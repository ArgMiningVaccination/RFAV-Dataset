About a dozen srudents attend\u00ad ed, and each brought a variety of concerns. \"I wanted people to come and just talk to Mark Cunningham directly,\" said Tony Quezada, a Warren resident adviser who helped organize the session. Under the plan, residence hall fees will be lowered and apartment fees will be raised nen year so that a double room will cost $7,108 and a single room will cost $7,308. All students living on campus would also be required to have a meal plan. The new housing fees include the minimum $1,800 meal plan. The new rates will make hous\u00ad ing fees at UCSD the lowest in the UC system, Cunningham said.

The opening of new residence halls and apartments at the new Eleanor Roosevelt College campus this fall begins (hat process. Cunningha m said that current and (mure students who live on campus would be paying for the projects through their housing fees. There is no other source of income to build new housing or pay for staffing, he said. \"The problem is that we are self\u00ad supporting. You are our customer. You are it. There is no state money. There is no federal money.\" Cunningham said. \"V\\fhat it comes down to is that the customer basically drive the sys\u00ad tCln.\" The goal is to be able to house half of undergrad uates and half of graduate students. Currently, 32 percent of under\u00ad graduates and 36 percent of graduate smdenrs are housed on campus. These numbers :lrc ranked second and first, respectively, within the UC system. With increasing enrollment, Cunningham noted that more money is b~lI1g spent on hiring new staff to accommodate more students. \"The total income for the depart\u00ad ment hasn't changed,\" Cunningham said. \"We're still at $43 million. We aren't generating millions of dollars, but we're spcnding a lot of money on staffin* that we would have just had profit. Students in ancndance seemed to understand the need to change the rates. They were more concerned with tile m3nd;tory $1,800 meal plan for various reasons. Many students questioned the necessity of having a meal plan whilc living in the apartments . oille students thought that increasing the apartment fees in place of the meal plan was a better idea. Cunningham was against tile idea on principles of fairness. \"We did look at that, but that real\u00ad ly doesn't fly for me. It's just taxing people,\" he said. Cunningham said that the new plan takes everything into account. \"Let's just take the entire program, which is what we did essentially , and mix it all together and say, 'you're not going to get anything for living in the apartments otllcr than the opporruni\u00ad ty to subsidize residence halls,'\" Cunningham said. \"That's not fair. It's just not fair. [ know what you're say\u00ad ing. It's more expensive, but it's not fair. And the issue of fairness and equi\u00ad ty is really important to our communi\u00ad ty.\" Some srudents, such as Quezada, still felt that being able to live without a meal plan in tile apartments encour\u00ad ages smdents to become independent. \"[ don't think it's fair for the people in the apartments because in the apartments you have your own kitchen and your own stove, so you're more independen t,\" Quezada said. \"But when you get a meal plan, it takes away from your growing experience.\" Another student asked whether residents could opt out of the meal plan due to special dietary needs. Cunningham said that there is an appeal process that srudents must go through to be exempt. \"There are people righ. now that are in dining programs that Opt out because we can't meet their needs. They are very rare,\" he said. Lisa Cho, a Warren freshman, felt her grocery choices would be limited by using her meal plan to buy gro\u00ad cenes. \"You can get so much more, like a better variety of sruff, from Ralphs than you can from Earl's Place or from Canyon Vista,\" she said. \"And a lot of my roommates like to shop at the Asian markets at Convoy Street, and you can't get that anywhere on cam\u00ad pus.\" See FORUM, Page 7 THE UCSD GUARDIAN ETCETERA HEY KEN/IV.

BRIEFLY Berkeley study links churchgoing to long life Regular churchgoers will have to wait significan tly longer to meet their maker. according to a report con\u00ad ducted by the University of Califomia at Betic.eley. According to the newty released study, attending reli\u00b7 ~ious services once a week or more will decrease one's nsks of death and health problems, even after modify\u00ad ing for health problems, age and other risk factors. Researchers from Berkeley's School of Public Health and the Public Health Institute concluded that churchgoers have 21 percent less chance of dying from a circulatory disease, while there was no signif\u00ad icant difference in the death risks caused by cancer. The study also shows that those attending ser\u00ad vices less than weekly have a 66 percent greater risk of dying from a respiratory disease and a 99 percent greater chance of death caused by a digestive dis\u00ad ease than weekly attendees. Data from the study was taken from 3 I years of longitudinal examination of over 6,500 adults from Alameda County, Calif., an ethnically, economically and religiously diverse community allowing researchers to make their findings relevant because of its comparabil\u00ad ity to the population of the United States. Funding for the study was made possible by grants coming from the Califomia Department of Health Services, the National Institute of Aging. and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

UCSD develops new smallpox treatment Researchers at UCSD school of medicine and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System have developed an oral drug that blocks deadly agents causing smallpox and other orthopox diseases. Hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir, or HOP-COV, is an antiviral medication that halts the growth and spread of variola, the virus responsible for causing smallpox and orthopox strands. HOP-CDV was developed as part of a national effort of drug developers to design an antiviral sub\u00ad stance for people infected with smallpox. Currently, HDP-CDV is not available for human use. The drug must continue safety trials in animals, and ultimate\u00ad ly in healthy humans. Testing is being conducted by the u.s. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases.

I am by no means an artist. When people ask me what my major is, I reluctantly answer \"media.\" r often hear the words roll out of my mouth and notice that this simple response sounds so much better than \"visual arts\u00ad media with an emphasis in film and video.\" Do I plan on being a filmmak\u00ad er' Doubtful. r plan on being a corporate sellout. Translation: I wi 11 pursue a career in gra phic design, editing, advertisi ng or some other integral part 01' the commercially drivv\\ society that artists despist!. I dread answering the \"What's your major'\" question, and I hate being looked down upon for pur\u00ad suing an artistic career instead of an intellecu13l one. But what r loathe most -even more than the overwhelming disappointment I sense from' those who expect me to follow more of an overachievlllg academic path -is the assump\u00ad tion that being an art major is a joke. The most common reaction I get from those who dare to delve further into the discussion of Illy major after hearing my short, sim\u00ad ple, please-don't-ask-me-to\u00ad explain-this response is, \"Oh, that must be fun.\" When I hear this, I know they're impl} ~ng that fun equals easy. For the record: Being a film and video major is not easy, espe\u00ad cially when you're competing with a bunch of artists. The easiest way I know of to THE SAM AND ROSE differentiate between an artist and one who is artistic can be beSt described by an example from my linguistics 7 lecture: Someone who is deaf is without hearing, and someone who is Deaf uses American Sign Language and is a member of th~ culmrally rich Deaf community. Similarly, one who is artistically inclined possesses the ability to make 3rt, while artists live and breathe their work -they devore their lives to art, and they lovt what they do. I have always liked to dance, write, draw, sculpt, paint -you name it. [ have always been artisti\u00ad cally inclined, but I don't think I'll ever become an artist. I don't have that kind of passion for my art. Perhaps I don't even have the nat\u00ad ural talent.

As much as people envy me for having a major that's \"so fun\" and what they assume to be \"someth.ing I love,\" I envy artists for having what\u00ad ever it is that makes them great.

This led us to the conciu\u00ad sion lhat to be a great artist, one must be tortured. This also led us to the conclusion that we are way too normal to be art students. I recently discussed this with another friend of mine, a non\u00ad visual arts major, and she agreed that there is a strong prejudice against non artists in art classes. I honestly think that the reason my teaching a sistants don't take me seriously is that I'm a reasonably good-looking young woman who gives the impressio n that there's more to her life than sitting in front of a computer screen making underground computer art while listening to experimental ound art on her down time away from researchi ng obscure indie films. Excu c me for having a well\u00ad rounded life and gi\\1ng in to a bit of pop culture. I've already admit\u00ad ted I'm not an arti r. There's no use pretending to be something I'm not. I JUSt don't understand why the people who already obvi\u00ad ously m'e arti~t s deserve more praise and attention than those of us who arc merdy trying to acquire some skills (or at least pass some general education clas es). I don't think that what artists possess that makes them great can be learned: You either have it or you don't. I don't have a problem with .,,01 being an artist. There are plenty of jobs out there for those of us more artistically inclined. However, there is no forum for the nlore corporate-geared art sUldent at UCSD. C.II me crazy, bur I thought the reason we are paying tens of thou\u00ad sands of dollars to attend college is so that we will be ahle to go out and get fabulous jobs to suppurt ourselves. Instead, I get iold that my art isn't conceptual enou!:(h and that I'm a sellout and have 1\\0 artistic integrity for wannng to pursue a career in commercial art.

Now if only SAT scores tr~ns\u00ad lated into some measure of respect for undergraduates at this universi\u00ad ry; decent on-camp us housing and parking situations come to mind. It seelTls rather ironic .that when so much of a universiry's public stature comes frolTl the selectiviry of its undergraduate class, absurdly selective views of the UCSO popu\u00ad lace are necess:lry to entice people to accept. And people wonder why a \"school with UCSD's ranking\" has all the pride and on-campus life of a community college. Well, that I~, except for on April 13.

Her defiance and affability, it was noted, not only brought her closer to the hearts of her people, but also gave them the courage to stand against invasion. It is perhaps fitting that on Saturday, another leader stood in defiance with his people against a bombardment against his own building and his own city, Ramallah .

One wonders whether the glut of slates in this year's A.S. elections have come about due to actual interest or whether they are an inevitable conclusion after last year's mockery of the principles of divided government when the entire Uniry slate won. One has to wonder whether the average UCS D student actually took the time to read the voter information pamphJets and under\u00ad stand the candidates, or whether they simply voted for the slate with the most signs on display. The evi\u00ad dence suggests the latter, and no doubt, candidates in this election have wised up and realized that to win, they must gather up as many of their buddies to run for as many posts as possible. This is ridiculous; it implies that recognition is the only factor in a student election, and consequently, there are no real issues at stake. That souMs a lot like high school, does it not? I horribly wish that there were enough people who could run on an \"apathy\" slate. I bet a lot of UCSD students would vote for a student government that ran the line \"We'll do nothing except some concerts, and return the rest of No Foolin' $1.00 SUB For all Coffee & Espresso drinks on Wed.

One might argue that the com\u00ad position of the student government actually does matter. After all, it takes important political stances on issues outside the immediate focus of UCSD, such as affirmative action and the war in Afghanismn, which ha ve relevanr poli lical divides in both the mainstream and at UCSD.

But six University of Mirll1esora students prolonged the debauche ry for one more day by running naked through Northrop Mall at about 12:15 p.m. on March 25. The male students ran through campus wearing only wigs, hats, shoes and sunglasses. The event, Ienown as the Jack Mytton Run, is in its fourth year. Junior Erica Barlow said she's een the event every year since she's been in school. She aid it always takes place the first day after spring break, but usually only one or two people run. After the students were dropped off on Washingron Avenue, they ran through the mall area and into a cul-de-sac next to Northrop Auditorium, where they were Forum: Triton Plus was of the options considered Continued from page 2 Cunningham described a tenta\u00ad tive plan to purchase grocery items for students. Students would have a \"menu\" to choose various items from llsing their meal plan. The items would in turn be purchased in bulk. This service would be tar\u00ad geted toward those living in the apartments . Acknowledging that prices for food will inevitably be more than at large supermarket chains, Cunningham said he wants to be able to satisfy the needs of those living in the apartments. \"We can't be Vons, but maybe have better pricing than certainly Earl's Place, which I hear tends to be expensive,\" Cunningham said. Regents Scholars in attendance raised other concerns. Currently, Regents Scholars are guaranteed four years of on-campus housing. Darlene Hunt is a Regents Scholar and a Warren college junior who lives on campus. She and other Regents Scholars living on campus feel that they deserve an exemp\u00ad tion from the required meal plan. Cunningham told her that it picked up. Beside the regular snt\u00ad dents walking near the mall, about 30 people gathered to watch in front the auditorium. \"I don't know how they came up with it, but it's a tradition now,\" said J im Diehl, a first-year graduate 'I don't know how they came up with it, but it's a tradition now: -JIm DIehl University of Minnesota Graduate student student in computer engineering who watched the run. The real Jack Myrton was born in Halston, England in 1796. He was a notorious prankster famous for his intelligence, courage and wit. One of the participants said the would be hard to explain to some students why they had to pay for the meal plan while others were exempted from it. \"[ teems so elitist and maybe that's the way it's supposed to be,\" Cunningham aid. \"It seems inequitable, it seems unfair, and it's hard to explain to everyone else why you get it and they don't.\" Another suggestion was to have apartment residents use a $1,800 Triton Plus account in lieu of meal points. The idea was considered, but money put into Triton Plus would not necessarily come back to H&DS. \"If you take a dollar to wherever you want to take it -the bookstore or wherever -that doesn't come back to housing. So it doesn't help offset any of our costs,\" Cunningham said. Cunningham stressed through\u00ad out the session the intentions of H& OS to best serve the needs of the students. \"Our position was, rather than come back and tax people, to pro\u00ad vide a service to give you some\u00ad thing,\" Cunningham said. He emphasized that H&DS seeks only to break even. \"It's not about profit,\" he said. Some students were still dubi\u00ad ous of the plan. run is adapted from a similar event at the Universiry of Michigan. Moments before the naked stu\u00ad dents ran through the mall, police sirens wailed. Someone in the small crowd said, \"Here they come,\" and was answered with nervous laughter. Renee Powell, a math major who happened to be in the mall when the naked men passed her, said she was surprised . \"I thought it was funny but [ don't know why they would run across campus naked,\" she said. \"[ don't know if they're in a frat or something; I can only guess.\" No police arrived on the scene. Police dispatcher Karen Guinn said they did not get any calls regarding the occurrence. \"If we don't get any calls we can't do anything,\" she said. -Rocky Thompson MinntSOta Daily Cho left the session feeling that Cunningham was redundant and was not seriously considering the suggestions of the students. \"He was very lengthy in all his answers,\" Cho said. \"It seemed a lot of his answers to the questions were repetition s of things he already said. He also doesn't seem very open to new suggestions about alternatives to the plan that [students in attendancel had.\" Hunt felt more comfort with the plan, although she still held some reservatio ns. \"It seems like it's economica lly feasible, and it's really one of the only ways to do it,\" she said. \"However, as a Regents Scholar, I think that since we are already liv\u00ad ing on borrowed time and most people can't be here for four years anyway, that Regents Scholars should have an exception to this required meal plan.\" Quezada believed there would still be problems with the plan. \"I think it's going to cause more chaos for the restaurant workers,\" he said. \"They're going to end up having more students come in than they can barely handle now.\" Cunningham still encouraged comments &om students, and invited e-mails to mcrml1ingham\u00aeucsd .edu. \"I'm here to listen,\" Cunningham said.

(U-Wire) -A Harvard University report published Monday has found tha t, despi te efforrs on the part of colleges to reduce heavy drinking, the percentage of college students nationwide engaging in binge drinking remains the same as it wa ~ight years ago. Officials at the University of Virginia, while largely rejecting the usefulness of the binge drinking sta\u00ad tistic, maintained that the incidence of dangerous drinking at the univer\u00ad sity has decreased in recent years. The study, conducte d by Han\"lrt! professor Henry ,,'cch,ler, found that 44 percent of college students between the ages of 1 H .lIld 23 had engaged in binge dnnklng -detined as consuming tin: or more drinks in a row for men and four in ;1 row for women -within two weeks of taking the .,tudy. That IS the same percentage the ~tudy fount! in 1993. \\ \\'cch ler \"ha~ been a SOrt of a bulldog in forcing people to see the worst of what is our there,\" said UV Presidcnt John T.

The University of Virginia'S Center for Alcohol and Substance Education and the Student Health Center don't consider the binge drinking statistic to be a useful way of measuring srudent drinking prob\u00ad lems, student heal th officials said. The binge drinking statistic is misleading because the definition of dangerous drinking can differ among people and siruations, said Jennifer Bauerle, social norllls marketing coordinator for Sntdent Health. Binge drinking statistics can lead people ro think that drinking problem s are more seriolls than they really are, Bauerle said. \"We believe many university srudents are making responsible choices,\" she added. Moreover, Student Health's concern is not JUSt how much Stu\u00ad dents are drinking but also whether students' drinking negatively affects their lives. According to the Health Promotion Survey, an online sur\u00ad vey conducted by' Student Heallh's Office of Ilealth PromoLion, the number of drinks srudellts say they consume per week has deClined since the study started in 1999. In 2002, the 3vernge university ~ru\u00ad dent reportedly consumed 3.6 alco\u00ad holic bevcrnge s a week. The number of drinks first-years report drinking has dropped from a high of 6.9 in 2000 to 3A in 2002. The decline III drinking 11:Is been even more dramatic within the Greek system. SPECIAL EGG DONOR NEEDED Preferred Donor will meet the following criteria: Height Approximately 519 or Taller Caucasian Fraternity members reported drinking 6.4 drinks per week in 2002, down from 18.8 in 2001. Sorority members reported con\u00ad suming 4.4 drinks per week, down from 7.6 last year. Fraternities also have taken steps to reduce serving alcohol to underage srudents and to students who are already intoxicated, said Aaron Laushway, assistant dean of fraternity and sorority life. \"Fewer students are consuming alcohol dangerously and fewer sru\u00ad dents are being served at fraterni\u00ad ties,\" Laushway said. \"That's my hope. I'm trusting our students who tell me they have made great progress.\" umbers of students reporting they have gone to the emergency room, gotten into a fight, per\u00ad formed poorly on a test or been injured as a result of drinking have either remained the same or decreased slightly since last year, Bauerle said. The University of Virginia has intensified its cfforts to prevent alcohol abuse since 1997, Assistant Director of C.A.S.E. Marianne Bonday said. In that year, seven college students in Virglll13 died from alcohol-related causes. fficials credited education pro\u00ad grams, such as C.A.S.E.'s peer edu\u00ad cator program Alcohol and Drug Abu e Prevention Team and the health center's publication Tbe fall Sent J01l17l01, as well as the universi\u00ad ty police efforts to enforce drinking laws, for the decline in drinking . -Martin Olivier CavfI/iel' Daily Teachers & Students!

MONDAY, APRIL 1, 2002 Tennis splits Hawaiian SOjourn Men beat Chaminade, lose to BYU By ISAAC PEARLMAN Sports Editor March 25 and March 27 saw the men's tennis team face opponents from opposite ends of the spectrulll when it easily breez.ed by the 0-11 Chaminade University before being handed a loss by top-ranked Brigham Young University of Hawaii. The Tritons enjoyed a Hawaiian road trip over spring break, starting off with a 9-0 route of Chaminade Inllonolulu, Hi. UCSD, ranked 21st, won every set en route to improving to 12\u00b71 on the season. Tritons Sameer Chopra and Bryan Swan started UCSD off on the right foot for No. I doubles, dispatching the Kieran and Michael McCartney brother duo 8-0. Jeff Wilson and Everett Schroeter followed up with a 8-1 doubles victory in the No. 2 match, and Mike Meyer and Dan Albrecht closed out the doubles sweep for UCSD with an 8-0 shel\u00ad lacking of 'Swords Lance Tanouye and Nick Alcover. Chopra excelled again in No. I singles play, taking out Lawrence Chan 6-0, 6-2. Swatt, not to be outdone, performance with a 6-3, 6-3 straight-set over Kieran McCartney. Wi Ison extended the McCartney brothers' horrible day, sweeping Michael McCartney 6\u00b7 3, 6-2 in the No. 3 singles matchup . Blake Wilson-Hayden, Emil ovak and Schroeter all followed with straight-set victories of their own when UCSD won 96 out of a total 119 games played. 'l\\vo days later, the Tritons faced off against the undefeated BYU\u00ad Hawaii in Laic, Hi., in what was quite a different matchup than their previous opponent. Chopra, ranked 44th in the nation at No. 1 singles, was matched up against Jan Krejci, rhe second-ranked singles player in Division II. Krejci dispatched with a straight-set win, 6- 3, 6-3. Scasiders' No.2 singles player Hung Soon Park built 011 Krejci's ierery and added to BYU's 1II0ment vict0- f\\ battled with the ~o. 3 clual, however, after win\u00ad IIIng the first set Wilson couldn't maintain the lead and dropped the 6-7, 6-0,7-6 decision . Novak earned the sole singles win the Tritons, The only other UCSD win came in the No.3 doubles match when Meyer and Albrecht earned an 8-5 victory over Makarevich and Ndiayc. However, that would be all for the Tritons, as their 2-7 loss dropped thcm to 12-2 while BYU\u00ad Hawaii improved to 15-0. Thc Tritons concluded their island swing last Thursday against Hawaii Pacific University, but at press time results for the match were unavailable.

Pepperdine was paced by Sean Rooney, who hit .700 and had 15 kills. The Waves hit .526 as a team and had seven service aces on the evening. The two-game deficit ignited a little spark within the Tritons and they were able to make the third game a seesaw battle before losing 30-2B. The Waves are the No. 2- ranked team in the country, and the Tritons had their work cut out The second game brought more of the same, and UCSD again had trouble getting on track, falling 30- 20. While the third game proved more entertaining for UCSD -the team put up quite a fight -the result was the same: a loss, 30-2B, allowing tile Waves to sweep the match 3 -0.

This year, head coach Patti Gerckens' team boasts an impressive 10-2 record at home during CCAA play, but has struggled on the road, going 2-8. Those road woes were never more painful than during a pair of shutout losses March 16 at UC Davis. The wins helped the Aggies pass the Tritons in the standings and the two teams headed in dif\u00ad ferent directions. UC Davis is currently riding a seven-game winning streak to the top of the CCAA, while UCSD has dropped seven and hopes to regain its footing in the stand\u00ad ings. Despite tough times, the Tritons remain optimistic . \"Right now, I think that we're at the greatest place a losing team could be,\" said senior left-fielder Kristina Anderson . \"Everyone is trying so hard. Things just aren't clicking for us.\" The statistics would seem to suggest the effort is there, since the Tritons lead the CCAA with a .969 fielding percentage. They are also fourth in earned run aver\u00ad age and second in batting ,average. Sophomore third baseman Amy Mettee suggested the wins will come with time, bur admitted the loss.es take a toll. \"Every time you lose, its frus\u00ad trating,\" he said. \"Losing is never easy, but we haven't 10 t confidence . Every great team goes through difficulties and challenges, but that makes you better.\" Despite current struggles as a team, a few UC D players are posting outstanding seasons. Mettee is among the CCAAS top five in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage , runs scored, stolen bases, total bases. doubles and hits. She was selected CCAA Player of the Week for March 10. Anderson benefitted from Menee being on base because she ranks in the CCAA top five for RBIs. Senior pitcher Christi Martinelli has also had a stellar year, going 12-6 thus far with an earned run average below twO while she al 0 leads the CCAA in strikeouts. She was named CCAAS pitcher of the week for March 10. As they struggle through the middle of their season, the Tritons look to regain the form that led them to a 13 -1 start. The Tritons still have two tournaments, the West Region Champions Tourney and the Mt. Dew Classic, as well as 10 con\u00ad ference games left (four at horne) against Cal State Stanislaus, CSU Bakersfield, CSU Dominguez Hills, Sonoma State and San Francisco State universities, the TritOns will have plenty of opportunities to put their season back in the right direction. They also will host rival Univer~ity of San Diego in exciting inter-San Diego action. The team still remains a confi\u00ad dent bunch. \"We still don't doubt that we'll make it to the top,\" Menee said.

The structure, which was designed by students of the Jacohs School of Engineering, is assured to be of the highest quality, according to Chancellor Robert C.

T&PS director Ivana Scruya refuted the need for the structure, saying UCSD already has ample parking for students. \"Studies have shown time and tllne again that a 500-to-one ratio i entirely appropriate for student parking,\" she said. \"You snldenrs are all just a bunch of whiny fucks.\" Instead of the construction of the new strucnlre, Scruya advocat\u00ad ed a plan wherein students walked to campus no matter what the dis\u00ad tance, availed themselve s of conve\u00ad nient\" public transportation sys\u00ad tem.

Scri~~s announces advance in ampl1ibious feline research SCientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography last week unveiled a major step for\u00ad ward in the emerging field of amphibious feline engineering . The 510 program aims to make it possible for cats to live underwater indefinitely . Before slO's latest experimentation was made public, the longest a cat had stayed underwater was six hours, 22 minutes. The SCriPPS study, however, had one cat living in a 20-gallon fish tank for 35 hours. The unprecedented feline submersion was made possible through a face mask designed to sur\u00ad round the cat's head in a n airtight bubble, which was then attached by a hose to a scuba-like breath\u00ad ing tank. The scientists said this was a major improvement over early efforts in underwater cat program technology, when the cats' heads were duct-taped into Tupperware , PETA was initially upset over the experiments, but soon got over themselves .

Council took office. As many have noted with varying degrees of dis\u00ad gust, this year's A.S. Council has been a fervent supporter of the dis\u00ad tribution of pornographic media on campus. According to A.S. President Jeff Dodge, the dissemination of Las Vega -style porn leaflets on Library Walk helps to raise funds for A.5.\u00ad funded events. Escort services, stri p clubs and exotic dancers' agencies pay the A.S. Council to distribute the porn in highly visible locations on campus. A.S. budget reports indicate that the advertising has generated revenue this year amounting to an extra $2,192,000 for campuswide events and student programllling. To those who must contend With rhe porn traffickers on Library Walk, however, the distri\u00ad butIOn' of pornography is a full\u00ad np.dged attack on morality and common decency. The leaflets lit\u00ad ter the hallowed srones of Library Walk, clog the Price Center foun\u00ad tain, and swirl through rhe air all over campus on windy days. Once, I e\"en round a leaflet stealmily rllcked into my rear jean pocket, no doubt placed mere by some pruri\u00ad ent purveyor of pornographic putrescence. This is to say nothing of the threat to decency that the porn dis\u00ad tributors themselves present. When I stumble down Library Walk :It 11 a.m. on a Monday, bleary-eyed and groggy, I don't want to be greeted with me sight of our student council members solic\u00ad iting me for sexual services, me sharp crack of leaflet on leaflet resounding through the morning air as they peddle meir wares. Just three weeks ago, I was met wi th the distasteful and lascivious hoots of Dod ge as he extended a Dream Girls fiyer in my direction . J looked away, embarrassed, when I caught A.S. Commissioner of Communi cations Catherine Algeri leering suggestivel y at me and mak\u00ad ing all sorts of comments about my virility. And I could have sworn that I saw A.S. Commissioner of Services and Enterprises Colin Parent checking out my ass. Shouldn't the A.S. Council be holed up somewhere in the Price Center, passing pro-America reso\u00ad lutions or something ? Granted, many students probably find satis\u00ad faction in me A.S. Council's new twist on \"serving the students' needs,\" but this is ridiculous. Keep me porn off Library Walk, and leave it where it belongs -on lab computer screclH and under dorm beds all over ea m pus. MONDAY, APRIL I, 2002 OK, ladies. How many times have you sat around with your girl\u00ad friends complainin g about how UCSD lacks any dateable men' Or if any do exist, they must travel in packs and hide somewher e, conve\u00ad niently out of our sight? I am proud to say that I have finally found their hiding place. After two-and-a -quarter years of waiting, hoping, searching, praying and -in moments of weakness - stalking, I had all but given up on the idea of Triton love. That is, until I discovered the spot where all the hot, irresistible, they-gotta-be\u00ad from-State UCSD men frequent. No, it's nOI in the Gaslamp; it', on the Revelle campus, and It's called oW, I UCSD students who mink thel' will acnlally get some studying 'done there. But we all know it's much more man tllat - it is, indeed, ule place to see and be seen, and it embraces this notion every Saturday at midnight, when CLUB CLL'\\\" opens its doors. The CLIC to CLL', transfor\u00ad mation is laudable. Refreshingly devoid of those computer terminals that get in tile way of socializing in the first place, the two-torey club i, accented with coat-and-b'lckpack check-in, dim lighting and a full\u00ad service bar, tended by referee-shirt\u00ad wearin' Zebras. After a much-need\u00ad ed apple marom (in classic UCSD style, it consisted of more apple than martini -but whatever), I headed upstairs, \"ia elevator. Now, at CLUB CLIX YOll can still catch your daytime rCb'lllar,: the resident Revelle freshman who still thinks it's cute to venture out of her room in her pajamas; thal old. pseudo-teacher who conducts some sort of study session on randolll nights in me first-floor couple, who insist on smooching by the magazine rack.s; and that guy. You know who I'm talking abollt -he strolls in around 10 every other night (severely ('vcr\u00ad dressed), makes his rounds, checks his e-mail, grabs some coffee and leaves around 11 :30 p.m. Well, they were still there, except (and pardon the \"Zoolander\" expression) , they were all really, really, ridiculously good-looking. There must be something in that CLICS tap water. Yes, the afore\u00ad mentioned Zebra bartenders unbut\u00ad toned meir uniforms a bit; the ever\u00ad present teacher served as the buffed-up doorman, and as for those people who are there so often, you swear CLICS is charging them rent -well, they were still there, and now occupied the coveted Vl P lounges (formerly, \"study rooms\"). Maybe it's the dark ambience that makes it virtually impossible to see anyone in the first place, but people at CLUB CLIX, especially the UCSD men (gasp I) were extremely hot. I spent a splendid three hours dancing with men who, come sunlight, went back to their books and IUd behind their IBM safety zones. The same boys who only leave their CLiCS cubicles to take their biweekly showers -the same guys who make female Tritons cry and take unnecessary trips to the SDSU campus to remind ourselves what the oppo ite sex is sllppo>cd to be like. MONDAY, APRIL 1,2002 Students profit from ugliness Escort service helps lame~asses like you get dates By SWEET E. PYE What do you want it to be? For any girl who's ever said \"you'll have to pay me to go to another frat party,\" a new opportu\u00ad nity has just opened up. Heidi Ho and John Finkle, twO enterprising Warren sophomores, have opened up The Company of Strangers, a campus escort service. \"It just seemed to make perfect sense,\" Ho said. \"Students are always looking for attractive, fun, outgoing girls to accompany them to parties. Yet committed relation\u00ad ships aren't what students wam. An escort service was the beSt solution.\" Fin.lde pointed to UCSD stu\u00ad dents' academic commitment a one reason for their company's creation. \"There really was a trt!mendous demand III the dating service mar\u00ad ket,\" Finkle said. \"Everyone know that UCSD students a~e too bus)' to go out and find their own dates.\" When asked why students would want to pay for something the)' can get for free, Finkle was quick to explain, \"Oh, these aren't just UCSD girls. We'l'e hired many ladies \"i\\<lan)' UCSD student~, espeCiall y Revelle stu\u00ad dents, don't have the aesthetic or interpersonal sk.ill to attract the rype of women they can get through our service.\" Ho, a criti<:al gender studies major, does not have trouble rec\u00ad onciling her feminist ideology with her business venture. \"It's simply paying women for work mat has long gone unpaid,\" 110 said. \"Everyone knows that sometimcs dates' can be a chore, hnt if the guy~ get I he gi rl they want, and the girls are paid for their labor, everyone's happy.\" Dr. Abe Stan 'anee, professor of sociology and author of the book \"'iVhy Men are Pigs.\" said it is not unCOllllllon for young men to turn to the sex industry. and that urge may begin in childhood. Nance cited a 1984 st'lldy that showed a phenomen on among grade schoolers who solicited kisses from female ci;Jssmatcs during recess and lunch breaks: \"Boys arc socialized from a young age to pur\u00ad sue women and business aggressive\u00ad ly,\" Nance said. \"It is easy for them to get the two mIXed up along the way.\" 'Ho and Finklc are adamant that their company does nor and will not offer sexual services. \"The ladies are under strict orders to never take money for sex,\" Ho said. \"Each girl is given a can of pepper spray just to be safe.\" However, \"Daniclle,\" who asked not to be identified by her real name in fear that her older brother may read this, said differently . \"We were told we just couldn't accept extra money for sex,\" she said. \"We charge johns a flat fee, and whatever happens on me date is up to our discretion .\" When asked if she ever engaged in a sex act while out on a job, Danielle said, \"Sex is a sacred thing that should only happen wimin the bonds of marriage -or another contracted agreement involving monetary exchange. You're damn right 1 have.\" While school administrators arc skeptical of me new campus busi\u00ad ness, they say their hands are tied. \"Apparently La Jolla has no statute against date-hiring,\" said Chancellor Robert Dynes. \"\\Ve're very suspicious, but our cfforts have not WHY RENT?

THE UCSD DISRE\u00b7GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL 1,2002 Title IX repealed by u.s. Supreme Co u rt Women's sports ended, teams now open to both genders By OLIVER CLOTHESOFF Staff Writer The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a major blow Friday to the future of women's sports when it repealed the Title IX amend\u00ad ment that requires equal oppor\u00ad tunity for male and female ath\u00ad letes: The amendment, which was passed in 1972, was abol\u00ad ished by a 5-4 vote in the case of Da1yle v. (It/ollal Collegiate Athletic Association. Chief justice William Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion. \"Women's sPOrts are boring,\" the report stares. \"No self\u00ad rt:specnng male wants to watch women's sports because it's painful knowing that the comedy of errors being exhibited is not an attempt at comedy, but rather a misguided effort that mocks the very fabric of ollr sportin~ cul\u00ad ture.\" justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted with the majority bllt left the chambers crying, claiming she'd felt pressured to vote the way she did. President Gt:orge W. Bush held a news conference to discuss the ruling, during which he tOld the nation that democracy had been served. \"Even if you people don't like what this will do to sports, these justices are the people that you people have elected to be the peo\u00ad ple who represent the people,\" Bush said. After being rold by one of I,is advisers that justices are not elect\u00ad ed, but rather appointed by the president, Bush furrowed his brow and proceeded to repeat one of his speeches from Sept. 11. The con\u00ad fused president stressed that \"America will come out stronger\" and that \"the search is underway for those who are behind this evil act.\" At the local level, the decision caught the UCSD administration by surprise, but they tried to spin it as best they could. \"Well. I don't like athletics anyway,\" aid Vice Chancellor of tudent Affairs Joseph Watson . \"So if the Supreme Court wants to destroy half of UCSD's athletic program, it just saves me the trOu\u00ad ble.\" 'lNhen asked what the fi.mding formerly used on women's sports would go toward, Watson replied that \"executive conferences \" and \"administrative salaries\" were pri\u00ad orities for him. UCSD Athletic Director Earl Watson tried to see the Qright side of the ruling. \"I actually think that this elim\u00ad inates sexism,\" he said. \"If we don't separate it into a women's team and a men's team, we can simply say that this is the UCSD team and the best athletes will Courtesy of Your Mom Women killers: Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist (front row, left) stated that women make a mockery of sports fadored In hiS deCISion. play, regardless of gender. I think that's fair.\" Female TritOn basketball play\u00ad er Ali Ginn agreed. \"I don't think this decision really affects me all that much because we're bener than the guys team anyway,\" Ginn said. While many people tried to stay diplomatic on the issue, ten\u00ad sions ran high in Washington , D.C., where female protesters blocked several blocks of traffic while demonstrating against the decision. Male protesters also came car\u00ad rying mocking signs that read \"It's abollt time,\" babies\" and \"Quit whining and my dinner.\" The protesters entered into several confronta\u00ad tions but no major injuries were reported. A.S. Commissioner of Athletics Robin Shelton had the final word on the situation. \"UC Davis Slicks,\" Shelton said. Athletic director to restructure sports Plans for basketball to move back to Division III, soccer up to Division I By AL COHOLIC Sports Editor UCSD Athletic Director Earl Edwards announced Friday that due to budget concerns, the UCSD athletics program will be forced to undergo changes for the 2002-2003 school year. Several of the major changes in the \"Dissembling UCSD Sports\" plan involve restructuring teams and even cutting certain teams in order to free up more money for other teams. \"It's a tough position,\" Edwards said. \"Obvious ly I wish I wasn't forced to do this, but the fact is that 1 am.\" Several of the teams Edwards is looking at cutting include track and field, fencing, men's and women's crew, and golf, among others. \"I feel that these teams get the least support among students,\" Edwards said. \"And in this tOugh situation I think all we can do is focus on the teams that are well\u00ad supported and are competitive.\" Tall Tritons: With the proposed move back to Division III, the Tritons will return to facing midget amputees like this player from Redlands University. Edwards will also try reorga\u00ad nizing several teams to help the budget and stoke the student body's interest. He is currently looking at mov\u00ad ing the men's basketba ll team back to Division III and hopes to com\u00ad pensate that move by transferring the women's soccer team to Division 1. \"I think if our men's basket\u00ad ball team went back to Division III and started beating everybody by 100 points again there would be a definite response among the student body,\" Edwards said. \"Instead of having our state-of\u00ad the-art arena sparsely filled with about 50 fans watching our team lose 20 games a year, we could have it full of happy supporters, resulting in more games like this year's game against Redlands [which UCSD won 104-44J.\" In addition, his goal to move the UCSD women's soccer team to Division I would generate rev\u00ad enue from television contracts and sponsorships. \"We moved from Division III to Division II, and we still won the national championship,\" Edwards said. \"I truly feel we could win at the Division I level, and the sensa\u00ad tion caused by this transfer would be key in attracting sponsorships and media contracts.\" Men's basketball head coach Greg Lanthier was pleased at the prospect of rerurning to Division ill. \"Unlike Division II, III Division III the teams don't quite outsize us by so much,\" he said. \"This will allow us to shoot threes a lot easier. These last few years I've been forced to somewhat hold back and actually go inside a few times each game, now J can give my shooters the green light from behind the arc all game.\" Triton basketball player Ryan Swed agreed with his coach. \"A couple of players were wor\u00ad ried earlier this year that our offense was one-dimensional,\" he said. \"We just kept pounding the ball inside play after play and every\u00ad body knew what we were going to do. This move would allow us to focus more on our outside game, because as everyone knows, a three\u00ad pointer is more than a two-pointer, so we obviously want to shoot as many threes as we can.\" Women's soccer player Megan Mendoza also looked forward to some new competition . \"We kicked everyone's ass in Division III, then kicked every\u00ad one's ass in Division II,\" she said. \"Logically, this is the next step to take. I'm looking forward to kick\u00ad ing everyone's ass in Division I.\" Among the sUldent body, the reaction to these proposed changes -as they are for any sportS-related event -was largely indifferent. \"I really don't care,\" said Roosevelt senior Amy Gardine. \"Why don't they just cut every team except for the women's soc\u00ad cer team? That's the only team I've ever heard April 2: RIMAe Artna: UCSO Gladiators "}
