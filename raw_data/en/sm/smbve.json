(hereafter \"Shionogi\"), a research - driven pharmaceutical company, announced today that the European Commission(EC) has granted Marketing Authorisation(MA) for Rizmoic \u00ae (naldemedine), for the treatment of opioid -induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have previously been treated with a laxative. This decision by the EC has followed adoption of the positive opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in December 2018. Welcoming the announcement, Dr. John Keller, Chief Executive Officer of Shionogi Limited , said \"Today's EU marketing authorisation for RIZMOIC allows patients with opioid -induced constipation already taking laxatives access to an important new treatment that can relieve their suffering from this much under -recognised condition that can significantly affect their quality of life.\" Dr. Viola Andresen, specialist in Internal Medicine at the Israelitic Hospital in Hamburg , Germany, commented \"We as physicians are highly welcoming this announcement, because the peripherally acting \u00b5 -opioid antagonist (PAMORA) naldemedine therapy for opioid -induced constipation and will therefore add an imp ortant value for the therapeutic management of patients suffering from OIC. \" OIC is a prevalent and distressing side effect of opioid therapy that does not reliably respond to treatment with conventional laxatives.1 The efficacy and safety of naldemedi ne has been established in 2 replicate 12 -week, phase 3, randomised, double - blind, placebo -controlled studies in patients with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC (V9231 and V9232)2. A phase 3 long -term (52 -week) randomised double -blind, placebo -controlled stu dy in subjects with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC was conducted to evaluate long term safety.3,4 Efficacy and safety were also established in randomised, double -blind, placebo group, comparator studies in patients with cancer and OIC (V9236).5,6 The resu lts of these studies support the efficacy of naldemedine, showing treatment with naldemedine was associated with a statistically significant increase in the spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) response rate over 12 weeks compared to placebo (47.6% vs. 34.6%, p=0.002; 52.5% vs. 33.6%, p<0.0001, respectively)2 in the two studies in patients with non -cancer pain, and a statistically significant increase in the SBM response rate over 2 weeks compared to placebo (71.1% vs 34.4%, p<0.0001) in a study in patients wit h cancer.5 The most common side effects are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.2 Naldemedine, which has already been approved for routine use in the US and Japan, is an antagonist of opioid binding at the mu -, delta -, and kappa -opioid recepto rs. Naldemedine is a derivative of naltrexone to which a side chain has been added that increases the molecular weight and the polar surface area, thereby reducing its ability to cross the blood -brain barrier (BBB); the CNS penetration of naldemedine is ex pected to be negligible at the recommended dose. Additionally, naldemedine is a substrate of the P -glycoprotein (P -gp) efflux transporter, which may also be involved in reducing naldemedine penetration into the CNS. Based on this, naldemedine is expected to exert its anti - constipating effects on opioids without reversing their CNS -mediated analgesic effects. ENDS Date of preparation: February 2019 Media contact For further information or to arrange a spokesperson interview please contact: Dr. Mark is one of the most commonly reported side effects associated with opioid treatment, including among patients with chronic non -cancer pain and patients with cancer.7 OIC is a result of increased fluid absorption and reduced GI motility due to mu opioid receptor binding in the GI tract . OIC is defined as a change in bowel habits that is characterized by any of the following after initiating opioid therapy: reduced bowel movement frequency, development or worsening of straining to pass bowel movements, a sense of incomplete rectal evacua tion, or harder stool consistency.8 In patients receiving opioid therapy for chronic non -cancer pain, the prevalence of OIC ranges from approximately 40 -60 percent.1 About Shionogi Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Rizmoic 200 micrograms film -coated tablets 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each tablet contains 200 micrograms na ldemedine (as tosylate). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film -coated tablet (tablet) . Round, approximately 6.5 mm diameter, yellow tablet debossed with '222' and Shionogi logo on one side and '0.2' on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rizmoic is indicated for the treatment of opioid -induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have previously been treated with a laxative. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dose of naldemedine is 200 micrograms (one tablet) daily. Rizmoic may be used with or without laxative(s). It may be taken at any time of the day but it is recommended to be taken at the same time every day. Alteration of the analg esic dosing regimen prior to initiating Rizmoic is not required. Rizmoic must be discontinued if treatment with the opioid pain medicinal product is discontinued. Special populations Elderly patients No dos e adjustment is required in patients older than 6 5 years of age (see section 5.2). Due to the limited therapeutic experience in patients 75 years old and older, naldemedine therapy should be initiated with caution in this age group . Renal impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Due to the limited therapeutic experience, patients with severe renal impairment should be clinically monitored when initiating therapy with naldemedine . Hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Date of preparation: February 2019 Opioid pain medicinal products There is limited experience in patients treated with opioid pain medicinal product(s) at daily do ses of more than the equivalent of 400 mg of morphine. There is no experience in patients treated for constipation induced by partial opioid mu -agonists (e.g. buprenorphine). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of naldemedine in children and ado lescents aged below 18 years ha ve not yet been established. No data are available. Method of administration Oral use. Rizmoic should be taken once daily, with or without food (see section 5.2). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation or patients at increased risk of recurrent obstruction, due to the potential for gastrointestinal perforation (see section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Gastrointestinal perforation Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been repor ted with use of peripherally -acting opioid antagonists in patients with conditions that may be associated with localised or diffuse reduction of structural integrity of the wall of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. peptic ulcer disease, Ogilvie's syndrome, diverticular disease and underlying malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract or peritoneal metastases). The overall risk -benefit of naldemedine should be considered in patients with these conditions or other conditions which might result in impaired inte grity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g. Crohn's disease). Patients should be monitored for the development of severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain. If obstruction or perforation are suspected, naldemedine must be discontinued (see section 4.3). Gastrointestinal adverse reactions Abdominal adverse reactions (e.g. abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea) have been reported with Rizmoic. Patients should be advised to report severe, persistent or worsening symptoms to their physician. In cases of severe diarrhoea or abdominal pain, the patient should be monitored and treated for dehydration using rehydration and appropriate treatment as needed (see section 4.8). Opioid withdrawal syndrome Opioid withdrawal syndrome is a cluster of three or more of the following signs or symptoms: dysphoric mood, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation or rhinorrhea, pupillary dilation or piloerection or sweating, diarrhoea, yawning, fever or insomnia. Opioid withdrawal syndrome typically develops within mi nutes to several days following administration of an opioid antagonist. Caution should be exercised with regards to opioid withdrawal. Patients should be advised to discontinue naldemedine and to contact their physician if opioid withdrawal occurs. Cases o f possible opioid withdrawal syndrome have been reported in the naldemedine clinical programme (see section 4.8). Patients having disruptions to the blood -brain barrier (e.g., primary brain malignancies, central nervous system (CNS) metastases or other in flammatory conditions, active multiple sclerosis and advanced Alzheimer's disease) may be at increased risk of opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia . The overall benefit -risk of naldemedine should be considered in these patients with close monitoring for symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Date of preparation: February 2019 Patients with cardiovascular conditions Naldemedine was not studied in the clinical trial programme in patients who had a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischaemic attack within 3 months of screening. These patients should be clinically monitored when taking Rizmoic. A QTc study performed with naldemedine in healthy volunteers did not indicate any prolongation of the QT interval. Patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors were not excl uded from the naldemedine clinical trial programme, with BMI 30 kg/m2, and a medical history of hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia being the most commonly reported risk factors. Severe hepatic impairment Naldemedine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The use of naldemedine is not recommended in these patients (see section 4.2). Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers Concomitant use of naldemedine with strong an increase in naldemedine exposure and may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. Concomita nt use of naldemedine with strong a decrease in naldemedine exposure and may reduce the efficacy of naldemedine. Concomitant use w ith strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of naldemedine with moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz) has not been established and should be used with caution (see section 4.5). Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, and is therefore essentially \"sodium -free\". 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Effects of other medicinal product s on naldemedine Naldemedine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A with some contribution from UGT1A3 and is a substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) (see section 5.2). Interactions with CYP3A inhibitors Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased exposure to naldemedine 2.9 fold that may result in an increase d risk of adverse reactions. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors such as grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and clarithromycin should be avoided. If use with strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, monitor for adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, may increase the plasma concentration of naldemedine. If used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. There is no risk of interaction with concomitant use of mild CYP3A inhibitors. Interaction with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers Rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased exposure to naldemedi ne by 83% . Concomitant use of strong use of naldemedine with moderate inducers (e.g. efavirenz) has not b een established, and patients should be monitored (see section 4.4). Date of preparation: February 2019 Interaction with strong P -gp inhibitors Concomitant use of P -gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine may increase plasma concentrations of naldemedine. If naldemedine is used with strong P -gp inhibitors , monitor for adverse reactions. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no data from the use of naldemedine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of naldemedine during pregnancy may precipitate opioid withdrawal in a fetus due to the immature fetal blood brain barrier. Naldemedine should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requi res treatment with naldemedine. Breast -feeding It is unknown whether naldemedine /metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in rats have shown excretion of naldemedine in milk (see section 5.3). At therapeutic doses, most opioids (e.g morphin e, meperidine, methadone) are excreted into breast milk in minimal amounts. There is a theoretical possibility that naldemedine provokes opioid withdrawal in a breast -fed neonate whose mother is taking an opioid receptor agonist. A risk to the suckling chi ld cannot be excluded. Naldemedine should not be used during breast -feeding. Fertility No human data on the effect of naldemedine on fertility are available. Naldemedine was found to have no clinically relevant adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Naldemedine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC were abdominal pain (7.8%), diarrhoea (5.9%), nausea (3.6%) , and vomiting (1. 1%). The majority of these gastrointestinal adverse reactions were of mild to moderate severi ty and resolved with out discontinuation of naldemedine treatment. One serious case of abdominal pain and one serious case of nausea were reported in patients with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients wi th cancer and OIC were diarrhoea (24.5%) and abdominal pain (3.9%). The majority of these gastrointestinal adverse reactions were of mild to moderate severity and resolved with treatment. Two serious cases of diarrhoea were reported in patients with cancer and OIC. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The adverse reactions with naldemedine 200 microgram tablets in patients with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC and in patients with cancer and OIC reported in clinical studies are presented in the tables accord ing to the MedDRA system organ classification. The frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common ( 1/10); common ( ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) an d not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Date of preparation: February 2019 iTable 1.

Symptoms included, but were not limited to hyperhidrosis, chills, lacrimation increased, hot flush/flushing, pyrexia, sneezing, feeling cold, abdominal pain, d iarrhoea, nausea, vomiting , arthralgia, myalgia, and tachycardia (see section 4.4). Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies with patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC and with patients with cancer and OIC. The majority of these gastrointestinal adverse reactions were mild to moderate severity and resolved with treatment. The discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal treatment emergent adverse events with naldemedine 200 micrograms compared to placebo was 3.2% and 1% respectively in patients with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC and 4.5% and 0% respectively for patients with cancer and OIC. Date of preparation: February 2019 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose Healthy volunteers A single dose of naldemedine up to 100 mg and multiple doses of up to 30 mg/day for 10 days were administered to healthy volunteers in clinical studies. Dose -dependent increases in gastrointestinal -related adverse reactions, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea, were observed. These were mi ld or moderate in severity and resolved. Patients with OIC A single dose of naldemedine (0.01 mg to 3 mg) and multiple doses of 0.4 mg/day have been administered to patients with OIC in clinical studies. A patient who took a single dose of naldemedine 1 mg experienced severe drug withdrawal syndrome, including nausea and stomach cramping and was given esomeprazole and ondansetron for nausea and midazolam hydrochloride for stomach cramping. The symptoms resolved. In clinical studies, patients with OIC who w ere administered 0.4 mg/day (twice the recommended dose) over 4 weeks had an increased incidence of GI -related adverse drug reactions including diarrhoea and abdominal pain frequently within 1 -2 days after initial dosing. Management There is no specific a ntidote for naldemedine. Naldemedine is not removed from the body by haemodialysis. In the event of an overdose, patients should be closely monitored for potential signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal syndrome (see section 4.4) and provided with appropr iate supportive care. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for constipation, peripheral opioid receptor antagonists, ATC code: A06AH05. Mechanism of action Naldemedine is an antagonist of opioid binding at the mu -, delta -, and kappa -opioid receptors. Naldemedine functions as a peripherally -acting mu -opioid receptor antagonist in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids without reversing th e central nervous system (CNS) -mediated opioid effects. Naldemedine is a derivative of naltrexone to which a side chain has been added that increases the molecular weight and the polar surface area, thereby reducing its ability to cross the blood -brain barrier (BBB); the CNS penetration of naldemedine is expected to be negligible at the recommended dose. Additionally, naldemedine is a substrate of the P -glycoprotein (P -gp) efflux transporter, which may also be involved in reducing naldemedine penetration in to the CNS. Based on this, naldemedine is expected to exert its anti -constipating effects on opioids without reversing their CNS -mediated analgesic effects. Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy and safety of naldemedine has been established in patients with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC and in patients with cancer and OIC. Date of preparation: February 2019 Clinical studies in patients with chronic non -cancer pain and OIC The safety and efficacy of naldemedine was evaluated in two identical, 12 -week randomised, double - blind placebo -controlled trials (Studies V9231 and V9232) in which naldemedine was used without laxatives and in a third long -term 52 -week randomised, double -blind placebo -controlled trial (Study V9235) in which naldemedine was used with or without stable laxati ves in patients with chronic non - cancer pain and OIC. Patients receiving a stable opioid morphine equivalent daily dose of 30 mg for at least 4 weeks before enrollment and self -reported OIC were eligible to participate. In Studies V9231 and V9232, OIC was confirmed through a 2 -week run -in period and was defined as no more than 4 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) total over 14 consecutive days and <3 SBMs in a given week with at least 25% of the SBMs associated with one or more of the following conditio ns: (1) straining, (2) hard or lumpy stools; (3) having a sensation of incomplete evacuation; and (4) having a sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage. In Study V9235, OIC was confirmed through a 2 -week run -in period and was defined as no more than 4 SBMs total over 14 consecutive days and <3 SBMs in a given week. A SBM was defined as a bowel movement (BM) without rescue laxative taken within the past 24 hours. In Studies V9231 and V9232, patients had to either not be using laxatives or be willing to discontinue laxative use at the time of Screening and be willing to use only the provided rescue laxatives during the Screening and Treatment Periods. All study participants took laxatives previously for the treatment of OIC. In Study V9235, patients on a stable laxative regimen at screening (52.4%) were allowed to continue using that same regimen without change throughout the study duration. In the run -in and treatment periods for all three studies, bisacodyl was used as rescue laxative if patients had not had a BM for 72 hours and were allowed one -time use of an enema if after 24 hours of taking bisacodyl, they still had not had a BM. Patients with evidence of significant structural abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract were not enrolled in these st udies. A total of 547 patients in Study V9231, 551 patients in Study V9232 and 1246 patients in Study V9235 were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 200 micrograms of naldemedine or placebo once daily for 12 weeks for Studies V9231 and V9232, for 52 week s for Study V9235. In Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235, the mean age of the subjects in these three studies was 53.2 years; 14.8% were 65 years of age or older; 62.0% were women; 80.2% were white. In Study V9231, the three most common types of pain were ba ck pain (62.0%); neck pain (8.3%) and osteoarthritis (5.3%). In Study V9232, they were back pain (53.6%); pain (10.2%) and arthralgia (7.8%). In Study V9235, the three most common types of pain were back pain (58.0%); osteoarthritis (9.5%) and neck pain (8 .1%). Prior to enrollment, patients had been using their current opioid for an average of 5 years. The patients who participated in Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235 were taking a wide range of opioids. The mean baseline opioid morphine equivalent daily dosa ge was 132.42 mg, 120.93 mg, and 122.06 mg per day for Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235 respectively. The mean baseline SBMs was 1.31, 1.17, and 1.60, for Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235 respectively. The primary endpoint for Studies V9231 and V9232 was the proportion of SBM responders, defined as: 3 SBMs per week and a change from baseline of 1 SBM per week for at least 9 out of the 12 study weeks and 3 out of the last 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint for Study V9235 was the change in the frequency o f BMs per week from baseline to Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52. Date of preparation: February 2019 There was a statistically significant difference for naldemedine treatment group versus placebo for the primary endpoint in Studies V9231 and V9232 (see Table 3). There were 4 secondary endpoints in Studies V9231 and V9232 (see Table 3). Table 3.

In Studies V9231 and V9232, patients who, based on concomitant medication records, were on laxative therapy prior to entering the study and who stopped its use within 30 days prior to Screening, and had self -reported OIC, were considered to be a LIR. Additionally, patients who were not on laxatives within 30 days prior to Screening and only received rescue laxative at or after Screening were cons idered non -LIR. The number of patients in the LIR and non-LIR subgroups were 629 (naldemedine: 317 and placebo: 312) and 451 (naldemedine: 223 and placebo: 228) for pooled Studies V9231 and V9232. All study participants took previous laxatives at some time for the treatment of OIC prior to entering the trials V9231 or V9232. In the LIR subgroup, a greater proportion of responders was observed with naldemedine (46.4%) compared with placebo (30.2%) and the difference between groups (16.2%) was statistically significant (p<0.0001). In the non -LIR subgroup, consistent with the results in the LIR subgroup, a greater proportion of responders was observed with naldemedine (54.3%) compared with placebo (38.9%) and the difference between groups (15.6%) was statist ically significant (p=0.0009). For Study V9235, long term efficacy data defined as the change in frequency of BMs at week 52 from baseline, assessed as a secondary endpoint, showed that subjects in the naldemedine group had improvements in the frequency o f BMs compared with subjects in the placebo group in both LIR (3.10 vs 1.90, p=0.0210) and non -LIR (4.26 vs 3.39, p=0.1349) subgroups. Clinical studies in patients with cancer and OIC The safety and efficacy of naldemedine was also evaluated in 2 randomised, double -blind and placebo - controlled studies (V9222 and V9236) in patients with cancer and OIC. Subjects were required to be treated with opioids for 14 days prior to Screening and had to be receiving a stable dose. The studies included a 2 -week Screening Period, 2 -week Treatment Period and 4-week Follow -up Period. For patients receiving laxative therapy at the Screening visit, it had to be continued at a stable dose until the end of the Treatment Period. Patients were allowed to receive rescue laxative(s) as needed regardless of being on a stable laxative regimen at baseline (apart from within 24 hours of the start of the Treatment Period). In studies V9222 and V9236, OIC was confirmed through a 2 -week run -in period and was defined as 5 SBMs during the 14 consecutive days prior to the randomisation and 1 of the following bowel symptoms in 25% of all BMs regardless of the use of rescue laxatives: presence of straining during bowel movement, feeling of incomplete evacuation, passage of hard st ools or small pellets. In studies V9222 and V9236, the mean age of the subjects was 64.3 years; 51.8% were 65 years of age or older; 39.4% were women and 97.1% were Japanese. Naldemedine 200 micrograms or placebo was administered for 2 weeks to cancer pa tients with OIC. The primary endpoint for Study V9236 and the secondary endpoint, without multiplicity adjustment, for Study V9222 were the proportion of SBM responders during the 2 -week Treatment Period. A responder was defined as a patient with 3 freque ncy of SBMs per week and an increase from baseline 1 SBM per week during the 2 -week Treatment Period Date of preparation: February 2019 Table 5. Proportion of SBM responders in patients with cancer and OIC during the 2 -week treatment period (Studies V9222 and the Chi -square test. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rizmoic in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of opioid -induced constipation (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption Naldemedine is absorbed with a time to achieve peak plasma concentration of approximately 0.75 hours in the fasted state. The absolute bioavailability of naldemedine has not been established. The absolute bioavailability of naldemedine is estimated to be in the range of 20% to 56%. There is no clinically significant food effect. The peak plasma concentr ation was reduced by 35% and time to achieve peak plasma concentration was delayed from 0.75 hours in the fasted state to 2.5 hours in the fed state, whereas no significant difference was observed in the area under the plasma concentration -time curve by fo od intake. Based on these data, naldemedine can be taken with or without food (see section 4.2). Distribution Naldemedine is highly bound to serum proteins, predominantly to human serum albumin and to a lesser extent to 1-acid-glycoprotein and -globulin , with a mean protein binding ratio in humans of 93.2%. The apparent volume of distribution is approximately 155 litres. Biotransformation Naldemedine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A to nor -naldemedine, with a minor contribution from UGT1A3 to form naldemedine 3 -G. Following oral administration of [14C] -labelled naldemedine, the primary metabolite in plasma was nor-naldemedine, with a relative exposure compared to naldemedine of approximately 9 to 13 %. Naldemedine 3 -G was a minor metabolite in plasm a, with a relative exposure to naldemedine of less than 3%. Naldemedine also undergoes cleavage in the gastrointestinal tract to form benzamidine and naldemedine carboxylic acid. In in vitro studies at clinically relevant concentrations, naldemedine did not inhibit the major CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 isozymes. Therefore, treatment with naldemedine is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of co -administered medicines that are substrates of these enzymes and transporters. In vitro data also showed that naldemedine is not a direct inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 transporters. Date of preparation: February 2019 Elimination The apparent terminal elimination half -life of naldemedine is approximately 11 hours, and the apparent total clearance (CL/F) of naldemedine is 8.4 L/h. Following oral administration of radio - labelled naldemedine, 57.3% and 34.8% of the dose was excreted in urine and faeces for the [oxadiazole -14C]-naldemedine and 20.4% and 64.3% of dose was e xcreted as the [carbonyl -14C]- naldemedine in urine and faeces, respectively. Approximately 20% of the naldemedine dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Linearity/non -linearity The peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration -time curve increased in a n almost dose-proportional manner within the dose range of 0. 1 to 100 mg. A slight accumulation (1 to 1.3-fold) for peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration -time curve was observed after once daily multiple dose admi nistration in the fasted state for 10 days. Pharmacokinetics in subpopulations Age, gender, body weight and race A population pharmacokinetic analysis from clinical studies with naldemedine did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of age, gender, body weight or race on the pharmacokinetics of naldemedine . The pharmacokinetics of naldemedine in the paediatric population has not been studied (see section 4.2). Renal impairment The pharmacokinetics of naldemedine after administration of a single 200 microgram dose of naldemedine was studied in subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end - stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, and compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of n aldemedine between subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, or subjects with ESRD requiring hemodialysis and healthy subjects with normal renal function were similar. Plasma concentrations of naldemedine in subjects with ESRD requiring dia lysis were similar when naldemedine was administered either pre - or post -haemodialysis, indicating that naldemedine was not removed from the blood by haemodialysis. Hepatic impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of a single 20 0 microgram dose of naldemedine was studied in subjects with hepatic impairment classified as mild (Child -Pugh class A) or moderate (Child -Pugh class B) and compared with healthy subjects with normal hepatic function . The pharmacokinetics of naldemedine be tween subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects with normal hepatic function were similar. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of naldemedine was not evaluated. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and embryo -fetal development . In the rat fertility and early embryonic development study, prolongation of the dioestrous phase was observed at 10 mg/kg/day and above, but was not observed at 1 mg/kg/day (12 times the exposure [AUC 0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 micrograms). The effect on oestrous cycle is not Date of preparation: February 2019 conside red clinically relevant at the proposed therapeutic dose. No adverse effects were observed in male or female fertility and reproductive performance at up to 1000 mg/kg/day (in excess of 16,000 times the exposure [AUC 0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 micrograms). In the pre - and postnatal development study in rats, one dam died at parturition at 1000 mg/kg/day, and poor nursing, suppression of body weight gain and decrease in food consumption were noted at 30 and 1000 mg/kg/day. Decreases in the viab ility index on Day 4 after birth were noted at 30 and 1000 mg/kg/day and low body weights and delayed pinna unfolding were noted at 1000 mg/kg/day in pups. There was no adverse effect on pre - and postnatal development at 1 mg/kg/day (12 times the exposure [AUC 0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 micrograms). Placental transfer of [carbonyl -14C]-naldemedine -derived radioactivity was pregnant rats. [Carbonyl -14C]-naldemedine -derived radioactivity was excreted into milk in lactating rats. In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, at the same dose levels, exposure in juvenile animals (PND 10) was increased compared to adult animals (2.3 to 7.4 -fold). Novel histopathology findings were observed at all doses tested in female rats in ovaries (tertiary follicles/luteal cysts) in addition to irregular oestrous cycles, hyperplasia of mammary gland, and vaginal mucification already observed in adult animals (the lowest dose tested corresponded to an exposure margin of 6 or more, depending on the age of the pups). Three -day earlier vaginal opening indicative of an early onset of sexual maturity was also observed, but only at high exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure at an oral dose of 200 micrograms. 6.
