In addition, they can help you sleep better on your [buckwheat pillow](https://www.pinetales.com/collections/premium-buckwheat-pillows), recall dreams and protect you from nightmares (check out our blog post here for [crystals for better sleep](https://www.pinetales.com/blogs/pillows-bedroom-sleep-health-lifestyle/gemstones-and-crystals-for-better-sleep)). Crystals are used for many purposes because of the uplifting, positive, and calming vibrations they give off. Amy Mercree, author of The Mood Book: Crystals, Oils, and Rituals to Elevate your Spirit, told [Oprah Magazine](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a26559820/healing-crystals/) that each crystal's vibrations are different. These vibrations arise from the extraordinary way in which their molecules and atoms interact. The atoms and molecules that make up our body are always vibrating, just like crystals. By using crystals for meditation, you can adjust your body's vibrations and, with the right intention, change your emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual energy. Though meditation crystals may be new to you, the practice has existed throughout history. Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans used crystals for protection. Ancient Chinese medicine also worked with crystals, and Indian texts outline crystal healing for the body. There are many different ways you can receive the healing properties and benefits of meditation crystals. You can simply keep them near you, like on a bedside table or in your pocket, wear them as a necklace or bracelet, and incorporate them into your meditation practice. Whether you are a beginner or you've been meditating for twenty years, using crystals for meditation to your practice can deepen your meditation and strengthen your intentions. According to [Carol Boote](https://www.healthline.com/health/meditate-with-crystals), \"the use of crystals for meditation practice can deepen your meditation, provide a focus object, and raise your consciousness and awareness of your higher self.\" Even though plenty of spiritual texts and anecdotal reports outline the benefits of using crystals for meditation, you won't find a lot of scientific studies on the topic. However, there are some that have examined the placebo effect of crystal work rather than the vibrational energy of these stones. For example, in a 2009 [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2814126/), researchers stated that the placebo effect from meditation crystals offered its own form of healing. Research on placebos has found that it has the power to change one's brain and offer healing. So, whether it's a placebo effect or the energetic vibrations, crystals for meditation, are powerful and can make a noticeable difference. Before you sit down on your [meditation pillow](https://www.pinetales.com/products/zafu-meditation-pillow-cushion) and begin meditating with crystals, you need to choose the right crystals. Each meditation crystal has its own properties; some will calm you down where others will energize you. There are specific crystals that are believed to be better for meditation and can either be used on their own or together in a crystal grid. Here are a few options to get started: Clear Quartz [Clear quartz](https://tinyrituals.co/blogs/tiny-rituals/meditation-crystals) is known as the master healer. It can be programmed for any intention you set during your meditation but is especially beneficial when you want to find clarity and free yourself from distractions. Having a clear, open mind will help you hear any guiding thoughts, receive \"ah-ha\" moments of perspective, and communicate with your higher self. Selenite Selenite has soothing energy and is great for periods of transformation. If you are going through a significant change, a recent transformation, or a challenging period of growth, selenite can strengthen your meditation. As you sit on your meditation pillow, hold a piece of selenite in your hand. It will gently open your consciousness and increase self-awareness, giving your more mental strength and feelings of serenity. Amethyst Amethyst is a powerful and versatile crystal that can be used for sleep and meditation. This crystal is also known to reduce stress and anxiety. It can be difficult to meditate when your mind is buzzing with things you have to do, a fight you had with your spouse, or your frustrations with your children. These things can keep your mind busy and wound up and prevent you from settling into a meditative state no matter how hard you try. This is where [amethyst](https://www.manifestandflow.com/collections/page-2/products/amethyst-tumbled-crystal) comes in, providing feelings of inner peace, relieving stress, increasing intuition, and healing mind, body, and soul. Labradorite Labradorite is a very high vibe crystal that can protect you from a downward spiral of negative thinking. Its unique colors of silver, blue, green, grey, and purple change as you move it. Looking at this crystal can help you stay in the present. It is also believed to resonate with your soul chakra and realize your destiny. Obsidian There are a few different types of obsidian, including black obsidian, mahogany obsidian, and snowflake obsidian. Though they have slight differences, all forms of obsidian have strong protective properties. So if you have trouble letting go during meditation, the protective and supportive energy of this crystal can help you sink into a deeper meditation. Think of it as a protective cloak there to support you. Tiger's Eye Tiger's eye is known to attract good luck, prosperity, and abundance but one of its lesser-known qualities it's how it can support you during times of change. If you are looking for clarity and empowerment, you should try working with this crystal while meditating. Lepidolite Lepidolite is a stone for periods of transition. If you feel hesitant or unsure, welcome this stone into your practice. It can help you move away from any blockages that stop the feeling of clarity you are looking for. It can also ease feelings of stress and anxiety and gently ease you into a meditative state. Now that you know what crystals to use, I'll share how you can use them. How to Use Crystals For Meditation Crystal work is often a matter of personal preference. There are multiple ways you can use crystals to deepen your meditation, ranging in complexity. First, you should set up a designated meditation area. This should be an area free of distractions with a comfortable place to sit like a [meditation cushion](https://www.pinetales.com/products/meditation-pillow-premium). Some people choose to have an altar nearby. This can contain other items used for your spiritual and meditation practices. For example, you could have tarot or affirmation cards, essential oils, dried flowers, and of course, crystals. To use your crystals for meditation, you should first set an intention for each. This is an important element of a practice known as cleansing. Cleansing is like pressing reset on your crystal's energy so it can start a new journey with you. It is not the same as cleaning. It is an energetic bath that can be done with sound, salt, water, smoke, sunlight, moonlight, being buried in the earth, or simply saying a prayer while holding your crystal. While completing the cleansing process, you can set your intention. It may be that this crystal helps you reach your highest self or let go of blockages or previous traumas. During meditation, you can hold your crystal in your hands. The hand you have your crystal in, is important. It is believed that the left hand is your receiving hand, meaning it will absorb the energy of the crystal. Alternatively, the right hand is your giving hand. This would help you give off the crystal's energy held in that hand. Crystal grids are another great option. They act as a powerful visual representation of your intentions and the healing properties you want to receive from your crystals. Though some examples and books share grid patterns, there are no rules. The pattern and design can be anything you want it to be. The purpose is to link your mind with the intention of the grid. Crystal grids are a great option if the touch of a crystal distracts you. Also, if you prefer to keep your eyes open, you can focus on the grid and its intention. If you are new to crystal grids but want to start creating them, you can buy engraved pieces of wood that identify the location to put your crystals. These can also be found on slabs of selenite. The grid is activated by placing a clear quartz point or selenite stick in the middle. This links the energy of the different crystals in the grid. You can also visualize lines of white light connecting all the crystals. Some people choose to use crystals for meditation on specific energy points on their body. These are known as chakras which are believed to be energy transducers in the body. Different crystals connect with different chakras. To do this type of meditation, you will need to lay flat on your back and place a crystal on each of your chakras. This practice is known as chakra balancing and also uses color, selecting specific colors of crystals for each chakra. The more time you spend on your meditation pillow, the better. Scientific research has found plenty of benefits from meditating, including reduced stress, better emotional health, increased attention span, improved memory, and better sleep quality. Even just 5 minutes a day can work wonders, and by incorporating crystals, you can deepen your meditation and enhance the benefits.
