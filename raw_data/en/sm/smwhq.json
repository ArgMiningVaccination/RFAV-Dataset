How does it work? Light Therapy can enhance cellular metabolism, accelerate the repair of damaged skin, and stimulate the production of collagen. Cells absorb light particles (photons) that transforms their energy into ATP (cell energy). The elevation of ATP then powers metabolic processes like synthesizing DNA, RNA, proteins, and enzymes needed for cellular repair and regeneration. This treatment is recommended for acne as the blue light setting kills acne-causing bacteria while also reducing inflammation in current breakouts. The red light setting is also successful at increasing the production of collagen and elastin for fine lines and reducing inflammation for pain and injuries. LED treatments can also help with some musculoskeletal injuries, aches, pains, eczema and other skin conditions. $30 to add 20-30 min LED facial to any acupuncture appointment Light Therapy treatment is pain-free, non-invasive and relaxing.
