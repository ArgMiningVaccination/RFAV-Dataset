And that I'd waited for the EU plug But I'll probably but a few more... A delightful cold roller, great quality! A great purchase I bought this lamb as I wanted to use it 2 hours before bed , but it does'nt last that much. It's for waking up at night or to breastfeed . I suggest buying a pulp if you want it to last long. The light is in 3 settings\\levels and I dont recommend staring to it because it's too much. love it , recommend it. I work nights and this mask is as effective as blackout blinds but less expensive to fit. Doesn't slip off during the sleep and stays put with the Velcro straps. Good value considering the benefits of uninterrupted sleep. they look good & the build quality is superb! The most expensive earphones I've ever purchased! Not that these ARE expensive for what "}
