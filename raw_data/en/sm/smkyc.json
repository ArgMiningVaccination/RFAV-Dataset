The most effective way to avoid catching one of these ailments is to avoid the virus or bacteria that causes the symptoms! As life would have it, that just isn't In conjunction with good hand-washing practices and hygiene, you can also help prevent winter illness and avoid sick time by making healthy food choices. A healthy diet will benefit your well-being year round, but some specific foods help add that extra boost during the dark winter months. Naturopathic doctors appreciate the concept of food as medicine and have some helpful suggestions to supplement your diet during cold and flu season. Bring on the Ginger One of my favorite foods for maintaining wellness during winter is ginger. This warming food has a variety of benefits during the cold winter months. Ginger has anti-inflammatory compounds that can help ease aching joints and muscles. Ginger tea is great for nausea or upset stomach and can be used after a big meal to promote digestion. Ginger also promotes circulation and warms the body, helping all your fingers and toes stay nice and toasty. One of my favorite recipes that include ginger is a coconut, carrot, ginger soup. Adding to the power of ginger, carrots are packed with vitamin A and C to help boost immune function. The coconut milk in this soup has beneficial fats that can help improve our intestinal and immune health. Ginger is easy to incorporate into soups, stews, curries, or teas so you get a daily dose of spicy goodness.

So what is it about the bone broth, or as grandma would say chicken stock, that makes it so amazing? When made correctly by adding apple cider vinegar to the carcass, and using the feet and necks of chickens, collagen and minerals leach out into the broth such as magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, silica. The nutrients are all in a very absorbable form these feed your body what it needs to stay healthy. In addition, you also receive a healthy dose of collagen, gelatin, and amino acids such as proline, glutamine, and glycine. All of these play a role in boosting the immune system, supporting digestive health and detoxification, and giving us nutrients to stay healthy. Bone broth can be used in so many different ways, it doesn't just have to be used for soup. I frequently will cook my rice using bone broth, braise veggies in it, drink a cup of it, and yes, add it to soups and stews. The flavor is amazing and it is so good for you! So the next time you are at the farmer's market, ask your rancher for the feet and necks so you can start your big pot of bone broth, you'll be glad you did!

Garlic & Onion - Antimicrobial Superstars Raw garlic and onion contain antimicrobial compounds and play an important role in keeping a healthy balance of our good bacteria and flora so we can better keep away pathogenic ones when they show up. I add both into as many meals as I can to stay healthy year-round. Bonus, it also keeps the vampires away JoAnn Yanez, ND, MPH, CAE is the Executive Director of the [Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges](https://aanmc.org/) and the Chair of the Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health (ACIH).

Favor Fermented Foods Naturally fermented foods, preserved using salt and the natural bacteria found on the surface, are an ancient and rich source of beneficial bacteria (probiotics). What does this have to do with winter illness? In embryologic development, our respiratory tract and our gastrointestinal tract derive from the same tissue-forming cells. As these differentiate into our airway/lungs and esophagus/stomach/intestines, they maintain commonalities including the immune system lining these tissues and the microbiome that they host. We acquire our intestinal microbes prenatally, living our span in an important symbiotic relationship with them. There are far more bacteria than cells in our body, their weight roughly equaling that of our brain! By adulthood, we should have developed a richness and complexity in our microbiome that reduces our vulnerability to both internal and external challenges to our health. In part, the diversity of our diet determines the \"critters\" living within. Short-term dietary changes can dramatically influence the microbial structure. Eating naturally fermented foods increases the occupancy of the microbiome and adds the \"good guys\" to our microbiome, the bacteria directing our immune system and brain. So, by adding naturally fermented foods daily, eating a diversity of pre-biotic foods-(rich food for bacteria), we boost gut, brain, and respiratory health. It is advisable to start slow if you have never eaten these foods. Begin by adding 1 Tablespoon to each meal, and gradually increase to \u00bd cup. They are also fairly easy to make at home and can further support the reality of \"Food as Medicine\"!

When I think about what else to cook for my family to foster good health, especially in the winter, I always think about a variety of mushrooms. Many of the edible mushrooms have immune system boosters built right in. Mushrooms offer important minerals, vitamins, and enzymes and are high in antioxidants. Mushrooms help to elevate B & T lymphocytes or white blood cells, important to help us fight infection. I have gotten good at using mushrooms at breakfast in a veggie or tofu scramble or sliced on a lunchtime salad. I integrate mushrooms into tomato sauce for vegan sloppy joes or saut\u00e9e with broccoli for a restaurant-fancy side-dish. Some patients wrinkle their noses at the idea of mushrooms but when I can share their versatility, how easy it is to use them, maybe share a [recipe](http://www.nhcmed.com/resourcesfurther-reading/recipes/breakfast-recipes/mini-frittata.html) or two and describe the clear health benefits of mushrooms, I know this one small edible edition can help keep patients healthy.

Root vegetables make a healthy medley I love a good roasted root vegetable medley in the winter. Chopping up rutabagas, turnips, red and golden beets, purple potatoes, red potatoes, garnet yams, carrots of all colors, kohlrabi, onions, parsnips, you name it and I can put it in the mix. Toss with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper and top with fresh rosemary for the last half hour of roasting, yum. And it looks as good as it tastes! Research on improving the gut microbiome is increasingly showing that eating a variety of vegetables daily is an important dietary strategy to embrace and this easy way of preparing root veggies helps up the daily average!
