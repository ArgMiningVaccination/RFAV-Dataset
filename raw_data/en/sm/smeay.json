Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 1T scanner (Siemens Magnetom4), with images obtained in two planes (dorsal and transverse) and included T2 *gradient echo (TR/TE 1270/ 26 ms, NEX 3), short tau inversion recovery (STIR) (TR/TE 5000/ 110 ms, inversion time 150 ms, NEX 1), (TR/TE 652/14 ms, NEX 4) and T2-weighted (TR/TE 3000/100 ms, NEX 5) fast spin echo sequences with a FOV of 140 9140 mm, acquisition matrix of 256 9256, 4 mm slice thickness and 4 mm slice gap. The well-de ned palmar cortical defect was represented by a linear on T2 *gradient echo, STIR, T1- and T2-weighted on all sequences within the palmaroproximal aspect McIII (consistent with bone sclerosis) ( Fig 3 ). STIR images showed a small area of high signal adjacent to the sclerotic region within proximal McIII. The PSL had a regular appearance apart from a slight lateral deviation due to presence of the low signal intensity exostosis medially, whilst McII was unaffected. Advanced imaging provided information about the extent of the fracture and size and shape of the exostosis. The advanced imaging diagnosis was incomplete fracture associated with sclerosis of the palmar aspect of proximomedial McIII and irregular exostosis.Gross post-mortem examination revealed that the compact cortical bone of the palmar medial aspect of McIII was thickened and encroached into trabecular bone. was a bony exostosis ( ~1095 mm) immediately abaxial to the suspensory and axial to the McII protruding from the palmar surface of McIII. Histopathological examination of the proximal McII, McIII and the PSL revealed an expanded area of focally extensive osteonal bone of the palmar cortex invading the trabecular bone dorsally ( Fig 4 ). The bone exhibited a moderately irregular pattern of osteon formation, which was variably sized and irregularly shaped. The osteonal bone within the lesion was very dense, with wide bands of bony extracellular matrix and irregular osteonal architecture of variably sized haversian canals. There were often multiple haversian canals per osteon. This area was continuous with the more regular osteonal bone, which represented less affected bone further dorsally. The bone also extended into an exophytic bony projection in a palmar direction, consistent with an exostosis, which was composed of well- differentiated woven bone. The suspensory ligament and McII were unremarkable on all examined sections. The histological ndings represent an area of osteosclerosis of McIII and a small exostosis likely related to the same lesion.

The contralateral limb was bandaged with sterile VetrapTM, sterile drapes were not used due to the temperament of the mare. Aseptic preparation of the left hindlimb was carried out using povidone/iodine scrub (Vetasept/C2269) after clipping and sterile bandaging of the distal and proximal limb was performed with sterile VetrapTM. Skin staples were placed on the proximal cannon under radiographic guidance. Three 1.5-cm stab incisions werecreated, the rst most proximal was just distal to the tarso - metatarsal joint. Three 4.5-mm cortical bone screws were placed in lag fashion across the fracture line using a Cordell drill (DeWalt/C22610). The Cordell drill had been sterilised using an ethylene oxide autoclave (Anprolene/C22611sterilisation system). Screws were placed approximately 2 cm apart proximally to distally from dorsolateral to plantar medial to cross the fracture line at 90 degrees. The proximal screw was 44 mm long, middle 42 mm and distal 40 mm. Saline was used throughout the procedure for lavage and irrigation during drilling of the fracture. The screws were placed in amikacin sulphate (Amikin/C22612) prior to insertion. After all screws were placed the screws were tightened from proximal to distal while the horse was not fully weightbearing. Final radiographs con rmed reduction of the fracture gap. Routine closure of the stab incisions was carried out with simple interrupted 3.5 metric polyglactin 910 sutures in the skin (Vicryl/C226133,5 Metric). A modi ed Robert Jones bandage was applied from foot to proximal tibia plateau. The mare was fully weightbearing after surgery and remained comfortable on the limb once the perineural blocks had worn off. The horse was discharged from the hospital 24 h after surgical repair with instructions to continue with box rest and a course of Ceftiofur hydrochloride bwt) for 5 days. Results The mare was strictly box rested for 8 weeks after discharge from the hospital. She remained comfortable and fully weightbearing on the limb during that time. The modi ed Robert Jones bandage was changed after 4 days and replaced for a 2-layer bandage which was changed every 4-6 days. Following this, the mare was maintained in a stable bandage.L Fig 4: 35 \u00b0dorsomedial plantarolateral radiographic projection MtIII fracture.

Semevelos SlaterB. equine clinicians, we understand the considerable demands on our lifestyle by offering emergency care to our clients and patients. Ten years after founding an equine ambulatory practice and offering to be available around the clock, I was ready to share the load. At the time, I was the founder and owner of an equine ambulatory practice of 10 years' duration and had recently hired a part-time associate. Within a 30-mile radius there were approximately 12 solo equine veterinar - ians and an estimated 3,000 horses. A culture of healthy competition existed professionally. My goal was to reduce my on-call responsibilities to no more than 25% of my personal time. I weighed the following considerations: continued commitment to provide high-quality emergency coverage to our routine clients; maintenance of the signif - icant financial contribution that emergency services made toward the profitability of the practice; and desire not to lose clients to the competition. I decided to approach a select group of solo practitioners locally who might share the common vision to offer emergency coverage while respecting and upholding each other's business interests. Strategy for Implementation of the Equine Clinician's Emergency Cooperative I was inspired by a group of four equine veterinarians within our state who had exemplified the emergency cooperative concept for over 30 years. After meeting with a member from their group and discussing details of the idea with other colleagues, I developed a proposal for an Equine Clinician's Emergency Cooperative (ECEC) suggesting the following logistics: Meetings and Reviews We would aim to meet once monthly to establish consistent methods of communication and build solid working relations. Throughout our discussions, we all agreed to uphold the following rules of engagement: 1. When a client requested service for an emergency, they would be asked upfront to identify their regular provider of service. Expectations were agreed on to respectfully restore that client back to their regular provider of service after the emergency was handled. 2. Verbal communication between veterinarians and sharing of medical records within a week would be routinely expected after each emergency visit. Once an emergency was seen and stabilized, the case would be turned over to the regular provider of service during routine business hours. 3. Veterinarians would only address the emergency at hand and not solicit additional, routine services during the visit. 4. If a client seeking routine services or looking to change their provider of service were to directly contact the emergency clinician, we agreed to adhere to the following protocol: A request would be made that the client contacts their regular provider of service to discuss needs and expectations. The veterinarians would also be expected as a professional courtesy to communicate directly with each other to mutually understand each other's position with the client. 5. We all agreed to be accountable to the team and invited any problems to be resolved through respectful communication among our participating members. Legalities Each practitioner would be required to document their state licensure, provision of liability insurance, worker's compensation if necessary, and definition of their business. Coverage We would choose to provide emergency services for established clientele only. If a new client called seeking emergency coverage, it would be left to the discretion of the emergency clinician on duty to determine if service would be provided. Priority should always be given to established clientele collectively among the practices. We also agreed to support clients within an approximate 30-mile practice radius, which accommodated most of the clientele. If a regular client was outside the practice area, they would be encouraged to transport their horse to a local facility. If the emergency clinician needed to travel outside of the designated area, then a back-up clinician should be notified. Scheduling Scheduled emergency coverage on the weekends would begin at 4:00 p.m. on Fridays and continue through 8:00 a.m. on Mondays. Often we would make additional arrangements for coverage on weeknights. With advance notice, we would schedule emergency coverage for at least 3 months at a time. Once the schedule was determined, if a change needed to occur, the participating AAEP News May 2020 III continued on page IVElizabeth CantrellOn-call coverage case study: Establishing an emergency cooperative By Lindroth, DVM, continued on page IVDr. Racquel Lindroth WELLNESS Dr. Lindroth sold her ambulatory practice and now teaches veterinary students at Montana State University.

EVENewsINSERT_05-20.indd 3 4/30/20 3:15 PMIV AAEP News May 2020 veterinarians could make arrangements between them- selves. Each business would then be notified about any scheduling changes. An online schedule was kept up to date and could be accessed by each participating member. Communication Systems Each business would choose how to design their phone system and answering service to direct their clients with an emergency to the appropriate contact number. This emergency contact number alerted a pager shared and utilized by the clinicians covering call through the ECEC. Invoicing For emergency provision, payment would be expected at the time of service. Pricing and invoicing would be handled through each individual business. We were aware of the pricing strategies for each business and held discus - sions for the purpose of keeping our pricing aligned. We were careful not to enter into price-fixing discussions. Referrals If during the course of emergency treatment a referral was deemed necessary, the on-duty clinician and client would work together to decide when and where to refer the case. The on-duty clinician would then notify the regular provider of service for that client regarding the referral. Additionally, the on-duty clinician would clarify the identity of the primary care provider for that client with the referral center. This was to make certain that communications, medical records, discharge instructions, and follow-up care would be directed back to the primary care provider for the referred client. Marketing Each business was encouraged to inform and prepare their clients about the implementation of the ECEC while introducing the participating members. Marketing methods (e.g. newsletter, website, client seminars, etc.) were to be decided by the individual business owners. Results An equine clinician's emergency cooperative was initially discussed and began to take form. Although the structure continued to be fine-tuned and a few of the participating veterinarians changed over the next few years, a collaborative effort between at least four veteri - narians has consistently and effectively remained in place. Maintaining flexibility, upholding effective communication and developing trust were vital to the success of the ECEC over time. Implementation of the ECEC provided me with a valuable opportunity to accomplish goals of establishing life balance while simultaneously achieving goals for my equine veterinary practice. I was able to continue a professional commitment to clients by offering comprehensive veterinary service with emergency coverage around the clock. Emergency services revenue generated within the business remained steady throughout the development of the ECEC. Electively choosing to reduce the amount of time my business was responsible for covering emergencies by at least 35% allowed me more time and energy to focus on building the routine and scheduled services within my practice. Professionally I recognized and appreciated the collegiali - ty that developed within our veterinary group. We started to meet and communicate more frequently, sharing case discussions and journal rounds in addition to problem- solving business decisions together. Most importantly, I was able to be present for my family. Within a year of establishing the ECEC, I was able to reduce the amount of time I was on call from a 100% commitment to 25% of my personal time, which had a tremendously positive impact for the well-being of my family life.

FOUND AtION Dr. Callum Donnelly, left, was among awarded researchers in 2019 for his project, \"Validation of an antemortem diagnostic PMAAEP News May The risks of remaining silent By Brent Cassady, DVM Every day, we are faced with opportunities to uphold the personal and professional values we hold sacred. When these values are called into question and we are then faced with an ethical dilemma, we may be thrust into a situation that can evoke discomfort and a series of emotional responses. One such response may be to justify the questionable actions in our minds and stay silent rather than confront the situation. This \"moral muteness\" may either be characterized by lack of action despite witnessing or being a party to a violation of ethics, or by communicating in ways that obfuscate one's moral beliefs and commitments. Since ethically based behaviors are driven largely by emotional and subjective decisions rather than by precise rules, we must be aware that our reactions to what we consider ethically \"sticky situations\" are bound to be emotionally driven, and often fear-based. Having sound strategies in place to help guide us through ethical challenges is paramount in order to provide excellent patient care and nurture our interpersonal relationships. It is a challenge to mentally detangle in a constructive and thoughtful way the dilemma we face when dealing with trainer/owner-driven medication requests. Similarly, opportunities to evaluate horses for soundness, particular - ly in the racing environment, are few and far between in many instances. Often, we are only invited to evaluate horses when there is a crisis or a significant deterioration in health. Trainer-driven patient care is a longstanding paradigm and may seem insurmountable, regardless of institutionalized regulations, new or old. When we are a party to trainer-driven medication requests, we may struggle to identify measures we can take that will uphold our mission to strengthen relationships and improve horse health. As a junior associate in a busy Thoroughbred practice, I was first exposed to trainer-driven medication requests at the commercial auctions of 2-year-olds. At that time, it was commonplace to be asked to administer anabolic steroids, intra-articular medications and other therapeutic medications without regard to individual need. I felt confused, conflicted and unsure that best practices were being employed. I wish I had voiced my concerns to colleagues or had a mentor independent of the practice to help guide me through these delicate issues. While there have been policy changes by the auction companies, as well as efforts by the AAEP to educate members and horsemen on responsible practices in the auction environ - ment, concerns remain regarding widespread bisphos - phate use, for example, in 2-year-old racing prospects at auction. The significant dilemma of trainer-driven medication has been addressed at the AAEP Annual Convention and within the AAEP listserv. In the midst of the cyclic exis - tential crises that the Thoroughbred racing industry, Tennessee Walking Horse industry and others face, our role as providers of care at the highest-possible standard has been scruti - nized and called into question by both external and internal bodies. The addition of a veterinary inspection prior to racing and, increasingly, prior to a timed workout has enhanced equine welfare. The reception has been mixed, but it has undoubtedly improved safety. From a values and ethical perspective, the direction of medical care and determination of soundness has now changed. The veterinarian is more engaged in directing patient care and medication, and has returned to the art of veterinary medicine rather than being employed as a medication technician. The fear of personal conflict, of being wrong, and of repercussions within one's own practice are all common fears that prompt us to rationalize actions we know aren't right. In this context, the opportunity to engage the client with a team approach will encourage more compre - hensive care for the patient, increase safety and serve to deepen our relationship with that client. Thus, conversa - tions around soundness and fitness to compete, for example, become easier. It is indeed easier to remain silent in the short run, but it is clear that even the smallest of failed opportunities to act ethically have a lasting impact on one's own sense of professional integrity.Dr. Brent Cassady Dr. Cassady is a racetrack regulatory veterinarian with the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and a member of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee.EtHICS continued on page XIIThe fear of personal conflict, of being wrong, and of reper - cussions within one's own practice are all common fears that prompt us to rational - ize actions we know aren't right.

One function of the AAEP Ethics Talk listserv is to provide membership an outlet to solicit advice and to anonymously post topics for discussion. Similarly, AAEP's Outrider mentorship program has been developed, in part, to assist members facing ethical dilemmas. Regulatory veterinarians are in the unique position to serve as a resource, and we welcome opportunities to provide outreach to clients in a non-aggressive and independent way. It is also important to consider that responsible private practice leadership should implement effective and anonymous protocols for junior associates to voice ethical concerns.

Chondrocytes, synovial cells, and adipose and bone marrow derived MSC were harvested post-mortem from three horses with no evidence of osteoarthritis. The effects of amikacin on cell viability were assessed for different exposure times, concentrations, and with pH buffered or unbuffered in media, as well as in the presence of synovial fluid. Cell metabolism/viability was assessed by colorimetric MTT assay, and cell proliferation was assessed by live cell imaging. Cell viability was assessed using trypan blue and dimeric cyanine nucleic acid stain. Mechanism of cell death was also evaluated. Amikacin exhibited a dose-dependent killing of chondrocytes, synovial cells, and bone marrow and adipose- derived MSC. At a concentration of amikacin achieved following typical intra-articular medication (25 mg/mL) rapid cytotoxic effects were seen for all cell types. The primary mechanism of cell death was via apoptosis, and cytotoxicity was not mitigated by the addition of synovial fluid in vitro. Amikacin at clinically applied doses induces rapid, pronounced cell death of equine joint cells and so amikacin doses currently used intra-articularly should be reconsidered. Penicillin treatment of horses with strangles In this prospective longitudinal study, John Pringle and colleagues in Sweden and the UK investigated the in fluence of penicillin treatment of horses with strangles on seropositivity toStreptococcus equi ssp.equi -speci c antibodies. Antibiotic treatment of horses with strangles is reported to impair the development of immunity to subsequent exposure to Streptococcus equi ssp. equi (S. equi ), although evidence- based studies for this hypothesis are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine whether penicillin treatment during clinical strangles in fluences the development or persistence of seropositivity to S. equi -speci c antibodies. Horses from a natural outbreak of strangles with 100% morbidity in 41 unvaccinated mature Icelandic horses were studied from onset to full recovery approximately 10 months after the index case. Horses were monitored clinically six times for S. equi , as well as serologically for antibodies to antigens A and C of S. equi using an enhanced indirect ELISA. Seven horses received penicillin within 11 days of onset of fever (Group 1), ve between 16 and 22 days after onset of fever (Group 2), and the remaining 29 horses (Group 3) received no antibiotics during clinical disease. The proportions of seropositive horses were compared using an extension of Fisher 's exact test. Although all horses were seropositive to S. equi within 2 months of the index case, signi cantly fewer horses treated early (Group 1) remained seropositive by 4 -6 months. These ndings support earlier suggestions that penicillin administered during acute strangles can interfere with persistence of humoral immunity to S. equi .Sesamoiditis This cross-sectional study by Kristen Lloyd and colleagues in Australia investigated the clinical signi cance of radiographic changes morphology, 'sesamoiditis '. Paired PSBs were isolated from the forelimbs of Thoroughbreds undergoing post-mortem examination. This included yearlings in pre-training, mature horses in race training, those resting from training and those retired from racing in the last 12 months. Each PSB was radiographed and assigned a vascular channel grade using previously published and novel grading systems. The sesamoids were then separated and individual whole bones were imaged with microcomputed tomography ( \u00b5CT); an imaging modality that allows assessment of bone microstructure in three dimensions. Associations between radiographic, \u00b5CT and performance variables were investigated with uni- and multi-variable generalised linear models. A total of 118 PSBs were collected from 59 horses aged between 16 months and 12 years. Nine horses were resting from training and 50 were in race training at the time of death. All PSBs had at least one vascular channel observed on\u00b5CT originating from the abaxial of which were observed radiographically. Proximal sesamoid bones with a higher bone volume fraction and wider channel diameter on \u00b5CT were more likely to have vascular channels identi ed on radiographs. Greater radiographic channel number and diameter were associated with fewer career placings. No association was found between any variable and the horse being subjected to euthanasia due to catastrophic fracture. This study suggests that more radiographic channels and greater channel diameter are associated with poorer measures of past performance. Antimicrobial susceptibility in equine practice In this UK-based study Julie Potier and Andy Durham assessed antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from ambulatory practice and from a referral hospital. Responsible use of antimicrobials in equine practice relies on knowledge of common bacterial isolates and their antimicrobial sensitivities. This study assessed the frequency of bacterial resistance to a combination of parenteral penicillin and gentamicin and to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for per os use in a selection of clinical isolates, and determined the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to alternatives to rst-line antimicrobials for the same isolates. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials for 6354 bacterial isolates from 365 ambulatory practices and 519 isolates from a referral hospital were analysed. The MICs were used to indicate sensitivity or resistance to commonly used antimicrobials and the prevalences of resistance were compared between origin of the isolates, and among antimicrobial drugs. Isolates from the referral hospital were signi cantly more likely to be resistant to the antimicrobials tested than those derived from ambulatory practice. Overall, 91% of the ambulatory isolates and 64% of the hospital isolates were \u00a92020 EVJ of the ambulatory practice isolates and 56% of the referral hospital isolates were sensitive for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. Most isolates were sensitive to penicillin and gentamicin as well as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. No suitable second choice antimicrobial was identi ed for those isolates resistant to the rst-line antimicrobials. The likelihood of isolates being sensitive to second choice antimicrobials was variable but generally higher for ambulatory isolates compared to referral isolates. Bacterial identi cation and measurement of MIC are essential to make the appropriate antimicrobial choice. Cerebrospinal fluid collection methods In this prospective study Hayley Chidlow and colleagues in the USA compared two collection methods for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis from standing sedated horses. The study included 15 adult horses with no evidence of neurologic disease, and nine horses with signs of neurologic disease. Cerebrospinal fluid collection from the lumbosacral (LS) space and the space between the rst and second cervical vertebrae (C1 -C2) of each horse was performed in randomised order. Continuous data were analysed using mixed-effects linear models and count data using mixed- effects negative binomial regression. Collection times, CSF cytology results, and equine protozoal (EPM) titres of CSF collected from the C1 -C2 and LS sites were compared. Cerebrospinal fluid collected from the C1 -C2 site had a signi cantly lower mean protein concentration and red blood cell count. Collection time, total nucleated cell count, EPM titres, and serum: CSF EPM titre ratios were not signi cantly different between collection sites. The authors concluded that cerebrospinal fluid from the C1-C2 space provides an acceptable alternative to LS CSF collection with decreased likelihood of clinically important blood contamination of samples. Communication between synovial bursae This anatomic study by Fanny Hontoir and colleagues in Belgium and the UK aimed to assess the presence and site of communication between the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) and the navicular bursa in the horse by computed tomography arthrography. Contrast medium was injected into the DIPJ 66 pairs of cadaver forelimbs and computed tomography arthrography was performed. The presence of a communication, location of the communication and additional structural changes were assessed. Navicular bursa opaci cation occurred in seven distal limbs (5.3%) following DIPJ injection. One limb showed a communication through the T-ligament and six limbs showed a communication through the distal sesamoidean impar ligament. The communication through the distal sesamoidean impar ligament was associated with a distal border fragment in three cases. This study showed that communication between the DIPJ and navicular bursa is uncommon and inconsistent. Clinically, the presence of a communication could: 1) in fluence the interpretation of diagnostic analgesia of the DIPJ or thenavicular bursa by facilitating the diffusion of local anaesthetic between these structures; 2) allow the drug and its potential adverse effects to spread from the treated synovial cavity to the non-targeted synovial cavity; 3) be responsible for the failure of joint drainage in the case of sepsis. Intrasynovial treatments for arthritis In this knowledge summary, Elena Gogua from the Moscow State Academy of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology, Russia, considered the PICO question \"In horses with arthritis, does the treatment with intra-articular antimicrobials concurrently with intra-articular corticosteroids reduce the risk of sepsis compared to intra-articular corticosteroids alone? \" The use of intra-articular antimicrobials concurrently with intra-articular corticosteroids appears to be common practice. Literature searches identi ed three papers that partially addressed the PICO question, one cross-sectional study and two retrospective cohort studies. The studies did not demonstrate a reduction of risk when antimicrobials were used. However, the strength of evidence provided by the studies was weak. The power of the studies to detect an effect of antimicrobials was low due to the small number of sepsis cases recorded. Further studies are therefore required to draw conclusions. S.

Ultrasonography and radiography identi ed sclerosis and exostosis of the proximomedial aspect of the metacarpal bone III in-between the suspensory ligament and the second metacarpal bone, and presence of a suspected fracture. The owner requested euthanasia of the gelding, and post-mortem computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging identi ed marked bone sclerosis and thickening of the palmar cortex of the metacarpal III (McIII), presence of an incomplete fracture in the palmar cortex of McIII and expansive exostosis from McIII extending in a palmar direction between the suspensory ligament and the second metacarpal bone. Histopathological examination con rmed the imaging ndings of sclerosis and led to nal diagnosis of a fracture of the palmar cortex of the McIII associated with an exostosis encroaching the medial aspect of the suspensory ligament. No abnormalities were present in the suspensory ligament or metacarpal bone II (McII). Introduction Incomplete palmar cortical fatigue fractures of proximal metacarpal III (McIII) have been reported in isolation (Dyson 1991; Riggs 1994; Pinchbeck and Kriz 2001; Morgan and Dyson 2012; Beccati et al. 2019) as well as concurrently with desmitis of the proximal suspensory ligament (PSL) (Ross et al. 1988; Beccati et al. 2019). Exostosis of the palmar aspect of the proximal McIII has previously been described without the presence of an incomplete palmar cortical fracture but with concurrent desmitis of the PSL (Launois et al. 2009). Injuries in the proximal McIII region can involve the bone and/or suspensory ligament and advanced imaging is pertinent for accurate diagnosis (Beccati et al. 2019). The current case report describes an incomplete fracture and exostosis of the proximal palmar McIII without associated SL involvement and, to the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst description of such a lesion using nuclear scintigraphy, radiography, ultrasonography, 5-year-old 476 kg Hanoverian gelding, used for showing, was presented for investigation of a moderate right forelimb (RF) lameness of 2-week duration. The referring veterinarian had attempted diagnostic analgesia unsuccessfully due to the horse 's temperament. Clinical ndings Clinical examination was unremarkable, with no pain evident on palpation including the proximal suspensory ligament (PSL). The gelding at walk and a 5/10th RF lameness (Arkell et al. 2006) was evident at the trot on a hard surface in a straight line. On the left circle, a 5/10th RF lameness was present and on a right circle a 2/10th RF lameness was evident on both the soft and rm surfaces. An abaxial sesamoid nerve block was attempted but despite sedation this was again unsuccessful due to the gelding 's temperament. Gamma scintigraphic imaging of the both forelimbs, thoracic spine and neck was performed with a gamma camera (Bartec- N-XRD Nucline X-Ring/R Gamma Camera Detector1) with bone-phase images after injection of technetium-99-DP (10 MBq/kg [4.5 MBq/lb], i.v.). This identi ed markedly increased focal radiopharmaceutical uptake (IRU) of the proximomedial aspect of the right metacarpus with approximately four times the activity of the equivalent region of the contralateral limb ( Fig 1 metacarpus were obtained (Magnum C-DMS2: settings 80 kV and 5 mAs). An approximately 3 cm radiolucent line was identi ed at the proximomedial aspect of McIII extending from 4 mm distal to the carpometacarpal joint in the palmar cortex in a proximolateral to distomedial direction ( Fig 2 ). Increased radiopacity consistent with sclerosis was present abaxial to the radiolucent line and axial to metacarpal II (McII) and this area contained poorly de ned horizontal radiolucent lines.

This area was consistent with mineralised tissue and appeared continuous with the axial aspect of McII. The PSL was deviated laterally as a consequence of this space-occupying mineralised area and had a normal heterogeneous echogenicity throughout, with well-de ned margins. Diagnosis Based on radiographic and ultrasonographic ndings, differential diagnosis included an incomplete fracture of the palmar aspect of proximomedial McIII with irregular new periosteal bone formation, or fracture of the axial aspect of the McII with callus formation. Post-mortem imaging and histopathology The owner declined further diagnostics or treatment despite being given a favourable prognosis with conservative management. The owner requested for the gelding to be subjected to euthanasia due to personal circumstances andthe dif cult temperament of the horse. Following euthanasia, the limb was transected proximal to the carpus and computed tomography (CT) distal limb was performed (Lightspeed VCT 4 Slice3) with the following technical parameters: 120 kV [peak], 155 mAs, 1.25 mm contiguous slices. Bone and soft tissue algorithms were used with an image eld of view (FOV) of 110 mm diameter and matrix dimensions of 512 9512. CT revealed poorly marginated sclerosis of the palmaromedial aspect of proximal McIII in the region of and adjacent to the origin of suspensory ligament, with a small, sharply de ned exostosis (moderately hypoattenuating compared to cortical bone) extending from the palmaromedial cortex of McIII in a palmar direction and partially encroaching the medial margin of the suspensory ligament ( Fig 3 ). Associated with this was a ne, linear and well-de ned hypoattenuating region (approximately 30 mm) consistent with a fracture orientated proximodistally through the palmar cortex of McIII.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 1T scanner (Siemens Magnetom4), with images obtained in two planes (dorsal and transverse) and included T2 *gradient echo (TR/TE 1270/ 26 ms, NEX 3), short tau inversion recovery (STIR) (TR/TE 5000/ 110 ms, inversion time 150 ms, NEX 1), (TR/TE 652/14 ms, NEX 4) and T2-weighted (TR/TE 3000/100 ms, NEX 5) fast spin echo sequences with a FOV of 140 9140 mm, acquisition matrix of 256 9256, 4 mm slice thickness and 4 mm slice gap. The well-de ned palmar cortical defect was represented by a linear on T2 *gradient echo, STIR, T1- and T2-weighted on all sequences within the palmaroproximal aspect McIII (consistent with bone sclerosis) ( Fig 3 ). STIR images showed a small area of high signal adjacent to the sclerotic region within proximal McIII. The PSL had a regular appearance apart from a slight lateral deviation due to presence of the low signal intensity exostosis medially, whilst McII was unaffected. Advanced imaging provided information about the extent of the fracture and size and shape of the exostosis. The advanced imaging diagnosis was incomplete fracture associated with sclerosis of the palmar aspect of proximomedial McIII and irregular exostosis.Gross post-mortem examination revealed that the compact cortical bone of the palmar medial aspect of McIII was thickened and encroached into trabecular bone. was a bony exostosis ( ~1095 mm) immediately abaxial to the suspensory and axial to the McII protruding from the palmar surface of McIII. Histopathological examination of the proximal McII, McIII and the PSL revealed an expanded area of focally extensive osteonal bone of the palmar cortex invading the trabecular bone dorsally ( Fig 4 ). The bone exhibited a moderately irregular pattern of osteon formation, which was variably sized and irregularly shaped. The osteonal bone within the lesion was very dense, with wide bands of bony extracellular matrix and irregular osteonal architecture of variably sized haversian canals. There were often multiple haversian canals per osteon. This area was continuous with the more regular osteonal bone, which represented less affected bone further dorsally. The bone also extended into an exophytic bony projection in a palmar direction, consistent with an exostosis, which was composed of well- differentiated woven bone. The suspensory ligament and McII were unremarkable on all examined sections. The histological ndings represent an area of osteosclerosis of McIII and a small exostosis likely related to the same lesion.

Diagnosis: Incomplete nonarticular fracture of proximomedial McIII (diagnostic imaging) with surrounding sclerosis and palmar exostosis (diagnostic imaging and histopathology). Discussion The current case describes an incomplete fracture associated with sclerosis and exostosis of the proximal palmar McIII without associated SL involvement radiography, ultrasonography, CT and MRI. Palmar cortical fractures, both fatigue and avulsion fractures, have been reported in isolation (Dyson 1991; Riggs 1994; Pinchbeck and Kriz 2001; Morgan and Dyson 2012; Beccati et al. 2019) as well as in combination with proximal suspensory desmitis (Ross et al. 1988; Beccati et al. 2019). Primary osseous injury of the origin of the suspensory ligament with little or no ligamentous pathology has been reportedpreviously (Murray et al. 2010) and palmar cortical fatigue fractures have also been identi ed without ultrasonographic evidence of proximal suspensory desmitis (Dyson 1991). Desmitis of the PSL may be associated with avulsion fractures of McIII at the origin of the suspensory ligament (Launois et al. 2003; Zubrod et al. 2004) and new bone formation of the palmar aspect of the proximal McIII with concurrent PSL desmitis has also been reported (Launois et al. 2009). The authors propose that the exostosis in the current case was due to pre-existing bone injury of this area, as no evidence of desmitis of the PSL was identi ed. A nonweightbearing ultrasound technique (with the carpus in moderate flexion) (Werpy et al. 2013) was utilised to allow better contact between the ultrasound probe and the limb. It enabled evaluation of the borders of the PSL as well as examination of a larger proportion of the palmar surface of McIII and axial aspect of McII than weightbearing ultrasonography. This facilitated imaging of the exostosis between the PSL and McII. The bones involved, the full extent of the fracture and the exostosis were further appreciated through cross-sectional imaging (CT and MRI) where it was established that fracture affected McIII rather than McII and revealed the full extent of the exostosis. Earlier reports of similar radiographic ndings (before CT or MRI was widely available) documented trabecular hypertrophy and/or medullary sclerosis of the proximal extremity of the McIII but found no evidence of the presence of a fracture (Lloyd et al. 1988). Consistent with ndings from previous publications (Tucker and Sande 2001; Launois et al. 2009; Powell et al. 2010; Beccati et al. 2019), this case report illustrates how cross-sectional imaging can aid the speci c diagnosis of complex injuries in this area especially in cases with inconclusive radiographic ndings. Incomplete fractures at the proximal metacarpus have predominantly, but not exclusively, been identi ed in racehorses or those undergoing high speed exercise (Morgan and Dyson 2012) .MRI in racehorses with subcarpal lameness has identi ed bone oedema beside palmar cortical thickening (Powell et al. 2010) that is likely to represent a different pathological process or a different bone modelling time point (Martig et al. 2014) to the current case. Incomplete fractures of the proximal metacarpal region have been reported in a broad spectrum of ages and work disciplines (Morgan and Dyson 2012), and in horses in low levels of work (Riggs 1994; Pinchbeck and Kriz 2001). Medullary sclerosis has been identi ed by radiography in some, but not all horses, with incomplete fractures of the proximal palmar cortex of McIII (Ross et al. 1988) and early bone densi cation may be undetected in cases where cross-sectional imaging was not performed. The aetiology of the fracture in the current case is not clear. The hypointense signal on T1 FSE images is consistent with sclerosis and the lack of bone oedema suggests chronicity of the lesion beyond the reported 2- week lameness (Ramzan and Powell 2010; Dyson et al. 2011). It is plausible that there was pre-existing modelling of the bone in the current case, which resulted in sclerosis and reduced the elasticity of the bone. This process would make the bone more brittle and liable to fracture (Allen and Burr 2013). The occurrence of lameness (only 2-week duration) perhaps coincided with a traumatic event in already brittle bone, which initiated a fracture. The fracture was identi ed on radiography and cross-sectional imaging a) b) Fig 4: a) Gross post-mortem image of transverse section through McIII. The compact cortical bone of the palmar medial aspect of McIII is thickened and encroaches into the central trabecular bone.

The bone proved remarkably dense to section during slide preparation; possibly the fracture gap was lost during specimen processing or the incorrect area was sectioned. However, the sclerotic process was con rmed with histopathology. The medial aspect appears overrepresented in reports of injuries to the proximal McIII (Lloyd et al. 1988; Ross et al. 1988; Pleasant et al. 1992; Launois et al. 2009; Dyson 2011; Morgan and Dyson 2012). One possible explanation for this is because the second carpal bone articulates solely with the second metacarpus, resulting in greater shearing forces of the second metacarpus against the third compared to the fourth metacarpus (Dyson 1988). Two different carpometacarpal articulations Prickett type-A gurations where there is no measurable articulation between the third carpal and second metacarpal bones and type-B con gurations where there is a measurable articulation between the third carpal and second metacarpal bones (Rooney and Prickett 1966). Medial metacarpal fusion (type-A) has been found to be associated with increasing age, occupation (performance careers) and proportion of the proximal projection of the carpometacarpal distal joint surface that was taken by the second metacarpal bone (Les et al. 1995). Another contributing factor of the medial propensity may be the greater proportion of the weight of the horse 's trunk distributed along the medial aspect of the limb (Balch et al. 1997). MRI of 30 cadaver limbs obtained from nonlame horses found the proximal palmar cortex of the McIII was thicker medially than laterally, suggesting asymmetrical forces act on the limb (Nagy and Dyson 2011). Male horses are overrepresented with incomplete fractures at this location but no genetic or sex linkage has been identi ed (Ross et al. 1988; Morgan and Dyson 2012). The authors propose that the sclerosis in the medial aspect of the proximal McIII may be the result of previous overloading of this area and potentially increased shearing forces. Conclusion This is the rst report of a palmar fracture of the proximal metacarpus and associated exostosis described by gamma scintigraphy, radiography, ultrasonography, CT and MRI. It demonstrates the valuable information obtained from advanced imaging that allows accurate diagnosis in challenging cases.

High action, however, especially that kind of action the horse is taught to exemplify, soon deranges the system. It breeds inflammation in the bro-cartilaginous tissues, upon which its chief strain is felt. The union between the splint bones and the cannon, or between the shin bone and the accessories, one on either side, speedily becomes converted into osseous matter .... The Illustrated Horse Doctor Edward Mayhew 1850 In the paper by Isgren et al. (2020), the authors describe an injury to the proximal medial metacarpus in a young Warmblood that they characterised an incomplete palmar metacarpal fracture with a resultant exostosis. While the clinical examination could not locate the source of pain, clinical imaging determined the location of the injury. Post- mortem imaging further delineated the extent of the injury and histopathology classi ed the bone changes. Possibly the most important point of the paper is that the bony exostosis cannot be visualised de nitively via imaging with radiographs, ultrasound or nuclear scintigraphy alone. Cross-sectional imaging is required to identify the bone growing off the palmar surface of the metacarpus. While this may be novel information for the reader to assimilate, it may further beg the question ...how important is it to identify this bony exostosis? Historically, the term blind splint is a rather ambiguous concept most often described as in flammation of the interosseous ligament between the second and third metacarpal bones and is a lesion that is not readily detectable externally by observation or palpation (Goble 1982). It has been surmised that the region of injury is dif cult to detect on physical examination because the injury occurs on the axial (inner) side of the splint, between the small metacarpal bone and the suspensory ligament in the same region highlighted by Isgren et al. (2020). It has been reported that histologically, the affected interosseous ligament usually consists primarily of chondroid tissue, whereas the normal interosseous ligament is primarily composed of dense white brous connective tissue. The authors of that report suggest that chondroid metaplasia of the collagen is the result of trauma (Rooney and Prickett 1966). It is important to understand the pathophysiology of the term chondroid metaplasia . Type 1 collagen bres and accompanying broblasts in tendons and ligaments are organised into linear packets or fascicles enveloped in sheaths. Type 1 collagen bres have a crimp in the resting state that can stretch about 3% of their length without undergoing structural deterioration. Linearly oriented small calibre vessels and broblasts are located between adjacentfascicles. Fibroblasts help maintain homoeostasis of the tissue in the presence of an adequate blood supply. Repetitive strain from exercise may damage type 1 collagen brils, the accompanying broblasts and the small calibre blood vessels due to friction and excessive tension. Degenerating broblasts have two general pathways they can follow. Either they die or they are transformed by metaplasia into chondrocytes because the latter can survive longer than broblasts in an environment with reduced O 2tension. 'Chondroid metaplasia 'may unfortunately be a temporary survival mechanism depending on vascularity and continuing mechanical insults. Chrondrocytes, whether of metaplastic origin or in growth plates, contain matrix vesicles within their cytoplasm. These membrane-bound vesicles have alkaline phosphatase on their surfaces that, when they are discharged from the chondrocytes into adjacent tissues following further insult, will attract calcium ions from the interstitial fluid to their surfaces and initiate calci c deposition in the soft tissues. This is the cause of linear pale streaks seen grossly in dissections of degenerative tendons or ligaments and linear densities in radiographic images and usually signi es that a major traumatic/degenerative event has occurred in that location at some previous point in time. The response of bone to injury also becomes integral to the understanding of musculoskeletal pathology. Bone is only 85% calci ed in the living individual. When bone is injured to the extent that a portion of it 'dies ', it becomes hypercalci ed. Sclerosis and increased density are terms to describe this appearance on a radiograph or MRI. If repair and vascularity returns, then osteoclasts from bone remodelling units remove the hyperdense dead bone while viable revascularised bone tissue is formed by 'lling cones 'or 'bone multicellular units 'of the bone remodelling mechanism. The end stage of 'bone death 'is, of course, an infarct. Pathophysiologically, new bone forms on the surface of the skeleton for several reasons. The most obvious is a callus in response to bone fracture. The callus provides mechanical stability and nutritional support while the bone heals. Traumatic disruption of the periosteum is another mechanism that can result in new bone formation, or exostosis, due to a mechanical disruption of the blood supply in this active region of bone homoeostasis. A third form of new bone formation is a periarticular osteophyte or 'marginal lip ' formation that is classically characterised as an extension of the margin of the subchondral bony plate in response to an abnormal stimulus that is exerted on the cartilage located at the articular margin. This could be from radial stresses that are exerted due to cartilage degeneration and loss in the major weightbearing centre of the joint surface or from chemotactic factors signalling for a local reparative process (Pool and Meagher 1990). \u00a92018 EVJ 10.1111/eve.12990A fourth form of new bone is an enthesiophyte whose formation in the horse, while interesting, is less well understood. By de nition, an enthesis is the region of soft tissue insertion onto a bone, such as tendon, ligament or joint capsule (Resnick and Niwayama 1983). A strain of this region of insertion is known as an enthesiopathy , but the pathophysiology of enthesiophyte formation involves more serious injury to the Sharpey 'sbres that anchor the soft tissue structure to the bone. Damage to these bres via a pulling or tearing motion will follow the same general pathway lined out in the section above on chondroid metaplasia, eventually leading to the calci cation of this region of soft tissue insertion. In fact, the calci cation of an enthesiophyte usually follows the plane of the soft tissue that is injured. The calci cation can be viewed as the body 's almost desperate attempt to re-anchor or reattach the injured soft tissue structure to the bone. If one critically examines the 'exostosis ' identi ed in the three papers cited here (Launois et al. 2009; Werpy and Redding 2017; Isgren et al. 2020), the bone proliferation seems to follow a curvilinear path around the suspensory ligament. This curvilinear projection is present at the same proximal to distal location in all these cases. Isgren et al. (2020) propose that the exostosis in their case was secondary to periostitis where the fracture exits the palmar cortex and not secondary to an avulsion of the suspensory ligament. In their opinion, the lack of identi ed suspensory pathology supports this conjecture. Dissection of this region does not shed any anatomical light on this because of the continuum of soft tissues and fascial planes in the region, however, careful study of a normal MRI in the region reveals a subtle soft tissue plane that originates on the palmar surface of the bone and curves around the medial aspect of the suspensory ligament ( Fig 1 ) (Brokken and Tucker 2011). The identi ed 'exostosis 'may actually be an enthesiophyte instead. If this was indeed the case, then surgical removal may be unnecessary or even contraindicated. It may be more reasonable to let the body heal itself or even to use such intervention as shockwave or laser therapy to encourage the return of the tissues to normal homoeostasis. In cases with recalcitrant lameness, however, surgicalprovocation of the area may provide the stimulus required for healing to proceed (Zubrod et al. 2004; Launois et al. 2009; Werpy and Redding 2017). This presents a convenient segue way into the challenge of equine orthopaedic imaging versus interpretation of clinical signs followed by treatment and prognosis. The current state of equine orthopaedics is one of advanced imaging. The rst author has always used a forum such as this to stress that the 'art 'of equine lameness diagnosis should always begin with an insightful history and thorough physical examination, including motion analysis (Martinelli and Rantanen 2008). In many venues it seems like the motto of 'It's all about the horse 'has been replaced by 'It's all about the image '. In some cases, it is absolutely important to rely on advanced imaging to highlight the injury or to categorise the disease process. MRI of the foot is just such a case (Dyson et al. 2005). Tendon lesions in the foot are almost impossible to detect without MRI and 'navicular syndrome 'actually involves several different etiologies ranging from vascular derangement at the distal border ligament to palmar cortical erosions to distal border fragments. Each carries its own treatment plan and prognosis. Without an understanding of the pathophysiology surrounding each, a 'shotgun 'therapeutic approach is most often implemented. This is not to imply that all horses suffering from 'foot lameness 'should have an MRI, but rather that the current state of knowledge of the different conditions previously de ned by the all encompassing term 'navicular syndrome 'present in different ways and may be treated differently. For instance, lesions of the deep digital flexor tendon in the foot tend to have an acute onset of relatively signi cant lameness (5/10) that does not tend to fluctuate and may respond favourably to extended box rest (Lutter et al. 2015), while desmitis of the impar ligament may cause intermittent lameness that may range from 1 to 5/10. Distal border fragments of the navicular bone do not always cause lameness (Yorke et al. 2014), but when it has been determined that the fragment is the cause of the lameness, then the prognosis for elite soundness becomes guarded (Biggi et al. 2013). Finally, box rest does little to resolve Fig 1: Displayed are two MR images of the proximal metacarpus taken from the same location but representing two different image sequences (Images courtesy of Dr C Judy). The arrows highlight a soft tissue plane emanating from the palmar medial metacarpus and encircling the medial border of the suspensory ligament at the same proximal/distal location and following the same general plane of 'exostoses 'described in several reports (Launois et al. 2017; Isgren et al. 2020). Calci cation of this soft tissue plane may be what is visualised in these reports and may represent a traumatic enthesiophyte rather than an exostosis. The distinction is important because it would represent a very different aetiology and possibly a very different approach to case management. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd235 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY desmitis of the collateral ligaments of the cof n joint, so more aggressive therapy is required to obtain a positive result (Schramme and Martinelli 2009). However, it is interesting how many clients or colleagues request advanced imaging such as MRI or CT for conditions that could easily be identi ed and treated following radiography, ultrasound or nuclear scintigraphy. In another recent case report of proximal palmar cortical fatigue fractures of the metacarpus, the clients declined nuclear scintigraphy in favour of a CT examination under general anaesthesia for the diagnosis of a severe lameness with acute onset. While the images are very detailed and the diagnosis without question, the issue remains whether the risk of general anaesthesia under these clinical circumstances outweighs the value of standing nuclear scintigraphy (Beccati et al. 2019). In contrast, in a separate case report on proximal metacarpal stress fractures, the authors opine that a CT examination should only be included in ambiguous or therapy-resistant cases of proximal suspensory ligament lesions (Berner et al. 2015). Finally, we present some thoughts about nuclear scintigraphy and equine orthopaedics. Nuclear scintigraphy (Tc-MDP bone scan) remains the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting occult bone lesions (Martinelli and Chambers 1995). It is adept at detecting bone changes to the microgram while radiography requires changes on the magnitude of grams to visualise the lesion. Unfortunately, nuclear scintigraphy has always struggled for its place at the table in equine orthopaedic imaging and has now been effectually replaced by MRI in most settings. While MRI does show some qualities of metabolic imaging, it is still woefully decient compared to the sensitivity of nuclear scintigraphy. Nuclear scintigraphy, when properly performed and interpreted, is a 'road map 'of musculoskeletal remodelling and injury. In the case of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake (IRU) in the proximal metacarpus, positioning of the dorsal view is of particular importance. It is desirable to image both forelimbs within the same frame of the camera so an easy comparison can be made side to side. In this way, no region of interest functions is required and a subjective comparison sufces. However, in some cases, the IRU will appear to be closer to midline on the limb than it actually is because the conformation of the horse requires the limb to turn out slightly when standing with the limbs close enough to be in the same eld of view. This is particularly true for wide-chested horses, such as Warmbloods and large Quarter Horses. To further dene the IRU, it is often bene cial to acquire a second dorsal view of the affected carpus in isolation, with the face of the carpus directly parallel to the camera. In this way, it is much easier to separate out IRU that seems to be associated with the origin of the suspensory ligament (OSL) versus IRU associated with the McII/McIII junction, an important distinction to make as these two conditions carry a very different prognosis and treatment plan ( Fig 2). The clinical approach to proximal metacarpal pain that resolves with regional anaesthesia can be summarised in a somewhat involved but logical algorithm. If the lameness is classi ed as 1 -3/10, then consider the condition more consistent with a 'strain '. If the lameness is characterised as 4-7/10, then it is more likely due to an 'injury 'and greater than 7/10 usually signi es a very serious injury involving the bone. If there are any physical ndings present on palpation,such as pain to deep digital palpation at the origin of the suspensory ligament, then radiographs of the proximal metacarpus and ultrasound of the suspensory ligament are indicated. If these are negative and nuclear scintigraphy is not available/feasible, then stall rest with hand or tack walking is indicated to see if the signs of lameness resolve over 1 -2 months. It would also be bene cial to treat the region with shockwave and/or laser therapy. In the above clinical scenario with radiographic evidence of a lucency in the proximal metacarpus, then the length of convalescence would more likely be extended to at least 3 months (Dyson 1988). If there is ultrasonographic evidence of suspensory ligament involvement (Dyson 1991), then the entire time out of formal training could be much longer (i.e. 6 -12 months depending on the severity of the soft tissue lesion) and a biological agent may be included in the treatment. If nuclear scintigraphy is available, then it is particularly useful in cases with no obvious sensitivity to palpation of the proximal metacarpal region or when regional anaesthesia is not feasible or its interpretation is equivocal. Regardless of the clinical signs, intense IRU associated with the proximal palmar metacarpus implies injury and a longer convalescence, while a'blush 'of IRU in that region implies a mild strain and less time out of work. Intense IRU associated with the aforementioned McII/McIII junction, however, tends not to be as serious and is often associated with a shorter time out of training. This emphasises that when interpreting a bone scan, intensity and location are important factors for determining severity of injury, prognosis and time out of training. Because IRU associated with the McII/McIII junction has commonly been identi ed in our practice over the years and is considered to carry a favourable prognosis for return to soundness, it then becomes important to question whether this proximal palmar enthesiophyte/exostosis is a newly identi ed condition or simply an existing one that we can now visualise more clearly with cross-sectional imaging. It is Fig 2: These images are nuclear scintigrams from two middle- aged Warmblood showjumpers presented for evaluation of proximal forelimb lameness with a history of acute onset (Images courtesy of California Equine Orthopedics). The image on the left represents the classic IRU associated with proximal MCIII directly on midline and is usually diagnosed as a fracture or stress fracture as it was in this case (Pinchbeck and Kriz 2001). The image on the right represents IRU currently distinguished as being associated with the junction between MCII/MCIII. The latter requires less time out of training, is not at risk of becoming a complete fracture, and is associated with a better overall prognosis, particularly when ultrasound examination of the region shows no suspensory ligament involvement. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd236 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY THE POWER OF NUTRITION STARTS WITHIN.

R. R. Costa*, C. G. Donelly, C. M. Crowe\u00a7, B. Vaughan\u00b6, C. E. Alexand M. Aleman School of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Epidemiology, University of California-Davis;Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital -Large Animal Clinic, University of California-Davis;\u00a7Neurology and Neurosurgery Service -Electrophysiology Laboratory, University of California-Davis;\u00b6Surgical and Radiological Sciences, University of California-Davis; andVeterinary Medical Teaching Hospital -Anatomic Pathology Service, Summary The focus of this report was to document the electroencephalogram (EEG) ndings associated with nonislet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia (NICTH) in a racing Thoroughbred mare subsequently diagnosed with renal carcinoma and carcinomatosis. We evaluated cortical cerebral activity and con rmed paroxysmal activity consistent with subclinical seizures by performing an EEG prior to onset of clinical signs of seizures. We showed that the electrical activity pattern progressed in a similar fashion as in humans with severe, progressive hypoglycaemia and presumed neuroglycopenia. The glycaemic threshold for abnormalities detected in EEG showed that abnormal electrical cortical activity appeared when blood glucose dropped to 44 mg/dL (2.4 mmol/L) and paroxysmal activity spread, becoming generalised when blood glucose dropped to 23 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L). NICTH is an uncommon paraneoplastic phenomenon in several species. In horses, NICTH has been reported most frequently in primary renal tumours, followed by primary hepatic tumours. This report highlights the importance of investigating the possibility of hypoglycaemia in cases of horses that present altered state of consciousness with or without intermittent seizures. This case report also highlights that the diagnostic work-up for horses presenting with episodic hypoglycaemia should comprise investigation of possible neoplasia, as paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia should be included in the list of differentials of horses with hypoglycaemia. Introduction Severe hypoglycaemia in horses occurs most frequently in critically ill foals, especially septic neonatal foals and foals with Tyzzer disease (Borchers et al. 2006; Hollis et al. 2008). Hypoglycaemia is rarely reported in horses older than a year of age (Divers 2011). The scarce reports of hypoglycaemia in horses older than a year of age have been mostly in association with chronic debilitating conditions such as neoplasia, emaciation and chronic intestinal disorders (Berggren 1980; Ross et al. 1983; Van Mol and West et al. et et al. 2001; Swain et al. 2005; LaCarrubba et al. 2006; Gold et al. 2008; Haga et al. 2008; Lyle et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2015).Hypoglycaemia is occasionally reported in association with hyperlipaemia, especially in ponies, miniature horses and donkeys (Moore et al. 1994; Mogg and Palmer 1995; Hughes et al. 2004). Hypoglycaemia has also been reported in horses with liver failure, endotoxaemia, strangulating lesions of the small and large intestine (Davis et al. 1992; Hollis et al. 2007). Clinical signs of cerebral dysfunction culminating with collapse and generalised seizures associated with severe, episodic, hypoglycaemia are reported in detail in a case of insulinoma in a 12-year-old Shetland pony broodmare (Ross et al. 1983). The initial clinical signs, including disorientation and unawareness of surroundings, were reported to progress to profuse sweating, ear twitching, chewing, staggering and severe clonic muscle contractions of head, neck and limbs, with the episodes lasting 15 -35 min in association with remarkably low blood glucose concentrations of 16 -19 mg/ dL (0.9 -1.1 mmol/L) ( Ross et al. 1983). Episodic collapse and seizure-like activity associated with severe hypoglycaemia has also been described in association with a variety of neoplasms in horses (Van Mol and Fransen 1986; Roby et et al. 2005; Haga et al. 2008; Lyle et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2015). Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with neuroglycopenia, a shortage of glucose in the brain, and results in alterations in electrical activity of the brain cells that are re flected by changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) (Blaabjerg and Juhl 2016). The EEG recordings in humans and animals during hypoglycaemia show characteristic patterns with early changes, such as decreased frequency band for alpha (8 -13 Hz) and beta (13 -30 Hz) activities, large delta ( >0 to<4 Hz) waves, et al. 2015; Blaabjerg and Juhl 2016). Most studies evaluating hypoglycaemia as a proxy for neuroglycopenia have been conducted in human diabetic patients subjected to recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia following insulin treatment, where initial mild cognitive dysfunction quickly progresses to seizures or collapse associated with severe hypoglycaemia (Sejling et al. 2015; Blaabjerg and Juhl 2016; Rubega and Sparacino 2017). Although blood glucose levels are not the only determinant of neuroglycopenia and brain dysfunction, the degree of hypoglycaemia has been correlated with changes in EEG and MRI (Burns et al. Sejling et our knowledge, EEG patterns during hypoglycaemia in adult horses have not been reported. Case history A 5-year-old Thoroughbred racing mare was referred to the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at UC Davis for evaluation of neurologic de cits and fever. Past history included that the mare was a solid performer in Northern California (earnings amounted to nearly US$ 180,000) and was claimed and sent to Southern California 3 months prior to presentation. The mare 's performance gradually declined, and 2 weeks prior to presentation to the Hospital, the mare performed poorly in a race and was shipped back to Northern California. The current trainer reported that the mare had a sketchy history of occasional episodes of abnormal behaviour while in Southern California, but we were unable to contact the previous trainer. Four days prior to referral, the mare was vaccinated and dewormed, and the following day she spiked a fever, appeared unstable and wobbly; she was treated with i.v. flunixin meglumine. A day later, she again appeared unstable and hyperexcitable, and she was given 20 mg of dexamethasone orally. The mare 's appetite was reported to be decreased during the times that she was febrile, but it improved after the anti-in flammatory treatment. The next day she appeared unstable on her feet, blind and deaf, and was referred. Clinical ndings Upon presentation at the hospital, the mare was in good body condition (BCS 4.5/9), well-muscled, had a slightly dull hair coat, and mild bilateral effusion of the metacarpophalangeal joints. Physical examination revealed the mare to be quiet but responsive, she appeared mildly ataxic and had abnormal wide-based stance of the thoracic limbs and narrow-stance of the pelvic limbs. Venous blood samples were collected for complete blood cell count (CBC) and serum biochemistry prole. Neurologic examination revealed mild obtundation, no cranial nerve de cits, and dynamic evaluation revealed symmetrical ataxia grade 2/5. Due to the concern for herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, a nasal swab was submitted at admission to investigate Equine Herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and was negative for EHV-1 gB gene. Initial diagnostic tests revealed CBC including brinogen within normal limits, and the only abnormalities on the serum biochemistry pro le were a mild hypertriglyceridaemia (62 mg/ dL, reference range 2 -42 mg/dL; reference range 0-0.5 76 2.94 mmol/L, reference range 4.2 - 6.1 mmol/L). Urine (yellow and opaque) was collected by free catch and submitted for urinalysis, revealing speci c gravity of 1.020, pH of 8, small amount of protein (25 mg/dL, reference: negative), negative for glucose, ketones, bilirubin, presence of moderate amount of haemoprotein (reference: negative), many crystals (mostly calcium carbonate and few calcium oxalate), rare hyaline casts, WBC (0 -3/HPF) and RBC (2 -3/HPF) and rare transitional epithelial cells, no renal or caudate epithelial cells, no bacteria and few mucus strands. Another blood sample was collected 4 h post admission to recheck the blood glucose, at which time the mare appearedmore obtunded and disoriented. The blood glucose concentration was found to be 35 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L). Differential diagnosis and diagnostic investigation The initial list of differential diagnoses for possible causes of hypoglycaemia in this mare included liver failure, excessive insulin associated with insulinoma, hypoadrenocorticism, performance enhancers (e.g. recombinant equine growth hormone) leading to upregulation of IGF-I and paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia. An additional blood sample was collected prior to initiation of treatment for further diagnostics to characterise the cause of the hypoglycaemia. While a jugular catheter was placed, clinical signs progressed to unawareness of surroundings and staggering, ear twitching and chewing. Intravenous fluid therapy was initiated with dextrose at a rate of 5 mg/kg/min. Her mentation rapidly improved and disorientation resolved. The mare was maintained on a constant rate infusion (CRI) of dextrose (at 2 mg/kg/min), and blood glucose concentration was monitored every 4 h. The dextrose rate was adjusted accordingly in order to maintain blood glucose between 80 and 120 mg/dL (4.4 -6.7 mmol/L). While on CRI of dextrose, the mare appeared normal and had a good appetite. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to evaluate cortical cerebral activity in attempts to con rm paroxysmal activity consistent with seizures and detect the presence of subclinical seizures in association with hypoglycaemia, while the dextrose CRI was decreased gradually, by 25%, then 50% then 75% and then discontinued. Digital EEG with simultaneous video recording was performed using a Nihon Kohden 9000 system1. The needle electrodes were placed subcutaneously as follows: 16 EEG (prefrontal, frontal, electrooculogram (EOG), 2 electromyogram (EMG) and 2 electrocardiogram (ECG) as previously described (Williams et al. 2008, 2012). Figures 1 and 2depict sections of the EEG during the hypoglycaemic monitoring. At the start of the EEG, blood glucose was 59 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) and no abnormal electrical activity was detected on EEG. As the glucose concentration decreased, EEG revealed abnormal electrical activity characterised by presence of spikes and waves and sharp waves ( Fig 1 ). At the time when the initial abnormal electrical activity was detected, blood glucose was 44 mg/ dL (2.4 mmol/L), and the only sign attributed to brain dysfunction was that the mare appeared excessively quiet. The blood glucose decreased further to 39 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/ L) with no overt signs of seizures, but the paroxysmal electrical activity increased on EEG. When clinical signs of staggering, loss of awareness of her surroundings, ear twitching, chewing, and clonic muscle contractions of head and neck were observed, EEG revealed overt ictal electric activity ( Fig 2 ), and a blood sample revealed glucose had decreased to 23 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L), at which time dextrose infusion was reinitiated at a rate of 5 mg/kg/min, and seizures rapidly disappeared. The mare was again maintained on CRI of dextrose at a rate adjusted based on blood glucose monitoring (which ranged between 70 to 122 mg/dL [3.9 - 6.8 mmol/L]). The mare appeared normal and had a good appetite. The blood sample collected prior to the initiation of treatment for hypoglycaemia was submitted to measure ammonia, glucose, insulin, cortisol, insulin growth factor (IGF)- \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd239 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY I, and IGF-II and partially processed IGF-II. Plasma ammonia concentration was within normal limits (7 lg/dL; reference range 5 -59lg/dL) and considering the unremarkable liver markers in the biochemistry pro le, liver failure was therefore ruled out. Blood glucose was low (29 mg/dL, 1.61 mmol/L), while insulin was normal (2.6 lIU/mL; reference range 0 - 20lIU/mL), thus ruling out insulinoma. Cortisol concentration was within normal limits (5.8 lg/dL; reference >2lg/dL) making hypoadrenocorticism unlikely. The IGF-I concentration was below normal range (9 nmol/L, reference range 12 - 41 nmol/L). Quanti and incompletely processed IGF-II (aka 'big IGF-II ') was not performed due to unavailability of commercial tests. Further diagnostic investigation to identify the cause of the hypoglycaemia included rectal palpation, abdominocentesis and peritoneal fluid analysis and abdominal ultrasonography. Rectal palpation was performed, revealing a large, rm mass (estimated to be at least 30 cm) located on the left side of the abdomen, palpation of the mass elicited mild discomfort. Abdominocentesis yielded abdominal fluid that appeared red and opaque, and after centrifugation the supernatant appeared yellow and clear. Abdominal fluid analysis revealed that total protein was slightly increased (2.8 g/dL, reference <2.0 g/dL), total RBC was increased (1,000,000/ lL, 1.091012/L reference 0), total nucleated cells were within the normal range (3800/ lL, reference <5000/ lL; 3.8 9109/L, reference <5.09109/L), counts revealed a predominance of nondegenerate neutrophils (82%), with lower numbers of large mononuclear cells (12% mildly vacuolatedmacrophages containing haemosiderin crystals and rarely eosinophilic small granules), small numbers of small mononuclear cells (6% mature small lymphocytes) and occasional platelets. Abdominal fluid was characterised as a modi ed transudate with evidence of previous haemorrhage, and blood contamination. Transcutaneous abdominal ultrasonography revealed a large heterogeneous mass arising from the left kidney; the renal parenchyma was recognisable dorsally, then blended into the extremely large heterogeneous mass that extended from the left paralumbar fossa region to the left 12th ICS, measuring approximately 50 cm in length ( Fig 3 ). The left liver lobe demonstrated a near-unrecognisable lobulated, heterogeneous appearance. Additionally, a large homogeneous mass was seen between the stomach and spleen measuring 13.0 cm 99.0 cm. Severe brinous anechoic effusion occupied the caudal abdomen with numerous, variably sized round to oval masses scattered throughout the effusion and lying along peritoneal surfaces. The right kidney (18 cm 97.5 cm) appeared normal. The right liver lobe was seen from the right 7th -15th ICS and demonstrated unremarkable echogenicity, vascularity, size and margins. Outcome and post-mortem ndings Diagnosis nonislet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia (NICTH) associated with disseminated neoplasia was made. The neoplasia was suspected to be primary renal in origin Fig 1: Electroencephalogram and simultaneous video recording during subclinical seizures.

Surgical removal of the tumour was deemedunfeasible, and due to the poor prognosis, the mare was subjected to humane euthanasia. Post-mortem examination revealed the peritoneal cavity to contain 10 L of red-orange Fig 2: Electroencephalogram during seizures.

S =Spleen. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd241 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY fluid. Extending from and partially effacing the left kidney was an approximately 50 950940 cm, multilobular, multifocally cavitated mass. The mass had dense projections that extended into and replaced portions of the affected kidney. One cavitation in the mass contained approximately 20 L of orange-tinged, translucent fluid. On cut surfaces the mass was variably rm to friable and yellow-brown to dark red, with a roughened, heterogeneous texture. The mass and the left kidney together weighed 30 kg after removal of the fluid (Fig 4 ). Two masses -one 18 9695 cm, and the second 139992c m -were adhered to the left abdominal body wall. The masses were tan-yellow, rm and multifocally cavitated on cut surfaces. Hundreds of nodules ranging from 0.5-8 cm in diameter were distributed over serosal surfaces throughout the peritoneal cavity, scattered throughout the gastrosplenic ligament, omentum, mesentery, mesometrium and mesovarium, often clustering large aggregates ( Fig 5 ). Larger nodules were mottled tan to dark red to brown, and were occasionally softened, friable or cavitated centrally. The liver weighed 8.9 kg (1.6% of bodyweight) and had approximately 20 similar nodules scattered over its capsular surfaces, all of which ranged in size from 3 to 10 mm in diameter and were rm, pale tan and bulged from cut surfaces. All lung lobes had dozens of similar nodules randomly distributed throughout their parenchyma, ranging from pinpoint to 1.5 cm in diameter. Upon gross evaluation of the central nervous system, especially the brain, no abnormalities were found. Histopathologic examination of the renal neoplasia revealed a carcinoma composed of cuboidal to columnar cells, often lining crude tubular structures or arranged in poorly cohesive nests and clusters, with a variable but often robust intervening brovascular stroma. Cellular atypia was moderate, as was mitotic rate. Broad zones of necrosis with associated haemorrhage and haemosiderosis comprised much of the tumour tissue. Nodules throughout the peritoneal and pleural cavities were histologically similar. Immunohistochemical evaluation con rmed the diagnosis of a carcinoma, with neoplastic cellsexhibiting inconsistent, moderately to strongly positive immunoreactivity with pancytokeratin negative immunoreactivity with vimentin and chromogranin. Speci c immunohistochemical features of renal cell carcinomas are not well established in this species, but histomorphology was considered suf cient for a presumptive diagnosis of tubular renal cell carcinoma. Discussion This is the rst reported case of EEG examination in a horse with NICTH during hypoglycaemic events, and it demonstrates the occurrence of early paroxysmal activity characterised by sharp waves, spikes and waves in absence of obvious manifestation of seizure. As the hypoglycaemia worsened, abnormal electrical activity became generalised, progressing to overt ictal electric activity accompanied by manifestation of seizures. The electrical activity pattern presented in this mare was similar to that described for humans with progressive, severe hypoglycaemia (Blaabjerg and Juhl 2016). Blood glucose levels are not the only determinant of neuroglycopenia and brain dysfunction; however, the degree of hypoglycaemia appears to be correlated with brain dysfunction (Burns et al. 2008; Sejling et al. 2015, Sparacino 2017).The glycaemic threshold for EEG changes has been studied in diabetic humans with post insulin hypoglycaemia and infants with neonatal hypoglycaemia, and it is reported to vary among individuals. In diabetic humans with post insulin hypoglycaemia, electrical changes in EEG are typically noted when blood glucose is around 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) (Sejling et al. 2015; Blaabjerg and Juhl 2016). Infants with severe neonatal hypoglycaemia present severe seizures when the blood glucose is below 36 mg/dL (2 mmol/L) (Burns et al. 2008). Similarly, in the present case, brain dysfunction characterised by disorientation concomitant with alterations in cortical electrical activity was noted when blood glucose decreased to 44 mg/dL (2.4 mmol/L). The cortical electrical changes in EEG progressed to more diffuse paroxysmal Fig 4: Gross post-mortem ndings. Large mass containing the left kidney weighed 30 kg after removal of the fluid. Fig 5: Gross post-mortem ndings. Hundreds of nodules ranging from 0.5 -8 cm in diameter were distributed over serosal surfaces throughout the peritoneal cavity, scattered throughout the gastrosplenic ligament, omentum, mesentery, mesometrium and mesovarium, \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd242 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY activity characterised by spike, waves and sharp waves as blood glucose decreased despite absence of overt signs. Progression to overt ictal electric activity was accompanied by clinical signs of staggering, ear twitching, chewing and clonic muscle contractions of head and neck, while the blood glucose had decreased below 25 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L). Although the degree of hypoglycaemia leading to neuroglycopenia and brain dysfunction is variable in humans, hypoglycaemia is considered the best surrogate assessment of neuroglycopenia. The glycaemic threshold for cerebral cortical dysfunction in horses is not known but, based on the present case, it is possible that abnormal cortical electrical changes are initiated whenever blood glucose drops below 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L). Further studies are warranted to elucidate the effects of severe hypoglycaemia in brain function in horses. The degree of hypoglycaemia in horses with NICTH varies greatly (Baker et al. 2001; Swain et al. 2005; LaCarrubba et al. 2006; Gold et al. 2008; Haga et al. 2008; Lyle et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2015). Not all cases of NICTH are described to be severe enough to lead to overt clinical signs of seizure- like activity and collapse. It appears that in many cases the hypoglycaemia fluctuated and episodes of seizure-like activity were intermittent (Roby et al. 1990; Baker et al. 2001; Swain et al. 2005; Haga et al. 2008; Lyle et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2015), resolving spontaneously. In other cases, there were no overt signs of seizure and the reported degree of hypoglycaemia was not severe enough (LaCarrubba et al. 2006; Gold et al. 2008), but this could have been a matter of time such that eventually the hypoglycaemia would intermittently become severe enough to lead to overt clinical signs of seizure. Nonislet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia has been reported in horses with primary neoplasia of the kidney (Berggren 1980; Van Mol and Fransen West et Baker et al. 2001; Swain et al. 2005; Lyle et al. 2010), primary neoplasia of the liver (Roby et al. 1990; Gold et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2015), as well as mesothelioma (LaCarrubba et al. 2006) and gastrointestinal stromal tumour (Haga et al. 2008). NICTH in humans has been associated mostly with neoplasia of mesenchymal or hepatic origin (de Groot et Bodnar et al. 2014; Khowaja et al. 2014; Han et al. 2017; Wilson et al. 2017). In dogs, NICTH has been reported mostly (hepatocellular 1985; Finora 2003; et al. 2010). The mechanism of paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia includes: (1) production of insulin by the tumour (ectopic insulin-producing tumours), (2) hepatic failure associated with tumour in ltration of the liver, (3) catabolic state associated with increase metabolic requirement and (4) production of substances by the tumour, including tumour necrosis factor- alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 growth factors (e.g. IGF-I, IGF-II) or IGF precursors. In humans, it is believed that the cause of hypoglycaemia in most cases of NICTH is the overexpression of IGF-II and secretion of an incompletely processed precursor IGF-II, also referred as 'big '(de Groot et 2017). 'Big 'is a large molecular weight pro-peptide with insulin-like activity. NICTH mediated by excessive secretion of IGF-I has also been reported (Wilson et al. 2017).The mechanism of the hypoglycaemia in the present case of renal (tubular) carcinoma with carcinomatosis was not determined. The hypoglycaemia accompanied by low (suppressed) insulin and low IGF-I suggested that the mechanism of hypoglycaemia in the present case might have been mediated by IGF-II or 'big IGF-II. 'However, this could not be con rmed because measurements of equine IGF-II and big IGF-II are not available. Similarly, in the other reported cases of NICTH in horses, the authors were unable to clearly identify the mechanism of hypoglycaemia. In one case of renal clear cell carcinoma, IGF-II was measured and found to be within the range of control horses; however, big IGF-II was not (Swain et al. 2005). The cornerstone for management of NICTH is temporary control of hypoglycaemia by i.v. dextrose administration and removal of the neoplasm as soon as possible (de Groot et al. 2007; Bodnar et al. 2014). In cases where complete removal of the neoplasia is not possible, reduction of the tumour mass is considered helpful. In these cases, administration of glucocorticosteroids and growth hormone, alone or in combination is recommended in an attempt to alleviate the hypoglycaemia (de Groot et al. 2007; Richters et 2014; Khowaja et al. 2014; Mohammedi et al. 2014). The frequency and severity of the hypoglycaemic episodes associated with NICTH is reported to be reduced by glucocorticoid treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Han et al. 2017). Successful management of NICTH with temporary i.v. dextrose treatment followed by removal of the neoplasia has been reported in humans and small animals (Leifer et al. 1985; Khowaja et al. 2014). There are no reports of successful management of NICTH in horses. Removal of a renal tumour was attempted in one case of NICTH associated with renal neoplasia, but the animal died during the surgical procedure (Lyle et al. 2010). It is important to note that the diagnosis of the neoplasia is often only made when the disease is fairly advanced and extensive, thus making the surgical removal of the neoplasm an unlikely option. The actual incidence and prevalence of NICTH in horses is not known and it is possible that many cases go unrecognised, especially considering in many cases of horses presenting with ill-de ned clinical signs such as decreased appetite, quiet demeanour, suspected mild colic, biochemistry pro les are not performed, or if performed low glucose levels are often disregarded and thought to be artefact due to prolonged sample transport and delay on assay performance (i.e. pseudohypoglycaemia). The tumour types associated with NICTH in horses are not known, as there are so few reports of NICTH. Of the 12 published cases of hypoglycaemia associated with nonislet neoplasia in horses, and the current case, eight cases (61.5%) were primary renal neoplasia, three were primary hepatic tumours (one hepatic and one cholangiocarcinoma), one gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and one mesothelioma. It is likely, however, that many cases of NICTH in horses go unrecognised or unreported. Conclusion In cases of horses presenting with altered state of consciousness and intermittent seizures, hypoglycaemia should be investigated, and a paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia should be considered in the list of differentials. As highlighted by this case, paroxysmal cerebral \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd243 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY cortical electrical activity in the absence of clinical signs of seizure might occur when blood glucose drops below 45 mg/ dL (2.5 mmol/L).

Johnson Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbia, Missouri, USA Corresponding author email: johnsonpj@missouri.edu Keywords: horse; hypoglycaemia; hypoglycorrhachia; neuroglycopenia; the fact that maintenance of normoglycaemia is so critical to health, the development of hypoglycaemia is uncommonly encountered in both adult human and equine patients because multiple homoeostatic mechanisms have evolved to prevent or reverse incipient hypoglycaemia. In human medicine, hypoglycaemia is de ned by Whipple 's triad: clinical signs consistent with hypoglycaemia; demonstration of hypoglycaemia coincidental with clinical signs; and resolution of clinical signs following re-establishment of normoglycaemia (Martens and Tits 2014). Hypoglycaemia is most commonly identi ed in human diabetic patients that are being treated with glucose lowering drugs, especially insulin or insulin secretagogues (Cryer et al. 2009). Hypoglycaemia is much less common in human patients who are not being treated for diabetes (Service 1995, 1999). In one retrospective report of 37,898 nondiabetic hospital admissions, hypoglycaemia (de ned as blood glucose 3.0 mmol/L [55 mg/dL]) was estimated to occur in 36 per 10,000 admissions (Nirantharakumar et al. 2012). Hypoglycaemia in those patients was attributed to a variety of nondiabetes drugs (including alcohol) and various critical illnesses such as hepatic, renal or cardiac failure, sepsis or lack of nourishment. Interestingly, more than one possible explanation for hypoglycaemia was identi ed in most of those patients and it was unexplained in only seven patients. As described in an adult horse in the accompanying clinical report by Costa et al. (2020), clinically important hypoglycaemia may also arise as an uncommon complication of malignancy (Scott 2009; Bodnar et al. 2014). Paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia has been described in the context of several types of cancer, including pancreatic islet and nonislet cell tumours. Although paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia may be explained by several diverse mechanisms (such as increased glucose utilisation by extensive tumours or cancer-related destruction of hepatic or adrenal gland tissue) (Iglesias and Diez 2014), the principal cause of NICTH in most cases is the elevated glucose utilisation (especially in skeletal muscle) and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis that result et al. 1981; Shapiro et al. 1990; Zapf et al. 1992), or rarely, IGF-1 (Nauck et al. 2007). Somewhat similar to what has been reported in the (limited) equine literature, NICTH is most commonly reported in human al. 2005; Pink et al. 2005; Bodnar et al. 2014). It has also beenreported that hypoglycaemia may sometimes result from pro- insulin or insulin secretion by nonislet cell tumours in rare cases (Shames et et al. 1973; Shetty et al. 1982; Seckl et al. 1999). Bona de hypoglycaemia is an uncommon nding in adult horses. In a recent retrospective study that reported neurological ndings in 47 hypoglycaemic adult horses (>1 year of age), the most commonly identi ed explanations for hypoglycaemia were liver disease (15 horses) and gastrointestinal (GI) disease (15 horses). Other aetiologies that were identi ed included hypertriglyceridaemia that was not secondary to either liver or GI disease (8 horses, all American Miniature Horses), sepsis (2 horses) and neoplasia (7 horses) (Costa et al. 2020). Although speci c diagnosis of neoplasia was not achieved in 2 of the 7 cancer-affected horses with hypoglycaemia, the following diagnoses were reported for the other ve horses in that study: renal undifferentiated carcinoma, renal tubular carcinoma with GI carcinomatosis, hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma (Costa et al. 2020). Hypoglycaemia is identi ed in some patients in the absence of clinical signs (sometimes <2.2 mmol/L [40 mg/dL]). have been modi ed, an effect that can develop in patients that have been affected by recurrent bouts of hypoglycaemia (Amiel et al. 1988). Alternatively, artefactual hypoglycaemia (pseudohypoglycaemia) may result from delayed laboratory measurement of sampled blood (especially if glucose assessment is delayed and based on measurements in serum). This artefactual glucose-lowering effect can be defeated by ensuring that collected blood is quickly processed in the laboratory or by collecting blood into a collection tube that contains an antiglycolytic agent such as fluoride. Pseudohypoglycaemia is more likely in (human) patients with elevated leucocyte counts (enhanced consumption of glucose) and in those with severe haemolytic disease or erythrocytosis, in which nucleated red blood cells or erythrocytes consume glucose at an accelerated rate (Macaron et al. 1981; Ybarra and Isern 2003; 2009; Theo logiannakos et al. 2010). Hypoglycaemia represents an important limiting factor in the glycaemic management of both type 1 and (advanced) type 2 diabetes mellitus and, in rare instances, may lead to death. Along with antecedent exercise and sleep, hypogly- caemia lowers the effectiveness of the normal autonomic responses ( 'glycaemic defenses ') intended to protect against worsening hypoglycaemia, thus setting in motion a vicious \u00a92018 EVJ (Cryer 2007). Episodic hypoglycaemia is an unfortunate reality for most people affected with diabetes mellitus; plasma glucose concentrations are reported to be at very low levels (<2.8 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]) for as much as 10% of the time (Cryer 2004). On average, diabetic patients develop two symptomatic episodes of hypoglycaemia each week and suffer one debilitating bout of severe hypoglycaemia on an annual basis (Cryer 2004). Signi cant bene ts regarding the use of continuous glucose monitoring technology in human diabetic patients at risk for hypoglycaemic episodes have recently been presented (Harris et al. 2010; Saw et al. 2017). A similar approach might be useful for the purpose of monitoring glucose status in horses at risk of hypoglycaemia (Johnson et al. 2011). Both death and permanent brain damage are regarded as rare and most patients who develop hypoglycaemia-associated brain dysfunction make a complete recovery following therapeutic restitution of the plasma glucose concentration (Musen et al. 2008; Cryer 2004). Hypoglycaemia-associated neuronal necrosis is reported to occur only when the electroencephalogram (EEG) becomes isoelectric. In contrast to cerebral ischaemia, cerebral blood flow increases in the face of developing hypoglycaemia and the resulting neurochemical changes are distinctly different to those resulting from ischaemia (Auer and Siesj \u20aco 1993; Cryer 2007). Reported hypoglycaemia- induced neurochemical changes include inhibited protein synthesis in many regions of the brain, a shift of brain redox equilibria towards oxidation, incomplete energy failure, loss of ion homoeostasis, cellular calcium in flux, intracellular alkalosis and a release of neuroactive excitatory amino acids, especially aspartate, into the extracellular the brain (Auer and Siesj \u20aco 1993; Cryer 2007). In contrast to earlier theories that hypoglycaemic brain damage resulted simply from glucose starvation (energy failure), it is now regarded as an example of cerebral 'excitotoxic 'neuropathology, in which neurons are selectively killed by an extracellular over flow of excitatory amino acids produced by the brain itself (Auer and Siesj \u20aco 1993; Cryer 2007). Although glucose is the obligate metabolic fuel for the brain under normal physiological conditions, the brain is unable to either synthesise glucose or store substantial quantities of glycogen in astrocytes. Therefore, the brain is dependent on a continuous supply of glucose derived from the circulating plasma. Glucose enters the brain via facilitated diffusion at a rate dependent on the arterial plasma glucose concentration (Blomqvist et al. 1991). Although the rate of glucose transport from the plasma into the brain exceeds the rate of brain glucose metabolism under normo- or hyperglycaemic conditions, it decreases in the face of hypoglycaemia and causes functional brain failure as a result of brain fuel deprivation. Neuroglycopenia is de ned as an unavailability of glucose in the brain (brain fuel deprivation). Unrecognised and untreated, neuroglycopenia results in neuronal dysfunction and death. Although hypoglycaemia (blood glucose concentration <3.9 mmol/L [ <70 mg/dL]) is the most common explanation for neuroglycopenia, it may also result from abnormal glucose transport, abnormal glycogen storage and abnormalities of metabolism (Aronoff et al. 2004; Chenouard et al. 2015). Various and sequential homoeostatic mechanisms are normally activated in order to maintain normoglycaemia (Preiser2013). Lowering of the rate of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells represents the earliest response to decreasing plasma glucose concentrations (reacting within the reference range for plasma glucose concentrations). The threshold plasma glucose concentration that triggers diminished insulin secretion in people is approximately 4.5 mmol/L (81 mg/dL) (Cryer Secretion of epinephrine by the adrenal medulla and glucagon by alpha cells in the pancreas is provoked at an approximate glycaemic threshold of 3.8 mmol/L (68 mg/dL). If these physiological responses fail to abrogate diminishing plasma glucose concentrations, there ensues a more intense sympathoadrenal response to worsening hypoglycaemia with concomitant neurogenic signs (Hepburn et al. 1991; Towler et al. 1993; DeRosa and Cryer 2004). Neurogenic signs reported in hypoglycaemic human patients include palpitations, anxiety, sweating, tremor, tachycardia, hunger and paraesthesias (at approximately 3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]). In addition to neurogenic signs that result from autonomic activation, other clinical signs resulting from neuroglycopenia at the similar glycaemic threshold include cognitive failure, confusion, blurred speech, sensation of warmth, fatigue, seizures, coma and death. Severity of the clinical manifestations of hypoglycaemia is correlated with the extent to which the blood glucose concentration is decreased, with signs of cerebral cortical dysfunction (cognitive impairment) reported in people and laboratory animals when the glucose concentration is less than 2.0 -2.8 mmol/L (36 -50 mg/dL). Blood glucose concentrations at this level have been associated with brain glucose concentrations that are close to zero. Coma may occur when the plasma glucose concentration is in the range of 2.3 -2.7 mmol/L (41 -49 mg/dL) (Cryer 2007). The concentration of blood glucose at which EEG perturbations occurs has also been investigated in human patients; EEG abnormalities indicative for cortical neuronal dysfunction (decreased alpha wave activity and increased theta activity) are reported to develop at median blood glucose concentrations of 2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) (Pramming et al. 1988). The alpha/theta ratio is regarded as a reliable indicator of EEG status in hypoglycaemic human patients (Tribl et al. 1996). Abnormal EEG patterns that resulted from hypoglycaemia in an adult horse affected with cancer have been reported for the rst time in this species in the accompanying article (Costa et al. 2020). Using an authenticated and well-established EEG recording method for horses, the authors demonstrated EEG abnormalities that were similar to those reported for humans with progressive, severe hypoglycaemia. It was interesting to note that EEG abnormalities (spikes and waves and sharp waves) were rst detected when the blood glucose concentration had decreased to 2.4 mmol/L (44 mg/dL) and that, at that point, although appearing to be quiet, the horse did not exhibit overt signs of clinical seizure. Clinically evident seizure activity was still not evident when the EEG demonstrated worsening paroxysmal electrical activity at a blood glucose concentration of 2.2 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). The horse did manifest physical seizure activity (including clonic muscle contractions) when the blood glucose concentration was 1.3 mmol/L (23 mg/dL), at which time overt ictal electrical activity was clearly evident in the EEG recording. Both the abnormal EEG activity and the clinical signs were eliminated when hypoglycaemia had been reversed by i.v. dextrose treatment. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that the glycaemic threshold for EEG changes in \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd247 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY adult horses is similar to that reported in people. The case report also points to the importance of EEG monitoring of hypoglycaemic horses because abnormal cortical activity (e.g. epileptic discharges) may be occurring in the absence of clinically evident seizure signs. Measurement of glucose concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides insight regarding glucose availability for neurons in the brain. Low CSF glucose concentration (known as hypoglycorrhachia) occurs in the face of severe hypoglycaemia (Chow and Troy 2014). Other causes for hypoglycorrhachia have included bacterial infections, cancer and stroke (Kim et al. 2005). Although CSF was not collected in order to ascertain the extent of hypoglycorrhachia in this case, a correlative relationship between severity of hypoglycaemia and the CSF glucose concentration was recently reported in a small number of horses (Aleman et al. 2018). In that study, CSF glucose was unmeasurable (glucose concentration was zero) in ve of twenty neuroglycopenic hypoglycaemic horses and foals. Clinical signs that result from hypoglycaemia in adult horses have not been reported extensively but have included signs resulting from cerebral dysfunction such as severe alterations in the state of consciousness, collapse and generalised seizures. Similar to the case reported here, other clinical signs associated with severe hypoglycaemia in adult horses may include disorientation, unawareness of surroundings, sweating, ear twitching, chewing, staggering and clonic muscle contractions (Aleman et al. 2018). Various and diverse clinical signs in the reported case likely resulted from the combined effects of both extensive abdominal neoplasia and paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia. It was interesting to note that episodes of both central blindness and deafness were reported as a part of the presenting medical history in this case. Intermittent central blindness and deafness were also reported in approximately 12% of 90 neuroglycopenic horses and foals that were associated with hypoglycaemia (de ned as blood glucose concentration <4.2 mmol/L [ <75 mg/dL]) in a recent study (Aleman et al. 2018). As was reported in a retrospective study of hypoglycaemic adult and young horses (Aleman et al. 2018), the observed clinical signs of hypoglycaemia in this case were predominantly those attributable to neuroglycopenia. Neurogenic signs, such as tremors, palpitations, anxiety and sweating were not reported, similar to observations in studies of other hypoglycaemic equids (Aleman et al. 2018). Post-mortem examination of the brain of the neuroglycopenic lly in this case was not undertaken. Histopathological evidence of brain injury has been reported in people affected with severe hypoglycaemia, for example following the inadvertent or inappropriate dosing with sulfonylurea drugs characterised by a prolonged hypoglycaemic action (Kalimo and Olsson 1980). Histopathological ndings in human cases of hypoglycaemia include super cial laminar necrosis throughout the cerebral cortex with neuronal necrosis also present in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus (Mori et al. 2006). Evidence of injury in the basal thalamic nuclei and thalamus, cortical white matter haemorrhage and cerebral artery infarction have also been reported in human infants affected with hypoglycaemia (Rozance and Hay 2006; Burns et al. 2008). Post-mortem examination of the brain of nonsurviving neuroglycopenic equids has not been reported and warrants further investigation.Author 's declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Reardon, S. Schiavo, T. Fordham and Y. A. Elce Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Easter Bush Veterinary Centre, University of Edinburgh, Roslin, Midlothian, Summary A 5-year-old National Hunt Thoroughbred mare presented with sudden onset left hindlimb lameness after race training on the gallops. Clinical examination revealed a marked painful reaction over the proximal metatarsal region but no other obvious abnormalities were detected. Survey radiographs at the yard did not reveal any abnormalities. Nuclear scintigraphic examination 3 days after injury revealed focal marked increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in the proximal metatarsal region. Subsequent radiography revealed an incomplete, articular fracture of the proximal left third metatarsal bone. Repair of the fracture using 3 34.5 mm cortical screws placed in lag fashion was performed under standing sedation following perineural analgesia. Follow-up radiographs demonstrated progressive healing of the fracture. The mare returned to race training 8 months after the fracture was repaired and raced successfully 12 months post injury. Introduction Third metacarpal and metatarsal bone distal condylar fractures are the most common long bone fracture affecting Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses in training (Ferraro 1990; Ross 2003). The clinical presentation is typically predictable with acute onset lameness with swelling around the fetlock region. Metatarsal and metacarpal fractures are common pathologies in racehorses due to the high-speed and repetitive loading of the limbs; the lateral condyle of the left third metacarpal bone being more commonly affected (Jacklin and Wright 2012; Ramzan et al. 2015). Metacarpal fractures are more common than metatarsal fractures in Thoroughbreds but the ratio is nearly equal in Standardbred horses (Rick et al. 1983; Zekas et al. 1999). Different surgical treatments for the common orientations of metatarsal fractures have been described, including; screw xation (either standing or under general anaesthesia), application of a buttress plate (or plates), dynamic compression plates and locking compression plates under general anaesthesia, for medial condylar fractures that spiral proximally (Russell and Maclean 2006; Bischofberger et al. 2009; Smith 2010; Payne and Compston 2012; Goodrich et al. 2014; O'Brien and Hunt 2014). In recent years, standing fracture repair has become a useful technique for reducing cost and risk associated with general anaesthesia. Incomplete fractures are often good candidates for standing repair as they are non or minimally displaced so require little surgicalmanipulation to achieve accurate reduction (Payne and Compston 2012). This case report describes an unusual fracture con guration in the proximal aspect of the third metatarsal bone. The fracture originated at the tarsometatarsal joint and coursed distally in a dorsomedial to plantarolateral plane to the level of the mid-metatarsus. This fracture con guration has been previously reported and repaired with lag screws in the metacarpal region but not the metatarsal region (Ross and Martin 1992). The fracture was repaired under standing sedation following nerve blocks using three 4.5-mm cortical screws placed in lag fashion (Russell and Maclean 2006; Smith et al. 2009). Previous publications have reported standing fracture repair for lateral and medial condylar fractures, but to the authors 'knowledge this is the rst case report describing this fracture con guration and its repair in a standing horse. Case history A 5-year-old National Hunt TB mare presented with an acute onset left hindlimb lameness (grade 4/5) (Ross 2003) after fast exercise on the gallops. Initial examination revealed that the mare was reluctant to bear weight fully on the limb and a painful reaction was elicited by palpation of the proximal metatarsal region. Survey radiographic examination of the limb, including the proximal third metatarsus, using a wireless digital radiography (DR) system1(Cuattro Slate 3) at the yard did not did not reveal any obvious fracture and nuclear scintigraphy was recommended. In the interim and based upon the clinical ndings the mare was cross tied in the stable and treated with i.v. phenylbutazone (Equipalazone/C2262 2.2 mg/kg bwt) (2.2 mg/kg bwt). No bandage was applied to the limb. The mare underwent nuclear scintigraphy, at the earliest opportunity, 3 days after initial onset of lameness. Scintigraphy and radiography Three days post injury the mare was injected intravenously with 6.5 MBq technetium-99methyldiphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) and 2 hours later images of both hindlimbs and the pelvis were acquired using a gamma camera and a dedicated computer system (MiE medical)3This revealed a focal, marked increase of radiopharmaceutical uptake at the level of the proximal left third metatarsal region ( Figs 1 and 2). Following a mandatory period of radioactive isolation, radiographs of the proximal third metatarsal region a signi cant riskofpropagation. Atthistime (5days post injury), themare was still not fully weightbearing on the limb. Following discussion with thetrainer thedecision was made tostabilise thefracture using cortical bone screws the mare standing and sedated ( Figs 5and 6).Surgical procedure plus additional ring block atthelevel oftheproximal metatarsal bone were performed using a combination of mepivacaine hydrochloride (Intra-epicaine/C2262,30mL) and lidocaine and cm 20 239732 cnts 90.00 sec 0%100% Fig1:Plantaro-dorsal ofthe proximal leftthird VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY adrenaline (Lignol/C226,840 mL). The contralateral limb was bandaged with sterile VetrapTM, sterile drapes were not used due to the temperament of the mare. Aseptic preparation of the left hindlimb was carried out using povidone/iodine scrub (Vetasept/C2269) after clipping and sterile bandaging of the distal and proximal limb was performed with sterile VetrapTM. Skin staples were placed on the proximal cannon under radiographic guidance. Three 1.5-cm stab incisions werecreated, the rst most proximal was just distal to the tarso - metatarsal joint. Three 4.5-mm cortical bone screws were placed in lag fashion across the fracture line using a Cordell drill (DeWalt/C22610). The Cordell drill had been sterilised using an ethylene oxide autoclave (Anprolene/C22611sterilisation system). Screws were placed approximately 2 cm apart proximally to distally from dorsolateral to plantar medial to cross the fracture line at 90 degrees. The proximal screw was 44 mm long, middle 42 mm and distal 40 mm. Saline was used throughout the procedure for lavage and irrigation during drilling of the fracture. The screws were placed in amikacin sulphate (Amikin/C22612) prior to insertion. After all screws were placed the screws were tightened from proximal to distal while the horse was not fully weightbearing. Final radiographs con rmed reduction of the fracture gap. Routine closure of the stab incisions was carried out with simple interrupted 3.5 metric polyglactin 910 sutures in the skin (Vicryl/C226133,5 Metric). A modi ed Robert Jones bandage was applied from foot to proximal tibia plateau. The mare was fully weightbearing after surgery and remained comfortable on the limb once the perineural blocks had worn off. The horse was discharged from the hospital 24 h after surgical repair with instructions to continue with box rest and a course of Ceftiofur hydrochloride bwt) for 5 days. Results The mare was strictly box rested for 8 weeks after discharge from the hospital. She remained comfortable and fully weightbearing on the limb during that time. The modi ed Robert Jones bandage was changed after 4 days and replaced for a 2-layer bandage which was changed every 4-6 days. Following this, the mare was maintained in a stable bandage.

The mare was immediately comfortable following stabilisation of the fracture and quiet box rest was required to allow healing without further injury. Radiographic examination 4 weeks after surgery revealed moderate widening of the fracture line as expected for this stage (Panjabi et al. 1985). Distal propagation of the fracture was still considered a possibility so despite the mare being fully weightbearing, the mare was maintained on box rest for a further 4 weeks. Repeat radiographic examination at 8 and 12 weeks post surgery revealed reduction of the fracture gap, with the screws remaining in position with mild remodelling at the level of the screw heads. Clinical examination at 12 weeks revealed mild bony exostosis at the level of screws but no pain on palpation or flexion of the limb. The mare was sound at walk. Based on these ndings a controlled walking exercise programme was instigated for 4 weeks. Further radiographic examination at 16 weeks after surgery revealed reduction of the fracture line, mild periosteal reaction was observed around the proximal screw head and slight bending of the proximal screw. At this point, the mare was turned out in a small paddock for 6 weeks prior to free eld turn out. The mare returned to training 8 months after original injury without signs of lameness and won a hurdle race 12 months after the original injury. Discussion This case report describes both an unusual fracture of the third metatarsal bone and the successful standing repair using cortical bone screws placed in lag fashion. The fracture was incomplete and minimally displaced making it a good candidate for standing fracture repair, which avoided the risk of propagation during induction or recovery from general anaesthesia. Proximal articular fractures of the MtIII are unusual in racehorses but are reported and normally occur on the dorsomedial aspect of the bone (Lloyd et al. 1988; Pleasant et al. 1992; Ross and Martin 1992). These fractures are commonly incomplete, longitudinal fractures caused by repetitive cyclic loading of the bone (Morgan and Dyson 2012) and normally propagate distally from the tarsometarsal joint into the third metatarsal bone and toward the dorsomedial cortex. Some incomplete fractures can be difcult to diagnose as there can be very little swelling and they do not always improve after intra-articular analgesia of the tarsometatarsal joint. Firm pressure around the proximal cannon can elicit pain in some cases, as was observed in this case. Precise radiographic orientation is required to visualise these fractures radiographically, which may explain why this was not observed on the initial screening radiographs taken at the yard and/or that the fracture had propagated by the time of the second radiographic study 5 days post injury. Nuclear scintigraphy can be very useful in ascertaining the location of a fracture prior to more targeted radiography and has the advantage of helping to rule out other bony pathology in the hindlimb, which can be dif cult to otherwise image successfully. MRI, computer tomography or ultrasound may also have been useful to identify a linear discontinuity in the proximal plantar cortex of MtIII (Gaschen incomplete fractures of the proximal third metatarsal bone has been reported to be successful (Pilsworth 1992). In this case the perceived risk of propagation and the level of lameness exhibited by the mare several days after initial injury were major factors in the decision to recommend standing surgical repair. Surgical repair of McIII/MtIII fractures involving the diaphysis (particularly those that appear to spiral) can include the use of locking plates placed dorsally and dorsomedially at 90 degrees to each other (Ahern et al. 2010; Goodrich et al. 2014), with minimally invasive approaches described (James and Richardson 2006). However, major complications of repairing fractures in this way include infection, implant failure (Ahern et al. 2010) and the requirement for plate removal after the fracture has healed. Use of a minimally invasive lag screw technique reduced the risks of these complications. The decision to cross tie the mare and not apply any bandage was made in the initial period due to the lack of accurate injury localisation and may have contributed to the apparent progression of the fracture from the initial screening radiographs. The application of a Robert Jones dressing that ends near the fracture site provides only limited support and increases the leverage arm, potentially resulting in more tissue damage (Ladefoged et al. 2017). On this basis, the limb was left unbandaged until the fracture was localised. With fractures of MtIII a cast or splint should be applied from the hoof to the sti fle joint (or in some cases only to the top of the calcaneus). The limb was bandaged after surgery to help reduce the post-operative swelling and to protect the surgical site from further trauma even though full support of the fracture was not achieved. Many veterinary surgeons nd bandaging of the mid hindlimb of questionable bene t, due to the intolerance from many horses; in this case the mare tolerated the post-operative bandage well, so it was retained. The decision to use i.v. dose of ceftiofur hydrochloride was based on the mare 's resentment of i.m. injections, the lack of availability of i.v. penicillin in our clinic at that time and the concerns of using procaine penicillin in a horse with a fractured limb due to the possible reactions (Olsen et al. 2007). While ceftiofur hydrochloride is not licenced for i.v. use in horses and has been linked to increased risk of diarrhoea by some, because of its bene ts by this route, it was considered an appropriate choice in this case. Conclusion This case report describes a novel surgical technique for an unusual third metatarsal fracture. The procedure was well tolerated by the horse and placement of the screws from the dorsolateral aspect of the limb was carried out safely and with relative ease. The authors recommend this technique for this fracture con guration based on the associated costs and balance of the risks involved.

Canadian Rockies Powder Skiing Event Jan 2021 VetPD Global Industry Partners North American Industry Partner Clinical Commentary Diagnosis and standing repair of a proximal metatarsal fracture in a racing Thoroughbred R. Tucker* and T. K. Hughes Liphook Equine by Cill /C19an-Garc /C19a and colleagues published in this issue (Cill /C19an-Garc /C19aet al. 2020) describes the successful standing repair of an unusual fracture con guration of the proximal third metatarsal bone. A 5-year-old racing Thoroughbred demonstrated sudden onset, severe lameness during race training, with pain identi ed on palpation of the proximal metatarsus. The fracture was not radiographically evident immediately following injury but was identi ed scintigraphically and radiographically within 5 days of injury, following transportation to a specialist referral centre. The scenario described in this case report provides an opportunity to re flect on the decision making involved with management and transportation of a suspect fracture patient. Establishing a diagnosis prior to travel is bene cial and is facilitated by the availability of high-quality, portable radiography systems. In many cases, portable radiography enables fracture diagnosis in situ, optimising initial treatment and coaptation, and allowing prognostication and treatment planning. Digital technology also allows the rapid sharing of images between the attending clinician and hospital specialists, facilitating surgical planning and accurate communication between all parties. As in this case report, some fractures are initially radiographically silent, creating dif culties with providing focused acute care. In this situation, limb support should be provided appropriate to the affected anatomical region indicated by clinical ndings. Generally, acute fractures in racing equines have a relatively predictable pathogenesis and alongside localising clinical signs, allow reasonable assumptions to be made as to the likely fracture con guration and hence appropriate initial management. Appropriate external support reduces the risk of injury propagation, protects fracture margins and provides signi cant analgesia. However, if the fracture location is unknown, indiscriminate support is contraindicated, particularly in the case of proximal limb fractures (Wright 2017). In this case report, history and presenting signs made a fracture affecting the proximal metatarsus or tarsus highly likely, but provided no clue as to the eventual unusual fracture con guration. Providing limb support, therefore, becomes a judgement call, with other factors to be taken into account such as the temperament of the horse and severity of lameness. Appropriate coaptation of the proximal metatarsus suf cient to prevent bending forces in the metatarsal diaphysis requires application of a Robert Jones bandage, supported by medial and lateral splints, or by a bandage cast. This rigid xation is applied from the ground to the level of the proximal tibia and may not be tolerated by all horses (F \u20acurst 2012). Having found no fracture on radiographic examination at the yard the treating clinicians were left with two options, therst to transport the horse to a hospital facility to allow scintigraphic examination, the second to perform further radiography after a suitable period of time. Nuclear scintigraphy is indicated in a case of sudden onset severe lameness originating during exercise as it is a highly sensitive imaging modality for the detection of fracture pathology, including stress fractures and those undetectable on routine radiographic views. Accumulation of radiopharmaceutical in bone is predominantly mediated by osteoblastic activity and acute bone injury can be imaged at 12 h to 3 days post injury (Dyson and Weekes 2003). However, false-negative results can occur in the acute phase, particularly in regions shielded by large overlying muscle mass. This is particularly relevant for fractures of the acetabulum or ileum, which may not become scintigraphically evident until 10 -14 days post injury (Dyson and Weekes 2003). If nuclear scintigraphy was not available the horse could have been rested in cross ties, with repeat radiography performed at 7 -10 days post injury, when osteoclastic activity may have resulted in widening of the fracture line and a radiographically evident fracture. If follow-up radiographs had not revealed evidence of fracture progression, such that continued conservative management had been possible, the need for transportation may have been avoided. Conversely, the identi cation of a fracture on repeat radiography may have necessitated travelling the horse for surgical treatment at this later date, at which stage catastrophic fracture progression would be more likely. In the reported case, widening of the fracture gap occurred between radiographs obtained on Day 1 and Day 5 post injury, whether due to the simple passage of time or further propagation during travel. Following arrival at the referral hospital, repeat tarsal radiographs may have provided a diagnosis without the need for scintigraphy, although we understand that it is easy to suggest this with hindsight. In the case described by Cill /C19an-Garc /C19aet al. (2020) , scintigraphic examination 3 days after injury revealed marked increased radiopharmaceutical uptake associated with the left proximal third metatarsal bone. Radiographs on Day 5 post injury revealed a longitudinal, incomplete, articular fracture extending from the tarsometatarsal joint to the level of the mid diaphysis, in a consistent dorsomedial to plantarolateral plane. Fractures in this anatomical region are uncommon. Three cases of fracture of the dorsoproximal cortex of the third metatarsal bone have been reported in the racing Thoroughbred, with affected animals showing acute onset grades 2 -3 of 5 lameness (Pilsworth 1992). Nonroutine radiographic views revealed short, articular fractures and evidence of pre-existing tarsometatarsal joint pathology. These ndings contrast with those 10.1111/eve.12975who do not report the presence of tarsometatarsal joint disease, nor involvement of the dorsal cortex, suggesting a different aetiology of this fracture. Incomplete longitudinal fractures of the proximopalmar third metacarpal bone have been widely reported but have not been described in the hindlimb (Lloyd et al. 1988; Pleasant et al. 1992; Ross and Martin 1992; Pinchbeck and Kriz 2001; Morgan and Dyson 2012; Beccati et al. 2019). In contrast to this report, these short, nonarticular fractures are most commonly visualised on dorsopalmar radiographic projections and cause lameness of moderate severity (Morgan and Dyson 2012). They do not require surgical intervention, with a majority returning to full athletic function following rest and walking exercise. Treatment of the reported fracture by internal xation is optimal to provide rigid stabilisation, interfragmentary compression and to minimise the risk of fracture propagation and secondary tarsometatarsal osteoarthritis. However, routine repair of such a fracture under general anaesthesia poses signi cant risk of catastrophic fracture during induction or recovery. Anaesthesia was avoided in three cases of condylar fractures of the third metatarsal bone which were managed conservatively in a cast. These minimally displaced medial condylar fractures, which propagated into the diaphysis, were immobilised in the standing horse using a half limb breglass cast. Casts remained in place for between 27 and 35 days and were replaced by a half limb Robert Jones dressing following cast removal. Two horses returned to racing and one remained lame secondary to osteoarthritic change of the metatarsophalangeal joint (Lloyd et al. 2008). Standing lag screw xation provides the bene ts of internal xation whilst avoiding risks associated with general anaesthesia. Standing placement of bone screws was rst reported in 2006 for treatment of spiralling fractures of the distal third metacarpal and metatarsal bones, which are at signi cant risk of anaesthetic related failure (Perez-Olmos et al.2006; Russell and Maclean 2006). Payne and Compston (2012) reported the results of a further 34 cases of standing repair of nondisplaced mid-sagittal fractures of the rst phalanx and condylar fractures of the third metacarpal and metatarsal bones. Further applications of the procedure are now being explored, including repair of the greater tubercle of the humerus (Madron et al. 2013) and the case reported in this issue (Cill /C19an-Garc /C19aet al. 2020). This fracture was amenable to standing repair as it was incomplete, minimally displaced and without comminution. The inability to perform arthroscopy in the standing horse was not of concern in this case, the tarsometatarsal joint being arthroscopically inaccessible. It should be noted that risks usually associated with general anaesthesia are not completely avoided by standing surgery, with 1 out of 13 cases reported by Russell and Maclean (2006) suffering postoperative fracture failure and 1 out of 34 cases reported by Payne and Compston (2012) suffering caecal rupture. However, the reported outcome for nondisplaced, mid-sagittal fractures of the rst phalanx and condylar fractures of the third metacarpal bone and third metatarsal bone are at least comparable to repair performed under anaesthesia (Payne and Compston 2012). In this case, ceftiofur hydrochloride, a third-generation cephalosporin classi ed as a critically important antimicrobial (World Health Organization 2017), was used to provide prophylactic antibiosis intraoperatively and for 5 days postoperatively. To date, there is no evidence that the risk of surgical site infection is increased with standing surgery, as compared with surgery performed under general anaesthesia, although antimicrobial provision is not detailed in the case series described by Payne and Compston (2012). There is also no evidence that prolonged treatment will reduce surgical site infections in clean surgeries, even when implants are placed (Aiken et al. 2015). The authors believe that a rst-line antimicrobial such as penicillin or oxtetracycline should be used in such cases, thus reserving an important and protected antimicrobial for those cases which satisfy criteria for its use (Bowen 2013). The report by Cill /C19an-Garc /C19a and colleagues provides a valuable example of the emerging versatility of standing bone screw placement in equines. Fracture con guration, temperament of the animal, a surgeon experienced in fracture repair and a competent surgical team are all vital components of successful standing fracture repair. If all these factors are in place, as in this case, this technique offers a valuable treatment option to improve the outcome of treatment of fracture patients.

Before using this product, please consult the product insert, a summary of which follows: Indication: Zimeta (dipyrone injection) is indicated for the control of pyrexia in horses. Dosage and Administration: Always provide the Client Information Sheet with the prescription. Administer Zimeta by intravenous injection, once or twice daily, at 12 hour intervals, for up to three days, at a dosage of 30 mg/kg (13.6 mg/lb). See product insert for complete dosing and administration information. Contraindications: Horses with hypersensitivity to dipyrone should not receive Zimeta. Due to the prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and associated clinical signs of coagulopathy, dipyrone should not be given more frequently than every 12 hours. Warnings: For use in horses only. Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Do not use in any food producing animals, including lactating dairy animals. Human Warnings: Care should be taken to ensure that dipyrone is not accidentally injected into humans as studies have indicated that dipyrone can cause agranulocytosis in humans. Not for use in humans. Keep this and all drugs out of reach of children. In case of accidental exposure, contact a physician immediately. Direct contact with the skin should be avoided. If contact occurs, the skin should be washed immediately with soap and water. As with all injectable drugs causing profound physiological effects, routine precautions should be employed by practitioners when handling and using loaded syringes to prevent accidental self-injection. Precautions: Horses should undergo a thorough history and physical examination before initiation of any NSAID therapy. As a class, NSAIDs may be associated with platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy. Zimeta has been shown to cause prolongation of coagulation parameters in horses. Therefore, horses on Zimeta should be monitored for clinical signs of coagulopathy. Caution should be used in horses at risk for hemorrhage. As a class, NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient. Consider stopping therapy if adverse reactions, such as prolonged inappetence or abnormal feces, could be attributed to gastrointestinal toxicity. Patients at greatest risk for adverse events are those that are dehydrated, on diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached or avoided. Since many NSAIDs possess the potential to produce gastrointestinal ulcerations and/or gastrointestinal perforation, concomitant use of Zimeta with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided. The influence of concomitant drugs that may inhibit the metabolism of Zimeta has not been evaluated. Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy. The safe use of Zimeta in horses less than three years of age, horses used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating mares has not been evaluated. Consider appropriate washout times when switching from one NSAID to another NSAID or a corticosteroid. Adverse Reactions: Adverse reactions reported in a controlled field study of 138 horses of various breeds, ranging in age from 1 to 32 years of age, treated with Zimeta (n=107) or control product (n=31) are summarized in Table 1. The control product was a vehicle control (solution minus dipyrone) with additional ingredients added to maintain masking during administration. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported During the Field Study with Zimeta See Product Insert for complete Adverse Reaction information. Information for Owners or Person Treating Horse: A Client Information Sheet should be provided to the person treating the horse. Treatment administrators and caretakers should be aware of the potential for adverse reactions and the clinical signs associated with NSAID intolerance. Adverse reactions may include colic, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. Serious adverse reactions can occur without warning and, in some situations, result in death. Clients should be advised to discontinue NSAID therapy and contact their veterinarian immediately if any signs of intolerance are observed. Effectiveness: The effectiveness phase was a randomized, masked, controlled, multicenter, field study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Zimeta (dipyrone injection) administered intravenously at 30 mg/kg bodyweight in horses over one year of age with naturally occurring fevers. Enrolled horses had a rectal temperature 102.0\u00b0F. A horse was considered a treatment success if 6 hours following a single dose of study drug administration the rectal temperature decreased 2.0\u00b0F from hour 0, or the temperature decreased to normal (101.0\u00b0F). One hundred and thirty-eight horses received treatment (104 Zimeta and 34 control product) and 137 horses (103 Zimeta and 34 control product) were included in the statistical analysis for effectiveness. At 6 hours post-treatment, the success rate was 74.8% (77/103) of Zimeta treated horses and 20.6% (7/34) of control horses. The results of the field study demonstrate that Zimeta administered at 30 mg/kg intravenously was effective for the control of pyrexia 6 hours following treatment administration. Refer to the Product Insert for complete Effectiveness information.

C. Knottenbelt*, A. H. Watson, J. W. Hotchkiss, S. Chopra\u00a7and A. J. Higgins\u00a7 Weipers Equine Centre, University of Glasgow, UK; andDepartment of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, UK; topical liposome-encapsulated preparation of bleomycin (Bleosome) was studied in 118 clinical cases of equine sarcoid and ef cacy was compared with two other standard conventional treatments, tazarotene and 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) as well as with the Bleosome in combination with each of these two conventional treatments. Treatments were arbitrarily assigned. Fifty-two of the 118 sarcoids (44%) were resolved after 12 months but there were signi cant differences between treatment groups with the combinations of either 5-FU and bleomycin, or tazarotene and bleomycin resulting in signi cantly superior resolution of 77 and 78% of the lesions, respectively. The preliminary results suggest that bleomycin in a liposomal carrier may be a useful treatment modality for super cial, diffuse and verrucose sarcoids. The treatment process was simple, and outcomes were functionally and cosmetically excellent. Liposome-encapsulated bleomycin is economic compared to radiation and other treatment options and can be applied effectively by the owner under guidance. Further studies with different administration protocols and higher concentrations of bleomycin are warranted. Introduction The equine sarcoid is an induced tumour of broblasts closely associated with the bovine papilloma virus 1 and 2 (BPV1/2). Although there is historical evidence of sarcoid dating back millennia, the condition was rst described pathologically by Jackson (1936) who coined the term sarcoid to describe its generally sarcomatous appearance. It is conventionally categorised into six different types according to the clinical features (Knottenbelt 2005) and pathological characteristics (Martens et al. 2000, 2001). The pathological spectrum associated with the equine sarcoid is well recognised and, although there is histological controversy over some individual cases, the broblastic origin of the tumour is widely accepted (Knottenbelt et al. 2015). Many studies con rm that treatment of the equine sarcoid remains challenging and unpredictable with over 40 different treatments described in the literature; this implies that no one treatment is universally effective (Knottenbelt and Kelly 2000). Radiation remains the gold standard treatment for periocular sarcoids and carries an excellent prognosis with good cosmetic and functional outcomes. The procedure is, however, often prohibitively expensive and logistically demanding since very few facilities exist for its delivery to equine patients. Additionally, the medical orsurgical treatment of periocular and facial sarcoid carries signi cant hazards since collateral damage may compromise eyelid and mouth function, respectively, and additionally may damage the subcutaneous nerves of the face (facial and trigeminal branches) (Knottenbelt and Kelly 2000). Most current treatments are either painful (e.g. imiquimod, 5% 5- fluorouracil [5-FU]), or require complex and often costly interventions (e.g. surgery and/or radiation), or carry signi cant systemic risks (e.g. BCG immunotherapy), or may result in functional compromise (e.g. surgery, photodynamic therapy or use of heavy metal and 5-FU ointment (AW5)1). Imiquimod applied every 2 or 3 days for up to 3 months has been reported to bring an improvement in over 60% of verrucose sarcoid lesions (Nogueira et al. 2006). Repeated intralesional in ltration with slow release cisplatin (Theon et al. 1993) has also shown good results but requires considerable logistical input. Horses presented with super cial verrucose or occult sarcoid around the eye have been treated using 5% 5-FU ointment (EfudixTM)2alone and a single 10-day course of twice-daily treatment (Knottenbelt et al. 2015). Likewise, treatment with a retinoid (0.1% tazarotene gel [ZoracTM]3) resulted in high recurrence (60%) and variable outcomes (Knottenbelt et al. 2015). Bleomycin is a water soluble glycopeptide antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces verticillus and has antineoplastic activity against several tumours in humans including squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma and testicular tumours (Scholar 2007). Bleomycin has several unique aspects including its large, metal-binding glycopeptide molecule, its unusual mechanism of action and its very low toxicity to normal (nontumour) cells and to haematopoietic tissues. In contrast to most other antineoplastic agents, it is not associated with myelosuppression or other tissue toxicity (Peedle 2005). Fibroblasts which are de cient in DNA repair are known to be more sensitive to bleomycin compared to normal broblasts (Lazo 2002). Topical trans-cutaneous delivery of bleomycin is challenging because of its inability to penetrate the stratum corneum since its highly polar positively charged molecule compromises penetration into the epidermis. Encapsulation of bleomycin in a liposomal delivery system facilitates skin penetration and has been shown to extend the biological half-life, augment antitumour activity and diminish systemic toxicity (Anthony et al. 2006). In vitro studies revealed that the LD50of encapsulated bleomycin in formulations of ultra- deformable liposomes (Bleosome4) times higher than free bleomycin for human cutaneous keratinocytes (Lau et al. al. 1991; 1998; F \u20acurst 2006). A study of the intralesional use of bleomycin in the treatment of equine sarcoid was carried out by F \u20acurst (2006) who reported some bene t in some cases, but overall the results of treatment were largely disappointing and little further attention has been paid to this compound in equine oncology since that work was published. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vivo efcacy of 0.1% liposomal-encapsulated formulation equine occult and verrucose sarcoids on the face and around the eyes. Materials and methods One hundred and eighteen cases (46 mares, 72 geldings) of a variety of breeds and ages were included in this preliminary study after ful lling the inclusion criteria. The lesions selected for treatment were clinically diagnosed with periocular or facial verrucose or occult sarcoid by the primary author from high resolution photographs submitted for assessment to the primary author by referring veterinarians according to the description by Knottenbelt (2005). Cases were treated with one of ve different treatment protocols ( Table 1 ). Fibroblastic, nodular, mixed and malignant sarcoid tumours and tumours that had previous surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy were not included in the present study. Most lesions did however have small micronodular sarcoid lesions within the verrucose or occult areas and some had verrucous ulceration. Where other tumours were present on a horse, these were left without treatment during the study. A pilot study of approximately 20 cases had suggested that primary treatment with either the retinoid tazarotene or 5% 5-FU ointment prior to application of liposome- encapsulated bleomycin was likely to make the treatment signi cantly more effective. The same pilot study identi ed that a concentration of 0.1% bleomycin was likely to be more efcacious than a 0.05% concentration. The cases involving the use of 5% 5- fluorouracil (EfudixTM)2 and 0.1% tazarotene gel (ZoracTM)3alone were cases that tted the inclusion criteria that had been treated prior to the availability of the bleomycin formulation. Treatments involving combinations of 5% 5- fluorouracil ointment and 0.1% tazarotene gel with Bleosome were arbitrarily assigned to one of the treatment groups in sequence from submissiononce the case had been assessed clinically to ensure inclusion criteria were met ( Table 1 ). Since this was a pilot study only, case numbers were not equalised. A placebo was not used at any point on the basis that the lesions required therapy. Treatment was applied by owners under the strict guidance of their own veterinarians using a treatment advice sheet, which contained advice on handling, use and disposal of the materials. Veterinary follow-up was carried out at strategic points during each protocol and in any case at 14- day intervals. Information regarding the ease of application, pain levels and other practical aspects was reported. The ve protocols can be summarised as: Treatment 1 Topical application of 0.1% tazarotene gel (ZoracTM) to the site every 12 h for 10 days by the owner under instruction from the attending veterinarian. Treatment 2 Topical application of 5% 5- fluorouracil ointment (EfudixTM)t o the site every 12 h for 10 days by the owner under instruction from the attending veterinarian. Treatment 3 Topical application of the 0.1% liposome-encapsulated bleomycin (Bleosome) to the site every 12 h for 40 days by the owner under instruction from the attending veterinarian. Treatment 4 A preliminary topical application of 5% 5-FU ointment (EfudixTM) to the site every 12 h for 10 days. The site was then debrided with a saline-soaked gauze swab to remove all residual cream and crusting on the site. This was then followed by the topical application of the 0.1% liposome- encapsulated bleomycin (Bleosome) to the site every 12 h for 35-60 days. All treatments were applied by the owner under instruction from the attending veterinarian. Treatment 5 A preliminary topical application to the site of tazarotene (ZoracTM) every 12 h for 10 days. Twelve hours after the last tazarotene application, the site was debrided using a saline- soaked gauze swab. This was then followed by the topical application of the 0.1% liposome-encapsulated bleomycin (Bleosome) to the site every 12 h for 35 -60 days.

EVJ Ltd259 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY treatments were applied by the owner under instruction from the attending veterinarian. In the three protocols that used the 0.1% liposome- encapsulated bleomycin preparation, this was applied directly to the treatment site twice daily using a syringe- delivered dose depending on the estimated approximate surface area and estimated depth of the sarcoid changes. The bleomycin preparation was gently massaged into the site using a nitrile gloved nger until no external evidence of the material could be identi ed. Absorption of the total volume was rapid and usually complete within 2 -3 min; few reports of any signi cant 'over flow 'or nonabsorption were made. The total dose of the bleomycin medication was adjusted somewhat empirically (between 0.05 mg/cm2and 0.1 mg/ cm2) according to the extent of the lesion and the estimated depth and area of the sarcoid changes, so that doses overall varied from 0.5 to 1.5 mL per application. No speci c dose rate/cm2or /cm3was calculated simply because of the practical dif culty for such a pilot study. The duration of bleomycin treatment was 35 -40 days in 22 of the cases and 60 days in six cases (see Table 1 ). The overall dose of Bleosome administered to the horses was systemically insigni cant, and since the naturally occurring (BMH), is a highly ef enzyme, no other special precautions relating to faeces or urine disposal were applied apart from the use of protective gloves. Owners and handlers were however advised that nitrile gloves must be worn, and hand washing should be undertaken regularly. No handling of the treatment site was however permitted during the process of treatment apart from the prescribed applications. Owners were asked to comment on the perceived extent of pain or discomfort associated with each of the selected treatments. Natural or expected variations in interpretation were hard to de ne. A successful outcome was de ned as resolution of sarcoid lesions 12 months after treatment cessation. Treatments were compared, pairwise, using 2 92 tables and Pearson Chi Squared test; odds ratios with 95% con dence intervals were also generated. Where cells had an expected count <5, Fisher 's Exact test was also employed. The pain level was simply divided into 'painful and nonpainful 'based on the owner 's report. No attempt was made to quantify the extent of pain since this was a subjective impression by a large number of people who would probably have described thepain differently. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and statistical signi cance was taken as P <0.05. Results Overall, 44% (52/118) of the sarcoids, treated by all ve protocols, were resolved 12 months after treatment cessation. However, there were signi cant differences between treatment groups ( Tables 1 and 2). For sole application of tazarotene and 5-FU, only 17 and 27%, respectively, had resolved by 12 months, whereas the combinations of either 5- FU and Bleosome, or tazarotene and Bleosome, resulted in resolution of 77 and 78% of the lesions, respectively. Combination treatment was signi cantly superior to sole treatments with tazarotene or 5-FU ( Table 2 ) but too few horses were treated with liposome-encapsulated bleomycin alone to reach a meaningful conclusion for that treatment. There was no statistical difference between the two combination treatments. It is important to note that lack of signi cant difference does not equate to equivalence of treatment. All horses treated using tazarotene showed pain and skin exudation, but compliance was improved by rewarding the horse during and after treatment ( Table 1 ). Pain and discomfort were also noted with application of 5-FU. Throughout the duration of treatment with liposome- encapsulated bleomycin, no pain or discomfort, or any overt inflammatory effects, were noted and no apparent systemic effects of the treatment were encountered in any of the horses. Discussion In vitro studies at The London Dermatology Centre encouraged the development of a novel product for the topical treatment of human cutaneous cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma, other skin malignancies and benign papilloma and warts. Blakeway et al. (2011) used liposome-encapsulated bleomycin topically to treat BCC and treatment-resistant warts and verrucae and presented the rst evidence of bleomycin being delivered to the skin using liposomes. Three patients with BCC and two patients with verrucae were treated with the 1 mg/mL preparation once daily administered at night until the lesions had cleared. Evidence was presented showing full response TABLE 2: Pairwise comparison of treatment results at 12 months using the ve protocols Treatment Tazarotene 5% interval), v2, Pearson Chi-Square (two-sided). * One cell has an expected count <5, Fisher 's Exact test (two-sided) also nonsigni cant.

In another study, 0.1% liposome-encapsulated bleomycin was used successfully in named patient studies to treat a variety of skin malignancies including BCC, squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and keratoacanthoma, as well as benign growths such as warts and verrucae (S. Chopra, personal communication). Standard care for these conditions included localised tissue ablation through cryotherapy, chemical ablation or surgical excision, all of which are painful and potentially dis guring, particularly where the lesion occurs on the face. The face is one of the most common locations for BCC and actinic keratosis in people. In over 60 named patient studies, Bleosome gave 100% responses and 97% clearance rates, including patients with large, deep BCC or multiple BCC lesions. The patients treated were un t for, or had refused, surgery due to concerns about physical trauma or facial dis gurement. The topical formulation proved easy to apply, well-tolerated, painless, and cost-effective and resulted in excellent cosmetic outcomes (S. Chopra, unpublished data). These features appeared to suggest that liposome-encapsulated bleomycin would be potentially useful in treating skin malignancies in the veterinary species. In the present series of 118 horses of mixed age and breed, the therapeutic bene t of a novel formulation of topically applied liposome-encapsulated bleomycin (0.1%) in combination with 5-FU or tazarotene was shown to be effective at 12 months in treating 77 and 78%, respectively, of periocular, facial verrucose or occult sarcoids. The success of this twice- daily treatment over a period of up to 60 days indicates it is a potential new approach to the treatment of certain types of sarcoid in the horse. Further studies are underway to examine efcacy of Bleosome in other types of sarcoid tumour and in other therapeutic combinations at other dose rates. The liposome-encapsulated bleomycin was easily applied by horse owners and remarkably free of side effects in the horses. These ndings support preliminary results in human studies. Although the mode of cellular entry has not yet been established, once the bleomycin molecule is inside the tumour cell, it remains there and is rapidly internalised into the nucleus where it interacts with DNA to cause both single- and double- strand damage (Umezawa 1983; Lazo 2002). This effect is due to the chelation of ferrous ions and binding to speci c sequences of double-stranded DNA containing pyrimidine repeats. In the presence of oxygen, the chelated bleomycin generates local high concentrations of hydroxyl radicals that cause signi cant double-strand breaks (D 'Andrea 2008). This makes bleomycin a potentially potent anticancer molecule and, as might be expected, any cells (including cancer cells) with DNA repair de ciencies will be signi cantly more sensitive to the DNA-toxic actions of bleomycin. Single-strand DNA damage can usually be readily repaired but double-strand damage is generally nonrepairable and is presumed to be lethal to cells. These theoretical advantages of bleomycin have, however, been compromised by the fact that the molecule is not internalised rapidly or effectively unless there is a steep concentration gradient between the extracellular and intracellular milieu. Once the molecule is internalised, however, tumour cells appear to selectively retain the bleomycin; the reasons for this are not established but it seems likely that the molecule translocates to the nucleus and interacts directly with the DNA (Lazo 2002).The removal and destruction of bleomycin is mediated by BMH (Stoltze et al. 2000). The normal physiological role of BMH is unknown, and its only identi ed activity is metabolic inactivation of bleomycin. The enzyme is probably well conserved across the species (Kamata et al. 2012) and although nothing is established speci cally for horses, it is a reasonable assumption that it also exists in horses. Its speci c distribution in tissues has, however, yet to be con rmed. Historically, bleomycin has been administered by intravenous, intramuscular intralesional or subcutaneous routes in humans to maximise penetration into tumour cells (Lazo 2002). However, following high systemic doses, there are potentially serious pulmonary side effects reported in humans (Simpson et al. 1998; Lazo 2002). Pulmonary toxicity occurs in about 6 - 8% of human patients when bleomycin is administered systemically in high doses to treat germ cell tumours and Hodgkin 's disease (Simpson et al. 1998). Intralesional use of bleomycin also requires caution with in flammatory reactions reported in humans at the site of injection. Additionally, scarring and onychodystrophy, hypopigmentation, Raynaud 's phenomenon, anaphylaxis and flagellate hyperpigmentation have also been reported rarely (Arpey et al. 2010). High doses by intravenous or intramuscular injection would not normally be considered appropriate for the treatment of cutaneous tumours in horses. Electrochemotherapy using bleomycin has been described in experimental rodent and human oncology (Belehradek et al. 1993) and in treatment of equine sarcoids with cisplatin (Cemazar et al. 2008); this involves enhancing cell permeability by electrical current (electroporation). It is possible that this could also enhance the absorption of bleomycin in horses but no studies have been carried out with this so far. In the present study, the most remarkable features of the use of Bleosome were the complete freedom from discomfort and any overt evidence of in flammatory response in any of the 56 horses treated in this pilot series. This absence of side effects allowed the application to be made easily and without signi cant restraint even on sensitive areas of the skin. Pinnal sarcoid might be a valuable potential target for this approach in view of the severe resentment and behavioural issues that often accompany other forms of treatment such as tazarotene, 5% 5-FU or imiquimod at this site. The treatment of pinnal sarcoids with this material has yet to be explored but it would seem that the least painful method of treatment. The alternative approach is surgery or laser surgery and Bleosome could be a useful adjunctive measure here especially if the margins of excision were declared unsafe. The course of treatment would need then to be adjusted according to the histological ndings in particular with reference to margin safety. Surgical approaches around the eye are highly problematic (Knottenbelt and Kelly 2000) since they are frequently invasive and scarring at this site is liable to compromise eyelid function; adjunctive chemotherapy with Bleosome could be valuable here also. Additionally, there were no apparent harmful effects on normal tissue structures when Bleosome was applied to equine skin. This is also a cardinal feature of liposome- encapsulated bleomycin use in human cutaneous cancer treatment (S. Chopra, personal communication) and the lack of tissue damage to surrounding tissues would be of considerable value in treatment of equine periocular and pinnal sarcoid in particular. The formulation appeared to result in no scarring and tissue destructive effects and \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd261 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY therefore had clinical and practical advantages over other current forms of sarcoid treatment including radiation. The therapeutic value and effects of topical Bleosome following surgery are currently being explored. No remote effects on other lesions on the treated horses were noted. Since this trial was focused on individual lesions around the eye, other sarcoids identi ed at other sites on the large majority of the cases were not treated at the time of the study. The effects of the Bleosome were seemingly entirely local, and this is probably to be expected given the minute doses used here and the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of bleomycin. Bleomycin is probably degraded completely by the naturally occurring BMH enzyme, so there are therefore no signi cant implications for handling of urine, saliva or faeces from horses under treatment. However, sensible precautions to avoid contact are of course always warranted. The overall dose of bleomycin administered topically to a horse is minute in terms of potential systemic side effects and in any case bleomycin has remarkably few unwanted systemic effects in any species including man except in high intravenous doses (Lazo 2002). Unlike most other antineoplastic agents, bleomycin is not associated with myelosuppression or organ toxicity (Peedle 2005). Further studies are currently underway to test a wider range of tumours as well as sarcoids in different anatomic sites including the ear. It does appear that liposome-encapsulated bleomycin has some important advantages over most other topical and local sarcoid treatments. The failure of bleomycin treatment in some of the sarcoid cases could possibly be explained by the naturally occurring endogenous BMH, although studies indicate that there is very little BMH in skin (Abess et al. 2003). In contrast however, a study by Kamata et al. (2012) in humans identi ed that concentrations of the enzyme in skin were in fact very high. This contrary nding may con rm that some individuals have more cutaneous enzyme than others. Kamata et al. (2012) also identi ed that the concentration of BMH in lesional cells was lower than that in abnormal skin cells. Other possibilities for therapeutic failure include insuf cient overall dosage or an excessively fast absorption and redistribution locally, or a lack of suf cient penetration. Bleomycin is water soluble and is rapidly removed by the cutaneous blood supply and may not have had time to penetrate the cell membranes in suf cient amounts for cytotoxic effects. This may lead to the use of higher concentrations of bleomycin in liposomes. The study did suggest that penetration into very dense nodular sarcoid lesions was not effective. Penetration into broblastic sarcoids was not considered here since in this study all treated lesions were verrucose or occult lesions. A subjective comparison of these nodules with nodules removed surgically from previous cases with type A2 and type B2 nodular sarcoids indicated that the Bleosome-treated nodules were much less likely to have signi cant root extensions manifest by 'unsafe surgical margins '. It therefore seems likely that the effects of the bleomycin were positive on the marginal areas of the nodular lesions, but dense nodules were not resolved by the topical application of bleomycin alone. It is possible that absorption of the liposome- encapsulated bleomycin into dense nodules was less ef cient and that either a higher concentration (0.2% or more) of bleomycin and/or more frequent applications may be required to create a steep enough concentration gradient toallow the bleomycin to gain access to the intracellular components of these masses. Further investigation is required to investigate these ndings. Denitive dosage rates for Bleosome are not yet established, but this preparation of liposomal-encapsulated bleomycin was easy to use, free of in flammation, pain-free and well-tolerated. Larger administered dose rates using higher concentrations of the drug would probably not have any extra unwanted side effects, and indeed such steeper concentration gradients might increase the clinical bene t. Applications do require speci c self-protection equipment including the use of nitrile gloves during application. Pharmacokinetic studies show that bleomycin is rapidly degraded since all tissues apart from the skin and lungs produce the degradative enzyme BMH (Abess et al. 2003; Kamata et al. 2102). Following an intramuscular injection in humans, there is a two-phase drug clearance from plasma with a plasma half-life of around 24 min and 2 h for the initial and terminal phases, respectively. In humans and rodents, the inactivated residues are excreted primarily in urine. The action of the BMH results in the formation of a nontoxic and DNA cleavage-incompetent deamido-bleomycin (Lazo 2002). Since the topical application used in this study contained very small overall amounts of the drug, it seems highly unlikely that any signi cant urine or faecal residues would have been present and that there would be no material health and safety issues regarding its use in horses apart from potential contact with the preparation itself. The compounded material might carry a potential risk if inhaled or ingested, although it is not reportedly absorbed at all from the human gut or from the airway. Bleomycin is not at all orally active and in human oncology is therefore administered by intravenous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal/intrapleural injection. The half-life following injection in humans and rodents is reported to be 24 min (Lazo 2002). Open wound contact would seem to be the only risk factor apart from percutaneous absorption. The latter would probably however be rapid and therefore direct skin contact should always be avoided. Since bleomycin requires reduction to be activated, sulphydradryl groups on proteins and peptides are potential reactivators. In humans, tumour lines with increased glutathione concentrations are more sensitive to bleomycin. Further studies are underway to explore the status of equine tumours in this respect. Additionally, almost all experimental and clinical studies indicate that normal cells can repair the bleomycin-induced DNA breaks using intracellular repair mechanisms such as DNA polymerase- b(Lazo 2002; D'Andrea 2008) so this may, in part at least, explain why some individual tumours or tumour types may not respond as well as others. Conclusions Bleomycin in a liposomal carrier can be a useful treatment modality for super cial, diffuse and verrucose sarcoids in horses. The treatment process is easy, and the outcomes are functionally and cosmetically good. Different concentrations and different application protocols (frequency and dose rate) need to be explored. Bleosome is relatively cheap compared to radiation and other treatment options and, with normal caveats, can under guidance be applied effectively by the owners. Further studies are warranted. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd262 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY Authors 'declaration of interests Dr Chopra developed Bleosome and owns the patent.

Synovial fluid was retrieved aseptically from horses presenting to Liphook Equine Hospital either (a) immediately after euthanasia or (b) from those requiring arthrocentesis as part of their clinical investigation. Samples were aliquoted into commercially available (i) plain tubes (0.5 mL; control) and (ii) EDTA tubes (at different volumes to obtain serial dilutions of EDTA:synovial fluid). TP concentration was measured by two independent observers using a calibrated hand-held refractometer. Samples from a separate group of horses were stored for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C and 20\u00b0C before analysis to assess the effects of time and temperature. Results were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. TP concentration was signi cantly higher at all EDTA concentrations compared to control samples, with the greatest effect seen with higher concentrations (P <0.0001 for samples with 3.17 mg EDTA/mL). Storage time or temperature did not signi cantly affect TP concentration. Refractometric measurement of small volumes of synovial fluid in commercially available EDTA tubes leads to arti cially elevated TP concentrations. Delays in sample analysis and alterations in storage conditions did not signi cantly affect TP concentration within the parameters studied. The magnitude of overestimation of synovial total protein concentration could result in misclassi cation of suspect synovial sepsis cases where EDTA tubes are used. Introduction Synovial fluid analysis is an important component in the investigation of diseases of equine synovial structures, particularly the diagnosis of synovial sepsis. Prompt diagnosis facilitates rapid treatment and greatly reduces the likelihood of a poor outcome (Morton 2005). Synovial fluid analysis involves a visual assessment of the colour, turbidity and volume of the sample as well as measurement of the TP concentration, nucleated cell count and cytological assessment. An increase in the TP concentration indicates in flammation, either septic or nonseptic (McIlwraith et al. 2015). The elevation occurs as aresult of the leakage of protein from damaged blood vessels and correlates to the degree of in flammation within the synovial cavity. A synovial fluid TP concentration above 2.5 g/ dL is generally considered abnormal and a concentration above 4 g/dL indicates severe in flammation as recognised in septic arthritis cases (McIlwraith et al. 2015). Hand-held refractometers are widely used in veterinary practice. The use of such devices to estimate the TP concentration of synovial fluid is easy, inexpensive and provides an immediate result. Furthermore, a smaller sample volume is required compared to the gold-standard biuret TP measurement. Hand-held refractometers measure the angle of refraction between air and an aqueous solution. When body fluid samples are analysed refractometrically, the angle of refraction is due to the combined concentration of all the solutes, with protein being the predominant solute (George 2001). Accurate TP concentration estimation relies on the relative consistency of these solutes. The gold-standard method of total protein measurement is the biuret technique and it has been shown that refractometric values for serum TP concentration correlate well with this technique (George and O 'Neill 2001). Although normal synovial fluid does not clot, haemarthrosis, iatrogenic contamination of the sample with blood or an elevated TP concentration may result in the sample clotting. To minimise the detrimental impact of clotting on synovial fluid analysis, the sample is often transferred immediately following synoviocentesis to a tube containing an anticoagulant, most commonly EDTA. In equine practice, it is common that small volumes of synovial fluid are collected via synoviocentesis. The effect of anticoagulant on the analysis of equine synovial fluid has not previously been determined. An excessive EDTA concentration (due to under- lling of standard EDTA collection tubes) has been shown to falsely elevate refractometric measurement of TP concentration in canine and rabbit plasma (Dubin and Hunt 1978). Furthermore, Estepa et al. (2006) demonstrated that the addition of K 3EDTA to equine peritoneal fluid samples elevated the refractometric measurement of the TP concentration in a concentration-dependent manner. Assessment of the impact of EDTA on the refractometric measurement of equine synovial fluid TP concentrations has not been previously reported. The purpose of this study was to determine if EDTA affects the refractometric measurement of TP concentration in a range of equine synovial fluid samples from normal horses \u00a92018 The Authors.

We hypothesised that under- lling EDTA collection tubes with synovial fluid would result in a false elevation of the total protein when measured by refractometry. In addition, the effect of temperature and time on refractometric TP measurement was established. Materials and methods Sample collection Synovial fluid was collected from horses over 1 year of age either subjected to euthanasia for reasons not related to joint disease and that had no evidence of orthopaedic pain on routine orthopaedic assessment or undergoing arthrocentesis as part of a clinical investigation at Liphook Equine Hospital, after obtaining owner consent. Samples from horses that were subjected to euthanasia were collected within 10 min of euthanasia. In clinical cases, arthrocentesis was performed by, or under the direct supervision of, the attending specialist veterinary surgeon (all diplomates of the European College of Veterinary Surgery) and any plain synovial fluid surplus to clinical requirements was used in the study. All synovial samples were collected via standard arthrocentesis approaches by an experienced veterinary surgeon or European College of Veterinary Surgeons diplomate after sterile preparation of the skin. Sample analysis Each refractometric measurement was performed on a hand-held refractometer which was calibrated with distilled water as per the manufacturer 's instructions before and between each reading. To perform the reading, a drop of each aliquot of synovial fluid was placed on the glass plate of the refractometer using a single-use pipette and the illuminator flap was closed. The TP concentration was assessed using the appropriate scale on the refractometer. Two laboratory technicians performed each reading on the same device consecutively and were blinded to each other 's results. Part 1 Twelve synovial fluid samples of at least 2.55 mL each were collected from a total of seven horses. The synovial fluid was split into 6 mL EDTA tubes (BD Vacutainer, Ref 367873)1or 1.3 mL EDTA tubes (Pioneer Veterinary Products, Ref M363)2in 6 aliquots as follows: 1.59 mg/mL (1 mL in 1.3 mL tube), 3.17 mg/ mL (0.5 mL in a 1.3 mL tube), 7.95 mg/mL (0.2 mL in a 1.3 mL tube), 43.2 mg/mL (0.25 mL in 6 mL tube) and 108 mg/mL (0.1 mL in 6 mL tube). In addition, 0.5 mL of fluid was put into a plain uncoated tube (BD Vacutainer, plain tube with silica, Ref: 367837)1as a control. The TP concentration of each aliquot was measured as described under sample analysis. Part 2 An aliquot of 1.5 mL of synovial fluid was collected from 10 joints from a total of ve horses. Each sample was divided into two plain tubes (0.5 mL synovial fluid) and two 6 mL EDTA tubes (0.25 mL synovial fluid). The TP concentration of each aliquot was measured using a hand-held refractometer by two independent observers as described under sample analysis. One plain tube and one EDTA tube were placed in a refrigerator with a constant temperature of 4 \u00b0C and the remaining samples were placed out of direct sunlight in atemperature-controlled room at 20 \u00b0C until analysis. Twenty- four hours after initial reading, the TP concentration of each sample was measured as described above. The samples kept at 4 \u00b0C were left for 15 min to return to room temperature (20\u00b0C) before reading. Statistical analysis Data were assessed for normality with the D 'Agostino and Pearson normality test. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA (with Greenhouse-Geisser correction) with Holm- Sidak 's multiple comparisons was implemented to assess whether TP concentrations differed in the various EDTA dilutions compared to the plain sample. Three-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons was used to assess whether there was an effect of tube type, storage time and storage temperature on TP concentrations. Bland-Altman plots of each EDTA concentration compared to the plain sample were constructed. Bias and agreement limits were calculated along with their 95% con dence intervals. A one-sample ttest was performed to evaluate whether the bias was statistically different to 0. Statistical signi cance was deemed to be P <0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using Graph pad Prism 73. Results All data were normally distributed. Part 1 Measurements of synovial fluid TP concentrations were signi cantly higher in all samples collected into EDTA tubes compared to plain tubes (P <0.046; Fig 1 ). Statistical signi cance was greatest (P <0.0001) for all samples with a concentration of 3.17 mg EDTA/mL synovial fluid (0.5 mL fluid in a 1.3 mL tube) and all samples with higher EDTA concentrations than this ( Tables 1 and 2). Part 2 Total protein concentrations were signi cantly higher in samples collected into EDTA tubes compared to plain tubes (control) at all time and temperature points (P <0.0001). There was no effect of temperature on refractometric TP measurement ( Fig 2 ).

Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd265 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY to distinguish between in flammation and sepsis of a joint. This distinction has important rami cations regarding appropriate treatment for the patient. A linear relationship between synovial fluid TP concentration and survival to hospital discharge has been demonstrated for cases of con rmed synovial sepsis, with higher total protein concentrations associated with a decreased likelihood of survival (Milner et al. 2014). Of all aspects of cytological assessment, TP concentration was found to be an important prognostic indicator, with the optimal cut-off value for predicting survival below 5.5 -6.0 g/dL for preoperative samples and below 5.0 - 5.5 g/dL for post-operative samples.Assessment of the total nucleated cell count and the differential count of white blood cells is also desirable when evaluating clinical cases of suspected synovial in flammation; both septic and nonseptic. This can only be performed on synovial fluid in which an anticoagulant has been added since this prevents cell adhesion. In clinical practice, it is relatively common for only tiny volumes of synovial fluid to be retrieved and the aim is to gather maximal information from these very small volumes. Clinicians habitually decant synovial fluid samples into a single storage tube containing anticoagulant to maximise the chance of full cytological evaluation of the sample. Standard sized EDTA tubes are routinely used in practice, and when small synovial fluid volumes are being obtained, there is a risk of under- lling the tube. Overall, there is a reasonably high chance of inadvertently submitting synovial fluid samples for cytological evaluation with a high EDTA concentration. In this study, adding equine synovial fluid to EDTA arti cially increased the TP concentration when measured with a hand-held refractometer compared to plain synovial fluid. The results of this study demonstrated that the more severe the degree of under- lling (higher synovial fluid EDTA concentrations), the greater the measured TP concentration compared to the control. This overestimation of refractometric TP measurement of synovial fluid samples containing EDTA could potentially influence clinical decision making. The magnitude of arti cial increase in TP concentration with an under- lled standard EDTA tube is enough to resemble a septic sample; lling a large EDTA tube with only 0.25 mL of synovial fluid elevated a true total protein value of 1.6 g/dL to 4.0 g/dL which could be consistent with synovial sepsis. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering a range of factors including the total nucleated cell count and degree of lameness when diagnosing synovial sepsis. In the event that only a small sample volume is obtained from synoviocentesis, there are several techniques that could be implemented to avoid a falsely elevated refractometric TP concentration. The TP concentration could be read on a refractometer immediately following collection from the fluid remaining in the needle hub/syringe, after putting the majority of the sample in an EDTA tube. Alternatively, smaller EDTA tubes (1.3 mL) could be used since a lower volume of synovial fluid is required to suf ciently ll the tube. Furthermore, as this study found that the elevation in TP is concentration-dependent, even if the small tube is not lled completely, the effect on the TP concentration will be reduced. Many equine veterinarians do not have the convenience of an onsite laboratory, necessitating a delay before most synovial fluid samples are analysed. Storage conditions whilst the sample is in the veterinarian 's car or in transit to the laboratory may also be suboptimal. Previous studies have shown that delays in the processing of equine blood samples of up to 72 h have resulted in a signi cant alteration of some common analytes but no alteration of blood proteins (Rendle et al. 2009). When kept at room temperature, whole blood total protein will remain stable for a day, or up to 6 days when plasma/serum is separated (Ban et al. 2002). A recent study by Hughes et al. (2017) examined the effect of storage conditions on equine synovial and mesothelial fluid and found that although total nucleated cell count and neutrophil morphology were affected, TP concentration was not altered.

There was also no signi cant effect of temperature, although only two temperatures were tested (4 and 20 \u00b0C). Further work is required to assess stability of synovial fluid over a wider range of temperatures to fully ascertain the effect of temperature on refractometric TP measurement. Ideally, further aspects of synovial cytological assessment such as total nucleated cell counts could be evaluated because high temperatures could well affect cell morphology and viability. The small number of samples is a limitation in this prospective study. Although the number of samples was sufcient to obtain statistical signi cance, a larger sample size would enable the trends to be studied more closely, particularly with regards to sample storage. It would be most useful for veterinary practitioners if a cut-off EDTA concentration or correction factor could be ascertained. Then, in the event of obtaining an insuf cient volume of synovial fluid, the refractometric TP measurement could be corrected to allow for the higher EDTA concentration in the sample. Including a greater number of diseased joints in the study population would have been useful to determine if the signi cant overestimation of TP concentration was sustained at even higher TP concentrations than tested here. In this study, the control against which EDTA-containing samples were compared was the refractometric measurement of plain synovial fluid. The gold-standard method for measurement of total protein concentration is the biuret method. Unfortunately, this biuret method cannot be applied to synovial samples because their high viscosity prevents their flow through biochemistry analysers. However, previous studies have shown that refractometry correlated well with the biuret method for TP measurement (George and O 'Neill 2001). Furthermore, use of refractometers for protein measurement in ambulatory veterinary practice is commonplace. Therefore, the results of this study will be directly relevant to ambulatory veterinary practitioners including those who may not have access to the biochemistry analysers capable of performing the biuret method. This study found that lling an EDTA tube with a small volume of synovial fluid overestimates the TP concentration when measured with a refractometer. The magnitude of error has the potential to affect therapeutic decisions in clinical cases of septic/nonseptic arthritis. Although a change to sample handling protocols could minimise the in fluence of EDTA on cytological analysis of synovial fluid, the necessity of performing cytology on small volumes of synovial fluid may be inevitable in some circumstances. In such times, the overestimation of TP concentration in samples containing EDTA should be taken into account when interpreting the results of protein analysis of synovial fluid to avoid misclassi cation of in flammatory joint disease and pursuit of inappropriate treatment.

These methods include therapy, haemopuncture, implants. Introduction The word 'acupuncture '(AP) comes from the Latin word 'acus '(needle) and 'pungere '(to puncture/drill). It consists of many techniques aimed at stimulating acupoints to promote healing and maintain homoeostasis of the organism. Stimulation of these points has achieved therapeutic effects, and increased sensitivity to palpation, heat or electrical stimuli can also be used as a diagnostic indication of injury, especially in the musculoskeletal system (Martin and Klide 1997). The philosophical basis of AP in Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM), particularly in the treatment of horses, dates back to the period 475 -221 BC. In the Liang Dynasty (502 -587 AD), Bole Liaoma Jing (Bole 's Equine Therapy Classic) was published. Western civilisation discovered TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) later and has sought to scienti cally explain its mechanisms. Findings from basic medical research that AP stimulation causes release of endorphins, serotonin, enkephalins, c-amino-butyric acid (GABA; a major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain), norepinephrine and dopamine helped to explain the effects of AP in a biomedical and pharmacological basis that was acceptable to the western medical establishment (Lu and Lu 2013). The volume of research and technology has accelerated in the last 50 years, giving rise to techniques such as electroacupuncture (EA) and laser therapy. The objective was to determine effective acupoints (AP points) to diagnose and treat each disease. Effective acupoints may be mapped by two theories: Ancient theory (1), according to Tangjitjaroen et al. (2009), says that certain chronic diseases were treated successfully in horses after an injury at a particular location of the body. Other horses were then treated the same way leading to the deduction that those points had the potential to heal a particular disease. Theory (2), as described by Schoen (2000), uses the transpositional method, viz, the Channels (Meridians) known and established in humans are extrapolated to horses andapplied with consideration of the animal 's anatomy. While there are criticisms of the use of comparative anatomy, where there are compatible anatomical structures (which may sometimes correspond to the classical equine points), such as lumbosacral space, present in both species, one can have clinical response when using those points (Michelotto J/C19unior et al. 2007), suggesting transpositional points have clinical effects. Palpation and conventional clinical examination, together with knowledge of the acupoints, has contributed greatly to the understanding of diagnostic points, which are trigger points mapped leading to what we now know as diagnostic and therapeutic points for various in rmities. They are widely used in the management of diseases that affect the locomotor system (McCormick 1997; Michelotto J /C19unior et al. 2014). A comprehensive study of AP requires a basic knowledge of the Chinese characters for the common clinical patterns and the acupoint names of the main points. It is not enough to know the points by their western alphanumeric codes. At the very least, in their attempts to master AP, western trained clinicians must know the meaning of the Chinese names of the key acupoints. For example, Bai Hui means 100 meetings, which is related to the nerves meeting at the lumbosacral plexus. Also, Ho Hai, also known as GV1, means Lotus flower which grows in the manure and refers to the point location close to the anal sphincter. In contrast with other species, horses show great sensitivity on palpation of acupoints. This makes it possible to perform a 'scan 'of the animal for diagnostic purposes and to localise these reactive points (Ashi Points) more easily relative to other species (Angeli et al. 2007). The main clinical applications of AP in horses are its use to diagnose and treat lameness (Schoen 1993). Together with the name of the acupoint, its anatomical location is very important in its relationship with function. It is postulated that the acupuncture points are mainly located at the junction of two or more muscles, between the fascia and close to peripheral nerve branches and nervous ganglias which are related to the internal organs (Robinson et al. 2007). The points related to the nervous ganglia are mainly those in the back, parallel to the spinal cord (Chapple 2013). Chinese medicine uses complex diagnostic methods, based on a range of information such as changes in the acupoints of one or more Channels, sensitivity at the paravertebral Shu-Association points, the theory of Five elements [Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water], and consideration of both internal and external pathogens. The Five elements theory is an ancient idea of balance to control and stimulate \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd268 doi: 10.1111/eve.12928the internal organs, which is very similar to the idea of hormone feedback positive and negative that is present in the endocrine physiology and glandular/hormonal balance (Fig 1 ). With this concept it is possible to choose what points one must 'stimulate 'in kidney failure to improve kidney function and what points are needed to 'sedate 'in a gastritis case or in a case of muscular pain. Another concept is the internal and external pathogens, which tries to explain and treat the animal when the disease originates from a virus, bacteria or other micro-organisms (external pathogen) or when it comes from hormonal or physiological problems (internal pathogen). In addition, in the TCM, terms such as wind, cold, dampness, heat, re and dryness are considered metaphoric pathogenic factors and are related to the concepts of the western medicine ( Table 1 ). Diagnosis takes into account clinical signs such as pain, appetite, neurological signs, the digestive system, changes in mucus and sense organs. Thus, it is possible to diagnose tendon injuries and ligament, joint, bone and muscle diseases in the limbs (McCormick 1996, 1997, 1998). Acupuncture modulates the body 's homoeostatic mechanisms. When used by experienced practitioners it can help in diagnosis and treatment of many clinical cases in routine practice. AP can bene t any disease, sometimes as a sole/primary treatment, and sometimes as a complement to other therapies. It can reduce the use of medications and can reduce or eliminate drug-related side effects in some cases (Alvarenga et al. 1998). AP use can be simple, cheap and practical in the eld. It is applicable in places that lack medical facilities, for example hurricane-stricken areas, or earthquake-stricken zones. Caution is necessary with the use of equine AP in chronic equine disease. Such cases require a prolonged course of treatment, or continuous treatment, depending on the severity and chronicity of the patient 's condition. Thus, one is advised to monitor the horse for recurrence or worsening of the disease picture and to adopt concurrent conventional treatment, or other supportive therapy, in some cases of chronic disease (Wen 2009). Some studies indicate that AP, combined with correct saddle- t, skilled hoof trimming andspeci c mounting techniques, can improve equine performance in 85 -90% of treated cases (Angeli et al. 2007; Angeli and Luna 2008). After 1 -4 AP sessions, given by procient therapists, horses can recover or exceed their original performance level (Harman 1997; Hielm-Bjorkman et al. 2001). Unfavourable aspects of equine AP include the stress and risk of infection generated by inserting multiple needles or implanting other foreign materials into the animal. However, the risks of invasive methods are minimal to negligible if AP is done by trained clinicians. Many techniques can be used to stimulate the acupoints. These include most commonly AP with dry needles, eletroacupuncture, aquapuncture, moxibustion, laser stimulation, gold implants and acupressure. The duration of each treatment may vary from 5 to 30 min depending on operator preference and the desired treatment plan (Schoen 1993). However, Rogers (2012) reported that the release of muscle spasm/pain can occur relatively quickly, within 10 s, or usually within <5 min. If equine myofascial pain and spasm persists for more than a few minutes after needle insertion, either inappropriate points were used, or that particular horse will not respond to the acupuncture protocol used. The number of treatments required depends on the disease and its severity and chronicity. Acupuncture - dry needling Altman (1997) de ned acupoints as input ports and power output points of an organism. When compared with adjacent skin areas, these points have electrical properties that are distinct and measurable: high conductance, lower resistance, organised eld patterns and electrical potential differences (Chapple 2013). According to Hwang and Egerbacher (2001), acupoints are generally de ned as skin points with spontaneous sensitivity to stimulation, characterised by reduced electrical resistance. Electrical skin resistance does not de ne all acupoints, however. Some studies fail to show lower resistance at acupuncture points which means not all of them can be de ned by this method of 'point location ' (Ahn et al. 2008). HEART AND S.

It means 'hole/cavity/depression '. Many acupoints are located in shallow depressions in muscle or joints and are skin areas with high concentrations of free nerve endings, nerve plexuses, mast cells, lymphatic vessels, arterioles and venules. Acupoint stimulation can induce therapeutic effects in several different ways, including effects on (a) local structures, (b) remote/distant areas, (c) speci c organs and related TCM functions and (d) systemic effects (Silva and Dorsher 2014). (a)Local effects : Points within or adjacent to an affected area in fluence the area, viz, points near the eye in fluence the eye; points near the elbow in fluence the elbow; points near the hoof in fluence the hoof (b)Remote/distant effects : TCM Channel Theory holds that there are 12 main channels, 6 Yin and 6 Yang, each bilateral, with its own speci c set of acupoints: \u00813 Hand Yin channels, relating to the lung, pericardium and heart, begin on the chest and end at the ngers. \u00813 Hand Yang channels, relating to the large intestine, Sanjiao [endocrine-related] and small intestine, begin at the ngers and end at the face. \u00813 Foot Yang channels, relating to the stomach, gallbladder and bladder, begin at the eyes and end at the toes. \u00813 Foot Yin channels relating to the spleen, liver and kidney, begin at the toes/or foot-sole and end at the chest. In addition, there are two midline vessels, governing vessel (GV, Yang) in the dorsal midline and conception vessel (CV, Yin) in the ventral midline. These begin in the perineum and end at the lip area. Traditional Chinese Medicine theory holds that each acupoint on a channel in fluences pathology in, or along the course of, the entire channel, and also in fluences its related organ and the TCM functions of that organ. For example, all points on the liver channel in fluence the course of that channel, but also in fluence the liver organ itself, and its related TCM functions. Another TCM law is that points at oneend of a Channel in fluence disorders at the opposite end of that Channel. For example, the last point of the stomach channel (ST45) may in fluence eye diseases [ST01 is on the orbital rim directly below the pupil]; GV20 (at the highest point of the head) in fluences perineal irritation and prolapse of the anus/vagina/uterus [GV01 is between the anus and coccyx]; and GB34 (between the upper heads of the tibia and bula) in fluences neck pain [GB21 is on the trapezius muscle and GB20 is near the atlas]. The mechanism of point stimulation effect relies on the restoration of the balance between Yin and Yang, which can then be resumed in de ciency or excess patterns of disease. The concept is to balance the points in a way that excess conditions should be suppressed, and de ciency conditions should be toni ed. The ability to determine if the condition is an excess or de ciency, requires Traditional Chinese diagnostic skills which may include tongue, pulse and palpation examinations. Table 2 shows the relationship between the Yin and Yang concept and the environment. It also shows the intersection between Yin and Yang and the disease clinical signs. In TCM, each of the ve main Yin organs (liver, heart, spleen, lung and kidney) in fluences a speci c sense organ and has a speci c pathological emotion/temperament. For example, liver (LV) in fluences the eye/vision and stagnation in the LV Channel, caused by Qi flow obstruction, can manifest as anger/rage/viciousness. The obstruction of Qi can be caused by liver diseases, channel pathway block (trauma, tumours, in flammation) or internal imbalance. Tables 2 and 3 provides a summary of some concepts related to the ve elements according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine. Equine AP is theorised to use these ancient tenets to promote a bene cial clinical effect. For example, the gallbladder governs sinew and movement. Although horses have no physical gallbladder, they have a GB (gallbladder) channel that governs processes and functions that mimic human GB functions. In fact, equine GB34-Yanglingquan, whether transposed from its human location (see above) or placed at its TCVM location (mid-lateral sti fle area, behind the femoral condyle), is a most powerful acupoint for equineTABLE 1: Chinese metaphoric pathogenic factors and its relationship with the western medicine concepts Chinese pathogenic factor Characteristic Western Medicine Association Wind Acute diseases; vestibular and cerebellar syndrome Cold Yin factor, can consume Yang; commonly in winter; impair blood circulation; intense local pain; myositis; disc and paralysis; associated with watery diarrhoea and vomiting; mucosal irritability; affect the high preferentially; strong and super cial pulse;Inflammation; post-operation wounds; all in (pemphigus; lupus); Dryness Dehydration; loss MAY locomotor problems and tendon/myofascial disorders (semimembranosus/semitendinosus, sti fle, lateral thigh, hip, rump, back, mid-lateral line, neck, occipital/ temporomandibular joint and eye pain/spasm). Similarly, LV points, like LV03 (below the distal end of the medial splint bone of the hindlimb), can be used to treat eye diseases (conjunctivitis/photophobia), or behavioural vices of the horses (biters/kickers), especially those with pain or spasm over the last few ribs on the right side, or with icteric mucosae or yellowish sclera (all liver-related signs). (c)Effects on speci c organs and related TCM functions : Each of the 12 main organs has an organ-associated re flex point (back-shu point) on the bladder channel in the medial paravertebral line between vertebrae T8 to S4. Each organ also has an alarm point (Front Mu point) on the abdomen or thorax. These Shu and Mu points are anatomically close to their related organs. Although the transpositional theory located the back-shu points at a speci c vertebral level, the spinal nerve roots do not obey this sequence. The back-shu point for equines should therefore be considered more as a region than as a point, a concept which is supported by other authors (Robinson 2006). Combination of the back-shuand Front Mu points for an organ is a classical point selection to treat disease of that organ (Xie and Preast 2011). (d)Systemic effects : As well as effects listed in (a), (b) and (c) above, some key acupoints, or combinations of points, have marked systemic effects. For example, combination of ST36, LI10/LI11 and GV14 can ease fever. Points like SP10 Sea), or BL17 (Geshu- Diaphragm Shu and In fluential Point for Bleeding) can influence bleeding and other blood diseases. The Chinese characters for acupoint names often give a clue to their therapeutic functions, including treatment of systemic diseases. Points with the Blood (Xue in Chinese) character in their names in fluence blood diseases; those with Yin or Yang characters in their names in fluence Yin (deciency patterns) and Yang (excess patterns) diseases. Those with the characters for Energy (Qi in Chinese), Wind (Feng in Chinese), Water (Shui in Chinese) in their names influence metabolism, movement disorders and vascular disorders in some way. Those with the characters for Cold (Han in Chinese) or Heat (Re in Chinese), in their names can influence systemic diseases involving viral infection signs and fever/infection signs. Some authors state that needle manipulation-twirling and sparrow-pecking (rapid partial insertion and removal) evokes a strong muscle action potential. This in turn depends on the presence, amount and distribution of intrafusal muscle bres present at the point of needle insertion (Yan et al. 1984). The leakage of intracellular potassium to the outside of muscle bres affected by the needle appears to be the main mechanism responsible for the change in the action potential. This can result in a suf cient depolarisation to reach adjacent nerve bres, triggering effects at the site of insertion of the acupuncture needle which ultimately reach the central nervous system (Steiss 2001). The muscle bres respond to the insertion of the needles through changes in the action potential. This re flex phenomenon is related to the intrafusal muscle tissue and to type II motor bres. It remains even after removal of vascular and nerve supply (Kendall 1989). Dry needling is an invasive, treatment used to treat myofascial pain and dysfunction. Needles are inserted into the muscle areas known as trigger points (TPs) to 'release 'or unblock it (Dunning et al. 2014). The TPs are located within a taut band of skeletal muscle and commonly located within a larger muscle group ( Figs 2 and 3). Active TPs are hypersensitive to touch, heat, electricity and needling.

For example, TPs in neck and head muscles can trigger and maintain neck spasm, headache, tinnitus, xerophthalmia (or epiphora), Equine muscle in scapular muscles can trigger and maintain shoulder/neck pain/spasm and/or upper limb ataxia. Dry needling of the TPs can release/inactivate the referred symptoms very quickly (Xie and Preast 2011). An interesting technique for wounds is called 'Circling the Dragon '. A local stimulation with dry needling can be done by the insertion of acupuncture (or ne hypodermic) needles surrounding the wound. This is a classical AP method where the idea is the same or similar to scari cation to improve blood circulation to heal the wound (Parmen et al. 2014). For classical acupuncture, liform needles, 26 -30 gauge, made of stainless steel, are the most commonly used needles (dry needling and EA). These needles have great strength, durability and electrical conductivity. The use of hypodermic needles, 50 -70 mm, 20 -22 gauge, is also ef cacious in cattle and horses (Xie and Preast 2011; Rogers 2012). Hypodermic needles are reported to be quicker and easier to insert than the much thinner liform needles. Acupressure Acupressure may be applied to selected acupoints with strong digital pressure, or pressure applied using wooden massage-sticks, or plastic needle-holders (Scognamillo-Szab /C19o and Bechara 2010; Rogers 2012) in order to avoid the use of dry needle technique. In horses, daily acupressure to selected Diagonal Mirror Points, combined with physical therapy, applied to the pain areas, complements and enhances the clinical outcomes of weekly veterinary AP sessions (Rogers 2012). Electroacupuncture Electroacupuncture (EA) is a method of stimulation of acupoints by passing an electric current through needles inserted into the points. The needles are electro-stimulated with the output power adjusted to the animal 's tolerance.The aim is to gain a more vigorous and prolonged stimulation (Fryet al. 2014). Cachado (2012) states that low frequency/high intensity (below the level of pain but causing muscle contractions) should be used in chronic diseases, since its effect and its duration are cumulative. In contrast, high frequency/low intensity (pleasant vibrational sensation) induces the production of dynorphins, has a short duration, and can be used in acute or surgical pain. According to Xie and Preast (2011), high frequencies are appropriate to drain excess (pain) and low frequencies are used to tonify in de ciency/ disability (rehabilitation). In horses, EA is recommended for musculoskeletal disorders (Xie et al. 1996) and other acute or chronic conditions. It is used to treat chronic pain and to accelerate axonal regrowth in paralysis of peripheral motor nerves (facial, radial, suprascapular and laryngeal paralysis, etc). Prolonged treatment, over 3 -9 months is needed in peripheral paralysis (Sumano et al. 1997). A study using EA to treat equine low back pain noted that pressure-induced pain threshold was signi cantly higher in treated horses (Fry et al. 2014). EA also reduces the session duration as compared with dry needling as an alternative stimulus for pain control (Schweinitz 2014). Electroacupuncture also can be used for surgical analgesia (more correctly termed surgical hypoalgesia). Janssens et al. (1988) reported that AP analgesia works by stimulating large myelinated nerve bres that conduct the stimulus to the spinal cord and higher centres. The ascending pain impulses are blocked by an interaction in which serotonin, endorphins, encephalin, norepinephrine and substance P all play important roles (Sheta et al. 2015).

Bleeding is a common result after trigger point 's manipulation -believed to release stagnation of the channels -small volume bleeding on the coronary band. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd272 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY The practical applications of EA for surgery in animals are limited and require careful surgery with minimal traction on the mesentery. Conventional anaesthetics may be unavailable, or in short supply. That said, surgical EA can be used to great advantage in combination with conventional sedatives and anaesthetic agents (Sheta et al. 2015). Sheta et al. (2015) studied the analgesic effects of EA in surgery in horses and donkeys. They concluded that EA allowed the surgeon to operate without visible signs of pain from, or discomfort to, most animals. In flammatory lesions at the operated sites induced a state of hyperalgesia and decreased the pain threshold. EA regulated this hyperalgesia and reduced the degree of pain. There were no complications during or after surgery. During suturing, a few cases needed in ltration of the incision line with local anaesthetic. Gold implant Gold, silver and the noble metals, have been used to treat various diseases since antiquity (Burmester 2001). Several forms of gold/gold compounds are used therapeutically today, one of which is sodium aurothiomalate (GSTM) (Mangalam et al. 2001). Earlier studies suggested that gold inhibited lysosomal enzymes of phagocytic cells in the inflamed synovial tissue (Persellin and Ziff 1966). Although the mechanism of action of gold ions on the cellular immune response is not yet understood fully, gold ions are known to be powerful inhibitors of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (Vernon-Roberts 1978; Fleming et al. 1996; Hostynek 1997). Gold also has an anti- inflammatory action in rheumatoid joints in human subjects (Sutcliffe et al. 1973; Danscher 2002). Gold ions inhibit antigen processes and inhibit NF-kappa B activation by blocking I-kappa B kinase (IKK) activity, thereby decreasing production of pro-in flammatory cytokines (Yang et al. al. al. 2003). Ben-Yakir (2008) summarised the scienti c basis of gold bead implants. Gold is biocompatible and extremely resistant to corrosion. In living tissue, gold releases positively charged ions, such as aurocianide Au(CN)2/C0. The negative charge is neutralised by Au3+that binds with thiolate and thioether ligands on protein, neutralising the negative charge. The Au (CN)2/C0action is to destroy the in flammatory cells around the joint that are contributing to joint in flammation (Lie et al. 2011). The use of gold implants to treat canine hip dysplasia has been reported. One-time implantation of gold has been demonstrated to replace multiple AP sessions (Durkes 1992; Jaeger et al. 2006). The technique has been improved and is used widely to treat hip dysplasia (Klitsgaard 1995; Hielm- Bjorkman et al. 2001). Currently, apart from its use in hip dysplasia, gold implantation at relevant acupoints is used to treat many other canine/feline diseases, including injury, degenerative myelopathy, wobbler syndrome), osteochondritis, spinal problems (intervertebral disc disease, spondylosis), results of trauma (chronic injuries, lick granulomas, nonhealing fractures) and other chronic conditions in animals (Durkes 1999; Rogers 2009; Xie and Preast 2011).The rst report of gold implantation in horses was conducted to reduce granulation tissue in skin lacerations (Frauenfelder 2008). That study reported that the use of gold implants displayed ef cacy in wound healing. Furthermore, the gold implants avoided exuberant granulation tissue formation and decreased brosis. Gold has anti-in flammatory and immunomodulating effects with no systemic or local adverse effects (M \u20acarki et al. 2018). In Brazil the use of gold implants in orthopaedic cases has been reported to achieve clinical improvement in up to 70% of equine cases treated (Joaquim et al. 2012). The success of gold implants in animal diseases has led to its use in human dentistry, surgery and medicine (Demann et al. 2005; Yun and Lee 2016). By 2008, more than 30,000 people in Europe alone had gold implants for various chronic diseases (Rogers 2009; Li and Pei 2015). Gold wire/bead implantation is a surgical procedure, in which gold fragments (24-carat jeweller 's gold wire, circa 2 -3 mm long and 1 mm in diameter), is the most used material, but special gold beads are also used and inserted into acupoints. The implants are approximately 2 -3 mm long and are made with a wire of 0.95 -1 mm diameter, wound to form a compact spiral, with no protrusions or sharp edges (Behrstock and Petrakis 1974) in order to hinder the migration of the implant. Each fragment is implanted with the aid of syringe tted and attached to a hypodermic needle 18 gauge (1.2 mm). It is a low-cost, convenient and fast procedure. When performed aseptically under sedation by pro cient clinicians, it gives no discomfort to the animal and requires no exercise restraint. Post-operative complications are rare but allergic reactions can occur due to the impurity of the gold implant, resulting in a local in flammatory reaction (Hielm-Bjorkman et al. 2001; Nunes et al. 2007). Moxibustion This technique is often used to treat chronic arthritis and musculoskeletal disease in TCVM (Kim et al. 2012) and TCM. It is a safe technique that can be taught to animal owners if necessary (Xie and Preast 2011). However, moxibustion poses a re-risk if glowing moxa should fall on flammable material. Therefore, cases should be treated on concrete in an area protected from wind/draughts. Small animals can be treated in the clinic while standing or lying on a non- flammable surface. Indirect moxibustion with a burning cigar of Artemisia sinensis and/or A. vulgaris is most often used (Scognamillo- and Bechara 2010). When burning moxa on equine Shu-Back Points, some vets wet the areas with water and apply a thin slice of fresh ginger, or a 5 mm layer of common salt, on which a 1 cm ball of moxa punk is placed and ignited. Direct moxibustion applies burning moxa directly on the selected acupoints. The moxa cigar is broken into 1 -2c m cylinders or rubbed into 'moxa snakes 'or rice-sized pellets. These are placed directly on a thin layer of gel ( Aloe vera ) (Fig 4 ) that is rubbed on the skin over the selected acupoints. Needle Moxa uses AP needles inserted into selected acupoints, especially on the back. A moxa cigar is broken into 1 -2 cm cylinders that are pushed rmly onto the handle of each needle. Before ignition, a special ash-guard, or a layer of aluminium foil, is placed underneath the moxa to prevent glowing ash from falling on the skin. The burning moxa transmits heat to the tissues via the needle. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd273 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY According to Xie and Preast (2011), whether moxibustion is applied indirectly, directly or by Needle-Moxa, heat from burning moxa warms Qi and blood inside the Channels. Thus, it increases Qi flow and warms the channels in cases of stasis, moves Qi and eliminates the internal cold and damp, as well as some forms of local toxic heat. One should avoid moxibustion in pregnant cases and near sensitive areas, such as near mucosal surfaces/large blood vessels or sensory organs, especially the eyes and nose. Recently some studies showed that analgesic effects of moxabustion could be explained by opioid release theory (Uryu et al. 2007). It can also help control renal failure by blocking sympathetic nerve action or controlling blood pressure (Paterno et al. 2012). Laser therapy Laser therapy refers to the use of apparatus containing compounds of diode or helium laser emission at low power (5-500 mW), operating at 630 -904 nm for stimulating acupoints (Xie and Preast 2011). It has anti-in flammatory and analgesic properties, and promotes wound healing. This modality is likely highly effective for treating of super cial AP points in the areas of thin integument. It is a painless and noninvasive technique. It is limited to treating larger areas (large animals) and takes up more time in application which may be disadvantageous for agitated cases. P /C19erez-Samart /C19n (2016) de nes numerous biological effects attributed to laser therapy and stimulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain, increasing ATP synthesis, increased synthesis of reactive oxygen species and improvement in the state of the nervous tissue, muscle and joint. These effects are due to energy absorbed by the materials that energy passes through and not the energy lost as heat. Laser therapy is a technique widely used in cases with low tolerance to needle insertions (Scognamillo-Szab /C19o and Bechara 2010). Other advantages include low risk of infection and may be ideal for cases afraid of needles. However, the objective evaluation of laser AP ef cacy is dif cult because the depth of action for the laser energy, probably an important determinant of effectiveness, is governed not only by these parameters, but also by the properties of the skin,such as thickness, age and pigmentation -factors that have also received little consideration in laser acupuncture. Aquapuncture Aquapuncture or injection-AP is a method wherein vitamin B1 or other solutions are injected within a certain acupoint (Xie et al. 1996; Luna et al. 2008). This method is useful in animals that do not tolerate the continued insertion of needles, as an adjunct to dry needling (Scognamillo-Szab /C19oet al. 2008) or in agitated casess. Furthermore, the AP needles are more dif cult to insert and take longer; horses have a very strong skin re flex contraction, which makes it dif cult to keep the needle in certain acupoints making the method an advantage. However hypodermic needles have some disadvantages: they are hollow and thick, their introduction is more painful, and needling is more likely to cause bleeding and laceration. They are less resistant to twisting and when they bend, there is greater risk of breakage (Cachado 2012). AP-injection has also been studied to treat dairy cattle with reproductive disorders and horses with lameness and back pain. Acupuncture can also be used to inject medication or vaccines for immunisation to obtain the added bene to f stimulating acupoints besides the drug effect of the medicine used in the point (P /C19erez-Samart /C19n 2016). Haemotherapy at acupoints Injection of autologous blood (viz, blood from the animal itself) became common in autoimmune or in flammatory disorders. Blood is drawn from a larger vessel (jugular, cephalic vein) and injected into selected acupoints (Xie and Preast 2011). It is also important to distinguish haemotherapy from haemopuncture that means blood drainage from an acupuncture point with a needle (Hackett et al. 1997). Haemopuncture is used to extract venous blood (Xie et al. 1996). It is indicated only for speci c acupoints over veins in situations of blood Stasis, blood heat and imbalance by excess heat in a robust animal (Xie and Preast 2011) (Fig 5 ). For example, one can let 20 -50 mL blood flow from acupoints on engorged digital veins in acute laminitis. Another method extracts jugular blood, which is injected immediately intramuscularly (5 mL per point) at speci c acupoints, viz, BL23, BL26, Baihui technique is also named autohaemotherapy. Pharmacopuncture This is the injection into selected acupoints of drugs (antibiotics, sex-hormones, steroids) at doses of 25 -50% of usual doses. This has been successful in some diseases. Chinese authors claimed that this technique increases the mechanical stimulus period and produces effects similar to conventional doses (Luna et al. 2008). In large animals, pharmacopuncture can reduce the undesirable side effects of medications and reduce treatment costs (lower doses). It is a good option for AP in large animals, since it requires a short period of restraint and uses common material such as hypodermic needles (Luna et al. 2008). In a study by Godoy et al. (2014) based on the hypothesis that stimulation of acupoints can reduce the stress induced by transport, this study compared the effects of Fig 4: Applied moxibustion technique to accelerate wound healing. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd274 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY aquapuncture (saline injection) in GV01 and acepromazine. Decrease in heart rate (HR) was seen, suggesting a possible autonomic effect. However, it was not able to change other variables such as transport-induced increases in cortisol, body temperature and respiration rate. Moreover, acepromazine sedation produced a signi cant reduction in respiratory rate of horses during transport without changing the stress-induced increase in cortisol. Its use in horses during transport should be considered with caution because it did not prevent the deleterious effects of stress and can cause respiratory depression. Cupping therapy This involves the use of special suction cups to apply a vacuum to the skin over selected acupoints. There are three main forms of cupping: (a) Fire Cupping; (b) Vacuum Cupping; (c) Sliding Cupping. In all cases, massaging the target areas with a lubricant oil or with stimulant massage creams, gives better cup-adhesion and enhances the outcome of cupping. The cups are removed when the skin turns deep red or purple (Michalsen et al. 2009). If a cup loses suction before the desired time, it can be removed and reapplied as in (a) or (b) below. The main use of cupping therapy is pain (Ullah et al. 2007). (a) Fire Cupping : This is the Traditional method. A cotton swab, soaked in pure ethanol/methylated spirits, is lit and plunged into an inverted glass suction cup. The flame consumes the oxygen within the cup immediately. After 2 s, the cup is pressed onto the skin, creating an immediate vacuum. The skin and underlying tissue is pulled into the suction cup. (b) Vacuum Cupping : This is a modern and more convenient method that eliminates re-hazards. It uses special PVC cups, each tted with an air-valve. Each cup is pressed onto the skin and evacuated in seconds using a detachable hand-pump. (c) Sliding Cupping : This is a very effective method in human subjects but not easy to use in shaggy-haired animals. Before cupping, the target area is massaged liberally with a lubricant oil or stimulant massage cream. The cups are applied as in (a) or (b) above and allowed toact until the skin turns deep red or purple. Then, all cups are removed, except two. The remaining two cups are slid longitudinally and laterally in a slow rhythmical movement to give the area a relaxing and stimulating massage for a few minutes before removal. Cupping can be used in ne-coated horses if a vegetable oil is smeared liberally over the area before the vacuum is applied. It is not easy to judge the degree of hyperaemia in the vacuumed skin in dark-haired skin/dark-coloured animals. Clinical uses in horses include muscle pain/spasm, back pain, respiratory and reproductive disorders. Conclusion The techniques used in acupuncture to diagnose, treat and prevent equine diseases use the endogenous/homoeostatic mechanisms of the case to induce 'self-healing '. Acupuncture can be considered complementary and integrative in an equine clinical practice setting. However, further studies are necessary to ascertain the ef cacy and safety of currently applied TCM techniques in equine clinical practice.

Aspiration of gastric contents by horses under general anaesthesia for colic surgery is an important anaesthetic complication and was discussed in a meaningful manner in a recent report (Monticelli and Adami 2019) and in the accompanying Clinical Commentary (Bennell and Senior 2019). As I understand it, the title of the paper uses the term 'aspiration pneumonitis 'as distinct from 'aspiration pneumonia 'because the latter would imply a septic process (Monticelli and Adami 2019). By contrast, pneumonitis would be an immediate in flammatory response induced most likely by acid gastric contents and other caustic agents in the stomach contents. This distinction is supported on page 186, second paragraph, by the claim that 'the gastric content of mammalians is usually regarded as sterile '(Monticelli and Adami 2019). There is no reference provided to support this statement, which seems to contradict what we do know about the bacterial population in the equine stomach and the intense bacterial fermentation in that site (Argenzio et al . 1974; Kern et al . 1974; Al Jassim and Andrews 2009). The stomach of the horse contains a rich and diverse population of bacteria (Perkins et al . 2012; Costa et al . 2015) that might nd a somewhat supportive environment in the gastric fundus (Argenzio et al . 1974; Kern et al . 1974) and even under conditions that cause gastroduodenal re flux, as in the horse with some forms of colic (Merritt 2003). My concern does not change the aims of the manuscript, which is to describe an important anaesthetic complication, its prevention, recognition and immediate management. However, the belief that material aspirated by anaesthetised horses could be sterile, with some contamination by a nasogastric tube, could lead to some misdirection in managing a probable septic pulmonary process superimposed on the early chemical injury.D.

NADA #141-268 Approved by FDA DESCRIPTION Diclazuril, (\u00b1)-2,6-dichloro- -(4-chlorophenyl)-4-(4,5-dihydro-3,5-dioxo-1,2,4- triazin-2(3 H)-yl)benzeneacetonitrile, has a molecular formula of C17H9CI3N4O2, a molecular weight of 407.64, and a molecular structure as follows: Diclazuril is an anticoccidial (antiprotozoal) compound with genera of the phylum Apicomplexa. PROTAZIL\u00ae (diclazuril) is supplied as oral pellets containing 1.56% diclazuril to be mixed as a top-dress in feed. Inert ingredients include dehydrated alfalfa meal, wheat middlings, cane molasses and propionic acid (preservative). INDICATIONS PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) caused by Sarcocystis neurona AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage : PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) is administered as a top dress in the horse's daily grain ration at a rate of 1 mg diclazuril per kg (0.45 mg diclazuril/lb) of body weight for 28 days. The quantity of PROTAZIL\u00ae necessary to deliver this dose is 64 mg pellets per kg (29 mg pellets/lb) of body weight. Administration : To achieve this dose, weigh the horse (or use a weigh tape)). Scoop up PROTAZIL\u00ae to the level (cup mark) corresponding to the dose for the horse's body weight using the following chart:Weight Range of Horse (lb)mLs of Pellets Weight Range of Horse (lb) mLs of Pellets 275 - 524 20 1275 - 1524 60 525 - 774 30 1525 - 1774 70 775 - 1024 40 1775 - 2074 80 1025 - 1274 50 - - One 2.4-lb bucket of PROTAZIL\u00ae will treat one 1274-lb horse for 28 days. One 10-lb bucket of PROTAZIL\u00ae will treat five 1100-lb horses for 28 days. CONTRAINDICATIONS Use of PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets is contraindicated in horses with known hypersensitivity to diclazuril. WARNINGS For use in horses only. Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Not for human use. Keep out of reach of children. PRECAUTIONS The safe use of PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets in horses used for breeding purposes, during pregnancy, or in lactating mares has not been evaluated. The safety of PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets with concomitant therapies in horses has not been evaluated. ADVERSE REACTIONS There were no adverse effects noted in the field study which could be ascribed to diclazuril. To report suspected adverse reactions, to obtain a MSDS, or for technical assistance call 1-800-224-5318 . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The effectiveness of diclazuril in inhibiting merozoite production of Sarcocystis neurona and S. falcatula in bovine turbinate cell cultures was studied by Lindsay and Dubey (2000).1 Diclazuril inhibited merozoite production by more than 80% in cultures of S. neurona or S. falcatula treated with 0.1 ng/mL diclazuril and greater than 95% inhibition of merozoite production (IC95) was observed when infected cultures were treated with 1.0 ng/mL diclazuril. The clinical relevance of the in vitro cell culture data has not been determined. PHARMACOKINETICS IN THE HORSE The oral bioavailability of diclazuril from the PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets at a 5 mg/kg dose rate is approximately 5%. Related diclazuril concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) range between 1% and 5% of the concentrations observed in the plasma. Nevertheless, based upon equine pilot study data, CSF concentrations are expected to substantially exceed the in vitro IC95 estimates for merozoite production (Dirikolu et al., 1999)2. Due to its long terminal elimination half-life in horses (approximately 43-65 hours), diclazuril accumulation occurs with once-daily dosing. Corresponding steady state blood levels are achieved by approximately Day 10 of administration. EFFECTIVENESS Two hundred and fourteen mares, stallions, and geldings of various breeds, ranging in age from 9.6 months to 30 years, were enrolled in a multi-center field study. All horses were confirmed EPM-positive based on the results of clinical examinations and laboratory testing, including CSF Western Blot analyses. Horses were administered PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets at doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg diclazuril/kg body weight as a top-dress on their daily grain ration for 28 days. The horses were then evaluated for clinical changes via a modified Mayhew neurological scale on Day 48 as follows: 0. Normal, neurological deficits not detected. 1. Neurological deficits may be detectable at normal gaits; signs exacerbated with manipulative procedures (e.g., backing, turning in tight circles, walking with head elevation, truncal swaying, etc.). 2. Neurological deficit obvious at normal gaits or posture; signs exacerbated with manipulative procedures. 3. Neurological deficit very prominent at normal gaits: horses give the impression they may fall (but do not) and buckle or fall with manipulative procedures. 4. Neurological deficit is profound at normal gait: horse frequently stumbles or trips and may fall at normal gaits or when manipulative procedures were utilized. 5. Horse is recumbent, unable to rise. Each horse's response to treatment was compared to its pre-treatment values. Successful response to treatment was defined as clinical improvement of at least one grade by Day 48 \u00b1 conversion of CSF to Western Blot-negative status for S. neurona or achievement of Western Blot- negative CSF status without improvement of 1 ataxia grade. Forty-two horses were initially evaluated for effectiveness and 214 horses were evaluated for safety. Clinical condition was evaluated by the clinical investigator's subjective scoring and then corroborated by evaluation of the neurological examination videotapes by a masked panel of three equine veterinarians. Although 42 horses were evaluated for clinical effectiveness, corroboration of clinical effectiveness via videotape evaluation was not possible for one horse due to missing neurologic examination videotapes. Therefore, this horse was not included in the success rate calculation. Based on the numbers of horses that seroconverted to negative Western Blot status, and the numbers of horses classified as successes by the clinical investigators, 28 of 42 horses (67%) at 1 mg/kg were considered successes. With regard to independent expert masked videotape assessments, 10 of 24 horses (42%) at 1 mg/kg were considered successes. There was no clinical difference in effectiveness among the 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg treatment group results. Adverse events were reported for two of the 214 horses evaluated for safety. In the first case, a horse was enrolled showing severe neurologic signs. Within 24 hours of dosing, the horse was recumbent, biting, and exhibiting signs of dementia. The horse died, and no cause of death was determined. In the second case, the horse began walking stiffly approximately 13 days after the start of dosing. The referring veterinarian reported that the horse had been fed grass clippings and possibly had laminitis.ANIMAL SAFETY PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets were administered to 30 horses (15 males and 15 females, ranging from 5 to 9 months of age) in a target animal safety study. Five groups of 6 horses each (3 males and 3 females) received 0, 5 (5X), 15 (15X), 25 (25X) or 50 (50X) mg diclazuril/kg (2.27mg/lb) body weight/ day for 42 consecutive days as a top-dress on the grain ration of the horse. The variables measured during the study included: clinical and physical observations, body weights, food and water consumption, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, fecal analysis, necropsy, organ weights, gross and histopathologic examinations. The safety of diclazuril top-dress administered to horses at 1 mg/kg once daily cannot be determined based solely on this study because of the lack of an adequate control group (control horses tested positive for the test drug in plasma and CSF). However, possible findings associated with the drug were limited to elevations in BUN, creatinine, and SDH and less than anticipated weight gain. Definitive test article-related effects were decreased grain/top-dress consumption in horses in the 50 mg/kg group. In a second target animal safety study, PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets were administered to 24 horses (12 males and 12 females, ranging from 2 to 8 years of age). Three groups of 4 horses/sex/group received 0, 1, or 5 mg diclazuril/kg body weight/day for 42 days as a top-dress on the grain ration of the horse. The variables measured during the study included physical examinations, body weights, food and water consumption, hematology, and serum chemistry. There were no test article-related findings seen during the study. STORAGE INFORMATION Store between 15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F).

Educational Partners Media PartnersCorrespondence Response to: 'Are gastric contents usually regarded as sterile? ' We apologise for the potentially misleading information in our article 'Aspiration pneumonitis (Mendelson 's syndrome) as perianaesthetic complication occurring in two horses: A case report '(Monticelli and Adami 2019) and we would like to use this opportunity for a further discussion. In human beings, the gastric content is regarded as sterile owing to the presence of gastric acids and therefore low pH that, under normal conditions, prevent the bacterial growth (Marik 2001). Similar considerations apply for carnivores (Beasley et al . 2015) and even for small monogastric herbivores such as rabbits, whose gastric pH ranges between 1 and 1.9 (Fann and O 'Rourke 2001). However, as Dr Freeman pointed out, in horses the pH of the gastric content ranges between 5.4 and 1.8 depending on the anatomical region (Al Jassim and Andrews 2009; Freeman 2020) and may therefore be considerably less acidic than in other species; as a result, it is reasonable to assume that the equine gastric content is not necessarily sterile as bacterial growth is possible in it. In support of this last statement, it is worth mentioning that bacterial infections of the respiratory system secondary to the aspiration of large volumes of gastric content with pH higher than 2.5 have been reported in human patients (DiBardino and Wunderink 2015). Another concern raised by Dr Freeman was whether, after aspiration of gastric content, the antimicrobial therapy should be initiated regardless of the absence of evidence of bacterial colonisation of the lower airways. Differentiating between aspiration pneumonitis and bacterial pneumonia remains a challenge in both humans and veterinary patients (Nafe et al . 2018). Indeed, in flammation and lung injury caused by the acidic gastric content have the potential to dramatically alter alveolar integrity and function even in the absence of bacteria (Marik 2001); in this scenario, the use of antimicrobials is regarded as debatable in humans (Raghavendran et al . 2011). Nevertheless, these authors agree with Dr Freeman that broad-spectrum antimicrobialsshould be given to equine patients in which aspiration has been observed or strongly suspected, as it was the case for the second horse of the report object of discussion (Monticelli and Adami 2019).
