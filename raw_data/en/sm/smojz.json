Please note: If your project is for a class, you must first check with your profess or first to see if he/she will approve the use of an alternative. If your professor approves your request, we recommend using one of the video -sharing sites below. Each site is free, and allow s you to upload and share videos online. They differ in their ability to capture certain things, so your choice should depend on the requirements of your assignment and the goals of your presentation: YouTube is a video -sharing website that allows you to re cord, upload, share and view videos.
