Thousands of acclaimed physicians. 1 4 6 9 1 0 1 2 1 3 1 4 Enhancing Precision In Cataract Surgery Hartford Hospital's Eye Surgery Center was the first facility in the state with new laser technology that makes cataract surgery more precise and predictable than ever. If you don't have a cataract, chances are you know someone who does. Cataracts \u2014 a clouding of the eye's lens that results in decreased vision \u2014 are fairly common, with most people developing them with age. Fortunately, surgery to remove the cataract can usually return vision to normal. At Hartford Hospital's Eye Surgery Center in Newington, Conn., ophthalmologists are now using innovative laser technology on select patients to perform the most exacting steps in cataract surgery with unprecedented precision \u2014 and without using a scalpel. The center acquired the AlconLenSx Laser system in December 2012. Center administrator Dwayne Kertanis says that ophthalmologists at the center performed 1,700 laser-assisted cataract surgerie s in the first nine months of use. Mr. Kertanis notes that, according to the laser's manufacturer, the center was the first in New England to use the laser and that it also performs the largest volume of laser-assisted cataract surgeries in the Northeast. Leading-Edge Technology The laser's sophisticated capabilities allow surgeons to use three-dimensional imaging to customize surgery to each patient's unique eye measurements and contours. Surgeons then preprogram the laser to perform key steps in the surgical process. Lasers are used in many areas of medicine, and have been used in ophthalmology for LASIK surgery and other procedures. \"This is really the first time it's being applied to cataract surgery,\" says Raji Mulukutla, MD, an ophthalmologist in Hartford Hospital's Winter 2014 12ROUNDS ophthalmology department. Dr. Mulukutla notes that cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgical procedure in the United States today. It involves opening the lens capsule, removing the patient's own lens and the catarac t material, and inserting a fabricated intraocular lens. The laser , Dr. Mulukutla says, \"turns cataract surgery into a bladeless operation and gives us a great deal of precision in making the opening in the capsule and removing the contents.\" Martin Seremet, MD, of the hospital's ophthalmology department, also operates at the center. He says the laser can be particularly helpful in correcting some mild to moderate cases of astigmatism during cataract surgery. Astigmatism occurs when the cornea \u2014 the outer portion of the eye \u2014 develops an irregular shape that causes blurred vision. Surgeons can make small incisions in the cornea by hand to correct the astigmatism. \"But those incisions are not as reproducible. They depend on the surgeon's skill and control,\" says Dr. Seremet. \"The laser can provide extremely reproducible incisions.\" Steps In Surgery In conventional cataract surgery, the surgeon first uses a hand-held scalpel to make an incision in the cornea and gain access to the cataract. In laser-assisted surgery, the laser, preprogrammed for the patient's unique eye configuration, makes the incisions with superior precision. The next step is to create a circular opening in the capsule , which is a membrane covering the lens. This is one of the most crucial steps in the process because it affects the ultimate positioning of the lens implant. In the standard approach, the surgeon uses a hand-held instrument to make the circular opening. In laser-assisted surgery, the laser is used to create the opening, based on the exact presurgical measurements. \"We think that being able to make that opening so perfectly round and centered using the laser will greatly improve placement of the intraocular lens,\" Dr. Mulukutla says. \"This becomes particularly important when we're using advanced-technology intraocular lenses that are either multifocal or designed to correct astigmatism.\" Once the opening is made, the surgeon removes the cataract material. This is done using a machine that employs ultrasonic energy to break up and remove the cataract. Here, too, the laser is helpful. It divides the cataract into multiple, small segments, so it can be removed with approximately 43 percent less ultrasonic energy. This is beneficial, Dr. Mulukutla points out, because \"the more energy you use, the more damage you can potentially do to the inner aspects of the eye, particularly the cornea.\" Less ultrasonic energy, she says, \"is less traumatic, so healing is quicker, with a smoother postoperative course.\" The entire procedure takes from seven to 20 minutes, depending on the individual cataract and eye, with the laser operating for about 30 seconds. Dr. Mulukutla says patients tell her the experienc e is amazing \u2014 very high-tech, with a lot of lights seen from the patient's perspective. Plus, she says, \"Patients love the fact that I am not using an actual scalpel.\" The center's outcomes from laser-assisted surgery have been excellent, she says. \"We have great results and no complications with the use of the laser.\" Skill And Experience Ophthalmologists who practice at the center have had extensive classroom and hands-on training in use of the laser, and each performed multiple cases under expert supervision before operating independently. Dr. Mulukutla estimates that she alone has performed more than 200 laser-assisted surgeries since January 2013. Hartford Hospital's Eye Surgery Center, founded in 1998, performs more than 8,400 surgeries a year, the vast majority of them cataracts. The addition of the advanced laser further distinguishes the center. \"The fact that Hartford Hospital invested in this technology puts us at the forefront, with cutting-edge technology many cataract surgeons don't have access to,\" Dr. Mulukutla says. She points out that more than 40 ophthalmologists from multiple private practices through - out central Connecti- cut choose to perform their surgeries at Hartford Hospital's Eye Surgery Center. \"We all use this facil- ity for surgery because we all believe it is the best possible place we can take our patients,\" she says. To obtain information about physicians practicing at Hartford Hospital's Eye Surgery Center, call Hartford Hospital's Physicia n Referral A Brand-New Man!\" Cassimer McDonald, 69, was diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes 20 years ago, and he wore eyeglasses for decades to correct his astigmatism, a condition that causes blurred vision. By fall 2013, though, McDonald's cataracts had grown markedly worse. \"My vision was becoming cloudy,\" McDonald says. \"I could not see things at a distance, and I had trouble reading.\" McDonald's local eye care provider referred him to Martin Seremet, MD, for laser-assisted surgery at Hartford Hospital's Eye Surgery Center in Newing - ton. McDonald had surgery on his right eye in October and returned to have his left eye done in December. \"When they finished the first one, I thought they were still prepping me for the operation, because it was so quick,\" McDonald says. \"There were no stitches, and I didn't have to take any painkillers. It was all so precise and so perfect.\" In addition to using the laser to treat the cataracts, Dr. Seremet used it to reduce McDonald's astigmatism. Based on cus - tomized measurements the laser makes possible, he preprogrammed the device to make precise \"arcuate\" \u2014 or curved \u2014 in - cisions of an exact length in predetermined locations in the cornea. By restoring the cornea to a more rounded shape, such incisions nearly eliminate astigmatism. Although he will probably need glasses for reading, McDonald is enjoying his near-perfect vision. \"When I take off the glasses, I can see everything perfectly, like when I was 20 years of age,\" McDonald says. \"I'm a brand-new man!\" Just as important, McDonald has high praise for Seremet and for the Eye Surgery Center staff. \"The people in Newington were so nice,\" he says. \"From the moment you step into that place until you leave, they are nothing but love. The way they treated me was excellent.\" Hartford Hospital Eye Surgery Center, Newington Hartford HealthCare's (HHC's) plan to bring a consistent and elevated standard of care to patients across the system is taking a significant step with the newly established Hartford HealthCare Cancer Institute's charter membership in the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Alliance. The unprecedented partnership, first announced in September, means that \"HHC and MSK together will develop strategies to improve outcomes and reduce the barriers to high-quality cancer care that many patients and families in Connecticut face today,\" said Andrew Salner, director of the Helen & Harry gray Cancer Center at Hartford Hospital. For the Hartford HealthCare Cancer Institute, the part - nership represents an opportunity to access the very latest in cancer research and clinical trials \u2014 a hallmark of MSK \u2014 to bring consistently excellent care to patients. For MSK, the partnership is a chance to provide high-quality cancer care to a wider population of patients. The pioneering partnership is the first of its kind for MSK, which plans to eventually expand to other regional health care providers as part of its Cancer Alliance. Since the partnership was announced, teams of physicians, clinical researchers and leaders from both organizations have been meeting to assess the resources and capabilities of each of HHC's five acute-care hospitals. As the partnership moves forward, HHC doctors will be integrated into MSK disease-management teams. \"We are so pleased to be able to bring the fruits of this remarkable collaboration to our patients,\" said Donna Handley, vice president of operations for the HHC Cancer Institute. \"This is a demonstration of the commitment on the part of both of our organizations to bring extraordinary cancer care to those who need it most.\" > > H A R T F O R D H E A l T H C A R E C A N C E R I N S T I T U T E An Unprecedented Alliance 4ROUNDS What is the Hartford HealthCare (HHC) Cancer Institute? The HHC Cancer Institute was established to deliver high-quality, standardized, multidisciplinary and coordinated care to all HHC cancer patients, no matter where in the HHC system a patient receives care. As a system, HHC treats more than 6,000 new cancer cases annually. The institute model of care provides all the types of expert care a patient may need for his or her treatment and overall quality of life. Site- specific, cancer-care teams of oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, nurses, researchers and others meet weekly to discuss patients. A team is involved in every patient's care. What is the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center? Founded in 1884 in New York City, MSK is the world's oldest and largest private cancer center and is a world leader in patient care, research and cancer educational programs. MSK has been ranked by US News & World Report as one of the best hospitals for cancer care in the United States. Each year, MSK treats 35,000 new patients; has 500,000 outpatient visits and 19,000 surgical cases; and its expert physicians are specialists in more than 400 types of cancer. MSK has more than a dozen multidisciplinary cancer-care teams, which include the various experts a patient needs for treatment for his or her type of disease. These experts include surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists , pathologists, psychiatrists, and nurses. MSK pioneered this multidisciplinary approach to treating cancer, which is the way the HHC Cancer Institute practices - focusing not only on cancer treatment, but also on the patient's overall well-being and quality of life. What will the HHC Cancer Institute's membership in the alliance mean for patients? HHC Cancer Institute patients will have access to world-renowned cancer care and unprecedented access to MSK clinical trials, which will be conducte d and delivered by HHC Cancer Institute physicians system wide. Clinical trials allow patients to receive the newest, most cutting-edge therapies and partic - ipate in advancing the care of future generations of cancer patients. Clinical trials are not just for patients with advanced disease. Expanding MSK's clinical trials also speeds up data collection so that investigational therapies can become approved faster and made available to more patients. Does this mean more HHC patients will go to New York for care? Because this alliance will bring MSK standards of care to the HHC Cancer Institute, the Cancer Institute does not anticipate referring more patients to MSK. In most cases, HHC Cancer Institute patients will be treated by HHC Cancer Institute physicians using MSK standards of care. For treatments not offered by the HHC Cancer Institute, such as bone- marrow transplants, patients will have the option to go to MSK, as they do now. What if I need advanced care now? Your physician will provide the best direction for your care. What is happening with the partnership between MSK and HHC? An MSK certification process is under way to ensure that the HHC Cancer Institute's resources, capabilities and standards of care meet or exceed the most- recent and highest standards. Designated HHC Cancer Institute clinicians will observe new treat - ment techniques on-site at MSK in New York City. The two organizations will share educational resources, and MSK will conduct quality and out - comes research at HHC Cancer Institute facilities. HHC Cancer Institute doctors will be integrated into MSK disease-management teams and actively participate in MSK clinical research. In addition to HHC Cancer Institute physicians, HHC Cancer Institute nurses, pharmacists, imaging experts and other care givers are undergoing training. The HHC Cancer Institute physician-in-chief will be on staff at both the HHC Cancer Institute and MSK, and an MSK researcher will be on-site at Hartford Hospital for two years. A joint MSK-HHC Cancer Institute steering committee is overseeing the implementation and ongoing work to accomplish the goals of the al liance. Winter 2014 5 A N D M E M O R I A l S l O A N - K E T T E R I N g : < < In Cancer Treatment MINDS TO HEAL Hartford Hospital provides advanced procedures to correct life-threatening disorders in the brain. 6ROUNDS Winter 2014 7Imagine that you're going about your usual activities, when suddenly you know something is wrong. Your arm is numb and weak. You want to speak, but can't think of the words. Your vision is altered. Or you have the worst headache you've ever experienced. These symptoms may mean you're having a stroke \u2014 a condition caused by blockage or bleeding of blood vessels in the brain. Untreated, stroke can cause permanent disability or death, so it's critical that you get medical attention immediately. Fortunately, the most advanced stroke care in the country is available at Hartford Hospital, a fact highlighted earlier this year when the Joint Commission named Hartford Hospital's Stroke Center New England's first Comprehensive Stroke Center. It is one of only 50 nationwide to earn the distinction. A variety of underlying brain abnormalities may cause a stroke. One is a rare disorder called moyamoya disease, while another, more common one, is an aneurysm, a bulge in a weakened area of a brain blood vessel. Physicians at Hartford Hospital are using leading-edge techniques to address these two life-threatening conditions. Restoring Blood Flow To The Brain Moyamoya disease is a condition in which arteries at the base of the brain become blocked over time, shutting off blood flow to the brain. \"Moyamoya\" is a Japanese word meaning \"puff of smoke.\" It was used to describe the disease because X-rays of affected brains show a tangle of tiny blood vessels growing out of the blocked artery in an attempt to compensate for the blockage. The disease occurs in both children and adults. It can cause both ischemic stroke, which is due to a clot blocking blood flow, and hemorrhagic stroke, which is bleeding within the brain. Stroke is usually the first sign that the patient has the disease . Only surgery can restore blood flow and prevent steady deterioration in the patient's physical and mental abilities. An operation known as EDAS (short for en - cephaloduroarteriosynangiosis), is the surgical procedure most often used to treat moyamoya disease, and Hartford Hospital neurosurgeon Inam Kureshi, MD, is one of very few surgeons in the country skilled in performing it. Dr. Kureshi learned the procedure during his fellowship at UClA, where he worked with some of the world's most prominent neurovascular surgeons. EDAS, Dr. Kureshi explains, is a procedure that \"restores circulation to the brain to allow more blood supply and prevent strokes or bleeding in the future.\" During the procedure, Dr. Kureshi accesses a blood vessel called the superficial temporal artery, which is in the patient's scalp. \"We take the artery, lay it on the surface of the brain and suture it to the brain's surface. That allows the brain to be in contact with another healthy blood vessel. Over six months to a year, the artery sprouts new branches and, over time, blood flow to the brain is restored enough to reduce the risk of stroke occurring again,\" Dr. Kureshi says. The artery is never cut or detached. \"It starts in the scalp, goes into the brain and back to the scalp through a tunnel we make for it in the skull,\" Dr. Kureshi says. \"We're careful during surgery to ensure that the blood vessel isn't com - pressed or kinked.\" When performed by a surgeon with Dr. Kureshi's experience and expertise, EDAS is highly successful. He notes that 95 percent of children and 85 percent of adults grow new blood vessels, and that the risk of complications from the surgery is a very low 5 percent. The patients Dr. Kureshi worries about most are those who smoke. \"The success rate among smokers is much lower,\" he says. \"Smoking is poison to new blood vessels.\" Defusing Dangerous Aneurysms A brain aneurysm presents many risks. As the aneurysm sac grows larger, it may compress nerves within the skull, causing headache, double vision or blindness. Blood clots can form within the aneurysm sac and later break off, blocking a downstream vessel. Or, as happens more often, Over six months to a year, the artery sprouts new branches and, over time, blood flow to the brain is restored enough to reduce the risk of stroke occurring again. Kureshi 8ROUNDS the aneurysm can rupture and bleed. Any of these occurrences can lead to permanent neurological damage. Hartford Hospital was the first hospital in New England to use an innovative tool called the Pipeline Embolization Device to reduce the risks posed by aneurysms, according to gary Spiegel, MD, director of neurointerventional surgery at Hartford Hospital. Pipeline is a flexible, mesh tube called a stent, which can be implanted across the \"neck\" or open - ing of the aneurysm so that blood flows through the stent, rather than into the aneurysm. Redirecting the blood flow encourages clots to develop within the sac of the aneurysm. This slowly decreases blood flow into the aneurysm, relieving the pressure that could lead to rupture. The federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the Pipeline device for the treatment of large aneurysms in a brain blood vessel called the internal carotid artery. \"In contrast to conventional stents, Pipeline is a much tighter mesh, akin to window screen rather than chicken wire,\" says Dr. Spiegel. \"I saw this technology eight years ago and had been awaiting its release. As soon as it was available, I ensured that we had virtually immediate access to it.\" In the past, treating large, wide-necked aneurysms was especially challenging. In these instances, \"coiling,\" a treatment that involves filling an aneurysm with tiny coils to reduce blood flow in to the aneurysm, required implanting a conventional stent across the neck of the aneurysm to prevent the coils from falling out of the large neck opening. By essentially reconstructing the blood vessel, Pipeline offers a superior treatment for these patients. \"All other endovascular treatments [those performed from inside the blood vessel] just filled the sack of the aneurysm, whereas Pipeline corrects the primary problem, which is the weakness in the vessel wall,\" Dr. Spiegel says. \"The Pipeline stent has such a tight mesh that it creates resistance to blood flow into the aneurysm. Over time, the lining of the blood vessel grows over it like ivy over a trellis.\" Hartford Hospital interventional radiologists Stephen Ohki, MD, Martin Ollenschleger, MD, and Dr. Spiegel all have had extensive training in the Pipeline procedure. Dr. Ollenschleger participated in the clinical trials of the device during his fellowship at New York University. In August 2011, only four months after the FDA approved the device, he became the first in New England to per - form cases with it. Since then, the three colleagues have treated more than 42 aneurysms with Pipeline. \"It's a very minimally invasive surgery,\" Dr. Ollenschleger says. \"We go in through the femoral artery [in the groin], then thread a small catheter into the patient's neck. We guide a microcatheter containing the Pipeline device into the blood vessels of the head, then place the stent across the neck of the aneurysm.\" Depending on the size of the aneurysm, doctors may insert one stent or several overlapping stents. \"Each one covers the neck of the aneurysm 30 to 35 percent, so with more stents, you decrease blood flow even further, while keeping the carotid open to feed the rest of the brain,\" says Dr. Ollenschleger. Patients have angiograms \u2014 X-rays of the brain blood vessels \u2014 six months after surgery to ensure that the aneurysm is fully closed. If it's not, another angiogram is performed in six months. If it still isn't fully closed, doctors may suggest implanting an additional stent to further slow the blood flow. In clinical trials, Dr. Ollenschleger says, the aneurysms of 82 percent of patients were found to be fully closed at six months and 86 percent at one year. This was significantly better than more conventional treatmen t of large, wide-necked aneurysms, which saw suc - cessful closure in less than 50 percent of patients. \"We are treating more and more patients with Pipeline preferentially over coiling because the results have been so good and the complication rates so low,\" Dr. Ollenschleger says. \"It's very effective in these larger or more complicated aneurysms.\" The rapid adoption of Pipeline, Dr. Ollenschleger says, \"is further evidence of Hartford Hospital's readiness to engage innovative technologies to advance patient care.\" Ollenschleger Spiegel Winter 2014 9Hospitals across the country are struggling to deal with an ever-increasing demand for emergency services. Last year, Hartford Hospital's emergency department alone had more than 100,000 visits from people with everything from minor cuts and sprains to life-threatening illnesses and injuries. Seeing suc h a high volume of patients quickly while providing every patient with the appropriate level of care is Hartford Hospital's top priority. That's why the hospital is introducing iTrack, or intermediate Track; an innovative approach with the potential to transform emergency care statewide. Jeff Finkelstein, MD, chief of emergency medi- cine at Hartford Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut; and Danette Alexan der, RN, MSN, direc tor of emergency services at Hartford Hospital, are spear - heading the initiative. Dr. Finkelstein notes that pa - tients who come to the ED with non- life-threatening conditions typically see a greeter, ar e triaged and then either go to an ED room or wait for one to be - come available. Once in a room, the patient stays there until either discharged or admitted. \"The prob - lem is, what if you run out of rooms?\" Dr. Finkelstein says. \"This could happen for multiple reasons. People may be waiting to be admitted upstairs or doctors are busy saving lives or workups are taking longer or the volume of patients is especially high. Almost every ED at some point, every day, runs out of rooms .\" iTrack aims to address this bottleneck by providing an alternative arrangement for patients whose conditions don't require them to be gowned and placed in a room for their entire visit. \"iTrack is a combination of private rooms, where we do exams and take histories; a few treatment rooms; and a special waiting area where patients who don't need active treatment or who are awaiting test results can relax in comfort,\" Dr. Finkelstein says. Using this system, he estimates, treating selected patients can be accomplished using two intake rooms, four to five treatment rooms, and a results-waiting area, rather than 15 to 18 regular ED rooms. Patients appropriate for iTrack are those whose conditions require more than a typical \"fast-track\" level of treatment, but less than the immediate, high - level care provided for patients suffering severe trauma , heart attack or stroke. \"We think of iTrack as a mid- track or intermediate level of care,\" Dr. Finkelstein says. iTrack was piloted at Hartford Hospital the summer of 2013, before it was rolled out in the fall. Although it operated only weekdays from 8 am to 7 pm that month, iTrack saw an average of 35 patients a day. \"Thirty-five patients a day is enough to take the pressure off of the 61 rooms in the back, so people who need to be treated there can be,\" Dr. Finkelstein says. The change increased patient satisfaction scores, decreased ED length of stay, and reduced median \"door-to-doc\" time for non-critical patients by nearly 25 percent. Hartford Hospital is the only area hospital imple - menting this type of systematic process for patients with significant, but not life-threatening, conditions. \"We're seeing people with belly pain, chest wall pain, vomiting, kidney stones and more,\" Dr. Finkelstein says. \"We're seeing them completely, safely, privately, ordering tests and following them through their course, but they're not occupying space needed for those with more serious conditions.\" Dr. Finkelstein expects to operate iTrack with its own dedicated staff beginning in April 2014 and hopes to extend its hours. \"The goal is to be open from 8 am to midnight seven days a week,\" he says.Emergency Care A fresh approach to emergency care promises to reduce wait times while ensuring top-quality care. Rethinking Jeffrey A. Finkelstein, MD, Chief of Emergency Medicine, Hartford Hospital 10 ROUNDS Olin Center Celebrates Expansion A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in the fall to mark the official opening of the Institute of living's expanded Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center. The Olin Center, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2013, is at the forefront of neuroscience research. The expansion and the acquisition of state-of- the-art equipment were made possible by a $3.2 million grant from the federal American Recovery and Rein - vestment Act and $2.2 million in match - ing funds from Hart - ford Hospital. Cardiac Program Honored Hartford Hospital's Cardiac Rehabilitation Program was certified by the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation and recognized for its commit - ment to improving the quality of life by en - hancing standards of care. AACVPR-certified programs are recognized as leaders in the field of cardiovascular rehabilitation because they offer the most advanced practices available. Psychiatric Emergency Unit Renovated The psychiatric section of Hartford Hospital's Emergency Department has undergone extensive renovations designed to enhance the privacy, safety and dignity of patients and facilitate communication among staff . Part of the funding was provided by the Hartford Hospital Auxiliary, which directed the proceeds from its annual golf tournament to the project. The physical improvements are part of a compre - hensive initiative to ensure the highest - quality emergency psychiatric care. Survival Strategies After Mass Shootings Recently issued federal guidelines for responding to active-shooter incidents are based on recommendations from a group initiated and chaired by lenworth Jacobs, MD, Hartford Hospital's vice president of academic affairs and chief academic officer. After the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dr. Jacobs proposed bringing together senior, national leaders from law enforcement, medicine, emergency response and the military to develop strategies for helping more victims survive shootings and other \"intentional mass-casualty\" events. The group's recommendations were titled \"The Hartford Consensus.\" The Federal Emergency Manage - ment Agency's endorsement of these survival strategies is a testament to Hartford Hospital's leadership on a national level in this area. Campaign Aims To \"Stop The Stigma\" Hartford Hospital has launched a multimedia campaign aimed at reducing the stigma often associated with mental illness. The \"Stop the Stigma\" campaign, which got under way in December 2013, invites users to sign an online pledge to try to change the way society views mental illness. The site also offers information about mental illness and links to other resources. To learn more and sign the pledge, visit www.StopTheStigmaCT.org.

Also this fall, gastroenterologist Michael Karasik, MD, performed the state's first \"endoscopic submucosal dissection,\" an operation to remove a cancerous lesion from the surface of the esophagus, while leaving the esophagus intact. Beyond Our Borders Hartford Hospital's expertise increasingly reaches around the world. Hartford Hospital Cancer Center Director Andrew Salner, MD, recently visited Hartford Hospital's sister hospital in China, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Medical School, in Jinan. Dr. Salner attended the opening ceremony of the new Qilu Hospital Nanshan Branch, gave two scientific presentations on cancer and presented a proclamation from Connecticut gov. Dannel Malloy congratulating Shandong and Qilu leaders on the opening of the new hospital. Bruce Browner, MD, site director of the Orthopedic Residency Program at Hartford Hospital and professor and chair emeritus of the UConn Health Center Department of Orthopedic Surgery; and Michael Miranda, MD, chief of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at Hartford Hospital and clinical assistant professor with the UConn Health Center Department of Orthopedic Surgery, conducted an International Multidisciplinary Trauma Conference with Muhim - bili University in Tanzania via video conference. Speakers from Hartford Hospital and Tanzania discussed the challenges of treating complex fractures in Africa and how these fractures are handled in the United States. Celebrating Weight Loss \u2014 And Better Health The Hartford Hospital Surgical Weight loss Center held its third annual patient reunion this fall. Patients, their guests and members of the center's staff came together to celebrate the improved health and quality of life patients have achieved through weight loss. The center has performed nearly 3,000 bariatric (weight-loss) surgeries over the past seven years, and patients have lost a total of 171,000 pounds. The average weight loss per patient was 57.57 pounds. The Surgical Weight loss Center at Hartford Hospital is accredited as a Center of Excellence by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program, an initiative of the largest organization of bariatric surgeons in the world.

The Institute's Anxiety Disorders C enter, led by Director David Tolin, PhD, is currently engaged in several clinical research studies. They include: Hoarding Many of us have clutter in our homes. But when one's accumulation of objects becomes so excessive that it interferes with normal activities and quality of life, it becomes hoarding. Hoarding is now recognized as a mental health disorder and is, for the first time, listed as a diagnosable mental illness in the new edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . The Anxiety Disorders Center is a nationally recognized leader in research on hoarding. Dr. Tolin and his colleagues are now conducting a first-of-its- kind study on the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, on brain function in people with hoarding disorder. The study, \"Neural Mechanisms of CBT Response in Hoarding Disorder,\" uses functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to monitor brain activity in people as they receive CBT. The goal is to discover how to make CBT even more effective in treating people with hoarding disorder. The study is seeking participants aged 20 to 60. Those who meet the study criteria will complete assessments, receive CBT and have fMRI scans. There is no cost to participants, and compensation of up to $200 is provided. For more information, call 860.545.7039 or email adc.research@hhchealth.org. Panic Disorder People who have recurring episodes of sudden, intense fear or anxiety, with no evident cause, may have a condition called panic disorder. Panic attacks occur without warning and are often accompanied by physical symptoms such as pounding heart, chest pain , shortness of breath or nausea. The attacks themselve s, coupled with the constant fear of their occurrence, can significantly affect a person's quality of life. The Anxiety Disorders Center is conducting a research study to see whether a biofeedback device called the Canary Breathing System can reduce the symptoms and number of panic disorders. Previous research has shown that people with panic disorder breathe differently from other people. In this study, participants periodically place under the nose a smal l tube equipped with a sensor. The sensor analyzes the person's breathing and transmits the information to a small tablet computer. The person is then asked to change his or her breathing based on signals from the tablet. The tablet and other equipment are loaned to participants, who are asked to use the device periodically over a four-week period. At weekly of - fice visits with the therapist, participants review the data and discuss progress. They also return to the center for one-hour visits three months and 12 months after beginning the study. For more information, call 860.545.7039 or email adc.research@hhchealth.org. Generalized Anxiety Disorder generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by ongoing fear of bad things happening to oneself or others and an inability to control worrying. People with gAD often have physical symptoms such as restlessness, difficulty concentrating and sleep problems. gAD is a fairly common condition, affecting more than 3 percent of adults in the United States. The Anxiety Disorders Center is conducting research to see whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy is effective is treating gAD. TMS is a noninvasive therapy approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. The therapy involves the patient sitting in a comfortable chair while a treatment coil on the head delivers magnetic pulses that stimulate certain nerve cells in the brain. In this study, patients first have a brain MRI that wi ll gu ide TMS treatment. Participants are then randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive TMS and the other will receive placebo treatment. The study is open to people 18 and older with excessive anxiety and worry who meet study criteria.
