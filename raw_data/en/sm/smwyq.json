Still so, we often pay little to no attention to the level of nutrients in our body, do we? Through a recent Instagram post by holistic lifestyle coach and author Luke Coutinho, we are reminded of the 'silent epidemic' that endangers our body in several ways, which is Vitamin D3 and B12 deficiency. \"In Integrative & Lifestyle Medicine, we invest time in identifying the root cause behind every symptom and disease. And there is one root cause that seems to be a commonality in almost every other person we consult. It is like a silent epidemic plaguing everyone, maybe you too. It's deficiency of Vitamin D3 & B12,\" says the lifestyle ambassador for Fit India Movement.

He says, \"In fact, every second patient we consult is running on critically low levels of these two vitamins. Levels of 3, 5, or 10 are dangerously low. A cumulative build-up of this deficiency can lead to innumerable problems.\" [readmore](javascript://) 02/9Role of Vitamin D3 There are two main forms of vitamin D, 'the sunshine vitamin' - vitamin D2 and D3. While the former is naturally found in some plants, the latter is naturally found in animals and is produced by the skin when it's exposed to sunlight. According to Coutinho, every cell in our body, from the brain to bones, has vitamin D3 receptors on its surface. \"These vitamins regulate the functions of several genes in our body. Hence its deficiency can lead to a range of symptoms and conditions. Sometimes, upping the levels of these two vitamins is all you need to feel better,\" he adds. As per the lifestyle coach, the role of vitamin D3 goes beyond bones. He lists down some of the role and benefits of the vitamin D3: - WBC (White Blood Cells) production - Training a smart immunity (T-cells) - Production of hormones including thyroid & sex hormones - Brain health & memory - Absorption of calcium, phosphorous (bone health) - Insulin resistance & more [readmore](javascript://) 03/9'Vitamin D3 is not just a vitamin. It acts like a hormone' In one of the slides of the post, Coutinho writes, 'Vitamin D3 is not just a vitamin. It acts like a hormone'. Many experts believe the same. Since it is mostly produced in the skin in response to sunlight and is also absorbed from certain vitamin D-rich foods, it is said to be a hormone too. Michael Holick, MD, PhD, of Boston University told MedPage Today, \"The body synthesizes it (vitamin D3) after sun exposure, and it's activated by the liver and kidneys. That activated form again acts like a hormone to regulate calcium metabolism.\" [Also read: Vitamin B12: The stealth sign of vitamin B12 deficiency which we often ignore](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/vitamin-b12-the-stealth-sign-of-vitamin-b12-deficiency-which-we-often-ignore/photostory/92171854.cms) [readmore](javascript://) 04/9Role of Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 is also an important nutrient that our body needs.

From a body ache, brain fog, fatigue, to hormonal imbalance, brittle nails and memory loss, deficiency of both these vitamins can cause serious health concerns. In the post, Coutinho writes: \"There is enough medical science that links vitamin D3 and B12 to almost everything right from your immune system to hormonal and brain health.\" \"Whether you have PCOS, Cancer, Alzheimer's, weak bones, low energy levels, any autoimmune condition, or are on a heavy treatment - you need adequate levels of these two vitamins,\" he adds. He urges each one to \"spend that money and get yourself tested for its levels.\" [readmore](javascript://) 06/9The factors that are to blame Several factors can cause vitamin D3 and B12 levels to fall in the body. According to Coutinho, long term use of antacids and other medications, heavy treatments like chemotherapy, poor gut health, chronic stress, low stomach acids, fad diets and going completely fat-free can lead to such deficiencies. Having Crohn's or kidney disease may also inhibit vitamin D and B12 absorption. Atrophic gastritis, which is the thinning of the stomach lining, pernicious anemia, can make it hard for your body to absorb vitamin B12 too.
