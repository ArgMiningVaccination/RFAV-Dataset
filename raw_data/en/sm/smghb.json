RALSTON Over the past two decades Canadian courts have repeatedly acknowledged that Indigenous individuals and collectives face systemic discrimination throughout the criminal justice system. The system's disproportionate adverse impacts on Indigenous peoples have also been thoroughly studied and documented for over half a century. Indigenous individuals are over-represented among those charged, convicted, and sentenced to prison, as well as those who are victims of crime. Among other disparities, Indigenous individuals are more likely to be denied parole, spend a disproportionate amount of time in segregation, and are less likely to receive community-based sentences. At the same time, the criminal justice system has often marginalized the legal responses of Indigenous collectives to wrongdoing among their members. These systemic issues require systemic responses. On April 23, 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada provided one such response in its decision in R v Gladue, articulating a broad, open-ended framework to address this crisis of legitimacy and outcomes in the sentencing of Indigenous persons. The Gladue decision's main principles have since been extended to various other facets of the criminal justice system. At the direction of the BC First Nations Justice Council, this book synthesizes the hundreds of cases that expand on these principles to provide readily accessible guidance to all those involved in their practical implementation. BENJAMIN A. RALSTON Benjamin received his JD from the University of British Columbia (2010) and his LLM from the University of Otago in New Zealand (2014). He is currently completing a PhD in Law at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law in Saskatoon where he has been teaching continuously since 2015. He has also taught in the University of Saskatchewan's Nunavut Law Program and Kanawayihetaytan Askiy land governance program.Benjamin was first called to the British Columbia bar in 2011 and he transferred to the Saskatchewan bar in 2015. He has been involved in the implementation of the Gladue principles since 2014 when he began assisting as an editor and co-author for Gladue reports in Saskatchewan as part of a pilot project. Since then he has authored several publications in this area, including the Indigenous Law Centre's Gladue Awareness Project: Final Report (2020). BENJAMIN A.

Cover artwork of Double Headed Gold Eagle: copyright \u00a9 Shain Niniwum Selapem Jackson, 2021ABOUT THE BC FIRST NATIONS JUSTICE COUNCIL At its most basic level, justice is understood differently by Indigenous people. Instead of punitive sentences, in an Indigenous justice system, the goal is to restore peace and equilibrium within the community and to reconcile the accused with their own conscience and with the individual or family who has been wronged by their actions. These innate differences are at the root of many challenges that Indigenous people face with today's justice model. Established in 2015 by the BC Assembly of First Nations, Union of BC Indian Chiefs and the First Nations Summit, the BC First Nations Justice Council (BCFNJC) was mandated to address the significant justice hurdles First Nations face including: 1. The overrepresentation of Indigenous children and youth in care, who make up approx. 65 per cent of the overall total, and the rate of Indigenous men and women in incarceration, which now stands at more than 30 per cent, growing from a pre-Gladue rate of 10 per cent. 2. The underrepresentation of Indigenous people working within the justice system (very few Indigenous police, prosecutors, judges, AG or PSSG staff exist). 3. Poor access to legal representation, partly due to the defunding of Legal Aid in 2002. 4. Poor access to justice services due to the defunding of a network of 14 Native Community Law Offices that functioned from 1975 to 2002. To accomplish this transformative work, the BC First Nations Justice Strategy, signed on March 6, 2020, was developed over two years by the BCFNJC, BC First Nations communities, the Province of British Columbia along with input from key justice system stakeholders participating at two Indigenous justice summits.The 2020 BC First Nations Justice Strategy calls for 42 actions along two tracks of transformative change: Track 1: Reform the current justice system Reduce youth incarceration through prevention, diversion and access to justice Increase public safety and access to justice for women and girls Establish a network of 15 Indigenous Justice Centres Increase cultural safety training and Indigenous representation in positions of authority Systemic implementation of Gladue Principles Independent third-party oversight regarding Indigenous peoples and the justice system Track 2: Restore First Nation legal traditions and structures Reclaim legal space and revitalize First Nations legal orders Rebuild self-determined and culturally-appropriate institutions Use restorative and healing approaches at all levels Create a community justice fund for stable and ongoing investment in programs Fully implemented, the BC First Nations Justice Strategy will reduce the number of First Nations people who become involved with the criminal justice system, improve the experience of those who do, increase the number of First Nations people working within the justice system and support First Nations' communities in the restoration of their justice systems and structures.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This has been a labour-intensive project. I started work on this book in mid-2019, a first draft was finalized during the first few weeks of the pandemic in the spring of 2020, only to be later updated and revised at the end of the year, and its publication is now on track for the spring of 2021. Looking back, I want to express my sincere thanks to everyone who made this book possible. First and foremost, I would like to thank Doug White and his colleagues at the BC First Nations Justice Council for entrusting me with this task and providing direction and encouragement throughout the process. Timothy Scolnick and his colleagues at the BC Ministry of the Attorney General were of great help in this regard as well. In addition, I also want to recognize Meredith Maloof and her colleagues at the Indigenous Law Centre for their own hard work and vital contributions. I am in their debt for being willing and able to publish this monograph, taking on all the administrative burdens this entails. Likewise, I want to acknowledge contributions from two research assistants, Sophie Kassel and Taylor Bereziak, as well as the cover art of Shain Jackson that is as meaningful as it is beautiful. And I wish to extend a special thanks to Judge Gerry Morin and Doug White again for the very gracious set of dueling forewords. Many others have contributed to my ongoing education and dabbling in this area of the law over the past six years, including (in no particular order): Judge Michelle Brass, Judge Cunliffe Barnett, Senator Lillian Dyck, Anisa White, Jonathan Rudin, Tim Quigley, Mitch Walker, Frances Rosner, James Scott, Rod Holloway, Christina Gray, Marilyn Poitras, Larry Chartrand, Glen Luther, Lawren Trotchie, Marsolais-Nahwegahbow, Fadden, Andrea Davidson, and countless others. Lastly, I wish to thank my partner, Shoshanna Paul, for her unwavering support even when this \"side project\" took on a life of its own and expanded into something more akin to a treatise.

He is predominantly an \"N\" dialect speaker and thus the pronunciation is \"N\" based.Foreword (ILC)XXII FOREWORD (BCFNJC) The development of this book was spearheaded by the BC First Nations Justice Council to assist in the vital and urgent work of addressing the overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system. This overrepresentation is well-documented and understood, long- standing and ever worsening, and reveals the depths of the legacy and intractability of colonialism in the criminal justice system. No fact is more illustrative of this than the trajectory of overrepresentation over the past 30 years. In the mid-1990s Indigenous people made up 10% of the prison populations in the country while making up only 5% of the overall population of Canada. As of 2020, just over 30% of prison populations are Indigenous. The unacceptable reality of overrepresentation has been well-known by the Canadian justice system for decades. Indeed, it has been decades since it was recognized as an urgent crisis in Canadian society and something had to be done about it. Section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code of Canada was adopted in 1996 as a remedial provision aimed at addressing this crisis. The historic decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue was issued in 1999. These important developments were designed to tackle the issue of overrepresentation, while recognizing that many other actions were needed, including the rebuilding of Indigenous systems of justice, upholding the basic constitutional and human rights of Indigenous peoples, and addressing systemic racism while creating an anti-racist culture. While Gladue is a good and important decision that holds real promise for helping to address overrepresentation, to date this promise has not been met. The simple reason for this, as is often the case, is that Supreme Court decisions regarding Indigenous peoples or their rights are generally not fully or rapidly implemented. This is the reality with respect to decisions regarding Indigenous Title and Rights, and it is the case with respect to Gladue.XXIII This volume, commissioned by the BCFNJC and written by Professor Benjamin Ralston, is intended to help spur greater action to implement Gladue. As a leader and mentor to many, Professor Ralston has authored a guide to the jurisprudence and its history that should be used by all those who work in the criminal justice system\u2014from Indigenous leaders and communities, to lawmakers, to judges, to prosecutors, to defence counsel, to police and law enforcement, to corrections and parole. Let us be clear, this is a book not only to read, but to use. Turn to it when deciding how to act in relation to an Indigenous accused and strive to find justice through a deep understanding of the intersection of colonialism and criminal justice. This is what we are called to at this moment in time\u2014to reject the ways of the past, to do better, to act in a principled way, to recognize the lived experience of Indigenous peoples, and make our systems ever more just and fair. A focus on implementing Gladue is one aspect of the comprehensive BC First Nations Justice Strategy that was jointly adopted by BC First Nations and the Government of British Columbia on March 6, 2020, and forms the blueprint for addressing the legacy of colonialism in relation to criminal justice. Rooted in the foundation of Indigenous self-determination and recognizing the practical stages and steps that are needed to move from where we are today to where we must be, the Strategy is the guide to transforming our current reality. Fully implementing Gladue throughout the system is a vital part of the early implementation of the Strategy. Let's get on with it\u2014and use this guide to help in doing this essential work. Douglas S. White III (Kwul'a'sul'tun), Q.C. Chair, BC First Nations Justice CouncilForeword (BCFNJC)XXIV INTRODUCTION The Supreme Court of Canada issued a unanimous set of reasons in an appeal called R v Gladue on April 23, 1999.1 This was the Supreme Court's first opportunity to interpret an amendment to the Criminal Code directing sentencing judges to \"pay particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders\" in exploring whether alternatives to prison might be available and reasonable in any given case\u2014namely, s 718.2(e). This sentencing framework provides the basis and overall structure for this publication. Ironically the outcome from the Gladue appeal had no impact on the sentence imposed on Ms. Jamie Tanis Gladue, a Cree woman living in Nanaimo whose name is reflected in its style of cause. She was sentenced for manslaughter in 1997 with little to no attention paid to her unique circumstances as an Indigenous woman, or to those of her common-law spouse and victim, his family, and their community.2 By April 1999, Ms. Gladue had been released on full parole and the Supreme Court did not see any benefit in disturbing this outcome in spite of the errors that had been made by courts below it. In stark contrast, Ms. Gladue's appeal has had an immeasurable impact on Canadian law and the criminal justice system since then. The broad implications of the Gladue decision are reflected in its near universal recognition among Canadian law students, lawyers, judges, and others working in the justice system today. It has also spurred countless well- known neologisms like \"Gladue reports\", \"Gladue principles\" referenced in the title of this publication. While the Gladue principles emanating from this decision are recognized by name throughout Canada's criminal justice system, it is more difficult to say how widely understood they are. This is not so much a criticism as it is a reflection of the open-textured and all-encompassing nature of 1 R para 94.XXV Introduction this sentencing framework. As the Supreme Court of Canada made clear in its subsequent decision in R v Wells, the sentencing guidelines in the Gladue decision were never intended to provide a \"single test\".3 Instead, they called on courts and counsel to broaden their gaze and explore a wide variety of circumstances that make Indigenous individuals and collectives unique, particularly in terms of their relationship with the Canadian government and criminal justice system. Parliament insisted on greater attention to Indigenous difference in sentencing as its response to two different realities that had emerged by the mid-1990s. First, the grossly disproportionate rates of imprisonment for Indigenous people had been linked to systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system. Second, many Indigenous justice initiatives and culturally relevant programs were (re-)emerging across the country by that time. These two realities opened up very different lines of inquiry for the courts and counsel. First, the circumstances of many Indigenous individuals are \"markedly different\" because of the impacts of a wide range of unique systemic and background factors on their lives.4 Addressing systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system may require us to work backwards from the system's disparate consequences for Indigenous people and question how these are produced by practices and attitudes within it, intentional or otherwise.5 Achieving equality may require attention to the social, political, economic, and historical factors that have contributed to inequality, and it may require differential treatment to ameliorate disparities.6 From this perspective, Parliament's insistence that Indigenous people must be sentenced differently can be seen as a demand for closer attention to the differences that contribute to their overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. Second, an Indigenous person's community will frequently understand the nature of a just sanction in a manner \"significantly different\" from that of many non-Indigenous communities.7 With the introduction of s 718.2(e), Parliament sought to expand the use of restorative justice principles and reduce reliance on prison in the Criminal Code \"with a 3 R v Wells, 2000 SCC 10 [Wells] at para 41. 4 Gladue, supra note 1 at para 77. 5 CN v Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 1114 at 1138-39, 1987 CanLII 109, citing Justice Rosalie S Abella, Report of the Commission on Equality in Employment (Ottawa: Minister of Supply and Services Canada, 1984) at 2. 6 Withler v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 12 at para 39. 7 Gladue, supra note 1 at para 77.XXVI THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence sensitivity to aboriginal community justice initiatives when sentencing aboriginal offenders\".8 Recognition and respect for Indigenous perspectives and justice initiatives leads to distinct inquiries into the legal, cultural, and historical differences between Indigenous collectives and non-Indigenous communities in Canada, which have \"vastly dissimilar legal cultures\".9 This may refocus our attention on the broader context of Indigenous self-government and self-determination and the promotion of this through federal policy since at least the 1980s.10 In short, sentencing Indigenous individuals differently can also mean greater respect for Indigenous collectives and perspectives. These divergent lines of inquiry emerge within the Gladue sentencing framework itself. The Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted s 718.2(e) as requiring lawyers and judges to canvass at least two sets of circumstances that make Indigenous people unique: (A) The unique systemic and background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts; and (B) The types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection.11 The Supreme Court of Canada's open-ended call for attention to Indigenous difference in Gladue initiated an expansive and complex body of sentencing jurisprudence. It provided a mandatory sentencing framework that must be applied in both rural and urban settings. The categories of \"unique circumstances\" that were outlined in Gladue take on meaning by reference to vastly different cultures, histories, experiences, legal traditions, programs, and justice initiatives across Canada. Its broadest principles are now applied in several analogous contexts beyond sentencing and the strict confines of Canadian criminal law. This publication is an attempt to collate as much as possible of the existing jurisprudence in one place to make it more navigable and comprehensible for anyone who is engaged in the implementation of the Gladue principles. It is anticipated that the primary audience for this book will be made 8 Ibid at para 48. 9 R v Van der Peet, [1996] 2 SCR 507, 1996 CanLII 216, paras 42, 49, McLachlin J at paras 232, 310, 313. 10 Canadian Pacific Ltd v Matsqui Indian Band, [1995] 1 SCR 3, 1995 CanLII 145, La Forest J at paras 18, 74, Sopinka J at paras 113-115. note supra note 3 at para 38.XXVII Introduction up of individuals with formal legal training. However, it is written with the understanding that this area of law is critically relevant to the work of many others, including Gladue report writers and community justice workers. For this reason it is written with the intention of making it accessible to the widest audience possible. For example, long excerpts from relevant legislation appear with less frequency than one might expect from a publication exclusively for lawyers practising criminal law. The existing case law on the Gladue principles has also been synthesized and organized within this monograph in an attempt to bring it together into a coherent whole so as to assist in its principled development into the future. In support of this objective, the book is divided into four distinct parts. First, the implications of the Gladue decision and the enactment of s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code are placed in context by summarizing some of the prior jurisprudence on the accommodative sentencing of Indigenous people that was already in place, as well as the many task forces and inquiries that contributed to these reforms to the law, and the legislative context and debate that further informed the Gladue framework. Second, the Supreme Court of Canada's judgments interpreting s 718.2(e) have been summarized in detail, along with other case law from the Supreme Court that indicates broader horizons for its core principles and values. Third, the two categories of unique circumstances referenced in Gladue and the need for case-specific information are each canvassed in reference to lower court jurisprudence that has filled in the Gladue framework and illustrated its flexibility. Fourth, emerging extensions of the Gladue principles to specific legal contexts will be explored, including the sentencing of Indigenous youth and dangerous offenders, and accounting for collateral consequences. This publication does not attempt to critically engage with the Gladue principles or the academic literature they have engendered. There are countless thoughtful and persuasive articles, books, and graduate theses dedicated to critiquing the Gladue decision itself and its subsequent implementation by Canadian courts. These publications largely fall outside the scope of this monograph. The more modest goal here is to gather together as much of the existing case law as possible and organize it in a way that makes it readily accessible and transparent for anyone involved in the implementation of the Gladue analysis. It is meant to provide a roadmap for authoritative statements of Canadian law as it currently stands rather than any expression of how the law ought to change. In other words, it is no more nor less than what it purports to be: a guide to the jurisprudence. ABORIGINAL PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR OWN CULTURES...

THE RELATIONSHIP OF COLONIALISM PROVIDES LEGAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT 2 PART A: LEGAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT Most of the ignoble history of Indigenous peoples' interactions with the criminal justice system in Canada is well beyond the scope of this publication. However, Parliament was responding to a particular legal and historical context when it directed sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances \"with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders\" in the Criminal Code in 1996. The Supreme Court then interpreted this amendment in a particular legal and historical context in Gladue three years later. In order to fully grasp what was decided in Gladue, the existing context can be of great assistance. Above all, s 718.2(e) and the Gladue principles insist upon the acknowledgement and accommodation of the unique circumstances of Indigenous people in sentencing. To do so, courts must confront the many complex ways in which Indigenous societies and individuals are differently situated. When the Supreme Court of Canada articulated its distinct and accommodative methodology for the sentencing of Indigenous people it did so building on an emerging jurisprudence, evolving practices and programming in both institutional and community settings, a deep body of knowledge amassed by several prior commissions of inquiry and task forces, and a thorough legislative debate. Each of these topics will be canvassed in turn to highlight the legal and historical foundations on which the Gladue principles were first constructed. This background context provides a frame of reference for the Supreme Court's intentions when it directed sentencing judges to pay attention to a wide variety of unique and conceptually distinct circumstances whenever an Indigenous person is sentenced. Among other things, it can provide context for references to Indigenous perspectives, systemic and background factors, culturally appropriate sanctions and procedures, and systemic discrimination.3 CHAPTER 1: EARLIER ACCOMMODATIVE SENTENCING PRACTICES There is a long line of cases preceding the Gladue decision, which offers a convenient place to start. The common law is known for evolving incrementally rather than abruptly and this can be seen in the sentencing jurisprudence on the accommodation of the unique circumstances of Indigenous people in Canadian law. Recognizing what came before the Gladue decision helps stabilize its principles where they have deeper roots in precedent. It is worth noting from the outset that the Supreme Court of Canada interpreted s 718.2(e) as having a remedial purpose rather than simply codifying principles from these earlier cases.1 In other words, s 718.2(e) was meant to change the law and not just reflect and entrench its existing state. Yet it is only possible to assess what this provision remedied if we first account for the prior state of the law in terms of sentencing Indigenous people. Canada's criminal justice system has been grappling with the distinct circumstances of Indigenous societies and their members ever since it was first forcibly imposed upon them. In the early 19th century there was lingering uncertainty among colonial courts regarding their jurisdiction over crimes committed amongst Indigenous people.2 However, by the 20th century Canadian courts were more or less unequivocal in their position that the Criminal Code should be applied to Indigenous people.3 This has given rise to other challenging questions, such as how Indigenous laws are to be reconciled with the civil and common law imported and imposed by European settlers.4 Cultural and spiritual divergence can 1 R v Gladue, [1999] 1 SCR 473; Mark D Walters, \"The extension of colonial criminal jurisdiction over the Aboriginal peoples of Upper Canada: Reconsidering the Shawanakiskie case (1822-26)\" (1996) 46:2 UTLJ 273. 3 See R v Beboning (1908), 13 CCC 405, 3 CNLC 517 (Ont CA) at 525. 4 See especially Connolly v Woolrich (1867), 17 RJRQ 75, 1 CNLC 70 Johnstone Connelly (1869), 17 RJRQ 266, 1 CNLC 151 See also R v Nan-CHAPTER 14 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A be seen in early cases as well.5 Language barriers are also apparent in some early cases.6 While the criminal justice system promises a form of equality before the law, underlying differences persist. And while Canadian law has long differentiated between Indigenous people and others, it historically did so in ways that are now universally recognized as oppressive and discriminatory.7 The Gladue principles continue to reflect the historical depth of this encounter and these legal, cultural, and spiritual differences in ways that make them particularly challenging. The precursors to the Gladue principles can be seen in experimental and accommodative sentencing jurisprudence that emerged from northern courts during the late 20th century, as well as appellate courts reviewing their decisions. These early cases demonstrate how sentencing with Indigenous difference in mind led courts to question the criminal law's equal application. The case law leading up to Gladue indicates shifting judicial attitudes around the relevance of social circumstances to moral blameworthiness, as well as the place of Indigenous peoples' unique cultures, perspectives, and values in sentencing. By the 1990s, Canadian courts were also engaging with Indigenous justice initiatives that aimed to involve Indigenous communities and governments in the administration of justice. Taken together, these cases demonstrate the basic foundations for the Supreme Court of Canada's Gladue analysis. Accommodative sentencing of Indigenous people from remote communities Some of the earliest precedents for an accommodative approach to sentencing Indigenous people can be found in the decisions of the e-quis-a-ka [1889] Terr LR 211, 2 CNLC Bone [1899] Terr LR 173, 3 CNLC 513 (NWTSC) where courts addressed whether polygamy charges could be brought based on Indigenous customary marriages. 5 See for example R v Machekequonabe (1897), 28 OR 309, 3 CNLC 575 (Div Ct) where an appeal from a manslaughter conviction was unsuccessfully argued based on a common law defence of having acted pursuant to a religious belief when a man killed someone he mistook to be a Wendigo. 6 See for example R v Louie (1903), 10 BCR 1, 3 CNLC 566 (CA) where an appeal addressed concerns over the admissibility of an Indigenous woman's dying declaration made through an interpreter. 7 See for example: Wendy Moss & Elaine Gardner-O'Toole, Aboriginal People: History of Discriminatory Laws (Ottawa: Law and Government Division, 1987); John S Milloy, A National Crime: The Canadian Government and the Residential School System,1879 to 1986 (Winnipeg: U of M Press, 1999); Constance Backhouse, Colour-coded: a legal history of racism in Canada, 1900-1950 (Toronto: Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History, 1999). 5 Chapter 1: Earlier Accommodative Sentencing PracticesCHAPTER 1 Northwest Territories Territorial Court during the tenures of Judge Sissons and Judge Morrow. In Itsi, for example, Judge Sissons held that a minimum fine for supplying alcohol to a minor would impact Indigenous people \"more heavily and unfairly\" than southerners visiting the territories due to their differing circumstances and intentions and he called for the provision to be disallowed on this basis.8 Following the precedents set by Judge Sissons, Judge Morrow took into account the shorter life expectancy for an Inuk by halving the period of incarceration he would have otherwise imposed for manslaughter in Moses E9-833.9 Judge Morrow also directed the correctional authorities to allow this sentence to be served in Yellowknife so the accused would be held among other Inuktitut speakers, as well as closer to psychiatric services.10 In Esagok, Judge Morrow went on to describe this contextual approach to the sentencing of Inuit as one that accounts for the \"clash of social cultures\" between them and non-Indigenous southerners.11 Another early example can be seen in the Ontario Court of Appeal's Fireman decision from 1971.12 It reduced a Cree man's ten-year penitentiary sentence for manslaughter to a period of two years less a day in order to properly account for his cultural background, his character, and his prospects for rehabilitation. Mr. Fireman was a trapper from a remote settlement on the Attawapiskat River who spoke no English and had little formal education. The Court found even a short term of imprisonment would be a \"substantial punishment\" for him given the \"loneliness\" he would face when unable to communicate with others in a southern penitentiary, and based on the stark contrast with his life in the north.13 Mr. Fireman's community was also said to have \"an apparent different value of death\".14 The Court found deterrence was met by the community's participation in the arrest of Mr. Fireman, as well as his initial ostracism followed by reintegration into the community. The Court stated that \"[w]hat is important in these circumstances is that to the whole community justice appears to have been done and 8 R v Itsi (1966), 6 CNLC 394 (NWT Terr Ct) at 402. CNLC 515 (NWT Terr Ct). 10 Ibid Terr Ct) at 332. 12 R v Fireman (1971), 4 CCC (2d) 82, 7 CNLC 337 (Ont CA). 13 Ibid at 340. 14 Ibid.6 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A that there will be respect for the law\".15 Mr. Fireman's reformation and rehabilitation were dominant considerations for sentencing, along with the community's respect for the justice system.16 In Curley, Judge Bourassa of the Northwest Territories Territorial Court followed a similar tack when sentencing three Inuit men from Hall Beach for statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl.17 He took into account that this particular offence was viewed differently in the Eastern Arctic than in the south at that time, based on both a pre-sentence report and the court's own experience, and noted that the accused men were not aware they had even committed a crime until they were confronted by the police and the Criminal Code.18 He sentenced them to one week in prison in addition to the three weeks of pre-trial custody they had already served, followed by eight months of probation.19 After a successful Crown appeal, the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal substituted four-month prison terms to ensure general deterrence was served.20 Yet it imposed a shorter custodial term in recognition of the \"cultural consideration\" that taking the accused out of their home community and imprisoning them in \"a totally foreign environment\" would add to the harshness of these sentences.21 On the other hand, it emphatically rejected the proposition that residents of remote communities should be judged by their own standards.22 The impact of the appellate decisions in Fireman and Curley on sentencing practices is difficult to assess from the reported case law. The Fireman case was distinguished in several decisions involving Indigenous people who judges perceived to be more acculturated than Mr. Fireman or whose communities were seen to be less remote, with the underlying assumption being that a clash of social cultures gradually abates over time.23 In Naqitarvik, for instance, the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal distinguished Fireman from the circumstances of an Inuk from Arctic Bay who \"had considerable contact with, and experiences of, the 15 Ibid at 341. 16 Ibid. 17 R Ibid 20 R v Curley, [1984] NWTR 281, 4 CNLR 72 (CA) at 75. 21 Ibid at 74. 22 Ibid. 23 See for example R v Whitney, [1995] AJ No 301 (QL), 167 AR 187 (Prov Ct). 7 Chapter 1: Earlier Accommodative Sentencing PracticesCHAPTER 1 way of life of Canadians outside his own remote community\".24 The majority held that the residents of Arctic Bay on the northern coast of Baffin Island had been \"exposed for some time to the same laws and customs as other Canadians\" and theirs was not \"a culture markedly different than that in the rest of Canada\".25 Similarly, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal found Fireman could not be applied in a case involving an Indigenous man with a Grade 11 education from La Ronge in northeastern Saskatchewan.26 Likewise, in Baillargeon, Justice Marshall of the Northwest Territories Supreme Court declined to follow Fireman's reasoning altogether, noting that the Dene community of Dettah in the North Slave Region was \"not nearly so remote, in any event\".27 On the other hand, these cases did set important precedents for courts to inquire into the differential impacts of the criminal law on the Indigenous people they sentenced, and for courts operating in Indigenous communities to familiarize themselves with this context. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal accepted the reasoning in Fireman as justifying deference to the greater knowledge and familiarity of sentencing judges with local conditions in Labrador, including the local knowledge of Canada's first Inuk judge, Judge Igloliorte.28 Similar deference appears to have been afforded to non-Indigenous sentencing judges regularly operating in Indigenous communities in some older cases of the British Columbia Court of Appeal as well.29 On the other hand, some of the unique circumstances that were considered to be relevant in Fireman, Curley, and Naqitarvik proved to be far more controversial, particularly the notion that Indigenous perspectives, values, and community initiatives were relevant to sentencing under the Criminal Code. 24 R v Naqitarvik (1986), 26 CCC (3d) 193 at 195, 3 CNLR 119 (NWTCA) [Naqitarvik]. 25 Ibid. 26 R v Beatty (1982), 69 CCC (2d) 223, [1983] 2 CNLR 125 (Sask CA). 27 R v Baillargeon, [1986] 3 CNLR 104 (NWTSC) at 109.

The same tension can be seen in the majority and dissenting reasons in Naqitarvik. The trial judge had considered the re-establishment of traditional counselling by Inuit Elders in Arctic Bay to be a suitable alternative to a long period of incarceration for a major sexual assault and he imposed an intermittent prison sentence of 90 days.30 The majority found this to be wholly inadequate, it substituted an 18-month sentence, and it distinguished contemporary Elder counselling in Arctic Bay from the historic practices of the Inuit.31 Yet Justice Belzil wrote a detailed set of reasons in dissent, concluding that the community's response reflected unique values and cultural identity, addressed community protection and rehabilitation, and had an added benefit of effecting reconciliation between the victim and offender.32 There are appellate decisions that pre-date Gladue where the relevance of cultural context in the sentencing of Indigenous people is emphatically rejected. Justice Kerans of the Alberta Court of Appeal characterized defence counsel's argument for \"mitigation based upon cultural conflict\" in a case of indecent assault on a minor as an entirely baseless suggestion that Indigenous cultures might permit such abuse.33 The British Columbia Court of Appeal adopted a similar position in a case of arson in Quilt.34 The Alberta Court of Appeal also took a dim view of the suggestion that sentences for sexual assaults in the remoter areas of northern Alberta were being routinely discounted.35 The Court further insisted that the starting point in weapons or violence cases should not \"hinge on considerations of heritage, geography or social circumstance\" and there is little relevance to where the offender grew up and learned their priorities, \"whether in private schools or while on public assistance, to say nothing of latitudes\".36 30 Naqitarvik, supra note 24 at 194. 31 Ibid at 198. 32 Ibid at 199-200. 33 R v N, [1983] AJ No 278 (QL) (CA) at para 4. 34 R v Quilt, [1984] BCJ No 1830 (QL), 14 CCC (3d) 572 (CA). 35 R v CAC [1992] AJ No 368 (QL), 1992 ABCA 133 (CanLII). 36 at paras 5-6.9 Chapter 1: Earlier Accommodative Sentencing PracticesCHAPTER 1 While not all courts rejected cultural background arguments out of hand, let alone in such absolute and categorical terms, some of the confounding issues that persist in the Gladue jurisprudence today were already apparent by the early 1990s. In PGH, for instance, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal concluded that \"[t]here is no doubt that an accused's antecedents are always relevant and that includes the culture, traditions and customs of a Native or aboriginal people\".37 However, \"mere proof of a Native blood line with a Native culture or heritage, by itself, without more, is not at all likely to constitute a mitigating consideration\".38 The Court of Appeal went on to narrowly circumscribe the relevancy of cultural background as a mitigating factor in the sentencing of Indigenous people to cases where a clear nexus could be demonstrated: [...] Counsel must provide the link between the particular aspect of the accused's Native heritage and the circumstances and the facts of the offence giving rise to the conviction. In any situation where the court is urged to acknowledge culture or heritage as a factor in sentencing, there must exist and be demonstrated some connection or nexus between the accused's Native legacy, attitudes and traditions and the proven offence whereby it can reasonably be said that the accused's circumstances, in all fairness, warrant a sympathetic hearing\u2014and a compassionate disposition.39 Discriminatory impacts on Indigenous people in sentencing Another legacy of these early cases can be seen in judicial recognition that prison can impact Indigenous people more harshly than others, resulting in collateral consequences or \"secondary penalties\".40 In addition to the impacts of being sent far from one's home, family, culture, language, and support network, the demographic makeup of some distant institutions can make them a more isolating, alien environment.41 Consistent with Moses E9-833, Fireman, and Curley, these consequences are accounted 37 R v PGH, [1994] NJ No 16 (QL), 1994 CanLII 9721 (CA) para 22. 38 Ibid at para 21. 39 Ibid at para 22. See also GA, supra note 28. 40 R v Bero, [1998] (QL) (Ct (CA) at para 6.10 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A for in many decisions preceding Gladue. In some cases sentencing judges addressed the harsher impacts of a penitentiary sentence in the south by making strong recommendations for prison to be served in northern institutions.42 In other cases courts addressed these collateral impacts as a mitigating factor.43 Prison was found to have an even harsher impact on Indigenous women in Daniels where Justice Wedge of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench held that the relocation of Indigenous women to the alien culture of a Kingston prison far from their home, children, and extended family breached their right to equality under s 15 of the Charter.44 Recognition that penalties under the Criminal Code can impact Indigenous people more harshly than others is also apparent in several early cases where firearms prohibitions were challenged as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. The outcome in these cases often turned on individual circumstances as opposed to generalizations. In Weyallon, for example, the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal overturned a Dene man's exemption based on judicial notice that an automatic firearms prohibition would have a \"self-evident\" impact on his hunting and trapping.45 In contrast, the Yukon Court of Appeal upheld an exemption in Chief where the pre-sentence report confirmed that an Indigenous man was a bona fide trapper who depended significantly on his earnings from the sale of furs and hunting to support his family.46 Likewise, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld such an exemption in McGillivary where the record disclosed that a Cree man from Cumberland House relied on hunting and trapping for the support and subsistence of his wife and seven children.47 A majority of the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion in Netser where the prohibition would have impacted an Inuk's safety, daily life, and livelihood.48 While it might have been clear that these mandatory prohibitions were more 42 See for example: R v Attagutaluk, [1986] NWTJ No 129 NWTJ 97 (Terr 25 (QL) 51, CanLII 45 R v Weyallon, [1985] 4 CNLR 184 (NWTCA).

Indigenous community involvement and culturally relevant programming Another important line of jurisprudence preceding the Gladue decision incorporated Indigenous justice initiatives, community involvement, and cultural programming in sentencing. The majority reasons in Naqitarvik were by no means the last word on this topic. The best-known decisions prior to Gladue are likely those where sentencing circles were relied upon to craft innovative community-based sentences. In Moses, for example, Judge Barry Stuart of the Yukon Territorial Court provided detailed guidance on the use of sentencing circles, pointing out that \"First Nations have the best knowledge and ability to prevent and resolve the long list of tragedies plaguing their communities\", among other things.49 Similar considerations are apparent in several other decisions that precede the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its seminal interpretation by the Supreme Court of Canada. In Mitchell, the British Columbia Court of Appeal directed a probation officer to consult with Indigenous court workers and the Gitxsan- Wet'suwet'en Tribal Council to prepare a plan for a young Wet'suwet'en man aimed at breaking his cycle of crime and pursuing rehabilitation. 50 The Court allowed an appeal from Mr. Mitchell's 18-month prison sentence for theft of two trucks, reducing it to time served plus one-year probation. The Court found this to be \"a case where a cycle of crime has developed in a seriously disadvantaged young person and that we should investigate further\".51 It ordered a post-sentence report to assess available resources in the Smithers-Moricetown area to permit \"something more constructive than just continuing the cycle which is demonstrated in the record of this accused\".52 The Court examined Mr. Mitchell's personal circumstances, including family instability, childhood sexual abuse, prenatal exposure to alcohol, and physical and cognitive impairments, and concluded that he was an \"unfortunate product\" of \"historical disadvantages\" facing many 49 R v Moses, [1992] 3 CNLR 116 at 140, 1992 CanLII 12804 (Y Terr Ct). 50 R Ibid at para 10.12 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A Indigenous communities.53 It held that Mr. Mitchell ought to benefit from the support of his community and the probation officer was encouraged to pass supervision over to the Tribal Council. In Jules, the Yukon Court of Appeal followed this reasoning in upholding a sentence of four months' incarceration followed by probation for a young Indigenous man convicted of theft and breaking and entering in Teslin, Yukon.54 His probation conditions included psychological treatment and completion of an alcohol addictions course, and restitution was ordered. The Court of Appeal found that the sentencing judge had been guided by a report from a probation officer and a letter from the Chief of Mr. Jules's First Nation. The pre-sentence report disclosed a family history of alcohol addiction and domestic violence, but also his positive employment history and acceptance into Poundmaker's Lodge in St. Albert, Alberta. The Chief 's letter encouraged a sentence of restitution, an apology, anger management, and other programming as a more effective way for dealing with this young man's problems than incarceration, the sentencing decision placed a great deal of weight on that recommendation, and the Court of Appeal took no issue with this approach. In Moosenose, Judge Davis of the Northwest Territories Territorial Court heard from several members of a Tlicho woman's community when crafting a sentence for theft, including an Elder and other representatives from her First Nation.55 He found that the probation officer, the Band Council, and the Hamlet Council were all in support of a community-based disposition. Judge Davis concluded that the level of community support and involvement in this case constituted special circumstances that would allow for a sentence other than prison to be imposed and he accepted most of the sentencing recommendations that had been developed by the community. Ms. Moosenose received a suspended sentence and she was ordered to perform community service at the direction of her Band Council. She was also placed under a curfew, and any travel outside the community was made subject to her Band Council's discretion, among other conditions. Many other examples can be seen of Indigenous leaders and Elders being integrated into sentencing conditions in the 1990s. In P( JA), Judge Lilles of the Yukon Territorial Court directed a probation officer to keep in close contact and consult with clan leaders of the Teslin 53 Ibid at paras 16-17. 54 R v Jules, [1990] YJ 139 (QL) (CA). 55 R No Accommodative Sentencing PracticesCHAPTER 1 Tlingit to monitor a community-based sentence for sexual assault that included regular attendance at a healing circle, public acknowledgement and apology for the offence, and community service, among other conditions.56 In Wahpay, Judge Stach of the Ontario Court of Justice sentenced an Ojibway woman to a year of incarceration followed by a year of probation for manslaughter of an infant, placing her under the direction of a probation officer, the Shoal Lake First Nation, and its Elders for her counselling and community service conditions.57 In Charleyboy, Judge Barnett imposed a suspended sentence that placed a Tsilhqot'in man under the supervision of his Chief and Elders, and required him to organize and manage a camp for youths and a support group for assaultive men, among other conditions.58 Likewise, in Dunn the British Columbia Court of Appeal varied the terms of a banishment condition requested by a Band Council, but maintained the Council's discretion over Mr. Dunn's access to his home reserve.59 There were ample precedents for Indigenous communities to participate in both the crafting of sentences and their implementation by the early 1990s. Several decisions from this same era held that cultural differences should be met with culturally appropriate programming as well, regardless of whether this takes place in custody or in a community setting. For example, Judge Lilles of the Yukon Territorial Court took judicial notice of the traditional culture of Old Crow when calling for the development of relevant programming and counselling for a young Gwich'in man in F(WR).60 In RJS, Justice Goodfellow of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court determined that a Mi'kmaw youth's best hope for rehabilitation would be working with a Mi'kmaw role model who could help him learn about his culture, develop his self-esteem, and gain better insight into the impacts of his conduct, after having been convicted of murder.61 In Laprise, Justice Wedge of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench held that the Crown failed to prove an Indigenous man's behaviour was intractable in a dangerous offender proceeding based in part on the strength of evidence that his conduct could be addressed by working with Indigenous professionals and Elders in culturally informed ways.62 56 R v P( JA), [1991] YJ No 180 (QL), 6 CR (4th) 126 (Terr R v [1991] OJ No (QB).14 THE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A Contextual assessment of moral blameworthiness in sentencing Indigenous people Other precursors for the methodology articulated by the Supreme Court in Gladue can be found in early cases where courts closely examined the difficult personal background of an Indigenous person during sentencing, often set out in a detailed report, and assessed their moral culpability in light of this context. In addition to decisions like Mitchell and RJS canvassed above, there are other early examples of innovative sentencing from the 1990s that clearly foreshadow the context-sensitive approach in Gladue. In Pettigrew, for example, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ordered a post-sentence report and took into account a M\u00e9tis woman's difficult background before reducing her 12-month prison sentence for manslaughter to one of six months followed by 12 months' probation.63 The Court noted there was no pre-sentence report before the trial judge and it only knew what had been provided in counsel's submissions so it ordered the preparation of a post-sentence report for the appeal.64 This individualized information then helped the Court assess what sentencing principles were of most relevance to Ms. Pettigrew: The report which we have now received says that Ms. Pettigrew is a Metis, that she was born in the Northwest Territories, that her parents both used alcohol heavily, and that she was abused during her childhood. She has consumed alcohol since an early age and her life has been marked by a series of misfortunes, several of them tragic. Her childhood circumstances and life experiences, as now disclosed, make a sentence wholly based on \"denunciation\", \"rejection\" or \"abhorrence\", in my view difficult to justify.65 In JS, Judge Diehl of the Saskatchewan Provincial Court sentenced an Indigenous woman to two years' incarceration for manslaughter of her mother after a similar examination of her unique circumstances in the record before the court.66 In addition to a pre-sentence report 63 R v Pettigrew, [1990] BCJ para para 66 PracticesCHAPTER 1 and a psychiatrist's report, Judge Diehl was presented with a report authored by a counsellor at James Smith Cree Nation that he found to be particularly insightful: This report is a comprehensive and elucidating account \"woman to woman\" between the accused and her counsellor. Unlike the two prior-listed reports, its narrative is a continuum of anecdotal uncoverings and personal revelations that came together fragmentarily, though not necessarily chronologically, over a much longer period of time. In this sense the report is more \"personal\" and, thus, more reliable. It portrays the painful journey intrinsic in any personal voyage of discovering one's self where, before healing can occur, layer upon layer of abuse and related indignities have to be painfully peeled away, like the clothes from a burn-victim, to whom, metaphorically, she bears a close and painful resemblance. For this accused the voyage continues to be long, and the suffering intense.67 Judge Diehl went on to find that the offence in this case was \"almost a derivative crime born of the unresolved effects of past conditions, abuse and indignities\", such as \"feelings of loneliness, fear, worthlessness, and marginalization\" related to substance abuse.68 He closely examined the programming available in the Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge that had recently opened in Saskatchewan and he made a non-binding recommendation to the correctional authorities that the sentence ought to be served there.69 Conclusion Many of the principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gladue have clear analogues in this earlier jurisprudence, even if these decisions may have been exceptions rather than the norm in their time. When s 718.2(e) was added to the Criminal Code it would be interpreted as Parliament's direction for the courts to pay greater attention to the unique circumstances canvassed in these earlier cases. Prior to Gladue, s 718.2(e) was already interpreted as a call for attention to community values and distinct perspectives on sentencing, other cultural differences, socio-economic deprivation, justice initiatives like sentencing circles 67 Ibid at para 34. 68 Ibid at at paras 96-97.16 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A and Elder panels, community input and support, and the criminal law's harsher impact on Indigenous people when differences go unrecognized.70 In summary, the Supreme Court of Canada's sentencing methodology in Gladue was not simply plucked out of the ether and read into a short amendment to the Criminal Code. However, it should not be characterized as little more than a synthesis of this prior case law either. The Crown raised both Fireman and the sentencing circle jurisprudence in the Gladue appeal to argue that s 718.2(e) amounted to little more than a codification of these existing principles.71 It was argued that nothing had changed nor needed to change in the way Indigenous people were being sentenced. That premise was soundly rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, which held that s 718.2(e) could not be interpreted by simply looking at these older cases. Instead, it must be viewed in context to the larger \"watershed\" of sentencing reforms that accompanied this provision.72 The Supreme Court's interpretation of s 718.2(e) built on more than the past jurisprudence alone. It also took notice of an emerging body of knowledge regarding the underlying causes and the most effective responses to the crisis of Indigenous over-incarceration. 70 See for example: R v HR, [1997] AJ Wells, para 38. 72 Ibid at para 39.17 CHAPTER 2: PRIOR TASK FORCES AND COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY The Gladue principles can also be challenging to understand as a result of the complex factual conclusions on which they are premised. The underlying causes of the crisis of Indigenous over- incarceration and its potential remedies are only briefly summarized in the Supreme Court of Canada's wide-ranging reasons. Yet the Supreme Court was clearly engaged with a body of knowledge developed outside the courtroom. When s 718.2(e) was introduced in 1996 it was part of a package of amendments to the Criminal Code that had been preceded by decades of academic research and government reports on sentencing reform. Among other topics, these prior studies canvassed the criminal justice system's adverse treatment of Indigenous people and Indigenous over- representation in that system. By the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s this research was bringing academic, political, and institutional attention to the disproportionate rates at which Indigenous people were entering the criminal justice system, as well as their unique circumstances, perspectives, and needs.1 By the 1980s, numerous federal and provincial 1 See for example: Canadian Corrections Association, Indians and the Law (Ottawa: The Canadian Welfare Council, 1967); Donald N McCaskill, A Study of Needs and Resources Related to Offenders of Native Origin in Manitoba (Report prepared for the Correctional Planning Branch, Ministry of the Solicitor General, Ottawa, 1970); Michael C Bennett, \"The Indian Counsellor Project\u2014Help for the Accused\" (1973) 15 Can J Corr 1; Rita M Bienvenue & AH Latif, \"Arrests, Dispositions and Recidivism: A Comparison of Indians and Whites\" (1974) 16:2 Can J Crim & Corr 105; John Hagan, \"Criminal Justice and Native People: A Study of Incarceration in a Canadian Province\" (1974) Can Rev of Sociology & Anthropology 220; Douglas Schmeiser, Hans WB Heumann, & John R Manning, The Native Offender and the Law (Ottawa: Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1974); Derek F Wynne & Timothy F Hartnagel, \"Race and Plea Negotiation: An Analysis of Some Canadian Data\" (1975) 2 Can J of Sociology 147; H Savage, \"Problems in Delivering Legal Services to Native Groups in Remote Areas\" in Conference on Legal Aid: Report and Proceedings (Ottawa: Canadian Council on Social Development, 1975); William T Badcock, \"Problems of Native Offenders in the Correctional System\" (1976) 18:4 Can J Crim & Corr 281.CHAPTER 218 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A task forces and commissions of inquiry were being initiated to investigate the treatment of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system as well. And by the 1990s, lawyers and judges were engaging with the factual findings and recommendations set out in these reports, as can be seen in many of the pre-Gladue cases summarized in the previous chapter. In other words, the innovative jurisprudence around sentencing Indigenous people in the 1990s developed in dialogue with these inquiries and studies. Commissions of inquiry into the treatment of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system have had palpable impacts on the criminal law's evolution in Canada in many different ways, such as the Supreme Court of Canada's reliance on the findings from the Donald Marshall Jr. Commission when it reformulated the Crown's duty of disclosure in Stinchcombe.2 The Supreme Court relied on this same extensive body of knowledge when it provided a comprehensive framework for the sentencing of Indigenous people in 1999.3 Furthermore, the Court directed sentencing judges to take judicial notice of many of the broad conclusions these commissions and task forces reached when sentencing Indigenous people in the future. Key recommendations and findings from the task forces and commissions of inquiry that preceded the Gladue decision are summarized in this chapter to provide not only background context for the development of these principles, but also convenient pinpoint references to help readers navigate these lengthy reports as needed. While the Supreme Court of Canada did not cite each and every one of the reports summarized in this chapter in Gladue, those it did rely on engaged with and built upon the many reports preceding them. Moreover, while many subsequent commissions and task forces have continued to address these issues since Gladue was decided, this chapter is focused on those pre-dating the Gladue decision as part of the underlying context on which this sentencing framework was first constructed. Some of the inquiries and task forces that post-date the Gladue decision in 1999 are referenced elsewhere in this book to the extent they have been invoked by the courts in subsequent case law. 2 R v Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 SCR 326, 1991 CanLII 45. 71, Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 Inquiry re Administration of Justice in the Hay River Area of the Northwest Territories In one of the earliest examples of an inquiry bringing attention to the underlying causes of Indigenous over-representation in the criminal justice system, Judge Morrow of the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories was appointed as a Commissioner to hold an Inquiry into the Administration of Justice in the Hay River Area of the Northwest Territories in 1967.4 He was tasked with assessing the administration of justice in the Hay River in general, in addition to investigating specific allegations made by a weekly newspaper named Tapwe \u2014Cree for 'truth'.5 Among other things, it was alleged that \"all individuals do not receive equal treatment in the Courts (of the Justices of the Peace) in Hay River\".6 Judge Morrow made it clear that he found no evidence of direct, intentional discrimination in the course of this inquiry.7 However, he did point out how the unique socio-economic circumstances of Indigenous peoples in the region resulted in differential impacts from the administration of justice. Judge Morrow concluded that Indigenous people suffered high rates of alcohol addiction in Hay River.8 Whenever this led to arrest, he found that their unfamiliarity with court procedure, the lack of interpreters, and the lack of legal representation meant they \"very often felt the only solution was to plead guilty and get it over with\".9 Judge Morrow also observed that justices of the peace were likely to assume that Indigenous people before the courts were earning their money from welfare and Indigenous women were involved in the sex trade so they would send them to jail without offering the fine option that was made available to non-Indigenous people employed in the region.10 Further, he stated that the police often felt obliged to arrest Indigenous people who were intoxicated in public on the assumption they might freeze to death or \"get into trouble\", while assuming non-Indigenous people \"probably had enough money to taxi home\".11 4 Justice William G Morrow, Inquiry re Administration of Justice in the Hay River Area of the Northwest Territories Report (Ottawa: Government of Canada, 1968). 5 Ibid at 1. 6 Ibid at 2. 7 Ibid at 2-3, 22-23. 8 Ibid at 94. 9 Ibid Ibid at 95. 11 Ibid.20 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A In light of these local circumstances, Judge Morrow recommended several reforms that included the provision of a \"friend in court\" for Indigenous people accused of crimes and more strenuous efforts to recruit Indigenous people as RCMP officers, special constables, and justices of the peace.12 More generally, he recommended improved access to legal aid and court facilities, and the provision of an alcoholic rehabilitation centre, a full- time psychiatrist, and a dedicated lawyer from the Department of Justice for the Northwest Territories, among other things.13 Native Peoples in the Administration of Justice in the Provincial Courts of Alberta Another early example of an inquiry addressing the treatment of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system can be found in the Board of Review on Native Peoples in the Administration of Justice in the Provincial Courts of Alberta. As part of a broader review of Alberta's provincial court system initiated in 1973, the Board of Review was mandated to address \"aspects of the administration of justice in Alberta affecting native people which can and should be corrected\".14 After five years of public hearings, the Board issued a series of recommendations aimed at improving accommodation of Indigenous peoples' culture, customs, and language in Alberta's provincial justice system. The Board identified issues around policing, the courts, alcohol, and the regulation of harvesting activities. Its recommendations included an endorsement of the integral role played by Indigenous court workers in Alberta's justice system, as well as a call for more uniform access to interpreters across the province.15 It also called for court sittings on reserve for certain matters.16 Indigenous over-incarceration was lightly touched upon by the Board of Review in context to incarceration for non- payment of fines and the need for alternatives.17 12 Ibid at 6. 13 Ibid at 5-6, 101-105. 14 Justice WJC Kirby (Chair), Native People and the Administration of Justice in the Provincial Courts of Alberta, Provincial Courts Board of Review: Report No 4 (Edmonton: Government of Alberta, 1978) at 1. 15 Ibid at 43-48. 16 Ibid at 30. 17 Ibid at 49. 21 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 The Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall Jr. Prosecution (Nova Scotia) In 1986, the Government of Nova Scotia initiated the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr. Prosecution \"to determine why Donald Marshall, Jr. was wrongfully convicted and to make recommendations to ensure such a miscarriage of justice does not happen again\".18 While the Commission's mandate focused on determining what had led to the wrongful conviction of Donald Marshall Jr. in 1971 (a Mi'kmaw man), it also made recommendations for broader reforms to Nova Scotia's justice system, many of which came to be echoed in subsequent commissions dealing with the treatment of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. More broadly, the Commission found that racism against visible minorities had played a part in this particular wrongful conviction. It therefore sought to identify \"specific steps that can\u2014and should\u2014be taken to reduce discrimination in the justice system itself.19 Of relevance to all visible minorities in Nova Scotia, the Commission's recommendations included: the adoption of a provincial Policy on Race Relations aimed at ensuring better representation of visible minorities as prosecutors, defence counsel, and judges;20 further education opportunities for police, law students, lawyers, and judges on the legal issues visible minorities face;21 continuing education programs for prosecutors to \"familiarize them with the problem of systemic discrimination and suggest ways in which they can reduce its impact\";22 alternative sanctions to incarceration for those too poor to pay fines;23 the development of appropriate diversion programs for Black Nova Scotians and Indigenous people in cooperation with Black Nova Scotian and Indigenous groups;24 and the encouragement of federal corrections officials to recruit and hire more minority staff, implement programs tailored to the particular needs of Black Nova Scotians and Indigenous people, and sensitize other employees to these needs.25 18 Nova Scotia, Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr, Prosecution: Digest of Findings and Recommendations (Halifax: Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr, Prosecution, 1989) at 10. 19 Ibid at 10. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid. 22 Ibid. 23 at 11. 24 Ibid. 25 Ibid.22 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A Several of the Commission's recommendations were specific to the circumstances of Indigenous people in light of their unique historic, cultural, and constitutional factors.26 It stated that Indigenous people \"have a right to a justice system that they respect and which has respect for them, and which dispenses justice in a manner consistent with and sensitive to their history, culture and language\".27 Its principle recommendation to operationalize this right was as follows: To help achieve this, we recommend that a community controlled Native Criminal Court be established in Nova Scotia, initially as a five-year pilot project. This would involve, on one or more reserves, Native Justices of the Peace hearing summary conviction cases, the development of community diversion and mediation services and community work projects as alternatives to fines and imprisonment, the establishment of aftercare services and the provision of court worker services. Native communities would be entitled to opt in or out of this pilot project model.28 In addition to this, the Commission recommended the establishment of a \"Native Justice Institute\" to address the incorporation of Indigenous law into the criminal and civil law as they apply to Indigenous people, among other important Indigenous justice issues.29 It also recommended hiring Mi'kmaq interpreters to work in all courts in the province, the establishment of an Indigenous court worker program in Nova Scotia, regular sittings of the Provincial Court on reserves, and the establishment of \"Native Justice Committees\" composed of community leaders for judges to seek advice from whenever they sentence Indigenous people.30 Further recommendations included: a study to address proportional representation of visible minorities on juries;31 funding for Nova Scotia Legal Aid to assign \"sensitized lawyers\" to work with Indigenous clients and to hire an Indigenous social worker/counsellor to act as a liaison with Indigenous people;32 the development of an Indigenous liaison program for the Nova Scotia Barristers Society, as well as educational programming for lawyers regarding the unique needs of Indigenous 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid. 28 Ibid. 29 Ibid at 11. 30 Ibid. 31 Ibid at 12. 32 Ibid.23 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 clients;33 and increased hiring and recruitment of Indigenous constables by the RCMP and municipal police forces.34 Task Force on the Reintegration of Aboriginal Offenders as Law-Abiding Citizens (Canada) In 1987, the Solicitor General of Canada established the Task Force on the Reintegration of Aboriginal Offenders as Law-Abiding Citizens to accomplish the following: Examine the process which Aboriginal offenders (status and non-status Indians, Metis, and Inuit) go through, from the time of admission to a federal penitentiary until warrant expiry, in order to identify the needs of Aboriginal offenders and to identify ways of improving their opportunities for social reintegration as law-abiding citizens, through improved penitentiary placement, through improved institutional programs, through improved preparation for temporary absences, day parole and full parole, as well as through improved and innovative supervision.35 In order to fulfill its mandate, the Task Force consulted with federal institutional staff, Indigenous inmate groups, Parole Board staff and members, Correctional Service Canada (CSC) staff, Indigenous communities, and various other organizations involved in social reintegration programming for Indigenous people.36 The Task Force interpreted its mandate in light of the recognized disproportionate representation of Indigenous people among federally incarcerated inmates at the time, as well as the disproportionately low rates of access to parole for Indigenous people.37 The Task Force's recommendations focused on the need for Indigenous-specific approaches as Indigenous people \"face unique difficulties in obtaining and completing parole\" and \"unique solutions are required because of their cultural and socio-economic backgrounds\".38 33 Ibid. 34 Ibid. 35 Canada, Final Report: Task Force on Aboriginal Peoples in Federal Corrections (Ottawa: Solicitor General of Canada, 1988) at 5. 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid. 38 Ibid at 10.24 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A Expanding on this, the Task Force argued that Indigenous-specific approaches to reintegration programming and services could likely constitute ameliorative programs aimed at remedying the disadvantages faced by individuals or groups so as to benefit from protection under s 15(2) of the Charter.39 In other words, Indigenous-specific programming would address the systemic discrimination that Indigenous people face in the prison system rather than amount to an impermissible form of reverse discrimination. The Task Force explained that systemic discrimination occurs when an apparently neutral law or program has the effect of disadvantaging people already in need of protection from discrimination, often in ways that are not readily identifiable and that require statistical analysis to detect.40 In its view, governments may institute programs that give special treatment or consideration to members of disadvantaged minorities in order to preclude or at least minimize litigation alleging systemic discrimination.41 It argued that the greater socio-economic disadvantage of Aboriginal offenders pointed to the need for special remedial treatment.42 It also concluded that \"[t]he socio-economic circumstances demanding special treatment for Aboriginal offenders include their cultural and spiritual background\".43 This would include values like community, language, family, and art.44 The Task Force issued a wide range of recommendations for reform, including: increasing data collection and further studies addressing the circumstances of Indigenous people under federal supervision;45 validating actuarial assessment tools, criteria, and procedures for their applicability to Indigenous people;46 assessing parole criteria for differential impacts on Indigenous people and, if necessary, proposing more appropriate methods;47 recognizing case assessments by Elders as having the same weight as other professional assessments for parole decisions;48 increasing Indigenous representation in the Ministry of 39 Ibid at 11. 40 Ibid. 41 Ibid. 42 Ibid at 12. 43 Ibid at 13. 44 Ibid at 14. 45 Ibid at 32-33. 46 Ibid at 36. 47 Ibid at 37. 48 Ibid at 38.25 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 the Solicitor General, in CSC, and on the National Parole Board;49 involving Indigenous communities and organizations in supervising released inmates;50 developing Indigenous cultural awareness training for correctional staff and screening new employees for their ability to work effectively with Indigenous people;51 providing treatment, training, and reintegration programming suited to the spiritual and cultural needs and way of life of Indigenous people;52 attending to the unique needs of Indigenous women in custody through opportunities to meet with families, programming in prison, and day parole facilities;53 providing institutional programming specifically designed for Inuit;54 implementing Indigenous-specific substance abuse programs;55 seeking the views of Indigenous leadership whenever inmates are released to Indigenous communities and accepting any special conditions leadership might propose, so long as they were legal;56 and developing legislation to enable Indigenous communities or organizations to assume control over certain correctional processes that affect them.57 Access to Justice: the Report of the Justice Reform Committee (British Columbia) In 1987, British Columbia appointed its own Justice Reform Committee \"to cause the justice system of the Province of British Columbia to be accessible, understandable, relevant and efficient to all those it seeks to serve\".58 Rather than being confined to criminal justice, the Committee was mandated to address citizens' attitudes and offer policy advice in various areas of the provincial justice system. Among other things, its findings addressed Indigenous people's lack of confidence in the justice system more broadly and their disproportionate rate of involvement in the criminal justice system in particular. It proposed an accommodative response: 49 Ibid at 39-42. 50 Ibid at 43.

Native people tend to resolve disputes through mediation or conciliation, bringing the community together. There is much scope for this approach within the present justice system.59 Following its review of the Justice Reform Committee's report, British Columbia undertook further consultations on Indigenous justice issues with representatives of First Nations, Tribal Councils, and off-reserve Indigenous organizations.60 This led the Province to identify five common themes for its action plan in response: 1. Individual Indigenous communities should assume increasing responsibility for providing justice services to their own people, through traditional conflict resolution practices. 2. Indigenous people should be encouraged to better understand the existing justice system; justice system personnel should be encouraged to better understand Indigenous people, their traditions and culture. 3. Regular communication between Indigenous people and the agencies of the justice system should be established. 4. A holistic approach to justice, integrating justice with broader social reconstruction initiatives, should be developed in Indigenous communities. 5. Career opportunities should be created for more Indigenous people to become involved in the delivery of justice services\u2014non-Indigenous personnel should be able to see Indigenous people as colleagues rather than just offenders or clients.61 Based on this consultation process, the Government of British Columbia proposed various specific measures for increasing Indigenous involvement in the justice system, including: establishing, training, and resourcing 25 local justice councils to \"quickly respond to justice issues on the local level\";62 establishing protocol agreements between probation offices and 59 Ibid, as cited in British Columbia, Native Justice Consultations: Progress Report and Action Plan (Victoria BC: Ministries of Solicitor General, Attorney General & Native Affairs, 1990) at 4. 60 Ibid. 61 Ibid at 8. 62 Ibid at 14.27 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 Indigenous communities;63 negotiating with Indigenous communities for on-reserve court sittings;64 inviting Indigenous proposals for diversion, community work/service, and attendance programs;65 soliciting contracts for Indigenous-operated conditional release programs for youths and adults;66 exploring reserve-based house arrest or other intermittent/ short-term sentencing alternatives with Indigenous communities;67 facilitating Indigenous community involvement in sentencing through Crown counsel;68 consulting with Indigenous leaders to establish a framework for Indigenous peacekeeping and input on sentencing and conditional release;69 and advising Indigenous communities of their right to file submissions to the provincial parole board.70 Osnaburgh Windigo Tribal Council Justice Review (Ontario) Beginning in January 1989, the Osnaburgh Windigo Tribal Council Justice Review Committee in Ontario was tasked with studying and making recommendations \"to improve the delivery of services related to the administration of justice, policing and related services, in the Windigo Tribal Council area, the Town of Pickle Lake and in the Southern Windigo Tribal Area including the communities of Saugeen, Cat Lake and Slate Falls\".71 The Committee was jointly appointed by the Government of Ontario and several Treaty No. 9 First Nations.72 This initiative was preceded by an incident in which Mr. Stanley Shingebis, a member of the Osnaburgh First Nation (now Mishkeegogamang First Nation), was arrested for public intoxication and rendered quadriplegic between the time of his arrest and his release from custody.73 The 63 Ibid. 64 Ibid at 15. 65 Ibid. 66 Ibid. 67 Ibid. 68 Ibid. 69 Ibid at 16. 70 Ibid. 71 Ontario, Report of the Osnaburgh/Windigo Tribal Council Justice Review Committee\u2014 Tay Bway Win: Truth, Justice and First Nations (Toronto: The Osnaburgh/Windigo Tribal Council Justice Review Committee, 1990) at 117, 120-121. 72 Ibid at 1. 73 Ibid.28 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A Committee expressed the view that if its recommendations were to be fully implemented, \"incidents such as the Shingebis matter would not be so likely to be repeated\".74 The Committee's recommendations are prefaced by a summary discussion of settler colonialism and its impacts on Indigenous peoples in Canada, including \"loss of land, autonomy and culture\" and cultural clashes between differing Indigenous and Euro-Canadian \"concepts of law, justice and society\".75 The relationship between its proposed reforms to the justice system and this broader context are described as follows: While this Report addresses the justice system, it is but the flashpoint where the two cultures come into poignant conflict. The Euro-Canadian justice system espouses alien values and imposes irrelevant structures on First Nations communities. The justice system, in all of its manifestations from police through the courts to corrections, is seen as a foreign one designed to continue the cycle of poverty and powerlessness. It is evident that the frustration of the First Nations communities is internalized: the victims, faced with what they experience as a repressive and racist society, victimize themselves. In most cases, both victim and offender are First Nations people. They kill and injure each other and they kill and injure themselves, having a suicide rate several times the non-native average in Canada.76 The Committee's recommendations are extensive, complex, and wide- ranging, dealing with land, economic, and social matters, on the basis that \"it is impossible to examine how the justice system impacts on these First Nations communities without looking at the underlying issues\".77 For example, it recommended granting reserve status to two of the Indigenous communities it examined and made recommendations with respect to co-management of resources, housing, water treatment, recreational facilities, drug and alcohol treatment services, family violence intervention, treaty rights, education, race relations, policing, and much more.78 With respect to the courts, its recommendations canvass holding court on reserve, post-release transportation issues, court translation services, appointment of Indigenous justices of the peace, creation of 74 Ibid. 75 Ibid at 5. 76 Ibid. 77 Ibid at 72. 78 Ibid at 72-78.29 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 Indigenous justice committees to provide information and advice on appropriate sentences, development of diversion programs and alternative measures with reference to \"traditional means or otherwise\", and reforms to legal aid and Indigenous court worker programming, among other things.79 The Committee also made a series of recommendations for improvements to probation and corrections, including recommending that probation be supervised by Indigenous residents of the same reserve who share probationers' language and culture.80 Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta In January 1990, the Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta was mandated to review the criminal justice system in relation to First Nations and M\u00e9tis in Alberta. Its objective was to identify any problems and propose solutions to ensure First Nations and M\u00e9tis \"receive fair, just and equitable treatment at all stages of the criminal justice process\".81 The Task Force introduced its final report and recommendations as a response to the disproportionate number of Indigenous people in correctional institutions and the tendency for Indigenous people to be \"at the receiving end of what appears to them to be a foreign system of justice delivered to a large extent by non-Aboriginals\".82 The Task Force identified various barriers that Indigenous people face in the criminal justice system. Among other things, it found barriers preventing Indigenous people in remote communities from accessing legal aid and obtaining bail.83 It found Indigenous people to be poorly represented by legal aid lawyers who spent insufficient time with their clients and lacked understanding of Indigenous cultures and languages.84 The Task Force also identified a greater tendency for Indigenous people 79 Ibid at 78-80. 80 Ibid at 80. 81 Alberta, Justice on Trial: Report of the Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta, vol I (Edmonton: Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta, 1991) [Justice on Trial, vol I]. 82 Ibid at 1-1. to 3-17.30 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A to plead guilty to offences to avoid remand regardless of guilt.85 It also found that automatic jail sentences were being applied to individuals who had been unable to pay fines in the past, which had a discriminatory impact on Indigenous people.86 Likewise, resources for intermittent sentencing were found to be unavailable in remote Indigenous communities.87 The Task Force concluded that the pre-sentence and pre- disposition reports written for Indigenous adults and young offenders were generally culturally insensitive as well.88 Furthermore, it found that the process for judicial interim release (i.e. bail) has a heavier impact on Indigenous people.89 Among other things, the Task Force criticized past reforms that centralized Alberta's criminal justice system and moved away from the use of lay judges on the basis that these changes undermined the accountability of the courts to Indigenous communities.90 In contrast, it endorsed a practice whereby committees of Indigenous laypersons were advising on sentences in Hinton and Fort Chipewyan at that time.91 Its recommendations also included: various forms of networking and communication between judges and Indigenous communities;92 various initiatives aimed at Indigenous representation in the justice system, including through Indigenous justices of the peace;93 improved access to translation and interpretation for Indigenous languages;94 court sittings being held closer to or within Indigenous communities;95 improved access to culturally sensitive legal counsel;96 establishment of Elder sentencing panels to assist judges;97 greater use of pre-sentence and pre-disposition reports that are \"culturally sensitive and reflective of the community sentiment\".98 85 Ibid at 4-29. 86 Ibid 90 Ibid at 4-4 to 4-5. 91 Ibid at 4-5. 92 Ibid at 4-7 to 4-8. 97 Ibid at 4-40. 98 Ibid.31 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 The Task Force dedicated one section of its final report to the roles played by judges, prosecutors, and defence lawyers. It concluded that \"[a]lthough subtle and usually unconscious, judicial bias exists\" and \"[t]he judiciary must face this fact and act to remedy it\".99 It recommended cross-cultural education as a starting point and the appointment of Indigenous judicial personnel as an improvement, while noting that some Indigenous people believe a separate justice system is needed.100 It also found that biases exist among defence counsel and Crown prosecutors that can impact the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and plea bargaining.101 Furthermore, the Task Force found that a lack of knowledge about Indigenous peoples among members of the legal profession was resulting in systemic discrimination.102 To remedy this situation, its recommendations included: intensive cross-cultural education for judges, lawyers, and prosecutors; that judges be more sensitive to and consider cultural and socio-economic factors when Indigenous people appear before them; and that defence counsel familiarize themselves \"with the total situation of an accused person\" in order to act in their best interests.103 The Task Force dedicated another short chapter to the differing premises underlying Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultures and worldviews, entitled \"An Aboriginal Perspective on Justice\".104 The Task Force, which included Professor Leroy Little Bear of the University of Lethbridge, summarized its conclusions as follows: ...The problems that Aboriginal people have with the criminal justice system are, to a large extent, a result of the implicit convictions of white society embedded in Canadian law. The end result is a clash of two cultures. For the Aboriginal people of Alberta, this results in non-fulfillment and frustration of expectations because the criminal justice system does not embody their implicit convictions about life and existence.105 The Task Force found that Indigenous worldviews tend to be \"cyclical/ holistic, generalist, and process oriented\", as compared to \"White 99 Ibid at 5-6. at 5-11. 104 \"An Aboriginal Perspective on Justice\" in Justice on Trial, vol I, supra note 81 at 9-1. 105 Ibid. 32 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A society's linear/singular worldview\".106 It identified several underlying foundations among First Nations and M\u00e9tis societies that differ from those of White society, including: the idea of equality among all creation;107 the assumption that all things have spirit and are inter-related;108 an emphasis on harmony and balance;109 the prioritizing of the group over the individual;110 communal ownership of land and resources;111 and the idea that disorder \"is corrected through rehabilitative and restorative action\".112 The Task Force also contrasted Canada's retributive model of justice to the more restorative model of justice it found in justice and dispute resolution processes among Indigenous societies.113 It stated that the latter tends to focus on: crime as a violation of one person by another; problem-solving and restoration of harmony; dialogue and negotiation as normative; restitution and reconciliation as means of restoration; justice as right relationship and harmony; and remorse, repentance, and forgiveness as important factors.114 The Task Force also found that offenders and their communities take an active role in these restorative processes, and the holistic context of an offence is taken into consideration \"including moral, social economic, political, religious and cosmic considerations\".115 In addition, the Task Force reviewed and compiled the recommendations from twenty-two earlier reports that had been prepared on the treatment of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system in Canada between 1967 and 1990.116 These included the final reports from commissions of inquiry and task forces already canvassed above, as well as several others addressing the treatment of Indigenous people in policing, corrections, 106 Ibid at 9-3. 107 Ibid at 9-3 114 Ibid. 115 Ibid. 116 \"A Review and Compilation of Recommendations of Twenty-Two Major Reports From 1967 to 1990 on Aboriginal People and the Criminal Justice System\" in Alberta, Justice on Trial: Report of the Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta, vol III (Edmonton: Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta, 1991) at 4-3 to 4-4 [Justice on Trial, vol III]. 33 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 and the broader criminal justice system in Canada.117 After reviewing these past reports, the Task Force identified the following \"top ten\" themes among past recommendations: Cross-cultural training for non-Indigenous staff; Greater Indigenous representation among staff; More community-based programs in corrections; More community-based alternatives in sentencing; Special assistance to Indigenous offenders; Indigenous community involvement in planning, decision- making, and service delivery; Indigenous advisory groups at all levels; Greater recognition of Indigenous culture and law in criminal justice system service delivery; Emphasize crime prevention programs; and Self-determination must be considered in planning and operation of the criminal justice system.118 Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba In April of 1988, the Manitoba government initiated the Public Inquiry into the Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People\u2014 117 The reports identified by the Task Force that are not addressed elsewhere in this chapter include: Canada, Task Force on Policing on Reserves Report (Ottawa: Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 1973);

First, Indigenous and non-Indigenous community leaders called for an inquiry into delays and irregularities with respect to the investigation and trial stemming from the murder of a young Indigenous woman named Helen Betty Osborne in The Pas in 1971.120 Second, several individuals called for an inquiry after J.J. Harper, executive director of the Island Lake Tribal Council, died following an encounter with a City of Winnipeg police officer who was exonerated by the police department the very next day.121 However, the inquiry's Commissioners, Associate Chief Judge Murray Sinclair and Associate Chief Justice Al Hamilton, were more broadly tasked with investigating, reporting on, and making recommendations on the overall relationship between the administration of justice and Indigenous peoples in Manitoba.122 Similar to the Task Force in Alberta, the Commissioners dedicated a chapter to similarities and differences between Indigenous and non- Indigenous concepts of justice.123 Among other things, this section outlines the prominent position and influence of Elders and healers within Indigenous societies.124 It also identifies the traditional values of the Anishinaabe, Dakota, Apache, and Cheyenne as examples of distinct Indigenous worldviews.125 More generally, the Commissioners found Indigenous societies see justice as being aimed at the restoration of peace and equilibrium within the community and the reconciliation of the accused with their conscience and those they have wronged.126 These outcomes were contrasted against the goals of controlling and preventing potentially harmful behaviour and punishing deviants as a means of control and public protection within non-Indigenous society.127 The Commissioners also addressed matters of Indigenous law, including Indigenous conflict resolution processes and systems of sanctions, which it found to be generally based on kinship and aimed at dispute resolution, 119 Manitoba, Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba (Winnipeg: Province of Manitoba, 1991), vol I at 3. 120 Ibid at 2. 121 Ibid. 122 Ibid at

harmony.128 Likewise, they identified several cultural imperatives or rules of behaviour common among Indigenous societies, including non-interference, non-competitiveness, emotional restraint, and sharing.129 The Commissioners argued that the criminal justice system's failure to recognize and understand the different cultural imperatives of Indigenous societies lies \"at the heart of systemic discrimination\".130 They asserted that \"[i]f the justice system in Manitoba is to earn the respect of Aboriginal people, it must first recognize and respect their cultures, their values and their laws\".131 The Commissioners dedicated a subsequent chapter to Indigenous over- incarceration and how it relates to racism, prejudice, and discrimination in the justice system.132 In order to explain the presence of systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system, they first identified various statistics and studies demonstrating Indigenous people are adversely impacted throughout that system, including through over-incarceration, over-charging, denial of bail, less time with lawyers, higher rates of guilty pleas, and higher rates of custodial sentences.133 They then pointed to several discriminatory factors that led to these adverse impacts on Indigenous people, including overall economic disadvantage, less formal educational credentials, linguistic barriers, cultural factors including different concepts of justice, a lack of facilities, resources, and services in Indigenous communities, and underrepresentation among decision makers in the system.134 The Commissioners argued these factors in turn lead to over-policing, higher rates of pre-trial detention, delays, difficulties, and misunderstandings in court hearings, and higher rates of incarceration for Indigenous people.135 Another chapter in the report is dedicated to the deep history of Indigenous societies in the area now encompassed by Manitoba, with a particular focus on the imposition of the Euro-Canadian legal system on Indigenous peoples and the displacement of Indigenous law.136 Building 128 Ibid at 22-29. 129 Ibid at 29-35. 130 Ibid at 36. 131 Ibid at 46. 132 Ibid at 85-113. 133 Ibid at 49-83.36 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A on this historical context, the Commissioners clearly stated their belief \"that the social situation of Aboriginal people is a direct result of a history of social, economic and cultural repression, all carried out under a cloak of legality\".137 They found that the criminal justice system \"has been a central instrument of the destructive policies of the past\".138 Yet they argued that it could play a positive role in the future by \"helping to make reasonable accommodation for Aboriginal peoples as it deals with individuals who come into conflict with the law, and with the larger Aboriginal community as that community takes control of its own justice system\".139 The Commissioners' detailed report addresses a wide variety of topics that go far beyond the scope of this publication, as well as more closely related topics on policing, jails, and child welfare. One chapter of particular relevance to the Gladue principles is entitled \"Alternatives to Incarceration\".140 There the Commissioners criticize the status quo approach to sentencing and argue for a new approach that is less dependent on prison as a sanction, that strengthens community sanctions and reconciliation programs, that focuses on the needs of victims, communities, and offenders rather than punishment, that gives greater consideration to cultural factors, and that allows the community to play a more meaningful role.141 They also criticize the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal decision in Naqitarvik\u2014discussed in Chapter 1\u2014for perpetuating the standardization of sentences for particular crimes without concern for unique circumstances and for discouraging the initiative of trial judges.142 In contrast, they recommended that the Manitoba Court of Appeal \"encourage more creativity in sentencing by trial court judges so that the use of incarceration is diminished and the use of sentencing alternatives is increased, particularly for Aboriginal peoples\".143 137 Ibid at 110. 138 Ibid at 113. 139 Ibid. 140 Ibid at 389 to 428. 141 Ibid at 402. The Commissioners elaborate on this proposal through several more detailed recommendations: 402-428. 142 Ibid at 404. 143 Ibid at 405.37 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 Law Reform Commission of Canada: Aboriginal Peoples and Criminal Justice In June of 1990, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada asked the Law Reform Commission of Canada to study the extent to which Canadian criminal law ensures that Indigenous people and members of cultural or religious minorities \"have equal access to justice and are treated equitably and with respect.144 The Commission decided to address the circumstances of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system in a report dedicated to this topic alone. In its first substantive chapter, the Commission described the \"remarkably uniform picture\" of the criminal justice system that had been drawn by the Indigenous representatives it consulted: From the Aboriginal perspective, the criminal justice system is an alien one, imposed by the dominant white society. Wherever they turn or are shuttled throughout the system, Aboriginal offenders, victims or witnesses encounter a sea of white faces. Not surprisingly, they regard the system as deeply insensitive to their traditions and values: many view it as unremittingly racist.145 The Commission went on to describe Indigenous peoples' \"vision of a justice system that is sensitive to their customs, traditions and beliefs\".146 It explained that Indigenous peoples aspire to have a criminal justice system that is Indigenous designed, run, and populated from top to bottom.147 The Commission described an Indigenous vision of justice as: being faithful to Indigenous traditions and cultural values while adapting these to modern society; evincing appropriate respect for community Elders and leaders; taking heed of the requirements of Indigenous spirituality; and paying homage to the relations between humanity, the land, and nature.148 It stated that an Indigenous vision of justice gives pre-eminence to collective interests and is holistic, integrative, and community-based.149 This approach would emphasize mediation and conciliation, but also seek acknowledgement of responsibility from 144 Law Reform Commission of Canada, Report on Aboriginal Peoples and Criminal Justice: Equality, Respect and the Search for Justice (Ottawa: Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1991) at 1. 145 Ibid at 5. 146 Ibid at 6. 147 Ibid. 148 Ibid. 149 Ibid.38 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A those who transgress societal norms.150 An Indigenous justice system would pursue the larger objective of reintegrating an offender into the community as a whole while working toward reconciliation between offender and victim.151 It is also a pluralistic vision of justice, with customary laws (i.e. Indigenous law) varying from one community to the next and promoting harmony within each community.152 The Commission interpreted its terms of reference as requiring it to go beyond the traditional focus of criminal law on formal equality, drawing on the substantive equality jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada with respect to human rights statutes and s 15 of the Charter.153 It stated that in order to ensure Indigenous people receive the same minimum level of service and are treated equitably and with respect, it must be recognized that the level of service in interaction with police, access to legal aid, and understanding of the court process is not equal among all groups in society.154 The Commission recommended as follows: ...Differences between members of various groups must be considered by police, prosecutors, defence lawyers, judges, legislators and all other participants in the criminal justice system. Indeed, the structure of the criminal justice system itself must be adjusted to allow greater recognition of those differences. Justice can no longer be blind: Justice must open her eyes to the inequities in society and see to it that they are not mirrored in the criminal justice system.155 The Commission also addressed the viability of Indigenous-controlled systems of justice. It referenced various academic publications and past reports that found Indigenous crime rates to be a product of Indigenous societies' marginalization through colonization.156 The Commission concluded that the criminal justice system itself played a role in this marginalization by displacing other mechanisms for social control such as the traditional role of Elders in Indigenous societies.157 It also canvassed cultural differences that lead to differential impacts for 150 Ibid. 151 Ibid. 152 Ibid. 153 Ibid at 9-12. 154 Ibid at 11. 155 Ibid at 12. 156 Ibid at 15. 157 Ibid.39 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 Indigenous people in the criminal justice system with respect to guilty pleas and pre-sentence reports.158 The Commission discussed the unique justice processes that already existed in some Indigenous communities, such as an Elders Council on Vancouver Island involved in diversion, bail supervision, the preparation of pre-sentence reports, speaking to sentence, and the supervision of open custody and probation at the time.159 It stated that Indigenous justice systems would be scaled to the communities themselves and would reflect their specific needs and priorities.160 In addition to its discussion of Indigenous justice systems and processes, the Commission outlined various steps to make the mainstream criminal justice system more equitable for Indigenous people.161 Among other things, the Commission recommended: programs for improved Indigenous representation in the system as police, lawyers, judges, probation officers, and correctional officials;162 expansion of Indigenous court worker programs;163 cross-cultural training for all participants in the justice system;164 incorporation of Indigenous culture into law school programs and recognition of lawyers specializing in the representation of Indigenous people by legal aid services;165 greater attention to the needs of speakers of Indigenous languages;166 creation of permanent liaison mechanisms between local Crown prosecutors and Indigenous communities and leaders;167 allowing representatives of Indigenous communities to give evidence of alternatives to custody at bail hearings, prepare release plans, and supervise individuals in the community upon release from custody;168 allowing Elders or other respected community members to sit with a judge to advise on appropriate sentences;169 and funding research regarding Indigenous law.170 158 Ibid. 159 Ibid at 17. 160 Ibid at 19. 161 Ibid at 26. 162 Ibid at 29. 163 Ibid. 164 Ibid at 30. 165 Ibid at 31. 166 Ibid at 32-34. 167 Ibid at 36. 168 Ibid at 169 Ibid. 170 Ibid at 39.40 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A The Commission prescribed myriad reforms to policing, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, charge screening, disclosure, access to counsel, and interrogation, among other topics.171 Echoing past commissions, it recommended reforms such as the appointment of more Indigenous justices of the peace and holding court in or near the Indigenous community where an offence was committed.172 It recommended amending bail legislation to ensure more equitable application to Indigenous people, such as: ensuring an accused's cultural background, community, and requirements for engaging in traditional pursuits are better understood;173 more flexible consideration of an intended surety's financial resources, character, and proximity to an accused in terms of kinship or place of residence;174 and abolishment or reduced reliance on cash deposits.175 The Commission also recommended reforms to sentencing that included: prioritizing alternatives to incarceration;176 expanding victim-offender reconciliation programs;177 and creating community service order programs in willing communities.178 Other proposed reforms included: making probation services available in a wider range of Indigenous communities;179 accommodating cultural differences in probation criteria;180 recognition of the application of traditional Indigenous sanctions as a mitigating factor for sentencing;181 greater access, detail, cultural sensitivity, and reference to the special circumstances of Indigenous people in pre-sentence reports;182 and aftercare programs for Indigenous people that are designed and administered by Indigenous community organizations.183 171 Ibid at 43-55. 172 Ibid at 57, 59. 173 Ibid at 63. 174 Ibid at 65. 175 Ibid at 66. 176 Ibid at 68. 177 Ibid at 69. 178 Ibid at 73. 179 Ibid at 74. 180 Ibid. 181 Ibid at 76. 182 Ibid at 77-78. 183 Ibid at 83.41 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 Saskatchewan Indian and Metis Justice Review Committees In June of 1991, two separate justice review committees were jointly established by provincial Indigenous organizations and the Government of Saskatchewan with parallel mandates: the Indian Justice Review Committee and the Metis Justice Review Committee. The Committees were established to formulate recommendations for the delivery of criminal justice services to First Nations and M\u00e9tis in the province, with a particular focus on the development and operation of practical, community-based initiatives to enhance those services.184 The Committees were given a six-month timeframe to propose \"practical changes and initiatives that could be implemented almost immediately, or within a very reasonable period of time\".185 Among other things, the Committees recommended: establishing Indigenous justice committees for youth and adults that could make sentencing recommendations, assist with the preparation of pre-sentence reports, and administer alternative measures;186 developing employment equity programs aimed at proportionate representation of Indigenous people in various aspects of the criminal justice system;187 developing cross-cultural and race sensitivity training for various actors in the criminal justice system;188 reforming civilian complaints mechanisms for police services;189 re-establishing an Indigenous court worker program on a province-wide basis;190 establishing culturally appropriate and holistic youth and adult mediation, diversion, and reconciliation programs, with eligibility criteria that encourage Indigenous participation;191 encouraging more flexibility and creativity from prosecutors and judges with respect to the use of pre-trial custody and custodial sentences for Indigenous offenders, and greater use of culturally appropriate alternative 184 Saskatchewan, Report of the Saskatchewan Indian Justice Review Committee (Regina: Saskatchewan Indian Justice Review Committee, 1992) at 1; Saskatchewan, Report of the Saskatchewan Metis Justice Review Committee (Regina: Saskatchewan Indian Justice Review Committee, 1992) at 1. 185 Ibid at 1. 186 Ibid at 14, 41. 187 Ibid at 17, 21, 35, 56. 188 Ibid at 17, 23, 25, 36-37, 49-50, 52-53. 189 Ibid 31-32.

The report's first substantive chapter is entitled \"Clash of Cultures\".203 It provides a short history of settler colonialism in the region, ranging from the introduction of smallpox to the imposition of the residential school system and the Indian Act.204 The Commission noted that \"from the beginning, government officials were unable or unwilling to accept that the community- and family-centred cultural values of the native people were irreconcilable with the values of a free-enterprise, individual- oriented, self-acquisitive society\".205 It also outlined a contemporary \"attitude problem\" among the non-Indigenous population from which police officers were recruited in the region, which led officers to \"unquestioningly accept allegations made against natives while keeping a closed mind to anything they raise in answer\", and explained their \"apparent disrespect for any rights of native people and the aggression and arrogance to which they are often subjected\".206 Most of the Commission's findings relate to policing. Yet its report does canvass cultural and language barriers within the judicial process, including the impossibility of translating terms like \"guilt\" and \"innocence\" into local Indigenous languages, and the foreignness of non-Indigenous standards of proof and civil procedure for witness testimony.207 The Commission contrasted the community-level dispute resolution processes of Indigenous peoples in the region against the adversarial court process, which \"runs counter to their traditional values and understanding\".208 It also provided examples of language barriers preventing Indigenous accused from understanding this process.209 The Commission found that Indigenous people have not been well- served by the process of justice of non-Indigenous society and \"[c]ultural differences have left a wide chasm that will not be easy to bridge\".210 It noted that the Indigenous peoples of the region were seeking to 202 Ibid. 203 Ibid at 9. 204 Ibid at 9-11 205 Ibid at 10. 206 Ibid at 11. 207 Ibid at 13. 208 Ibid THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A control their own lives, manage their own affairs, and create a process of justice that is \"comprehensible and culturally acceptable to them\".211 The Commission stated that the non-Indigenous court system must be made more accessible and comprehensible to Indigenous people. It also urged judges to adopt \"a sensitive and knowledgeable approach\" to engaging with evolving Indigenous justice processes.212 The Commission's recommendations with respect to the courts include: appointing and training Indigenous justices of the peace who are fluent in local Indigenous languages;213 accommodating requests from Indigenous leaders for court sittings to be held in their communities;214 training family counsellors and establishing safe houses for victims in peril in Indigenous communities;215 improving the preparation of prosecutors and the transparency of their decision-making in the region;216 improving the coordination and management of legal aid services in the region;217 and ensuring Indigenous court workers are fluent in local Indigenous languages.218 Advisory Committee on the Administration of Justice in Aboriginal Communities (Qu\u00e9bec) In December 1992, the Government of Qu\u00e9bec appointed the Advisory Committee on the Administration of Justice in Aboriginal Communities, chaired by Judge Coutu of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec.219 The Committee was mandated \"to conduct a systematic and orderly consultation intended to devise models of justice able to respond to the specific needs of each Aboriginal community in Qu\u00e9bec and respectful of the traditions, customs and socio-cultural values of those communities\".220 Among other things, 211 Ibid. 212 Ibid. 213 Ibid at 36-37. 214 Ibid at 37-38. 217 Ibid at 38-39. 218 Ibid at 41. 219 Quebec, Justice for and by the Aboriginals: Report and Recommendations of the Advisory

Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 it was asked to consider models put forward during a justice summit in 1992, including mediation, diversion, justices of the peace, and justice committees.221 Indigenous communities had agreed to these models as an interim measure during the negotiated transfer of responsibility for services to Indigenous peoples.222 While many Indigenous communities within Qu\u00e9bec participated in the process, the Mal\u00e9cit, Mohawk, and Cree Nations chose not to participate.223 The Committee found that not one of the Indigenous communities that did participate in its consultation process outright rejected Qu\u00e9bec's criminal justice system and criminal laws.224 Only the laws governing hunting and fishing were singled out as inherently problematic.225 However, they did express a general uneasiness, dissatisfaction, or grave insecurity with respect to the justice system being misunderstood, insufficiently informed about Indigenous realities, and administered by people perceived as foreigners.226 Most of the communities that participated were also confident that they could assume at least partial responsibility for the administration of justice.227 As a result of its consultations, the Committee found mediation to be a model for resolving conflicts that is well accepted by Indigenous communities and all those involved in the administration of justice.228 It was found to be consistent with Indigenous cultures and perspectives in that it aims to create consensus rather than confrontation.229 The Committee recommended mediators be chosen from members of a justice committee and suggested mediation could have benefits if applied to areas such as youth protection matters.230 At the same time, it found that mediation should not be a substitute for criminal prosecution in cases of family violence or sexual assault.231 221 Ibid. 222 Ibid at 11. 223 Ibid at 19. 224 Ibid at 20. 225 Ibid. 226 Ibid at 21. 227

well received by both members of Indigenous communities and those involved in the existing justice system.232 It was found to be consistent with Indigenous cultures and perspectives in that it allows for a reconciliation process to be initiated rather than solely focusing on punishment.233 The Committee found diversion could facilitate the transfer of responsibility to Indigenous communities and should result in lower crime rates and fewer prison terms.234 It also noted diversion was being practised in other provinces and territories and found this could provide a more expedient and cost effective alternative for remote communities in particular.235 The Committee found that a majority of the Indigenous communities in Qu\u00e9bec wished to have Indigenous justices of the peace appointed.236 While it recognized legislative amendments would be necessary, the Committee anticipated these justices of the peace would have extensive jurisdiction over summary offences, municipal or band by-laws, and potentially even youth protection matters.237 It linked the establishment of Indigenous justices of the peace to the adoption of more Indigenous community by-laws that would be administered locally.238 It anticipated Indigenous justices of the peace would improve the day-to-day administration of justice, particularly with respect to detention hearings.239 Based on the input of the communities and organizations it consulted, the Committee found that the creation of justice committees in Indigenous communities \"constitutes one of the best ways to have the community participate in the administration of justice\".240 These committees would be made up of community members, including Elders, women, and young people.241 Among other things, they would provide input on sentencing, assist in elaborating by-laws, ensure follow up on probation orders, supervise community work programs, and suggest sentencing 232 Ibid at 33. 233 Ibid. 234 Ibid. at 34. 238 Ibid. 239 Ibid. 240 Ibid at 50. 241 Ibid at 44.47 Chapter 2: Prior Task Forces and Commissions of InquiryCHAPTER 2 circles if the need arises.242 Some of the Indigenous communities the Committee consulted had already formed justice committees of their own initiative whereas others wanted assistance in setting these up.243 The Committee recommended that justice committees assume the role of diversion committees as well.244 It also recommended that each justice committee have a paid coordinator with adequate training and support.245 The Committee also consulted on the potential use of sentencing circles in Qu\u00e9bec. While several Indigenous communities wished to be consulted by judges on their choice of sentences, doing so by way of a sentencing circle was not universally accepted.246 The Committee ultimately recommended encouraging judges to consult Indigenous communities in sentencing either through one of the methods proposed in its report, or \"any other method which may be developed in concert with the communities and those involved in the justice system\".247 In addition to its consultations on particular models like justice committees and justices of the peace, the Committee addressed broader concerns raised by Indigenous communities and organizations. For example, it recommended that the concerns of Indigenous women's organizations be taken into account and that Indigenous women and men should participate on \"as equal a footing as possible\" in the operation of the proposed models.248 It also recommended: reforms to the provision of legal aid;249 new public legal education initiatives;250 improved accommodation of Indigenous languages and access to interpreters;251 Indigenous advisors and training on Indigenous peoples' \"habits and customs\" for judges;252 improved communications between prosecutors and authorities in Indigenous communities, and training for prosecutors with respect to Indigenous peoples' \"customs and usages\";253 242 Ibid. 243 Ibid Ibid at 51. 245 Ibid. 246 Ibid at 56. 247 Ibid at 65. 248 Ibid. 249 Ibid at

Commission on Aboriginal Peoples\u2014 Bridging the Cultural Divide (Canada) In August 1991, the Government of Canada established the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples with a comprehensive mandate to investigate and propose specific solutions regarding the evolution of the relationship between Indigenous peoples, the Canadian government, and Canadian society as a whole.255 Prior to issuing their five-volume final report in 1996, the Commissioners released Bridging the Cultural Divide as a special report that same year.256 In that report they acknowledged that \"literally hundreds of recommendations by task forces and commissions of inquiry\" had already been issued on how to reform the criminal justice system to make it more respectful and responsive to the experience of Indigenous people.257 For this reason, they chose to focus on providing a framework for implementing those past recommendations, as well as proposing the recognition and establishment of Indigenous justice systems.258 Echoing prior commissions, the Commissioners found that Indigenous perspectives on justice differ from how non-Indigenous Canadians think of the administration of justice as a highly specialized and professionalized aspect of society.259 They stated that Indigenous perspectives of justice reflect distinctive Indigenous worldviews and \"in particular a holistic understanding of peoples' relationships and responsibilities to each other and to their material and spiritual world\".260 According to the Commissioners, \"Aboriginal conceptions of justice must be understood as part of the fabric of social and political life rather than as a distinct, 254 Ibid at 110-111. 255 Canada, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: Looking Forward, Looking Back, vol 1

They stated that Indigenous peoples' perception of the justice system as illegitimate and oppressive has deep historical roots and Indigenous peoples' contemporary realities in the justice system must be understood in a historical context of their relationship with non-Indigenous people.262 They also canvassed the distinctive nature of Indigenous laws and justice systems, as well as the different assumptions underlying them.263 The Commissioners found a remarkable consensus in its review of past reports on how the criminal justice system has failed Indigenous people, but also found \"notwithstanding the hundreds of recommendations from commissions and task forces, the reality for Aboriginal people in 1996 is that the justice system is still failing them\".264 They noted the continuing trend towards Indigenous over-incarceration and sought to identify its root causes.265 The Commissioners found that recent studies and reports had confirmed that the over-representation of Indigenous people in the justice system is both linked to disproportionately high crime rates and a consequence of systemic discrimination.266 They also pointed to how systemic discrimination has contributed to higher crime rates among Indigenous people due to the phenomenon of simultaneous over- policing and under-policing of Indigenous people and communities.267 The Commissioners identified three primary explanatory theories for Indigenous over-incarceration and socio-economic disadvantage that point in different directions: 1) First, they identified the theory of cultural clash or conflict that views Indigenous disadvantage as a result of cultural differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.268 While the Commissioners agreed that cultural conflict explains much of the alienation that Indigenous people experience in the justice system, they cautioned that an exclusive focus on this explanation locates the source of the problem within Indigenous cultures, assumes Indigenization of the existing system will be sufficient, 261 Ibid. 262 Ibid at 7. 263 Ibid at 12-25. at 26-27. 265 Ibid 268 Ibid at 40-42.50 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A and obscures structural problems grounded in the economic and social inequalities experienced by Indigenous people.269 2) Second, they identified the theory that Indigenous over- incarceration can be explained as \"a particular example of the established correlation between social and economic deprivation and criminality\".270 The Commissioners agreed that economic and social deprivation is a major underlying cause of disproportionately high rates of criminality among Indigenous people, as well as a direct contributor to the systemic discrimination they face in the justice system.271 They also accepted that socio-economic factors could aggravate other cultural factors, such as how over-crowded housing aggravated the already problematic nature of sedentary living being imposed on the James Bay Cree.272 3) Nevertheless, the Commissioners found that the cultural and socio-economic explanations for Indigenous over-incarceration need to be integrated with a broader historical and political analysis that can explain how Indigenous people have been made \"poor beyond poverty\".273 They identified the relationship of colonialism as providing \"an overarching conceptual and historical link in understanding much of what has happened to Aboriginal peoples\".274 In their view, responding to the historical roots of Indigenous crime and social disorder requires healing of relationships both internally within Indigenous societies and communities and externally between Indigenous and non- Indigenous people.275 While the remainder of the report is focused on the establishment of Indigenous courts and justice systems, which goes beyond the scope of this publication, the Commissioners did canvass and endorse various existing initiatives, including Indigenous constables and police forces, Indigenous justices of the peace and judges, Indigenous court workers, cultural awareness training programs, diversion programs, Elder panels, 269 Ibid. 270 Ibid at 42.

also undertook detailed case studies of the Community Council Project of Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto and the Hollow Water First Nation's Community Holistic Circle Healing Project in Manitoba in order to identify best practices for future initiatives.277 Furthermore, they highlighted the federal government's failure to implement recommendations from previous commissions and recommended that accountability mechanisms be put in place for both past commissions and the Commission's own further recommendations.278 Conclusion Many of the factual conclusions reached by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gladue may be more transparent and meaningful when read in light of the myriad findings of prior commissions of inquiry and task forces. The Gladue decision is just one example among many of Canadian courts incorporating these reports into their sentencing decisions. Yet the Gladue framework may be particularly challenging to grasp without this context in mind. Well in advance of the enactment of s 718.2(e) and the Supreme Court of Canada's purposive interpretation of this provision, commissions and task forces were undertaking extensive research and engaging in consultations on the underlying causes of Indigenous over- incarceration and its solutions. They consistently identified systemic discrimination throughout the criminal justice system, regardless of intention, including in policing, bail, sentencing, parole, and corrections. Many identified unconscious biases and knowledge gaps among sentencing judges, Crown prosecutors, and defence counsel, among others. They urged the incorporation and accommodation of Indigenous languages, practices, cultures, and legal traditions within the mainstream justice system. And they called for more involvement of Indigenous individuals and collectives in all aspects of the administration of justice, including bail, sentencing, probation, and parole. Above all, these reports emphasize the alienation of Indigenous peoples from a criminal justice system that reflects a foreign worldview, a foreign legal tradition, and foreign perspectives. They anticipate accommodation of the distinct legal, cultural, and historical perspectives of Indigenous peoples through a variety of alternative procedures, such 276 Ibid at 82-147. 277 Ibid at 148-176. 278 Ibid at 289-291.52 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A as justice committees, Elder panels, culturally sensitive pre-sentence reports, specialized courts, and alternative dispute resolution processes, as well as alternative community-based dispositions. Furthermore, these reports explain that Indigenous over-incarceration is more than just a consequence of socio-economic marginalization and culture clash; it must also be viewed within the broader context and narrative of settler colonialism.53 CHAPTER 3: LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND CONTEXT While the Gladue sentencing framework reflects the accumulation of knowledge from many cases and studies that came before it, the Supreme Court of Canada's decision is fundamentally based on a purposive and remedial interpretation of Parliament's statutory direction in s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code. This provision mandates that courts must consider \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment\" that are reasonable in the circumstances when crafting a fit sentence for any person regardless of background. However, it also compels them to do so \"with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders\". Section 718.2(e) neither explicitly sets out the specific alternative sanctions that might be available nor does it specify the circumstances of Indigenous people that must be considered. These were left to the courts to explore in context to the many other amendments that came with it. In interpreting this two-part directive from Parliament, the Supreme Court of Canada sought guidance from its legislative history and context, which supported its interpretation that Indigenous people must be sentenced \"differently\" to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in each case.1 To round out the historical and legal context from which the Gladue principles emerged it is worth briefly canvassing that legislative debate and context here as well. Introduction of Bill C-41 (The Sentencing Reform Act) The brief legislative mention of the circumstances of Indigenous people in s 718.2(e) came as part of an ambitious series of statutory reforms to the sentencing process within the Criminal Code. In January 24, 1994, following the speech from the throne for Canada's 35th Parliament, then Minister of Justice and Attorney General Allan Rock set the tone for these changes by announcing that his government's upcoming agenda 1 R v Gladue, THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A would include attention to equal access to justice and equal treatment in the justice system.2 Among other things, this would include \"the search for better ways of ensuring that the justice needs of aboriginal peoples are recognized and acted upon\".3 He further elaborated on this broader agenda for criminal justice reform as follows: Aboriginal people, among others, say the law has become a system more about process than about justice and to some extent they are right. In many aboriginal communities there is now a remarkable will to actually do something about this challenge. It is a will to carve out new relationships with the justice system. The process of change will be gradual and difficult but we have an obligation to aggressively pursue this opportunity for change. ...4 In June 1994, Minister Rock went on to introduce Bill C-41 (The Sentencing Reform Act), proposing comprehensive reforms to the sentencing process under the Criminal Code.5 These amendments were subsequently debated and passed before being proclaimed into force in 1996.6 The amendments were the culmination of over a decade of research and public consultation on sentencing reform. They created a new Part XXIII of the Criminal Code that included the following elements: enabling provisions for alternative measures (diversion) programs; a statement of the purpose and principles of sentencing; a statutory code of procedure and evidence for sentencing; modernized probation provisions; a new fine regime; a stand-alone restitution order; and an enabling provision for conditional sentences as a new sentencing alternative.7 In short, Bill C-41 addressed reform to both the sentencing process and the available outcomes. Among other things, Parliament authorized alternative measures in s 717 of the Criminal Code in order to increase opportunities for creative, individualized responses to relatively minor offences, including restitution, personal service work for the victim, community service 2 House of Commons Debates, 35th Parl, 1st Sess, No 9 (27 Jan 1994) (Hon Allan Rock). 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 5 House of Commons Debates, 35th Parl, 1st Sess, No 84 (13 June 1994) (Hon Allan Rock). 6 For a more detailed discussion of the background to these amendments, see David Daubney & Gordon Parry, \"An Overview of Bill C-41 (The Sentencing Reform Act)\" in Julian V. Roberts & David P . Cole, Making sense of sentencing (University of Toronto Press, 1999). 7 Ibid at 33.55 Chapter 3: Legislative History and ContextCHAPTER 3 work, mediation (where the victim agrees), and referral to specialized programs for counselling and treatment.8 It also introduced a statement of the purpose and principles of sentencing in s 718. This not only codified existing objectives from the jurisprudence such as denunciation, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation, but it \"also signal[led] Parliament's interest in the restorative justice objectives of restoration for harm done to victims and the community and in promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of harm done to victims and to the community\".9 The fundamental principle of sentencing was identified as proportionality in s 718.1, stating that every sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Further principles were set out in s 718.2, including s 718.2(e). Section 718.2(d) codified the principle of restraint: \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\". Immediately following this principle of restraint, Parliament directed that sentencing judges must consider all reasonable and available alternatives to prison with particular attention to the circumstances of Indigenous people via s 718.2(e). This provision formed part of an extensive series of amendments that not only directed courts to reduce their reliance on incarceration and to explore all available alternatives, but also enabled them to do so through new sentencing options like conditional sentences and expanded options for alternative measures. Furthermore, it placed restorative justice sentencing objectives alongside traditional objectives within Canadian sentencing jurisprudence like deterrence and denunciation. Section 718.2(e) in context to emerging Indigenous justice initiatives Minister of Justice Allan Rock made it clear that the rationale behind s 718.2(e) was to address the disproportionate representation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system by encouraging courts to examine alternatives. Speaking to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, he explained the provision as follows: [T]he reason we referred specifically there to aboriginal persons is that they are sadly overrepresented in the prison populations 8 Ibid at 33-34. 9 Ibid at 34.56 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART A of Canada. I think it was the Manitoba justice inquiry that found that although aboriginal people make up only 12% of the population of Manitoba, they comprise over 50% of the prison inmates. Nationally aboriginal persons only represent about 2% of Canada's population, but they represent 10.6% of persons in prison. Obviously there's a problem here. What we're trying to do, particularly having regard to the initiatives in the aboriginal communities to achieve community justice, is to encourage courts to look at alternatives where it's consistent with the protection of public\u2014alternatives to jail\u2014 and not simply resort to that easy answer in every case.10 Other Members of Parliament within the Government of Canada at the time similarly linked Bill C-41 to both the unique circumstances of Indigenous people and innovative justice initiatives for Indigenous sentencing that had already emerged by the mid-1990s. For example, the Honourable Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Nova Scotia) described Bill C-41 as recognizing \"that wherever appropriate, alternative measures designed to meet the special needs of aboriginal offenders should be used\".11 The Honourable Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Ontario) described Bill C-41 as having the potential for change \"from the aboriginal perspective\" by building on existing leadership for justice reform and community-based pilot projects already in existence.12 The Honourable Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Saskatchewan) emphasized that Bill C-41 would provide alternatives to incarceration for Indigenous people by relating these changes to the emerging use of sentencing circles in Saskatchewan's courts, giving an example of an urban sentencing circle that was successfully held in the City of Saskatoon.13 His remarks echo several of the points raised in both the case law and the reports canvassed in the previous two chapters: [...] The use of alternatives for aboriginal offenders is a very important principle of this bill. In my province of Saskatchewan 10 House of Commons, Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence, no 62 (Nov 17, 1994). 11 House of Commons Debates, 35th Parl, 1st Sess, No 93 (20 Sept 1994) at 5909 (Hon Roseanne Skoke). 12 House of Commons Debates, 35th Parl, 1st Sess, No 108 (18 Oct 1994) at 6817 (Hon Derek Lee). 13 House of Commons Debates, 35th Parl, 1st Sess, No 95 (22 Sept 1994) at 6028 (Hon Morris Bodnar).57 Chapter 3: Legislative History and ContextCHAPTER 3 the aboriginal population is the fastest growing segment of society today. It also represents a disproportionate percentage of the offenders incarcerated. The courts in Saskatchewan have started to experiment with sentencing circles. A sentencing circle brings together elders of the community and also includes members of the non-native community and professionals such as lawyers and police officers. The emphasis is not on retribution but rather on returning to the community its sense of harmony as defined by the aboriginal population.14 Members in opposition characterized s 718.2(e) in a similar light even if they vehemently opposed its inclusion in Bill C-41, linking it to the precedents already set by sentencing circles and other emerging initiatives.15 The Honourable Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, Quebec) of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois went so far as to describe s 718.2(e) as trying to \"sneak through the back door the concept of a parallel system of justice for Aboriginals\", calling it an \"enormity hidden under nine sneaky words\".16 To Ms. Venne, this was a \"horror\" that would allow Indigenous people to \"benefit from a legal system different from that which applies to all other Canadians\"\u2014\"a parallel justice, an ethnic justice, a cultural justice\".17 While there was clearly no consensus among the political parties on whether Indigenous people ought to be sentenced differently, it appears to have been common ground that this is precisely what s 718.2(e) would encourage and enable. Conclusion In sum, the \"nine sneaky words\" set out in s 718.2(e), calling for particular attention to the circumstances of Indigenous people when exploring every reasonable and available alternative to incarceration, entered the Criminal Code in a very specific historical and legal context. They were part of a complete overhaul of the Canadian sentencing regime, including its objectives, process, and available outcomes.

Parliament clearly linked the provision to Indigenous alienation from the mainstream justice system, Indigenous over- representation in that system, and Indigenous peoples' unique justice needs. Furthermore, it was meant to build on the existing leadership and agency of Indigenous peoples as reflected in the Indigenous justice initiatives that had already emerged by that time.ABORIGINAL PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR OWN CULTURES...

THE RELATIONSHIP OF COLONIALISM PROVIDES THE ACCOMMODATIVE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA62 PART B: THE ACCOMMODATIVE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA The most logical starting point for any detailed discussion of the Gladue principles would be the Supreme Court of Canada's Gladue decision itself. While this framework has received extensive interpretation in the decisions of sentencing judges and appellate courts from across Canada, the most authoritative statements of the law remain those of our highest court. In the chapters that follow the Supreme Court of Canada's relatively steadfast approach to the Gladue principles will be traced from its initial judicial notice of widespread bias and systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system in Williams all the way to their more recent consideration in Friesen in context to the disproportionate rates of victimization that Indigenous children and youth contend with. Over two decades of case law from the Supreme Court of Canada amply demonstrate the versatility of these principles when understood at the highest level of abstraction as directions for courts to recognize and accommodate the circumstances that make Indigenous people unique and that feed into systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system. 63 In Gladue, the Supreme Court of Canada took into account the sentencing jurisprudence that predated this case, the legislative context and debate around s 718.2(e), and the long line of commissions and task forces that addressed Indigenous over-incarceration prior to this amendment to the Criminal Code, as summarized in Part A. However, the framework the Supreme Court articulated in Gladue builds from these foundations to provide a more flexible, practical, and systematic approach. Judicial notice of the social context of systemic discrimination, settler colonialism, and widespread racism that Indigenous people face is now a mandatory consideration whenever an Indigenous person comes before the court for sentencing. The Supreme Court also instructed judges, counsel on both sides, and the authors of pre-sentence reports to pay more attention to the unique circumstances of Indigenous people going forward. The Court called for a holistic approach to sentencing Indigenous people that not only attends more carefully to the circumstances of the individual being sentenced, but also to victims and communities. The broad principles and concepts established in the Gladue decision address everything from the constrained circumstances that many Indigenous people face to the different worldviews and legal perspectives of Indigenous collectives and communities. All of these differences have implications for the sentencing process, and each may need to be accommodated elsewhere in the broader legal system as well. 64 CHAPTER 4: JUDICIAL NOTICE OF DISCRIMINATION IN WILLIAMS By the late 1990s, a more accommodative approach to sentencing Indigenous people had clear legislative backing, theoretical and empirical support from several decades of studies and reports, and the benefit of experience and insight from early innovative judicial decisions. Yet a wider implementation of these modifications to sentencing practices for Indigenous people faced an additional barrier in terms of institutional constraints on the courts and counsel in the day-to-day functioning of the criminal justice system. While the Gladue decision was preceded by a number of significant and promising pilot projects within Indigenous communities and judicial experiments in specific courts and regions, this is no indication that they had become the rule rather than the exception by the 1990s. Much of the early jurisprudence canvassed in the first chapter emphasized the need for detailed information and extensive community involvement as the prerequisites for any alternative sentencing practices to be undertaken for Indigenous people. However, the timeliness of the delivery of justice under the Criminal Code was clearly a concern in the 1990s as well. Of particular note, the Supreme Court of Canada decided a pair of appeals in 1998 clarifying that a person's Charter right to be tried within a reasonable time would be extended to the sentencing process that follows trial.1 Likewise, the legislative direction in s 718.2(e) was accompanied by Parliament's insistence that sentencing must take place \"as soon as practicable\" after conviction, as set out in s 720 along with other reforms to the overall sentencing process. This tension between practical, time-constrained procedural concerns and the deep seated systemic factors that underlie Indigenous over-incarceration and alienation appear to have set the stage for the Supreme Court's addition of judicial notice to the analysis in Gladue. 1 R v MacDougall, [1998] 3 SCR 45, 1998 CanLII 763; R v Gallant, [1998] 3 SCR 80, 1998 CanLII 764.65 Chapter 4: Judicial Notice of Discrimination in WilliamsCHAPTER 4 The factual context and lower court decisions One year prior to releasing the Gladue decision, the Supreme Court addressed questions of judicial notice and anti-Indigenous racism in the distinct procedural context of jury trials in the Williams decision. Victor Williams, an Indigenous man, sought to appeal his conviction for robbery of a pizza parlour in Victoria, British Columbia.2 He had pleaded not guilty and elected for trial by jury. His defence was essentially that someone else committed the robbery. The legal issue that made its way up to the Supreme Court was whether Mr. Williams had a right to question potential jurors to determine whether they \"possess prejudice\" against Indigenous people that might impair their partiality\u2014in other words, to challenge them for cause.3 In first applying to question potential jurors for racial bias, Mr. Williams filed materials alleging widespread racism against Indigenous people in Canadian society along with an affidavit stating in part that he hoped the jurors were not \"Indian haters\".4 The initial trial judge accepted this evidence and allowed Mr. Williams to ask the potential jurors whether their ability to judge the evidence in the case without bias, prejudice, or partiality might be affected by the fact that he was an \"Indian\" and the complainant was white.5 Additional questions were allowed to clarify responses and twelve potential jurors were disqualified for risk of bias as a result. The Crown successfully applied for a mistrial based on procedural issues and the \"unfortunate publicity\" stemming from this jury selection process.6 At the commencement of a second trial, Mr. Williams again applied for an order to challenge jurors for cause in relation to the risk of bias against Indigenous people. His second application was supported by the ruling and transcript from the first motion, as well as testimony from four witnesses. The motions judge accepted that the evidence supported the view that Indigenous people \"historically have been and continue to be the object of bias and prejudice which, in some respects, has become more overt and widespread in recent years as the result of tensions created 2 R v Williams, [1998] 1 SCR 1128, 1998 CanLII 6 Ibid.66 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B by developments in such areas as land claims and fishing rights\".7 He also acknowledged there was a reasonable possibility that a potential juror would be biased against an Indigenous person charged with robbery of a white person. However, the motions judge was of the view that \"there was no reasonable possibility that this bias would translate into partiality at the trial, because jurors can be expected to put aside their biases and because the jury system provides effective safeguards against such biases\".8 The judge who presided over the second trial denied a renewed application to challenge potential jurors for cause but did instruct the jury that it ought to \"be aware of or disregard any bias or prejudice that they might feel towards Williams as a native person\".9 Mr. Williams appealed his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the sole issue of the court dismissing his application to challenge potential jurors for cause. Speaking for the Court of Appeal, Justice Macfarlane found no error in principle in the decision of the motions judge. He considered the evidence and quoted at length from the Bridging the Cultural Divide report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in order to conclude that non-Indigenous people can in fact have subconscious biases against Indigenous people and that Indigenous people perceive the justice system as unfair and inconsistent with their traditions, values, and culture.10 Justice Macfarlane found ample evidence in the materials before him of Indigenous over-incarceration and systemic discrimination due to socio-economic factors as well. However, he also found a lack of studies demonstrating this general bias would affect the decision-making of jurors. The decision of the motions judge and the subsequent conviction were upheld. Widespread racial prejudice in the community may be subject to judicial notice The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously allowed an appeal from this decision. In doing so, the Court outlined the Canadian approach to jury trials and how it would be modified to address widespread anti- 7 Ibid at para 3. 8 Ibid at 5. 9 Ibid at 6. 10 R v Williams (1996), [1997] 1 153, 1996 CanLII 3687 (BCCA) at paras 57.67 Chapter 4: Judicial Notice of Discrimination in WilliamsCHAPTER 4 Indigenous bias and discrimination. Potential jurors are presumed to be indifferent or impartial and counsel must raise concerns that displace this presumption before challenging or questioning them. This usually entails calling evidence in order to substantiate the basis for such concerns, but the Court stated that it could also be the subject of judicial notice if it is notorious \"in the sense of being widely known and accepted\".11 Among other things, it may be possible to take judicial notice of the existence of racial prejudice in the community from which the jury pool is drawn as a fact so notorious as to \"not be the subject of dispute between reasonable people\".12 The Court also held that a judicial finding of widespread racial prejudice in the community could allow judges in subsequent cases to take judicial notice of this fact. Furthermore, it pointed out that \"events and documents of indisputable accuracy may permit judicial notice to be taken of widespread racism in the community\" as well.13 Emphasizing the need for practical solutions, the Court urged against \"duplicat[ing] the investment in time and resources\" involved in establishing prejudice in the community in all subsequent cases.14 Judicial notice would allow for practices to change over time and avoid endless re-litigation of these complex issues. Foreshadowing Gladue, the Court suggested that similar concerns warranted consideration with respect to other aspects of criminal procedure as well: ...[i]t is unlikely that long inquiries into the existence of widespread racial prejudice in the community will become a regular feature in the criminal trial process. While these comments are not necessarily limited to challenges for cause, the question whether they are applicable to other phases of the criminal trial is not to be decided in the present case.15 Racial prejudice can unconsciously shape the daily behaviour of individuals The Supreme Court went on to address the nature of racial prejudice and its potential impact on jury decision-making as a form of unintentional discrimination: 11 Williams SCC, supra note 2 at para 12 Ibid at 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid.68 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B ...racial prejudice interfering with jurors' impartiality is a form of discrimination. It involves making distinctions on the basis of class or category without regard to individual merit. It rests on preconceptions and unchallenged assumptions that unconsciously shape the daily behaviour of individuals. Buried deep in the human psyche, these preconceptions cannot be easily and effectively identified and set aside, even if one wishes to do so. ...16 Judges may infer that some people will struggle to identify and eliminate biases The Supreme Court held that \"[r]acial prejudice and its effects are as invasive and elusive as they are corrosive\".17 It stated that post- jury selection safeguards might not suffice on their own given \"the destructive potential of subconscious racial prejudice\".18 The Court urged lower courts to err on the side of caution by permitting prejudices to be examined whenever doubts are raised. It also took the additional step of disagreeing with the British Columbia Court of Appeal's finding in another case that \"concrete evidence\" is needed in order to challenge prospective jurors regarding their biases.19 Instead, the Court held that \"[w]here widespread racial bias is shown, it may well be reasonable for the trial judge to infer that some people will have difficulty identifying and eliminating their biases\" and to permit challenges on this basis.20 In other words, the tension between general knowledge of the existence of anti-Indigenous bias and discrimination in the criminal justice and the specific individuals and facts before the court can be bridged by reasonable inferences. 16 Ibid at para 21. 17 Ibid at para 22. 18 Ibid. 19 Ibid at para 23. 20 Ibid.69 Chapter 4: Judicial Notice of Discrimination in WilliamsCHAPTER 4 Widespread racism has led to systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system The Court found ample evidence that widespread prejudice could have affected the impartiality of the jurors. It found \"[r]acism against aboriginals includes stereotypes that relate to credibility, worthiness and criminal propensity\".21 The Court also found that \"widespread racism has translated into systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system\", citing reports from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall Jr. Prosecution, and the Cariboo-Chilcotin Justice Inquiry for this conclusion.22 It held that in these circumstances, the trial judge should have allowed the accused to challenge the prospective jurors for cause. Conclusion In Williams, the Supreme Court of Canada set the stage for its distinct methodology for the sentencing of Indigenous people in many respects. The Supreme Court clearly accepted the factual findings of prior commissions of inquiry that Indigenous people face widespread bias and systemic discrimination throughout the criminal justice system. It also provided a practical process for addressing these deeply engrained issues in the day-to-day functioning of that system. In essence, the factual findings of commissions of inquiry and past precedents would provide the basis for inferential reasoning in future cases. This would allow the complex issues Indigenous peoples face in the justice system to be addressed without making \"long inquiries\" a regular feature of criminal process. 21 Ibid at para 58. 22 Ibid.70 CHAPTER 5: THE FRAMEWORK AND PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN GLADUE The Supreme Court of Canada returned to the complex issues of systemic discrimination and widespread bias against Indigenous people in the criminal justice system within less than a year of the Williams decision through its reasons for decision in Gladue. In doing so, the Supreme Court also revisited the role of judicial notice in addressing these issues in the daily functioning of the courts, outlining a practical approach that builds on both the factual findings of prior commissions of inquiry and the sentencing innovations and jurisprudence of the early 1990s. With the support of explicit legislative direction for Indigenous people to be sentenced differently, it provided extensive guidelines on the proper interpretation and practical implementation of s 718.2(e) going forward. Several alternative sentencing practices, community-based dispositions, and other justice initiatives were in place in urban and rural Indigenous communities by this time so it is little surprise the Court provided a guiding framework of overarching principles, broad categories of relevant considerations, and generalizable procedural rules rather than prescribing any one-size-fits-all formula or uniform set of rules and considerations. However, the breadth and open-texture of this sentencing framework may have worked against it in subsequent jurisprudence of lower courts, as later addressed by the Ipeelee decision over a decade later. As the Gladue decision sets out the core principles around which the remainder of this publication will be structured, they will be set out in detail in this chapter with various headings created for ease of reference to specific principles. 71 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 The factual context and lower court decisions Jamie Tanis Gladue is an Indigenous woman who sought to appeal a three-year prison sentence for manslaughter of her common law husband. By the time her matter was before the Supreme Court of Canada, the sole basis for Ms. Gladue's appeal was her argument that the trial judge failed to give appropriate consideration to her circumstances as an Indigenous person pursuant to s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code. According to the sentencing judge, there were no \"special circumstances\" arising from either Ms. Gladue's Indigeneity, or that of her common law husband and victim, as they were both living in an urban area off-reserve rather than \"within the aboriginal community as such\".1 Ms. Gladue is a Cree woman from Alberta.2 She was engaged to her common law partner and they had moved to Nanaimo in British Columbia the same year he died. Ms. Gladue killed her partner while intoxicated after celebrating her 19th birthday. She confronted him over alleged infidelity with her sister and then stabbed him twice after he mocked and insulted her. While no submissions were made regarding her Indigenous circumstances during the sentencing proceeding, the trial judge had confirmed that she was Cree and that the town in Alberta where she had grown up was not an Indigenous community.3 He went on to emphasize the seriousness of the offence before imposing a three- year prison term and a ten-year weapons prohibition. The British Columbia Court of Appeal heard an appeal from Ms. Gladue's three-year prison sentence based in part on the ground that the trial judge failed to give appropriate consideration to her circumstances as an Indigenous person.4 She also applied to present fresh evidence at her appeal regarding her attempts to maintain links with her Indigenous heritage since the killing, including applying for \"full Cree status\" for herself, obtaining status for her daughter, and maintaining contact with the Cree mother of her late partner and victim.5 The Court of Appeal unanimously held that the trial judge erred when he concluded that s 718.2(e) did not apply simply because Ms. Gladue and her common law 1 R v Gladue, [1999] SCR Ibid para at para 19. 5 Ibid.72 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B husband and victim lived off reserve. However, a majority of the justices agreed with the trial judge's finding that there was no basis for special consideration of her Indigenous background in light of the circumstances of this \"near murder\", including Ms. Gladue's deliberation, motivation, viciousness, and persistence.6 The majority also appeared to dismiss her application to rely on fresh evidence of her efforts to maintain links with her Indigenous heritage. The foundations for a purposive analysis of s 718.2(e) in the dissent of Justice Rowles In stark contrast to the majority's approach, Justice Rowles of the Court of Appeal issued a lengthy set of dissenting reasons that foreshadowed the framework that would be set by the Supreme Court. She referred to various reports on sentencing reform that had been published in the lead up to s 718.2(e)'s enactment, as well as some of the reports on the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the justice system that are summarized in Chapter 2 of this publication, including the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples' Bridging the Cultural Divide report and the Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba.7 Justice Rowles found two constant themes throughout all these reports: (i) the overuse of incarceration as a sentencing tool more generally; and (ii) the particularly high rate of imprisonment of Indigenous people.8 In light of these reports and the parliamentary debates on Bill C-41, she found it clear that ss 718.2(d) and 718.2(e) \"were designed to remedy [...] the excessive use of incarceration in the criminal justice system in Canada and the disproportionately high number of aboriginal people who are incarcerated\".9 Justice Rowles went on to hold that the over-representation of Indigenous people in the justice system is well-documented and that it \"results, in part, from what is referred to as systemic discrimination\".10 She cited Professor Tim Quigley for an explanation of how systemic discrimination is the ultimate result when \"the unemployed, transients, and the poorly educated\" are treated as \"better candidates for imprisonment\" in the sentencing 6 Ibid at para 20. 7 R v Gladue, 54. 10 Ibid at para 55.73 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 process in spite of the fact that \"the social, political and economic aspects of our society place Aboriginal people disproportionately within the ranks of the latter\".11 She also cited Professor Quigley's description of how these factors can create a snowball effect in light of other factors, including the younger demographics of Indigenous peoples, their alienation from the justice system, the over-policing they face, the greater likelihood that they will be denied bail and imprisoned for fine default, and the lower likelihood that they will receive probation.12 She described s 718.2(e) as \"invit[ing] recognition and amelioration of the impact systemic discrimination has on aboriginal people\".13 Justice Rowles also considered how Indigenous peoples \"have traditionally dealt with unacceptable conduct in a different manner from that imbedded in the Canadian penal system\", referring again to the Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba.14 She stated that \"[t]he conception of justice as restorative of the community may be relevant to the degree to which 'justice' may be seen to be done by aboriginal people\" and \"the need for rehabilitation, reintegration and reconciliation may be essential to the community's cohesion\".15 She also addressed the additional complexity involved when considering the Indigenous culture of an individual who lives in an urban setting, but stated that this \"cannot be regarded as irrelevant in the sentencing process\".16 In elaborating on the need to consider the culture of Indigenous people living in an urban setting during sentencing, Justice Rowles again pointed to Bridging the Cultural Divide and the Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, citing the following passage from the latter report: Great care must be taken in these cases, because the influence of Aboriginal cultures is present, although difficult to detect. [...] it is important to distinguish between a person's lifestyle, which for some individuals may appear to be one of complete integration into the mainstream, and his or her culture, which is reflective of the values in which a person was raised and which continues to shape that person's behaviour. Thus, it is important for the courts to satisfy themselves as to the true influence of 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid at para 57. 13 Ibid at para 14 at para 63.74 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Aboriginal culture. The acceptance of outward appearances is not sufficient. In fact, where the influence of Aboriginal culture is difficult to detect, this itself may be a factor that the courts should take into consideration.17 Justice Rowles cited the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples for cautioning against limiting the consideration of community-based programs to rural reserve communities and for highlighting Indigenous- specific programming in urban settings. She quoted the Commission's warning that assuming urban Indigenous people need to deal with the non-Indigenous system \"makes the promise of culturally appropriate justice systems an illusion for almost half of all Aboriginal people in Canada\u2014the half that live in towns and cities\".18 She found nothing in the legislation to suggest that s 718.2(e) is limited to Indigenous people living on reserve and found that Ms. Gladue's residence off-reserve did not alter her Indigenous heritage or her cultural ties, nor did it alter the significance of those factors in her rehabilitation.19 Justice Rowles found that the three-year sentence of imprisonment was excessive and she would have imposed a sentence of two years less a day followed by a three-year period of probation.20 There is a judicial duty to give s 718.2(e)'s remedial purpose real force In introducing the unanimous reasons for judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Cory and Justice Iacobucci described the Gladue appeal as requiring it \"to begin the process of articulating the rules and principles that should govern the practical application of s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code by a trial judge\".21 In other words, the Court appeared to anticipate this framework would provide the foundations for a new body of jurisprudence under s 718.2(e) without providing the final word on this subject. Importantly, it interpreted s 718.2(e) as \" more than simply a re-affirmation of existing sentencing principles\", indicating that its analysis would be more than just the sum of existing precedents 17 Ibid at para 61. 18 Ibid at para 1 at para 24.75 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 and practices.22 It described the remedial purpose of this provision as Parliament's \"direction to sentencing judges to undertake the process of sentencing aboriginal offenders differently, in order to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in the particular case\".23 Taking into account its legislative context and history, the Court described s 718.2(e) as \"alter[ing] the method of analysis which each sentencing judge must use in determining the nature of a fit sentence for an aboriginal offender\".24 Likewise, the provision \"creates a judicial duty to give its remedial purpose real force\".25 Indigenous people's circumstances are unique and may make prison less appropriate The Supreme Court went on to note that s 718.2(e) both directs sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions other than prison that are reasonable in the circumstances for all offenders and calls for \"particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders\".26 It found the general role of this provision to be clear: for all offenders \"imprisonment should be the penal sanction of last resort\", only to be used \"where no other sanction or combination of sanctions is appropriate to the offence and the offender\".27 As for why the circumstances of Indigenous people warranted particular attention, the Court interpreted this as Parliament's recognition that Indigenous people's circumstances are unique and different from those of non-Indigenous people. It also held that this specific reference to Indigenous people in s 718.2(e), which deals with restraint in the use of prison, \"suggests that there is something different about aboriginal offenders which may specifically make imprisonment a less appropriate or less useful sanction\".28 22 Ibid at para 33. 23 Ibid. 24 Ibid para 26 27 Ibid. 28 Ibid.76 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Section 718.2(e) is part of an overall re-orientation towards restorative sentencing The Supreme Court recognized that \"some courts in the past have taken the unique circumstances of an aboriginal offender into account in determining sentence\", making specific mention of the Ontario Court of Appeal's Fireman decision.29 Likewise, it recognized that it has always been a principle of sentencing that courts should consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances. Nevertheless, it held that s 718.2(e) cannot be interpreted simply by looking to past cases for similar statements of principle. Instead, it \"must be interpreted in its total context, taking into account its surrounding provisions\".30 The Court identified the availability of conditional sentences under the new amendments as \"giv[ing] an entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should be resorted to only where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the circumstances\" and indicating Parliament's desire to lessen the use of incarceration.31 It also pointed to the newly introduced sentencing goals in s 718, which focus on \"the restorative goals of repairing the harms suffered by individual victims and by the community as a whole, promoting a sense of responsibility and an acknowledgement of the harm caused on the part of the offender, and attempting to rehabilitate or heal the offender\".32 The Court insisted that s 718.2(e) must be construed in light of these broader changes to the Criminal Code. Section 718.2(e) reflects Parliament's sensitivity to Indigenous justice initiatives The Court went on to review the legislative history of Bill C-41 as corroboration for its purposive interpretation of s 718.2(e). In the statements of the Minister of Justice and other Members of Parliament it found a clear government position that s 718.2(e) is aimed at \"reducing the use of prison as a sanction, at expanding the use of restorative justice principles in sentencing, and at engaging in both of these objectives with a sensitivity to aboriginal community justice initiatives when 29 Ibid at para 38. See Chapter 1 for a summary of this and other earlier cases. 30 Ibid at para 39. 31 Ibid at para 40. 32 Ibid at para 43.77 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 sentencing aboriginal offenders\".33 As summarized in the first part of this publication, Indigenous justice initiatives in urban and rural contexts were clearly contemplated by Parliament during this legislative debate, linking s 718.2(e) to the agency of Indigenous communities. Section 718.2(e) responds to Canada's long-standing problem of over-incarceration The Supreme Court pointed out that the parties and interveners before it all agreed that the purpose of s 718.2(e) is to respond to both the general issue of over-incarceration in Canada, as well as \"the more acute problem of the disproportionate incarceration of aboriginal peoples\".34 They also agreed that one of its roles \"is to encourage sentencing judges to apply principles of restorative justice alongside or in the place of other, more traditional sentencing principles when making sentencing determinations\".35 Still, the Court decided to address these issues in its reasons by summarizing the findings reached by various reports and studies on Canada's high rates of incarceration and the failures of imprisonment as a sanction to provide \"additional insight into the purpose and proper application of this new provision\".36 It found widespread consensus that imprisonment has not been successful in achieving some of the traditional goals of sentencing and it understood Part XXIII and s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code to be \"a reaction to the overuse of prison as a sanction\".37 This broader sentencing objective is by no means exclusive to the sentencing of Indigenous people. Section 718.2(e) directs sentencing judges to address Indigenous over-incarceration The Supreme Court went on to address what was by then a well- documented problem\u2014\"the excessive incarceration of aboriginal peoples\"\u2014pointing out that this had received the attention of a large 33 Ibid at para 48. 34 Ibid at para 50. 35 at para 57.78 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B number of commissions and inquiries.38 It cited extensively from Professor Michael Jackson's 1988 article \"Locking Up Natives in Canada\", describing this as \"a disturbing account of the enormity of the disproportion\".39 The Court also pointed out that the situation had not improved since then, citing more recent statistics from contemporary government reports.40 The Court described the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system as a \"sad and pressing social problem\", noting that \"[t]he figures are stark and reflect what may fairly be termed a crisis in the Canadian justice system\".41 The Supreme Court also pointed out in its reasons that \"the excessive imprisonment of aboriginal people is only the tip of the iceberg insofar as the estrangement of the aboriginal peoples from the Canadian criminal justice system is concerned\".42 It reiterated its finding in Williams that there is widespread bias and racism against Indigenous people in Canada and this has translated into systemic discrimination within the criminal justice system.43 The Court also cited the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples' Bridging the Cultural Divide report and the Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba for their findings that the criminal justice system has largely failed Indigenous peoples due to their fundamentally different worldviews, cultural values, and experiences.44 It held that s 718.2(e)'s singling out of Indigenous people for \"distinct sentencing treatment\" is \"Parliament's direction to members of the judiciary to inquire into the causes of the problem and to endeavour to remedy it, to the extent that a remedy is possible through the sentencing process\".45 Courts have the power to influence how Indigenous people are treated in the system The Supreme Court acknowledged that \"sentencing innovation\" alone cannot remove the causes of offending by Indigenous people or the greater problem of Indigenous peoples' alienation from the 38 Ibid at para 59. 39 Ibid at para 60. 40 Ibid at para 58. 41 Ibid at para 64. 42 Ibid at para 61. 62-63. 45 Ibid at para 64.79 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 criminal justice system.46 It identified the reasons underlying the over- incarceration of Indigenous people as including \"poverty, substance abuse, lack of education, and lack of employment opportunities\", bias against Indigenous people, and \"an unfortunate institutional approach that is more inclined to refuse bail and to impose more and longer prison terms\" for Indigenous people.47 Yet the Supreme Court insisted that sentencing judges do still play at least a \"limited role\" in remedying injustice against Indigenous peoples in Canada, which it described as follows: Sentencing judges are among those decision-makers who have the power to influence whether an aboriginal offender will go to jail, or whether other sentencing options may be employed which will play perhaps a stronger role in restoring a sense of balance to the offender, victim, and community, and in preventing future crime.48 Two categories of circumstances must be canvassed in sentencing Indigenous people The Supreme Court pointed out that a clear implication of the wording of s 718.2(e) is that the circumstances of Indigenous people are \"significantly different\" from the non-Indigenous people who come before the courts.49 It noted that there are a wide range of unique circumstances and background considerations with respect to the distinct situation of Indigenous peoples in Canada.50 Without suggesting they were exhaustive categories, however, the Court identified two types of unique circumstances that \"most particularly\" require attention from sentencing judges:51 (A) The unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular offender before the courts; and (B) The types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection. 46 Ibid at para 65. 47 Ibid. 48 Ibid. 49 50 Ibid. 51 Ibid.80 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Category A\u2014The role of unique systemic and background factors in sentencing The Supreme Court summarized this first category of relevant background circumstances as the \"well-known\" systemic and background factors that \"figure prominently in the causation of crime\" by Indigenous people.52 It described how \"[y]ears of dislocation and economic development have translated, for many aboriginal peoples, into low incomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or irrelevance of education, substance abuse, loneliness, and community fragmentation\".53 Echoing the dissent of Justice Rowles, it cited Professor Quigley's description of how these factors interact with one another in a snowball effect in order to produce Indigenous over-incarceration.54 The Court accepted that systemic and background factors may partially explain offences and recidivism among non-Indigenous people as well. However, it went on to explain why the systemic and background factors affecting Indigenous peoples are unique, as well as why Indigenous people are more adversely affected by prison: ...the circumstances of aboriginal offenders differ from those of the majority because many aboriginal people are victims of systemic and direct discrimination, many suffer the legacy of dislocation, and many are substantially affected by poor social and economic conditions. Moreover, as has been explained repeatedly in studies and commission reports, aboriginal offenders are, as a result of these unique systemic and background factors, more adversely affected by incarceration and less likely to be \"rehabilitated\" thereby, because the internment milieu is often culturally inappropriate and regrettably discrimination towards them is so often rampant in penal institutions.55 The Court went on to explain that sentencing judges must pay attention to how these unique background and systemic factors played a role in bringing a particular individual before the courts. They also play a role in crafting an effective sentence and determining the most relevant sentencing principles for the courts to emphasize: 52 Ibid at para 67. 53 Ibid. 54 Ibid. 55 Ibid at para 68.81 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 In cases where such factors have played a significant role, it is incumbent upon the sentencing judge to consider these factors in evaluating whether imprisonment would actually serve to deter, or to denounce crime in a sense that would be meaningful to the community of which the offender is a member. In many instances, more restorative sentencing principles will gain primary relevance precisely because the prevention of crime as well as individual and social healing cannot occur through other means.56 In summary, an Indigenous person's unique systemic and background factors may have relevance to sentencing in several conceptually distinct but overlapping ways. These include: (i) shedding light on why they ended up before the court; (ii) assessing whether prison will impact them more adversely than others; (iii) assessing whether prison is less likely to rehabilitate them; (iv) determining whether prison is likely to deter or denounce their conduct in a way that is meaningful to their community; and (v) addressing whether restorative sentencing principles ought to be given primacy to address crime prevention and bring about individual and broader social healing. In doing so, the Court appears to have framed this first category of unique circumstances broadly enough to encompass prior precedents for assessing the collateral consequences of incarceration on Indigenous people who would be dislocated from their land, culture, family, and community, such as Mr. Fireman and Mr. Curley.57 Yet at the same time it also appears to embrace prior precedents where Indigenous people were found to be less morally blameworthy due to their disadvantaged circumstances and the role these played in bringing them into contact with the criminal justice system, such as Ms. Pettigrew and Mr. Mitchell. Furthermore, it linked this category of factors to broader social healing and collective, community perspectives, implying their relevance to the second category of unique circumstances as well, which focuses on culturally-relevant sentencing processes and sanctions. 56 Ibid at para 69. 57 See Chapter 1 for a summary of these earlier cases.82 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Category B\u2014Procedures and sanctions particular to their heritage or connection The Court linked this second category of relevant unique circumstances to \"the different conceptions of appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions held by aboriginal people\".58 It pointed to the \"significant problem\" that Indigenous people in the criminal justice system face when their own understanding of sentencing, as well as that of their community, is \"often far removed from the traditional sentencing ideals of deterrence, separation, and denunciation\".59 This in turn was linked to the distinct traditions and sentencing practices of Indigenous peoples. The Court found \"most traditional aboriginal conceptions of sentencing place a primary emphasis upon the ideals of restorative justice\" and \"[t]his tradition is extremely important to the analysis under s. 718.2(e)\".60 The Court anticipated the need for further jurisprudential development of \"[t]he concept and principles of a restorative approach\" and suggested \"different issues and different conceptions of sentencing\" will each be \"addressed in their appropriate context\".61 The Court also noted that the sentencing judge failed to explore any distinct conception of sentencing that might have been held my Ms. Gladue, her victim and his family, or her community in this case.62 However, it provided a general characterization of restorative justice as \"an approach to remedying crime in which it is understood that all things are interrelated and that crime disrupts the harmony which existed prior to its occurrence, or at least which it is felt should exist\".63 It described this approach as focusing on the human beings closely affected by the crime, in which \"[t]he appropriateness of the particular sanction is largely determined by the needs of the victims, and the community, as well as the offender\".64 The Court explained that restorative justice does not necessarily entail a more lenient approach to crime than imprisonment. In fact, it noted that some proponents of restorative justice view it as potentially imposing a 58 Gladue, supra note 1 at para 70. 59 Ibid. 60 61 Ibid at para 62 Ibid at para 94. 63 Ibid. 64 Ibid.83 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 \"greater burden on the offender than a custodial sentence\".65 The Court quoted extensively from a law review article exploring how restorative justice fits within a punishment paradigm, including the following: ...Restorative justice necessarily involves some form of restitution and reintegration into the community. Central to the process is the need for offenders to take responsibility for their actions. By comparison, incarceration obviates the need to accept responsibility. Facing victim and community is for some more frightening than the possibility of a term of imprisonment and yields a more beneficial result in that the offender may become a healed and functional member of the community rather than a bitter offender returning after a term of imprisonment.66 The Court also clarified that its general description of \"the basic tenets of traditional aboriginal sentencing approaches\" is not meant to imply that \"all aboriginal offenders, victims, and communities share an identical understanding of appropriate sentences for particular offences and offenders\".67 It pointed out that the customs, traditions, and concepts of sentencing among Indigenous peoples \"vary widely\".68 However, the Court pointed to the importance of recognizing that \"for many if not most aboriginal offenders, the current concepts of sentencing are inappropriate because they have frequently not responded to the needs, experiences, and perspectives of aboriginal people or aboriginal communities\".69 The Court declined to engage in any extensive discussion of the \"innovative sentencing practices\" available to Indigenous people in the criminal justice system, but listed healing circles, sentencing circles, and community council projects as a few examples.70 It did point to a common underlying principle among the varying conceptions of sentencing held by Indigenous peoples\u2014namely, \"the importance of community-based sanctions\".71 At the same time, the Court cautioned judges against concluding that the absence of any community-based alternatives \"eliminates their ability to impose a sanction that takes into 65 Ibid at para 72. 66 Ibid, citing Daniel Kwochka, \"Aboriginal Making Room for a Restorative Paradigm\" (1996) 60 Sask L Rev 153 at 165. 67 Ibid at para 73. 68 Ibid. 69 Ibid. para 74. 71 Ibid.84 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B account principles of restorative justice and the needs of the parties involved\".72 Instead, it clarified that one of the unique circumstances for the sentencing of Indigenous people is that \"community-based sanctions coincide with the aboriginal concept of sentencing and the needs of aboriginal people and communities\".73 The Court went on to encourage sentencing judges to implement community-based sanctions in circumstances where it is reasonable to do so. It also stated that \"[i]n all instances, it is appropriate to attempt to craft the sentencing process and the sanctions imposed in accordance with the aboriginal perspective\".74 Notably, this reference to sentencing in accordance with an Aboriginal perspective echoes the use of this same phrase in the reports cited in Gladue, which use it to describe Indigenous peoples' unique legal traditions and worldviews.75 The same phrase is also consistently used in other Supreme Court of Canada cases as a short- form reference to perspectives derived from Indigenous peoples' distinct customs, practices, traditions, and laws.76 In summary, the Court directed sentencing judges to consider whether any alternative sentencing procedures or sanctions might be appropriate for the Indigenous person being sentenced based on a number of additional factors. These include: (i) any different conceptions of sentencing or perspectives on justice that are held by the Indigenous community to which the accused is connected, by heritage or otherwise; (ii) any community- based sanctions or justice initiatives within the Indigenous community to which the accused is connected; and (iii) whether alternative sanctions or procedures can achieve restorative justice objectives by addressing the victims, the community, and the offender even in the absence of any community-based sanctions or justice initiatives. In this way, the Court framed this second category of unique circumstances in an equally open-textured manner that encourages the involvement of Indigenous communities in the sentencing process and community-based sanctions, consistent with existing practices and prior jurisprudence, while also resolving the debate in the jurisprudence 72 Ibid. 73 Ibid. 74 Ibid. 75 See Chapter 2 for a summary of some of these earlier reports. 76 See for example: R v Van der Peet [1996] 2 SCR 507, 1996 CanLII 216 CanLII 302 at paras 112, 147-149. 85 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 over the role of community-specific perspectives and values in favour of greater pluralism.77 At the same time, in context to Ms. Gladue's own circumstances, the Court also took great pains to ensure this framework was broad enough to encompass Indigenous people who live in an urban setting and who may have only a limited connection to the community to which they are connected by heritage or otherwise. Unique circumstances can lead to sentences varying from one community to the next The Supreme Court went on to clarify how both categories of Indigenous peoples' unique circumstances fit within the fundamental duty of every sentencing judge, which is \"to determine a fit sentence taking into account all the circumstances of the offence, the offender, the victims, and the community\".78 It noted that this long-standing principle of Canadian sentencing law has an \"individualized focus\", for which \"[d]isparity of sentences for similar crimes is a natural consequence\".79 The Court also cited itself for the principle that sentences for a particular offence may vary across various communities and regions as \"the 'just and appropriate' mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurs\".80 This general principle was said to be \"particularly apt\" in context to the sentencing of Indigenous people.81 Community perspectives and needs can affect the relevant sentencing objectives The Court provided the following rationale for an individualized approach to sentencing that is sensitive to the needs and conditions of particular Indigenous communities and meaningful to Indigenous peoples: As explained herein, the circumstances of aboriginal offenders are markedly different from those of other offenders, being characterized by unique systemic and background factors. 77 See Chapter 1 for a summary of cases addressing the relevance of community perspectives. 78 Gladue, supra note 1 at para 75. 79 Ibid at para 76. 80 Ibid, citing R v M(CA), [1996] 1 SCR 500 at 567, 1996 Ibid at para 77.86 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Further, an aboriginal offender's community will frequently understand the nature of a just sanction in a manner significantly different from that of many non-aboriginal communities. In appropriate cases, some of the traditional sentencing objectives will be correspondingly less relevant in determining a sentence that is reasonable in the circumstances, and the goals of restorative justice will quite properly be given greater weight.82 Principles of separation, denunciation, and deterrence remain relevant At the same time, the Court also clarified that its approach to s 718.2(e) would not mean that \"as a general practice, aboriginal offenders must always be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight to principles of restorative justice, and less weight to goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation\".83 It cautioned against assuming that Indigenous peoples do not believe in the importance of the latter goals or \"even if they do not, that such goals must not predominate in appropriate cases\".84 The Court stated that there are some serious offence and some offenders for whom separation, denunciation, and deterrence are \"fundamentally relevant\".85 The length of the term of imprisonment must be considered for serious offences On the other hand, the Court added that \"even where an offence is considered serious, the length of the term of imprisonment must be considered\".86 It noted that the length of a prison sentence for an Indigenous person could be less in some circumstances or the same in other circumstances. It also stated that \"generally\" the more violent and serious the offence, the more likely it will be that the terms of imprisonment for Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders \"will be close to each other or the same, even taking into account their different concepts of sentencing\".87 As will be addressed in context to the Ipeelee 82 Ibid. 83 Ibid at para 78. 84 Ibid. 86 Ibid at para 79. 87 Ibid.87 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 decision, lower courts' embrace and expansion upon this generalization overshadowed the other principles in this framework in several subsequent decisions. Various questions guide the search for a fit sentence for an Indigenous person The Court listed off several questions that should guide sentencing judges' application of this individualized, case-by-case approach to sentencing Indigenous people: For this offence, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this community, what is the appropriate sanction under the Criminal Code? What understanding of criminal sanctions is held by the community? What is the nature of the relationship between the offender and their community? What combination of systemic or background factors contributed to this particular offender coming before the courts for this particular offence? How has the offender who is being sentenced been affected by, for example, substance abuse in the community, or poverty, or overt racism, or family or community breakdown? Would imprisonment effectively serve to deter or denounce crime in a sense that would be significant to the offender and community, or are crime prevention and other goals better achieved through healing? What sentencing options present themselves in these circumstances?88 Section 718.2(e) provides flexibility for a more holistic approach to sentencing The Supreme Court went on to state that when sentencing Indigenous people, as well as others, the analysis \"must be holistic and designed to achieve a fit sentence in the circumstances\".89 A sentencing judge must 88 Ibid at para 80. 89 Ibid at para 81.88 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B take into account all surrounding circumstances regarding the offence, the offender, the victims, and the community, including but not limited to circumstances that are unique to Indigenous peoples. It stated that sentencing must proceed with sensitivity to and an understanding of the many difficulties that Indigenous people have faced \"with both the criminal justice system and society at large\".90 Considering these circumstances in light of the aims and principles of sentencing will assist with the determination of what is \"just and appropriate in the circumstances\".91 Section 718.2(e) provides judges with \"a degree of flexibility and discretion to consider in appropriate circumstances alternative sentences to incarceration which are appropriate for the aboriginal offender and community and yet comply with the mandated principles and purpose of sentencing\".92 This allows judges to give effect to \"the aboriginal emphasis upon healing and restoration of both the victim and the offender\".93 Sentencing judges have a duty to consider every Indigenous person's unique situation The Court described s 718.2(e) as imposing a duty on judges to: (a) consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances; and (b) pay attention to the circumstances of Indigenous people. It stated that \"[t]here is no discretion as to whether to consider the unique situation of the aboriginal offender; the only discretion concerns the determination of a just and appropriate sanction\".94 Judicial notice is mandatory but further individualized evidence may be needed The Supreme Court went on to state that the way in which sentencing judges carry out their duty in the daily functioning of the courts may vary from case to case, but it sought to provide a general framework for this analysis. In doing so, the role of judicial notice it had previously addressed in Williams was extended to the sentencing process. The Court held that \"[i]n all instances it will be necessary for the judge to take 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid. 93 Ibid. 94 Ibid at para 82. 89 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 judicial notice of the systemic or background factors and the approach to sentencing which is relevant to aboriginal offenders\".95 On the other hand, it suggested that \"it may be that some evidence will be required in order to assist the sentencing judge in arriving at a fit sentence\" for each particular offence and offender.96 It is worth noting that the Supreme Court described the role of case-specific evidence in permissive terms rather than as a mandatory requirement, implying a relatively robust role for judicial notice. The role of case-specific information was stated more forcefully in Ipeelee, however. Counsel on both sides should adduce relevant evidence absent waiver The Court anticipated some Indigenous people would not want to have detailed evidence of their particular personal circumstances placed before the courts, in which case they are entitled to waive this process. The Court also provided very basic guidance on the role that Crown and defence counsel play in fulfilling this analysis. In the absence of waiver, the Court stated that it will be \"extremely helpful for counsel on both sides to adduce relevant evidence\"\u2014in fact, \"it is to be expected that counsel will fulfill their role and assist the sentencing judge in this way\".97 Sentencing judges must make further inquiries if the record is insufficient The Court also predicted there would be cases in which a sentencing judge is unable to rely on counsel for relevant evidence regarding an individual's particular circumstances as an Indigenous person, such as where that individual is unrepresented. In these cases, \"it is incumbent upon the sentencing judge to attempt to acquire information regarding the circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal person\".98 Sentencing judges are directed to acquire information on existing alternatives to incarceration, whether inside or outside the individual's Indigenous community. Again echoing the dissenting reasons of Justice Rowles, 95 Ibid at para 83. 96 para 84.90 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B the Court made it clear that this duty is engaged regardless of whether an individual resides in an urban context, a rural setting, or on a reserve. Alternatives in metropolitan areas must also be explored \"as a matter of course\".99 Relevant information may be obtained through pre-sentence reports and witnesses The Supreme Court also expected that the presence of an Indigenous person in the court \"will require special attention in pre-sentence reports\".100 Among other sources, it was anticipated that the authors of pre-sentence reports would obtain this information from the \"representations of the relevant aboriginal community which will usually be that of the offender\".101 The Court also held that judges \"may and should\" call witnesses to testify with regards to reasonable alternatives \"in appropriate circumstances and where practicable\".102 Reasons for sentence and fresh evidence upon appeal will assist in appellate review The Court stated that appellate courts are also obliged to consider relevant and admissible fresh evidence in an appeal against sentence if the sentencing judge at first instance fails to engage with their obligation under s 718.2(e) \"as fully as required\".103 In doing so, it endorsed the approach taken by Ms. Gladue in her pursuit of an appeal. The Court also highlighted that \"although s. 718.2(e) does not impose a statutory duty upon the sentencing judge to provide reasons, it will be much easier for a reviewing court to determine whether and how attention was paid to the circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal person if at least brief reasons are given\".104 This permissive approach to reasons was also revisited by the Supreme Court in Ipeelee. 99 Ibid. 100 Ibid. 101 Ibid 103 Ibid at para 85. 104 Ibid.91 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 Indigenous people must be treated fairly by taking into account their difference The Court also clarified that s 718.2(e) should not be interpreted as a form of \"reverse discrimination\" that favours Indigenous people over others.105 Instead, it aims to reduce Indigenous over-incarceration by \"seek[ing] to ameliorate the present situation and to deal with the particular offence and offender and community\".106 The Court stated that the fundamental purpose of s 718.2(e) is \"to treat aboriginal offenders fairly by taking into account their difference\".107 Characterizing s 718.2(e) in this way tacitly linked it to the concept of substantive equality developed in context to s 15 of the Charter.108 The Court went on to explain that s 718.2(e) does not require \"an automatic reduction of a sentence, or a remission of a warranted period of incarceration, simply because the offender is aboriginal\".109 Instead, it directs sentencing judges to consider the unique circumstances of Indigenous peoples when weighing the multitude of factors that must be accounted for in a fit sentence. Section 718.2(e) must be considered in the context of the overall scheme of Part XXIII of the Criminal Code and the other statutorily mandated considerations within it. The Court stated that \"the sentence imposed will depend on all the factors that must be taken into account in each individual case\" and the weight to be given to each factor will vary in each case.110 Therefore s 718.2(e) may not always mean a lower sentence for an Indigenous person. Nevertheless, the Court directed sentencing judges to always bear in mind the mischief that s 718.2(e) was enacted to address: ...it must in every case be recalled that the direction to consider these unique circumstances flows from the staggering injustice currently experienced by aboriginal peoples within the criminal justice system. The provision reflects the reality that 105 Ibid at para 86. 106 Ibid at para 87. 107 Ibid. 108 See for example: Eaton v Brant County Board of Education, [1997] 1 SCR 241 at paras 66-67, 1997 CanLII 366; Law v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1999] 1 SCR 497 at paras 25, 36, 46, 72, 1999 CanLII 675. 109 Gladue, supra note 1 at para 88. 110 Ibid.92 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B many aboriginal people are alienated from this system which frequently does not reflect their needs or their understanding of an appropriate sentence.111 Section 718.2(e) is applicable to all Indigenous people regardless of where they live Of particular relevance to Ms. Gladue, the Court affirmed that s 718.2(e) applies to all Indigenous people and not only those who live in rural areas or on a reserve. It agreed with the unanimous view of the British Columbia Court of Appeal that s 718.2(e) is not restricted to Indigenous people who live within a distinctly Indigenous community. It held that s 718.2(e) must \"at least\" apply to \"all who come within the scope of s. 25 of the Charter and s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982\".112 It suggested this would include \"Indians (registered or non-registered)\", as well as Inuit and M\u00e9tis.113 The Court also echoed the concerns expressed by Justice Rowles in her dissent with respect to s 718.2(e)'s application to Indigenous people living in urban areas. It stated that many Indigenous people living in urban areas are closely attached to their culture. It also cited the final report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples with regards to how urban Indigenous people's cultural identity is tied to a land base or ancestral territory \"because of the associated ritual, ceremony and traditions, as well as the people who remain there, the sense of belonging, the bond to an ancestral community, and the accessibility of family, community and elders\".114 Alternatives must be explored even in the absence of community support The Court acknowledged that it will likely be easier to find and impose an alternative to incarceration where an Indigenous community has \"a program or tradition of alternative sanctions, and support and 111 Ibid. 112 Ibid at para 88. 113 Ibid at para 90. 114 Ibid at para 91.93 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 supervision are available to the offender\".115 In other words, the existence of Indigenous justice initiatives plays an important supportive role in the analysis. And it also clarified that \"[f ]or all purposes, 'community' must be defined broadly so as to include any network of support and interaction that might be available in an urban centre\".116 Yet this does not mean that a judge's identification of reasonable alternatives is contingent on community input. The Court went on to state \"even if community support is not available, every effort should be made in appropriate circumstances to find a sensitive and helpful alternative\".117 Even if the Indigenous person being sentenced lives in an urban centre without any support network this will not relieve the sentencing judge of their obligation to find an alternative to imprisonment. Both the sentencing judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred The Supreme Court made it clear that both the sentencing judge and the majority decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal were flawed. The trial judge did not appear to have \"considered the systemic or background factors which may have influenced the appellant to engage in criminal conduct, or the possibly distinct conception of sentencing held by the appellant, by the victim Beaver's family, and by their community\".118 He may have also erroneously limited s 718.2(e) to the circumstances of Indigenous people living in rural areas or on reserve. At the same time, the Court also noted that the sentencing judge received \"little if any assistance from counsel on this issue\".119 The Court took issue with the apparent failure of the majority of the Court of Appeal to consider many of these factors as well, although it noted that Justice Rowles discussed them in detail in her dissent. Furthermore, it took issue with the majority's dismissal of Ms. Gladue's application to adduce fresh evidence. The Court stated that \"assuming admissibility and relevance, it was certainly incumbent upon the majority to consider the evidence, and especially so given the failure of the trial judge to do 115 Ibid. 116 Ibid at para 92. 117 Ibid. para 94. 119 Ibid.94 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B so\".120 If, on the other hand, that fresh evidence was insufficient, \"the proper remedy would have been to remit the matter to the trial judge with instructions to make all the reasonable inquiries necessary for the sentencing of this aboriginal offender\".121 Nevertheless a new sentencing hearing was not in the interests of justice The Court noted that an application of these principles to Ms. Gladue's appeal would be sufficient to justify sending the matter back for a new hearing and it had before it only \"very limited evidence\" regarding her Indigenous background.122 However, the Court accepted that a sentence of three years' imprisonment for her offence, which the majority described as a \"near murder\", was not unreasonable.123 The Court also found, \"[m]ore importantly\", Ms. Gladue had been granted day parole after serving six months in a correctional centre, followed by full parole, and was directed to reside with her father, take alcohol and substance abuse counselling, and comply with the requirements of the Electronic Monitoring Program.124 It held \"the results of the sentence with incarceration for six months and the subsequent controlled release were in the interests of both the appellant and society\".125 In light of all this, a new sentencing hearing was not in the interests of justice. Conclusion The distinct framework and methodology for sentencing Indigenous people set out in the Gladue decision canvassed a wide range of procedural and substantive issues in context to s 718.2(e)'s brief mention of \"the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders\". In doing so, the Supreme Court was building on existing sentencing jurisprudence that had addressed diverse topics ranging from how an Indigenous person's disadvantaged background can impact their blameworthiness to how distinct community 120 Ibid at para 95. 121 Ibid. 122 Ibid at para 123 Ibid. 124 Ibid at para 97. 125 Ibid.95 Chapter 5: The Framework and Principles Set Out in GladueCHAPTER 5 perspectives and values can be taken into consideration. The Court also adopted the factual conclusions from the reports of various commissions and task forces that preceded this decision, and took into account the legislative debate around s 718.2(e) and Parliament's desire for greater sensitivity to Indigenous justice initiatives, whether in metropolitan cities or remote communities. To call this sentencing framework ambitious would be to state the obvious. Yet the Court appears to have anticipated an incremental evolution would occur in the jurisprudence as different issues and different conceptions of sentencing would each be addressed in their appropriate context. Just as the Court suggested judicial notice could play a key role in the incremental evolution of challenges to jurors for cause in Williams, the Court saw judicial notice playing a role in changing sentencing practices as well. In addition to this, submissions and evidence from counsel on both sides, special attention in pre-sentence reports, and witness testimony could all assist at a procedural level to ensure an individualized approach to sentencing Indigenous people, considering not only the individual's circumstances, but those of Indigenous victims and communities as well. While the Supreme Court of Canada has never resiled from this framework or any of its basic principles and concepts, it has reiterated them in subsequent decisions in such a way as to provide greater clarity and address the misunderstandings and misconceptions that have arisen within lower court jurisprudence. These warrant equally close attention. 96 CHAPTER 6: CONDITIONAL SENTENCING OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN WELLS The Supreme Court of Canada revisited and restated the broad principles, concepts, and overarching framework of the Gladue analysis in the Wells decision issued the following year. By this time the Supreme Court had already provided guidance on the principles governing the use of conditional sentences, which had been made available through Bill C-41 as well. The Wells appeal offered an opportunity for the Court to explain how the Gladue analysis fits into the conditional sentencing regime in what would be one of many contextual applications of the Gladue principles for lower courts to contend with. In context to this particular form of community-based sentencing, the Court emphasized Indigenous community perspectives and initiatives alongside the more individual-focused impacts that systemic and background factors have on sentencing, which it described as mitigating in nature. Mr. Wells was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and this was upheld by the Alberta Court of Appeal without the benefit of the Gladue framework. The Supreme Court nevertheless dismissed this appeal, emphasizing the deference owed to sentencing judges. In light of this outcome, the Wells decision may have dampened the influence of the Gladue principles on lower court jurisprudence. However, it remains an important restatement of these principles and how they can be implemented in practice. The factual context and lower court decisions Mr. Wells sought to have a 20-month custodial sentence for sexual assault converted to a conditional sentence on the basis that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the appropriate considerations required by s 97 Chapter 6: Conditional Sentencing of Indigenous People in WellsCHAPTER 6 718.2(e) in light of him being an Indigenous person.1 A jury convicted Mr. Wells of committing a sexual assault against an 18-year-old Indigenous woman at a house party in the victim's own bedroom on the Tsuu T'ina Nation Reserve while she was either asleep or unconscious from the effects of alcohol. The sentencing judge described Mr. Wells' actions as a major or near major sexual assault and held that deterrence and denunciation were the paramount sentencing factors to be considered for such an offence.2 A pre-sentence report was prepared for Mr. Wells that was \"generally favourable\" and that recommended a conditional sentence.3 He had completed a 28-day treatment program at an Indigenous-focused alcohol treatment centre and he was assessed as posing no threat to the community so long as he abstained from alcohol. While the sentencing judge acknowledged a need to bear in mind s 718.2(e) in light of the fact that Mr. Wells is Indigenous, he nevertheless held that \"the necessary elements of deterrence and denunciation would be lacking\" if the 20-month sentence were to be served in the community as a conditional sentence.4 Mr. Wells appealed this sentence to the Alberta Court of Appeal arguing that s 718.2(e) was not properly considered, but his appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal accepted fresh evidence including an application made by Mr. Wells for a second session at the same treatment centre he had previously attended, as well as submissions from the Tsuu T'ina Nation Spiritual Healing Lodge, which was willing to admit Mr. Wells until his admission into a second session of treatment. However, there was also a brochure for the healing lodge indicating that \"persons who have a history of violence, child molestation, [or] sexual offences\" were considered to be \"inappropriate clients\".5 The Court of Appeal found that the fresh evidence assisted in considering alternatives to prison but was \"problematic\" in that Mr. Wells was apparently an inappropriate client for the proposed programming.6 The Court of Appeal had also provided its own interpretation of s 718.2(e) without the benefit of the Supreme Court's reasons in the Gladue decision. It held that \"reasonable\" means sentences must be commensurate with the objectives and principles of sentencing set 1 R v Wells, 2000 SCC 10 [Wells] at para 1. 2 Ibid at para 17.98 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B out in ss 718 to 718.2, and \"circumstances\" includes \"the gravity and nature of the offence, the record of the accused, impact on victims and community, the need for denunciation and deterrence, the need to maintain proportionality, aggravating and mitigating factors, relevant case law, and the particular circumstances of the accused\".7 The Court of Appeal also held that sentencing judges must consider \"additional circumstances\" when sentencing an Indigenous person, including: \"social factors particular to aboriginal Canadians; recognition of the alternative approaches taken to sanctions by aboriginal communities; the geographic availability of alternative sanctions; and community support\".8 However, it was of the view that Parliament could not have intended s 718.2(e) to mean the victims of Indigenous people, including Indigenous victims \"would receive less protection under the law\" or that a sentencing judge would be obliged to \"conduct an inquiry as to the circumstances of the aboriginal offender\".9 The Court of Appeal's reference to an \"inquiry\" was made when distinguishing the unusual circumstances of another contemporary case, Hunter, where the sentencing judge relied on s 718.2(e) to order the Crown to investigate and report back on the social conditions of a First Nation, among other topics, prior to the sentencing hearing.10 Casting doubt on the approach taken in Hunter, which Mr. Wells sought to rely on, the Court of Appeal made it clear that this kind of judicially directed inquiry would not become the norm. The Gladue analysis applies at stage two of the conditional sentencing analysis Justice Iacobucci, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, first addressed how and when an Indigenous person's unique circumstances ought to be considered in relation to the principles governing the availability of a conditional sentence under the Criminal Code. The Alberta Court of Appeal's decision had not only been issued prior to the Supreme Court's guidance on the sentencing of Indigenous people in Gladue, but had also preceded its subsequent guidance on how to approach conditional sentencing under the Criminal Code in Proulx.11 7 Ibid at para 20. 8 Ibid at para 21. 9 Ibid at paras 22-23. 10 1998 ABCA 109 at paras 58-62 [Wells ABCA], citing R v Hunter (1997), 11 CR (5th) 156, 1997 CanLII 14834 (Alta QB). See also R v Hunter, 1998 ABCA 141 at paras 4-5. 11 R v Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 [Proulx]. 99 Chapter 6: Conditional Sentencing of Indigenous People in WellsCHAPTER 6 The Supreme Court reiterated that when considering the availability of a conditional sentence the judge must first, at a preliminary stage, exclude the possibilities of either probationary measures or a penitentiary term, without yet determining the \"duration and venue of the sentence\".12 If either a penitentiary or a suspended sentence is appropriate, a conditional sentence should not be imposed. At this first stage the judge must also consider statutory prerequisites for a conditional sentence, including: (i) the absence of a minimum term of imprisonment; (ii) a custodial sentence of less than two years (i.e. not a penitentiary sentence); and (iii) the safety of the community will not be endangered by the sentence being served in the community. Assessing the danger to a community would require consideration of: (i) the risk of re-offending; and (ii) the gravity of damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence. The Court then described the second \"and most substantial\" stage of the conditional sentencing analysis as determining whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles set out in ss 718 to 718.2.13 While the first stage involves a cursory review of these provisions, the second stage requires \"a comprehensive consideration of these principles and objectives\" in order to determine \"(i) whether the offender should serve the sentence in the community or in jail, (ii) the duration of the sentence, and, if a conditional sentence, (iii) the nature of the conditions to be imposed\".14 It is at this second stage that the judge is required to fully consider and apply s 718.2(e) in deciding on the appropriateness of a conditional sentence, alongside \"all of the other principles and objectives set out in ss. 718 to 718.2\".15 The Court reiterated its analysis in Gladue, stating that \"whenever a judge narrows the choice to a sentence involving a sentence of incarceration, the sentencing judge is obliged to consider the unique systemic or background circumstances which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts\".16 In addition, \"the judge must consider the types of practicable procedures and sanctions which would be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage\".17 It also 12 Wells, supra note 1 at para 27. 13 Ibid at para 29. 14 Ibid. 15 16 Ibid. 17 Ibid.100 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B noted that the application of s 718.2(e) does not mean a sentence will \"automatically be reduced\" as \"the determination of a fit sentence requires a consideration of all the principles and objectives set out in Part XXIII\".18 Conditional sentencing where denunciation and deterrence are paramount More generally, the Supreme Court stated that a conditional sentence \"may be reasonable in circumstances where deterrence and denunciation are paramount considerations\", but this will depend on \"the severity of the conditions imposed\".19 It clarified that while a conditional sentence is \"generally better suited to achieve the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations, and promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender\", the objectives of deterrence and denunciation can also be \"well served with a conditional sentence\".20 It also noted that \"certain conditions can create more onerous circumstances than those associated with incarceration\".21 Echoing the holistic analysis described in its reasons for decision in Gladue, the Supreme Court stated that \"each conditional sentence needs to be crafted with attention to the particular circumstances of the offence, offender, and the community in which the offence took place\".22 The Court also reiterated its general guidance in Proulx that \"the more serious the offence and the greater the need for denunciation, the longer and more onerous the conditional sentence should be\".23 However, there may be certain circumstances in which the need for denunciation or deterrence \"is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society's condemnation of the offender's conduct\".24 Whether a conditional sentence is available in such circumstances \"depends upon the sentencing judge's assessment of the specific circumstances of the case, including a consideration of the aggravating factors, the nature of the offence, the community context, and the availability of conditions which have the capacity to properly reflect society's condemnation\"25 18 Ibid. 19 Ibid at para para 21 at para 23 Ibid, quoting Proulx, note 25 Ibid at para 35.101 Chapter 6: Conditional Sentencing of Indigenous People in WellsCHAPTER 6 A restatement and summary of the sentencing guidelines set out in Gladue Justice Iacobucci reiterated the guidelines articulated in the Gladue decision as follows: Section 718.2(e) indicates that a custodial sentence is \"the penal sanction of last resort for all offenders\", but sentencing judges must pay particular attention to Indigenous people's circumstances as they are unique.26 Section 718.2(e) focuses on restorative justice for all offenders, but also recognizes that \"most traditional aboriginal conceptions of sentencing hold restorative justice to be the primary objective\".27 Section 718.2(e) is intended to remedy the serious problem of Indigenous over-incarceration \"to the extent that a remedy [is] possible through sentencing procedures\".28 Sentencing judges must consider, \" at the very least \", both:29 (a) \"the unique systemic or background factors that are mitigating in nature in that they may have played a part in the aboriginal offender's conduct\"; and (b) \"the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection\". \"[T]he alternative of community-based sanctions must be explored\" in particular, \"given that most traditional aboriginal approaches place a primary emphasis on the goal of restorative justice\".30 The sentencing judge's role \"is to conduct the sentencing process and impose sanctions taking into account the perspective of the aboriginal offender's community\" when searching for a fit sentence.31 \"[I]t is often the case that imposing a custodial sentence on an aboriginal offender does not advance the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e), neither for the offender nor for his community\", particularly for \"less serious or non-violent offences, where the goal of restorative justice will no doubt 26 Ibid at para 36. 27 Ibid at paras THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B be given greater weight than principles of denunciation or deterrence\".32 However, \"the Court in no way intended to suggest that as a general rule, the greatest weight is to be given to principles of restorative justice, and less weight accorded to goals such as denunciation and deterrence\", as this would \"contradict the individual or case-by-case nature of the sentencing process\".33 Rather than providing a \"single test\", \"[s]ection 718.2(e) imposes an affirmative duty on the sentencing judge to take into account the surrounding circumstances of the offender, including the nature of the offence, the victims and the community\".34 \"[T]o the extent generalizations may be made, the more violent and serious the offence, the more likely it is as a practical matter that the appropriate sentence will not differ as between aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders, given that in these circumstances, the goals of denunciation are accorded increasing significance\".35 Primacy may still be given to denunciation and deterrence for serious crimes The Court went on to reject Mr. Wells' argument that the courts below failed to take into account the paramount significance of restorative justice within Indigenous communities by according greater weight to the goals of denunciation and deterrence due to the nature of his offence. It emphasized that s 718.2(e) \"requires a different methodology \" for assessing a fit sentence for an Indigenous person, but does not necessarily mandate \"a different result \".36 It also reiterated its generalization that \" as a practical matter , [...] particularly violent and serious offences will result in imprisonment for aboriginal offenders as often as for non-aboriginal offenders\".37 The Court held that \"it was open to the trial judge to give primacy to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in this case on the basis that the crime involved was a serious one\".38 32 Ibid 33 Ibid at para 40. 34 Ibid para 35 Ibid at para 42. 36 at para 44. 37 Ibid. 38 Ibid.103 Chapter 6: Conditional Sentencing of Indigenous People in WellsCHAPTER 6 A categorical approach to the seriousness of an offence would be inappropriate The Court explained that the seriousness of a crime in any given circumstances is \"a factual matter to be determined on a case-by-case basis\".39 However, it was clear that there are no categories of offences \"which presumptively exclude the possibility of a non-custodial sentence\".40 A categorical approach would fail to show appropriate deference to the initial sentencing decision and \"there is no legal basis for the judicial creation of a category of offence within a statutory offence for the purposes of sentencing\".41 Such an approach would also represent a \"partial\" and \"unbalanced\" application of the principle of proportionality, which requires consideration of both \"the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender\".42 Yet the Court found no error in how the sentencing judge determined the seriousness of the crime on the facts of this case. The greatest weight may still be accorded to restorative justice for serious crimes The Supreme Court also made the point that its guidance in Gladue does not \"foreclose the possibility that, in the appropriate circumstances, a sentencing judge may accord the greatest weight to the concept of restorative justice, notwithstanding that an aboriginal offender has committed a serious crime\".43 It pointed out that s 718.2(e) requires that courts not only take into account the unique circumstances of an Indigenous person being sentenced, \"but also to appreciate relevant cultural differences in terms of the objectives of the sentencing process\".44 It clarified that its generalization about serious offences in Gladue\u2014that the more violent and serious the offence, the more likely it is that similar terms of imprisonment will be imposed to those for a non-Indigenous person\u2014\"was not meant to be a principle of universal application\".45 39 Ibid at para 45. 40 Ibid. 41 Ibid, citing at R v McDonnell, [1997] 1 SCR 948, Sopinka J at paras 32-33, Ibid para at para 50.104 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B The Court emphasized that when judges look to the circumstances of the Indigenous person being sentenced this will require consideration of more than just the individual. An Indigenous person's circumstances may \"include evidence of the community's decision to address criminal activity associated with social problems, such as sexual assault, in a manner that emphasizes the goal of restorative justice, notwithstanding the serious nature of the offences in question\".46 It reiterated that sentencing \"requires an individualized focus, not only of the offender, but also of the victim and community as well\".47 It also reproduced a passage cited in Gladue that emphasized variance between sentences from one community or region to the next is to be expected \" as the 'just and appropriate' mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurred \".48 However, the Court noted that the evidence in this case suggested that the available Indigenous-specific programming was inappropriate for Mr. Wells and there was no evidence of either the existence of or his participation in any \"anti-sexual-assault program\".49 Judges must conduct a practical inquiry into an Indigenous person's circumstances The Supreme Court also took the opportunity to clarify the scope of a sentencing judge's duty to inquire into an Indigenous person's unique circumstances in Wells. Without the benefit of the Supreme Court's reasons in Gladue, the Alberta Court of Appeal found that it would not be practical \"to expect the Court, on its own volition, to make inquiries regarding offenders before the Court: aboriginals or otherwise\".50 Instead, it held that \"the onus must rest with the accused to suggest specific alternative sanctions supported by evidentiary submissions to the Court\".51 In contrast, the Supreme Court of Canada had determined in Gladue that it is necessary in every case for the sentencing judge to take judicial notice of systemic or background factors that contribute to the difficulties faced by Indigenous people \"in both the criminal 46 Ibid [emphasis 1 SCR 500, 1996 CanLII 230 at para 92. 49 Wells, supra note 1 at para 52. 50 Wells ABCA, supra note 10 at para 62. 51 Ibid.105 Chapter 6: Conditional Sentencing of Indigenous People in WellsCHAPTER 6 justice system, and throughout society at large\".52 And \"[i]n addition, the judge is obliged to inquire into the unique circumstances of aboriginal offenders\".53 The Court reiterated that \"[a]t times, it may be necessary to introduce evidence of this nature\" to supplement judicial notice.54 Rather than placing this obligation solely on the accused, as the Alberta Court of Appeal had done, it stated that \"[i]t is to be expected in our adversarial system of criminal law that counsel for both the prosecution and the accused will adduce this evidence\".55 Furthermore, it reiterated that the sentencing judge has \"an affirmative obligation\" to inquire into the relevant circumstances \"even where counsel do not provide the necessary information\".56 In most cases this obligation can be satisfied by the information contained within pre-sentence reports. However, where this information is insufficient, \"s. 718.2(e) authorizes the sentencing judge on his or her own initiative to request that witnesses be called to testify as to reasonable alternatives to a custodial sentence\".57 On the other hand, the Court emphasized that the methodology prescribed in Gladue was never intended \"to transform the role of the sentencing judge into that of a board of inquiry\".58 Instead, sentencing judges are only obliged to make inquiries beyond the information contained in the pre-sentence report in \"appropriate circumstances\" and where such inquiries are \"practicable\".59 Determinations of whether further inquiries are appropriate or practicable are also to be \"accorded deference at the appellate level\".60 Conclusion The Wells decision provides a thorough and unanimous reiteration of the core principles and concepts set down in Gladue by the Supreme Court of Canada. It is therefore an authoritative lens for interpreting the 52 Wells, supra note 1 at para 53. 53 Ibid. 54 Ibid at para 54. 56 Ibid. 58 Ibid para Ibid.106 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B distinct sentencing methodology under s 718.2(e). Among other things, the reasons for decision in Wells make it clear that an Indigenous person's systemic and background factors can have a mitigating impact on their sentence. In context to the conditional sentencing regime and its focus on community dispositions, the Court also clarifies that cultural differences can have an impact on the relevance and weight to be given to particular sentencing objectives under the Criminal Code. The Court also adds nuance to its earlier generalization that the more serious the offence, the more likely it is that a term of imprisonment will be imposed. While the generalization is repeated, the Supreme Court of Canada accepts that in some cases there may be evidence that an Indigenous community has decided to deal with serious offences differently, implying they have the autonomy to do so within the Gladue framework. Above all, the Wells decision appears to emphasize that the Gladue principles do not provide a single test so much as they provide a distinct framework and methodology that requires sentencing judges, counsel for both sides, and the authors of pre-sentence reports to all turn their minds to the circumstances that make Indigenous people unique. While the Court reiterates the same two categories of unique circumstances that \"at the very least\" need to be addressed, these may not exhaustively capture all the distinctive circumstances that are relevant when sentencing an Indigenous person. At the same time, this open-ended sentencing framework affords deference to the sentencing judges who deal with the unique circumstances of Indigenous individuals, victims, and communities in any given proceeding.107 CHAPTER 7: LONG- TERM OFFENDERS AND MISCONCEPTIONS IN IPEELEE The Supreme Court of Canada did not reassess and clarify the various principles and overarching framework governing the sentencing of Indigenous people for well over a decade after releasing its reasons in Wells. The differing roles of judicial notice and case-specific information in the Gladue analysis received some clarification in Spence in 2005. However, the Supreme Court did not comprehensively address the Gladue principles again until its reasons were released in the Ipeelee and Ladue appeals in 2012. In Ipeelee, the Supreme Court took the opportunity to not only \"revisit and reaffirm\" the Gladue framework but also to explain how this analysis applies in context to sentencing for breaches of long-term supervision orders (\"LTSOs\").1 In this way, Ipeelee parallels the Wells decision that had also restated the Gladue framework and provided guidance on how it fit with the general principles for conditional sentences. Yet by the time the Court revisited this framework for a third time a number of errors and misconceptions had become apparent in the lower court jurisprudence, requiring not only a detailed reaffirmation of the analysis but also the identification of appellate decisions that had fallen into error and should not be followed. For this reason, the Ipeelee decision requires careful attention and will be summarized in detail in this chapter, prefaced by a brief discussion of the Spence decision that preceded it. A clarification of the roles of judicial notice and case-specific information in Spence Five years after Wells, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the role of judicial notice in the Gladue analysis in its unanimous reasons in Spence. Like Williams, this decision arose from a trial judge's refusal 1 R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 at para 1 [Ipeelee].CHAPTER 7108 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B to allow certain questions to be posed to potential jurors in support of challenges for cause. The case involved a Black accused and an East Indian complainant. The trial judge allowed defence counsel to challenge for cause based on the potential bias against a Black accused but refused to extend the challenge to address the race of the complainant, \"as he regarded the 'interracial' element on the facts of this case to be irrelevant\".2 The defence accepted that the ethnicity of the complainant may not aggravate racial bias against a Black accused, but asserted that in \"an era of multiracial juries\" there is a possibility of \"[r]ace-based sympathy\" compounding prejudice against his client.3 In upholding the trial court's decision, the Supreme Court accepted that courts have taken judicial notice of \"racial prejudice as a social fact not capable of reasonable dispute\" in the past but did not find it to be equally apparent that jurors would have any \"natural sympathy\" for victims of their own race.4 While it accepted that the trial judge could have allowed a broader inquiry on the facts of this case, it did not find any error in the judge \"draw[ing] the line where he did\".5 In reaching this decision, the Court clarified the requirements for judicial notice. It reiterated that any fact can be \"judicially noticed\" if it is \"so notorious or generally accepted as not to be the subject of debate among reasonable persons\" or \"capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy\".6 If the fact at issue is determinative of the matter (such as \"the where, when and why of what the accused is alleged to have done\")\u2014referred to as an adjudicative fact\u2014a failure to meet this test will be determinative.7 If, however, the fact relates to the reasoning process or broader considerations of social policy\u2014known as social facts or legislative facts\u2014there may be greater flexibility and \"the limits of judicial notice are inevitably somewhat elastic\".8 The Supreme Court explained that its judicial notice of \"the systemic or background factors that have contributed to the difficulties faced by aboriginal people in both the criminal justice system and throughout 2 R v Spence, 2005 SCC 71 at para 1 [Spence]. 3 Ibid at para 4 para 5. 5 Ibid. 6 Ibid at para 53, 61. 7 Ibid at para 58, 62. 8 Ibid at para 58, 63.109 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 society at large\" in Wells and Gladue was an example of judicial notice of \"social fact\" evidence.9 It explained that social facts refer to \"social science research that is used to construct a frame of reference or background context for deciding factual issues crucial to the resolution of a particular case\".10 It described these facts as general rather than specific to the circumstances of a particular case, but stated that \"if properly linked to the adjudicative facts, they help to explain aspects of the evidence\".11 At the same time, the Supreme Court cautioned that the closer social facts approach \"the dispositive issue\" the greater the weight given to standard criteria for judicial notice.12 In making this latter point, the Supreme Court pointed to, among other things, the paragraph in Gladue that emphasized the value of case-specific information in assisting a judge in determining a fit sentence for an Indigenous person.13 As will become clear, the Court expanded on this in Ipeelee by emphasizing the importance of case-specific information when this had previously been described in more permissive terms in Gladue and Wells. The circumstances of Mr. Manasie Ipeelee One of the appeals addressed in this decision involved Manasie Ipeelee, an Inuk from Iqaluit, Nunavut. The Court described his individual circumstances as \"far removed from the experience of most Canadians\", including being born to an alcoholic mother who froze to death when he was five years old, becoming an alcoholic himself at age 11, and getting involved in the criminal justice system by age 12.14 The Court noted that by age 39 Mr. Ipeelee had spent a significant proportion of his life in custody or under some form of community supervision. While the majority of his offences were property-related, he had committed violent crimes as well, including aggravated assault and sexual assault. Mr. Ipeelee was designated a long-term offender in 2001 after committing a second sexual assault. He served a six-year prison term and was released on a 10-year LTSO to a community correctional centre. His LTSO was suspended on four occasions for attitude and 9 Ibid note 2 at para 57. 10 Ibid. 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid at 13 Ibid para 83. 14 Ipeelee, supra note 1 at para 2. 110 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B behavioural problems. Finally, he was charged for breaching a condition of his LTSO by becoming intoxicated, which led to the sentence under appeal. At first instance he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment less six months of pre-sentence custody. The sentencing judge held that the paramount consideration when sentencing for a breach of an LTSO is the protection of the public, whereas rehabilitation only plays a small role and an Indigenous person's unique circumstances are of \"diminished importance\".15 While the Court of Appeal accepted that Mr. Ipeelee's background and the disadvantages he had suffered provided insight into his repeated involvement with the criminal justice system, it held that they should not affect his sentence. The circumstances of Mr. Frank Ladue The second appeal involved Frank Ladue, a member of the Ross River Dena of the Yukon Territory. He was initially raised by his grandparents as his parents had severe alcohol abuse problems and died when he was still young. At age 5, he was taken to residential school where he reported suffering serious abuse. He returned to live with his grandparents at age 9 but could no longer speak his language and began drinking and acting out. Mr. Ladue went on to live with foster families, spend time in juvenile detention, and continue drinking heavily throughout his life. He began using heroin, cocaine, and morphine in a federal penitentiary. The Court stated that \"Mr. Ladue's life experiences may seem foreign to most Canadians, but they are all too common in Ross River\".16 It outlined some of Ross River's collective community experiences of abuse and trauma, the effects of which \"continue to be in the high rates of alcohol abuse and violence in the community\".17 Mr. Ladue's criminal record began at age 16 and included 40 subsequent convictions, including property-related offences, alcohol-related offences, and violent offences. Mr. Ladue was designated a long-term offender in 2003 after his third conviction for sexual assault. He served a three-year prison sentence and was released on a seven-year LTSO. The LTSO had been suspended on numerous occasions and he had two previous convictions for breaching the condition that he abstain from intoxicants prior to the offence giving rise to this appeal. In 2009 he was released from prison following a suspension of his LTSO and was at first going to be released 15 Ibid at para 15. 16 Ibid at para 21. 17 Ibid.111 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 to housing with culturally relevant support from an Elder. Instead, due to an administrative error by Crown officials, he lost his placement and was placed in downtown Vancouver, in spite of his concern about access to drugs there. Shortly after, Mr. Ladue was charged with breaching a condition of his LTSO when his urine tested positive for cocaine. The sentencing judge imposed a three-year term of imprisonment, finding isolation to be the most important sentencing objective in the circumstances and apparently concluding that the \"tragic aspects\" of Mr. Ladue's history should have no impact on his sentence.18 However, the British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed his appeal. A majority reduced his sentence to one year of incarceration. Justice Bennett, writing for the majority, discussed s 718.2(e) and the Gladue decision in detail and found the sentencing judge failed to give Mr. Ladue's circumstances \"any tangible consideration\".19 Justice Bennett also held that s 718.2(e) requires \"more than a reference to the provision\" and \"must be given substantive weight, which will often impact the length and type of sentence imposed\".20 The majority concluded a three-year sentence was not proportionate to the gravity of Mr. Ladue's offence and his degree of responsibility, especially considering his background and how he ended up at the halfway house in Vancouver. The dissent did not take issue with the sentencing judge's s 718.2(e) analysis but would have reduced the term of imprisonment to two years on other grounds. The central place of the principle of proportionality in determining a fit sentence Prior to addressing the role that the Gladue principles play in determining a fit sentence for a breach of an LTSO for an Indigenous person, the Supreme Court saw fit to reiterate the principles governing sentencing more generally. It noted that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to \"respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society\", which is accomplished by imposing \"just sanctions\" that reflect \"one or more\" of the objectives set out in s 718 of the Criminal Code.21 It also noted that the fundamental principle of proportionality, codified in s 718.1, \"has long been a central tenet of 18 Ibid at para 28. 19 Ibid at para 30. 20 Ibid, citing R v Ladue, 2011 BCCA at para 35.112 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B the sentencing process\" and has a \"constitutional dimension\" both as a principle of fundamental justice under s 7 of the Charter and in s 12 of the Charter's constitutional scrutiny of grossly disproportionate sentences.22 The Court emphasized that the fundamental principle of proportionality must be respected no matter what weight a judge might wish to accord to the various objectives and other principles in the Criminal Code: it is \"the sine qua non of a just sanction\".23 First, it requires that a sentence reflect the gravity of the offence, which is closely tied to denunciation and promotes \"justice for victims\" and \"public confidence in the system\".24 Second, it ensures a sentence does not exceed what is appropriate in light of the moral blameworthiness of the offender, serving a limiting function that \"ensures justice for the offender\".25 A just sanction must reflect both these perspectives on proportionality and \"does not elevate one at the expense of the other\".26 The Court also noted that sentencing judges enjoy \"broad discretion in the sentencing process\" in spite of this fundamental principle.27 Determining a fit sentence, \"subject to any specific statutory rules that have survived Charter scrutiny\", is \"a highly individualized process\" in which judges must have sufficient manoeuvrability to tailor sentences to the circumstances of the particular offender and offence.28 However, there are limits to the deference afforded to a sentencing judge and appellate courts have a duty to ensure the sentence under review is \"proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender\".29 The Supreme Court of Canada's emphasis on the principle of proportionality having two independent variables set the stage for its clarification of how systemic and background factors can impact the latter variable (i.e. someone's degree of responsibility) regardless of the former (i.e. the gravity of the offence). 22 Ibid at para 36. 23 Ibid at para 37. 24 at 37. 25 26 27 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 Clarification of the long-term offender regime in general The Supreme Court also took this pair of appeals as an opportunity to clarify the long-term offender regime more generally. Part XXIV of the Criminal Code sets out a process for designating individuals as either dangerous or long-term offenders. The long-term offender designation and LTSOs were introduced in 1997 to address a \"lacuna\" in the law \"whereby serious offenders were denied the support of extended community supervision, except through the parole process\".30 LTSOs were designed to \"supplement the all-or-nothing alternatives of definite or indefinite detention\".31 Section 753.1 of the Criminal Code authorizes a sentencing judge to designate someone a long-term offender if satisfied that: (a) a prison sentence of two years or more would be appropriate for the offence for which they have been convicted; (b) there is a substantial risk that they will reoffend; and (c) there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community. If someone is found to be a long-term offender, the court must impose a custodial sentence of two years or more and issue an LTSO for a period of 10 years or less. Mandatory conditions for all LTSOs are set out in regulations and the National Parole Board (NPB) may impose further conditions. The NPB may suspend an LTSO if conditions are breached or it is otherwise satisfied that suspension is necessary and reasonable to prevent a breach or protect society. Suspensions are served in a federal penitentiary and failure or refusal to comply with an LTSO is also an indictable offence punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Long-term supervision orders serve both public protection & rehabilitation The Supreme Court interpreted an LTSO's legislative purpose as \"contribut[ing] to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by facilitating the rehabilitation and reintegration of long-term offenders\".32 The rehabilitation and reintegration of a long-term offender into the community is \"the ultimate purpose of an LTSO\" but this is 30 Ibid at para 43. 32 Ibid at para 47.114 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B \"inextricably entwined\" with the protection of the public from the risk of reoffence.33 The Court noted that many lower courts had incorrectly treated rehabilitation as playing \"little to no role\" for long-term offenders when it is in fact \"the key feature of the long-term offender regime that distinguishes it from the dangerous offender regime\".34 There is no distinct sentencing regime or system for a breach of an LTSO The Supreme Court emphasized that a breach of an LTSO is \"not subject to a distinct sentencing regime or system\" and \"the best guides for determining a fit sentence are the well-established principles and objectives of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code\".35 Rehabilitation will not always be the foremost consideration. As in any other sentencing context, the weight accorded to each principle or objective will vary depending on the circumstances of the particular offence and the sentence must be proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Breaches can occur in \"an infinite variety of circumstances\" and there is no mandatory minimum penalty.36 While there is a 10-year maximum penalty, \"it would be too much to suggest that the mere existence of a high statutory maximum penalty dictates that a significant period of imprisonment should be imposed for any breach of an LTSO\".37 The severity of any particular breach requires a contextual analysis that considers \"the circumstances of the breach, the nature of the condition breached, and the role that condition plays in managing the offender's risk of reoffence\".38 A revisiting and reaffirmation of the Gladue principles The Supreme Court went on to reiterate the various 'social fact' findings and sentencing guidelines that were first set out in the Gladue decision. It restated that the reason for s 718.2(e)'s specific reference to Indigenous 33 Ibid at para 48. 34 Ibid at para 50. 35 Ibid at para 55. 36 38 at Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 people is the fact that they were \"sadly overrepresented in the prison populations of Canada\" according to former Minister of Justice Allan Rock and the various studies and commissions of inquiry that addressed this in detail prior to 1996.39 The Court also reiterated that s 718.2(e) directs \"members of the judiciary to inquire into the causes of the problem and to endeavour to remedy it, to the extent that a remedy is possible\".40 The Court summarized its overall guidelines in the Gladue decision as follows: The Court held, therefore, that s. 718.2(e) of the Code is a remedial provision designed to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in Canadian prisons, and to encourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to sentencing (Gladue, at para. 93). It does more than affirm existing principles of sentencing; it calls upon judges to use a different method of analysis in determining a fit sentence for Aboriginal offenders. Section 718.2(e) directs sentencing judges to pay particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders because those circumstances are unique and different from those of non-Aboriginal offenders (Gladue, at para. 37). When sentencing an Aboriginal offender, a judge must consider: (a) the unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender before the courts; and (b) the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular Aboriginal heritage or connection (Gladue, at para. 66). Judges may take judicial notice of the broad systemic and background factors affecting Aboriginal people generally, but additional case-specific information will have to come from counsel and from the pre-sentence report (Gladue, at paras. THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Judicial notice of systemic and background factors provides necessary context Building on Spence, the Supreme Court also saw fit to clarify the role that judicial notice plays in applying s 718.2(e) in light of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's resistance to judicial notice in R v Laliberte.42 It explained that \"courts must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools and how that history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration\" for Indigenous peoples.43 However, these matters \"on their own\" may not necessarily justify a different sentence for Indigenous people.44 Instead, \"they provide the necessary context for understanding and evaluating the case-specific information presented by counsel\".45 Case-specific information is required in every case and Gladue reports can assist The Court made it clear that counsel have a duty to bring individualized information before the court \"in every case, unless the offender expressly waives his right to have it considered\".46 This indicates a shift away from the more permissive approach to case-specific evidence in Gladue and Wells where the Court had suggested more guardedly that \"it may be that some evidence will be required\" or \"at times, it may be necessary\".47 The Court also acknowledged the current practice of bringing case-specific information before the court \"by way of a Gladue report, which is a form of pre-sentence report tailored to the specific circumstances of Aboriginal offenders\".48 It further stated that \"[b]ringing such information to the attention of the judge in a comprehensive and timely manner is helpful to all parties at a sentencing hearing for an Aboriginal offender, as it is indispensible to a judge in fulfilling his duties under s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code\".49 42 Ibid at para 60, citing R v Laliberte, 2000 SKCA 27. 43 Ibid. 44 Ibid.

It pointed out that the reasons for decision in Gladue \"were mindful of this fact, yet retained a degree of optimism\".50 Yet its \"cautious optimism\" that sentencing judges would play at least a limited role in \"remedying injustice against aboriginal peoples\" had \"not been borne out\".51 The Court reviewed subsequent statistics to find that \"the overrepresentation and alienation of Aboriginal peoples in the criminal justice system has only worsened\".52 It acknowledged s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code and the Gladue decision had not \"had a discernible impact on the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice system\".53 While \"the Gladue principles were never expected to provide a panacea\", the Court also found some indication in academic commentary and the case law that this could be in part attributed to their \"fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication\".54 For this reason, the Court set out to address a number of existing criticisms, misunderstandings, and misapplications in its reasons. Sentencing judges play a role in reducing both crime and systemic discrimination First, the Supreme Court rejected the criticism that \"sentencing is not an appropriate means of addressing overrepresentation\" as one that had been based on a fundamental misunderstanding of s 718.2(e)'s operation.55 Citing the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, the Court noted that the available evidence indicates that Indigenous over-incarceration stems from both: (i) the commission of \"a disproportionate number of crimes\" Ibid 40 Ibid at para 62. 53 Ibid at para 64.118 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B by Indigenous people; and (ii) the treatment of Indigenous people within \"a discriminatory justice system\".56 The Court affirmed that both of these matters fall within \"the purview of the sentencing judge\".57 Sentencing practices must change if they do not effectively deter and rehabilitate In response to the first issue, the Court stated that \"sentencing judges can endeavour to reduce crime rates in Aboriginal communities by imposing sentences that effectively deter criminality and rehabilitate offenders\"\u2014two codified objectives of sentencing.58 It emphasized that \"[t]o the extent that current sentencing practices do not further these objectives, those practices must change so as to meet the needs of Aboriginal offenders and their communities\".59 In making this point, the Court endorsed commentary to the effect that the principle of parity should not be a barrier to more effective sentences: As Professors Rudin and Roach ask, \"[if an innovative] sentence can serve to actually assist a person in taking responsibility for his or her actions and lead to a reduction in the probability of subsequent re-offending, why should such a sentence be precluded just because other people who commit the same offence go to jail?\"60 Judges can ensure systemic factors do not inadvertently lead to discrimination In response to the second issue, the Court reiterated that \"judges can ensure that systemic factors do not lead inadvertently to discrimination in sentencing\".61 It once again cited Professor Quigley's explanation of systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system as had been reproduced by Justice Rowles and the Supreme Court itself in Gladue: 56 Ibid at para 65. 57 Ibid. 58 Ibid para 66. 59 Ibid. 60 Ibid, citing Jonathan Rudin & Kent Roach, A to Stenning and Roberts' 'Empty Promises'\" (2002) 65 Sask L Rev at 20. 61 Ibid at para 67.119 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 Socioeconomic factors such as employment status, level of education, family situation, etc., appear on the surface as neutral criteria. They are considered as such by the legal system. Yet they can conceal an extremely strong bias in the sentencing process. Convicted persons with steady employment and stability in their lives, or at least prospects of the same, are much less likely to be sent to jail for offences that are borderline imprisonment offences. The unemployed, transients, the poorly educated are all better candidates for imprisonment. When the social, political and economic aspects of our society place Aboriginal people disproportionately within the ranks of the latter, our society literally sentences more of them to jail. This is systemic discrimination.62 The Supreme Court clarified that \"[s]entencing judges, as front-line workers in the criminal justice system, are in the best position to re- evaluate these criteria to ensure they are not contributing to ongoing systemic racial discrimination\".63 While this directive can be interpreted narrowly in context to the assessment of an Indigenous person's moral blameworthiness in light of how these factors might have played a role in bringing them before the court, it could also have far broader applications as well. Reassessing sentencing practices can further the fundamental purpose of sentencing The Supreme Court clarified that both sentencing innovations and the re-evaluation of unintentionally discriminatory criteria fit with the fundamental purpose of the sentencing process, which is \"to promote a just, peaceful and safe society through the imposition of just sanctions that, among other things, deter criminality and rehabilitate offenders, all in accordance with the fundamental principle of proportionality\".64 It stated that \"[j]ust sanctions are those that do not operate in a discriminatory manner\".65 It also quoted the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba's final report that echoes these dual roles: 62 Ibid, citing Tim Quigley, \"Some Issues in Sentencing of Aboriginal Offenders\" in Richard Gosse, James Youngblood Henderson & Roger Carter, eds, Continuing Poundmaker and Riel's Quest: Presentations Made at a Conference on Aboriginal Peoples and Justice (Saskatoon: Purich Publishing, 1994) at 275-76 [Quigley]. 63 Ibid 68. 65 Ibid.120 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Despite the magnitude of the problems, there is much the justice system can do to assist in reducing the degree to which Aboriginal people come into conflict with the law. It can reduce the ways in which it discriminates against Aboriginal people and the ways in which it adds to Aboriginal alienation.66 The Gladue principles do not provide a \"race-based discount\" in sentencing The Supreme Court of Canada went on to reject critics' characterization of the Gladue principles as inviting sentencing judges \"to impose more lenient sentences simply because an offender is Aboriginal\".67 It reiterated its statement in Gladue that \"s. 718.2(e) should not be taken as requiring an automatic reduction of a sentence, or a remission of a warranted period of incarceration, simply because the offender is aboriginal\".68 It further endorsed the Manitoba Court of Appeal's explanation of this principle in Vermette, once again alluding to the concept of substantive equality: The section does not mandate better treatment for aboriginal offenders than non-aboriginal offenders. It is simply a recognition that the sentence must be individualized and that there are serious social problems with respect to aboriginals that require more creative and innovative solutions. This is not reverse discrimination. It is an acknowledgement that to achieve real equality, sometimes different people must be treated differently.69 Both categories of unique circumstances affect what is a fit and proper sentence The Supreme Court went on to reject the suggestion that, regardless of its purpose, the methodology of s 718.2(e) will inevitably provide \"a remission of a warranted period of incarceration\" for Indigenous people.70 It noted that the Gladue methodology focuses on the unique circumstances of an 66 Ibid at para 69, citing Manitoba, Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba (Winnipeg: Province of Manitoba, 1991), vol I at 110-11 [Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba]. 67 Ibid at para 70. 68 Ibid at para 71. 69 Ibid, citing R v Vermette, 2001 MBCA 64 at para 39. 70 Ibid at 72.121 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 Indigenous person \"which could reasonably and justifiably impact on the sentence imposed\"\u2014namely, \"(1) the unique systemic and background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender before the courts; and (2) the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular Aboriginal heritage or connection\".71 The Court stated that \"[b]oth sets of circumstances bear on the ultimate question of what is a fit and proper sentence\".72 Systemic and background factors may bear on the individual's culpability The Supreme Court clarified that systemic and background factors \"may bear on the culpability of the offender, to the extent that they shed light on his or her level of moral blameworthiness\".73 It reiterated its clarification in Wells that these \" are mitigating in nature in that they may have played a part in the aboriginal offender's conduct\".74 The Court pointed out that many Indigenous people \"find themselves in situations of social and economic deprivation with a lack of opportunities and limited options for positive development\".75 While this may not mean their actions were \"not voluntary and therefore deserving of criminal sanction,\" such constrained circumstances may diminish their moral culpability.76 Any failure to take these circumstances into account would violate the principle of proportionality that requires a sentence to be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender\".77 Systemic and background factors may impact deterrence and denunciation The Court pointed out that these systemic and background factors \"may also indicate that a sanction that takes account of the underlying causes of the criminal conduct may be more appropriate than one only aimed 71 Ibid. 72 Ibid. 73 Ibid at para 73. Ibid. 77 Ibid.122 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B at punishment per se\".78 It cited the following passages from Gladue for this principle: In cases where such factors have played a significant role, it is incumbent upon the sentencing judge to consider these factors in evaluating whether imprisonment would actually serve to deter, or to denounce crime in a sense that would be meaningful to the community of which the offender is a member. In many instances, more restorative sentencing principles will gain primary relevance precisely because the prevention of crime as well as individual and social healing cannot occur through other means.79 Indigenous perspectives and worldviews can impact the effectiveness of a sentence The Court also clarified that the second category of circumstances addressed in Gladue\u2014the types of procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate for someone based on their particular Indigenous heritage or connection\u2014\"bears not on the degree of culpability of the offender, but on the effectiveness of the sentence itself \".80 It reiterated the point made in Gladue that \"for many if not most aboriginal offenders, the current concepts of sentencing are inappropriate because they have frequently not responded to the needs, experiences, and perspectives of aboriginal people or aboriginal communities\".81 It also reiterated the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples' conclusion that the criminal justice system has been a \"crushing failure\" for Indigenous peoples due to fundamentally different worldviews \"with respect to such elemental issues as the substantive content of justice and the process of achieving justice\".82 The Court explained the relevance of this second set of circumstances to the failures of the criminal justice system for Indigenous peoples as follows: The Gladue principles direct sentencing judges to abandon the presumption that all offenders and all communities share the 78 Ibid. 79 Ibid, citing Gladue, supra note 40 at para 80 Ibid at

given these fundamentally different world views, different or alternative sanctions may more effectively achieve the objectives of sentencing in a particular community.83 Crafting a fit and proper sentence requires attention to unique circumstances The Court reiterated that rather than providing a \"race-based discount\" or asking courts to remedy Indigenous overrepresentation by \"artificially reducing the incarceration rates\", Gladue directs lower courts to pay particular attention to the circumstances of Indigenous people \"in order to endeavour to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in any particular case\".84 Not only is Gladue \"entirely consistent with the requirement that sentencing judges engage in an individualized assessment of all of the relevant factors and circumstances, including the status and life experiences, of the person standing before them\", it \"affirms this requirement\".85 Gladue recognizes that \"up to this point, Canadian courts have failed to take into account the unique circumstances of Aboriginal offenders that bear on the sentencing process\".86 Section 718.2(e) aims to remedy this failure \"by directing judges to craft sentences in a manner that is meaningful to Aboriginal peoples\".87 The Court cautioned that \"[n]eglecting this duty would not be faithful to the core requirement of the sentencing process\".88 The history of Indigenous peoples is unique and tied to the legacy of colonialism The Court also rejected the criticism that the Gladue principles violate the principle of parity by \"creat[ing] unjustified distinctions between offenders who are otherwise similarly situated\".89 It noted that this is premised on the mistaken assumption that the circumstances of 83 Ibid. 84 Ibid at para 75. 85 Ibid at para 76.124 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Indigenous people before the courts \"are not, in fact, unique\", which \"ignores the distinct history of Aboriginal peoples in Canada\".90 The Court again referenced \"the various reports and commissions on Aboriginal peoples' involvement in the criminal justice system\" as emanating the \"overwhelming message\" that \"current levels of criminality are intimately tied to the legacy of colonialism\".91 It noted that non- Indigenous people's background and systemic factors should also be taken into account, but at the same time the source of many Indigenous people's \"poverty and other incidents of social marginalization\" lies in their distinct history.92 Parity allows different sanctions to be justified based on unique circumstances The Court stated that the interaction between its interpretation of s 718.2(e) in Gladue and the parity principle codified in s 718.2(b) \"merits specific attention\".93 It noted that while s 718.2(b) requires that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances\", similarity \"is sometimes an elusory concept\".94 The Supreme Court endorsed Professor Jean-Paul Brodeur's description of circumstances like \"unemployment\", \"substance abuse\", and \"loneliness\" as having different meanings in different contexts, such as in relation to isolated reserves or \"urban ghettoes\".95 The Court noted that \"[i]n practice, similarity is a matter of degree\" and \"[n]o two offenders will come before the courts with the same background and experiences, having committed the same crime in the exact same circumstances\".96 It clarified that parity \"simply requires that any disparity between sanctions for different offenders be justified\".97 If the Gladue framework leads to different sanctions for Indigenous people 90 Ibid at paras 76-77. 91 Ibid at para 77, citing

to the sentencing process\".98 Courts must ensure parity does not undermine s 718.2(e)'s remedial purpose In addressing how the principle of parity, as codified in s 718.2(b), ought to interact with s 718.2(e), the Court cautioned that \"[c]ourts must ensure that a formalistic approach to parity in sentencing does not undermine the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e)\".99 It again cited Professor Quigley, who asserted that \"[u]niformity hides inequity, impedes innovation and locks the system into its mindset of jail\" and \"prevents us from re- evaluating the value of our aims of sentencing and their efficacy\".100 It also cited how Professor Quigley linked the need to avoid \"excessive concern about sentencing parity\" with the equality jurisprudence under the Charter, since \"there is a differential impact from the same treatment\" in \"an ethnically and culturally diverse society\".101 It is an error to require a causal link between background factors and an offence The Supreme Court went on to examine the post-Gladue jurisprudence in order to identify and correct several errors made by lower courts that had \"significantly curtailed the scope and potential remedial impact of the provision, thwarting what was originally envisioned by Gladue\".102 These warrant particularly close attention as the errors are set out in appellate level decisions that undoubtedly impacted the approaches of the courts below in the jurisprudence between Gladue and Ipeelee. The first error that the Supreme Court identified was the suggestion that the person being sentenced \"must establish a causal link between background factors and the commission of the current offence before being entitled to have those matters considered by the sentencing judge\".103 98 Ibid. 99 Ibid. 100 Ibid, citing Quigley, supra note 62 at 286. 101 Ibid. 102 Ibid at para 80. 103 Ibid.126 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B In order to clarify this error, the Court provided a specific example in the Alberta Court of Appeal's decision in Poucette where the Court of Appeal erroneously held that \"Gladue requires that [systemic and background factors'] influences be traced to the particular offender\" and that the \"[f ]ailure to link the two is an error in principle\".104 This judgment was described as \"display[ing] an inadequate understanding of the devastating intergenerational effects of the collective experiences of Aboriginal peoples\" and as \"impos[ing] an evidentiary burden on offenders that was not intended by Gladue\".105 The Supreme Court identified two further examples of what it characterized as the same error\u2014the Alberta Court of Appeal's Gladue decision from 1999 and the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's Andres decision from 2002.106 It is worth noting that not one of these three decisions makes any explicit mention of the need for a \"causal\" connection, instead insisting on the need for counsel or sentencing judges to trace, link, or tie systemic and background factors to the particular offender or offence.107 In contrast, the Supreme Court cited the Ontario Court of Appeal's Collins decision with approval for that court's clarification that paying attention to an Indigenous person's unique background and systemic factors imposes \"a much more modest requirement\" than a causal link.108 In Collins, the Court of Appeal insisted that systemic factors must still be taken into account even when they only amount to the background or setting for the commission of the offence.109 The Supreme Court also cited the British Columbia Court of Appeal's approach to s 718.2(e) in Jack with approval.110 There the Court of Appeal found there was no \"direct relationship\" between the individual circumstances of Mr. Jack, a Cowichan man who had a positive upbringing, and the problems faced by the Cowichan people in general, but Gladue factors were nevertheless relevant more generally, including in terms of Mr. Jack's relationship to 104 Ibid at para 81, citing R v Poucette, 1999 v Gladue, 1999 ABCA 279 [Gladue ABCA]; R v Andres, 2002 106 at para 29. 108 Ipeelee, supra note 1 at para 82, citing R v Collins, 2011 ONCA 182 at paras 32-33 [Collins]. 109 Collins, supra note 108 at para 33. 110 Ipeelee, supra note 1 at para 82, citing R v Jack, 2008 BCCA 437 [Jack].127 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 his community and his prospects for rehabilitation.111 In other words, community-level factors are potentially relevant to sentencing even if there is no evidence before the court that an Indigenous person's own moral culpability is diminished by their unique circumstances. Gladue circumstances and individual offending are intertwined in complex ways The Court went on to explain that a \"direct causal link\" between an Indigenous person's unique systemic and background circumstances and their offending would be \"extremely difficult\" to ever establish as \"[t]he interconnections are simply too complex\".112 It cited the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba's explanation of this: Cultural oppression, social inequality, the loss of self-government and systemic discrimination, which are the legacy of the Canadian government's treatment of Aboriginal people, are intertwined and interdependent factors, and in very few cases is it possible to draw a simple and direct correlation between any one of them and the events which lead an individual Aboriginal person to commit a crime or to become incarcerated.113 Gladue circumstances provide necessary context rather than an excuse for crime The Court also pointed out that there is no logical requirement for this kind of a \"simple and direct correlation\" or connection since \"[s]ystemic and background factors do not operate as an excuse or justification for the criminal conduct\".114 Instead, \"they provide the necessary context to enable a judge to determine an appropriate sentence\".115 On the other hand, the Court stated that \"[t]his is not to say that those factors need not be tied in some way to the particular offender and offence\".116 An Indigenous person's unique circumstances will only 111 Jack, supra note 110 at paras 29-30. 112 Ipeelee, supra note 1 at para 83. 113 Ibid, citing Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, supra note 66 at 86. 114 Ibid. 115 Ibid. 116 Ibid.128 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B influence the ultimate sentence if \"they bear on his or her culpability for the offence or indicate which sentencing objectives can and should be actualized\".117 If interpreted in a vacuum these statements could invite the same line of reasoning that the Supreme Court explicitly rejected in Ipeelee. For this reason, it must be remembered that the Supreme Court also concluded that the Alberta Court of Appeal fell into error when it required the sentencing judge to \"link\" or \"trace\" the systemic and background factors of the First Nations community of Morley, Alberta to an individual member of that community in the Poucette decision.118 It is an error to interpret Gladue principles as inapplicable to serious offences The Supreme Court went on to identify the \"irregular and uncertain application of the Gladue principles to sentencing decisions for serious or violent offences\" as \"[t]he second and perhaps most significant issue in the post-Gladue jurisprudence\".119 It cited Professor Roach's criticism that appellate courts had \"attended disproportionately\" to the paragraphs in Gladue and Wells that discuss the relevance of these principles in \"serious cases\" and compare the sentencing of Indigenous and non- Indigenous people.120 The Supreme Court agreed that \"unwarranted emphasis\" was being placed upon its broad generalization that \"the more violent and serious the offence the more likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals and non-aboriginals will be close to each other or the same\".121 It stated that \"[n]umerous courts have erroneously interpreted this generalization as an indication that the Gladue principles do not apply to serious offences\".122 The Court also cited an article by Ren\u00e9e Pelletier for her identification of the barriers to carving out exceptions from the Gladue principles for serious cases, including the lack of any legal test or statutory direction in the Criminal Code to distinguish between serious and non-serious 117 Ibid. 118 Ibid at para 81, citing Poucette, note 104 at para 14. 119 Ibid at para 84. 120 Ibid, citing Kent Roach, \"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: Gladue at Ten and in the Courts of Appeal\" (2009) 54 Crim LQ 470 at 472. 121 Ibid. 122 Ibid, citing R v Carri\u00e8re (2002), 164 C.C.C.

Ibid. 128 Ibid 85, citing Gladue, supra note 40 at para 82 & Wells, supra note 47 at para 50. At the same time, the Court also cited appellate cases in which the \"element of duty\" in the Gladue analysis was given explicit recognition: R v Kakekagamick (2006), 214 OAC 127, 2006 CanLII 28549 (Ont CA), leave to appeal to SCC refused, 21826 (10 May 2007); R v Jensen (2005), 196 OAC 119, 2005 CanLII 7649 (Ont CA); R v Abraham, 2000 ABCA 159. Ibid at para 87. 130 Ibid.130 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B is required in every case involving an Aboriginal offender, including breach of an LTSO, and a failure to do so constitutes an error justifying appellate intervention\".131 Application to the circumstances of Manasie Ipeelee The Court held that the lower courts in Mr. Ipeelee's case made several errors in principle warranting appellate intervention. More specifically, they had erred when they concluded rehabilitation was not a relevant sentencing objective for breach of an LTSO, and they erred again in giving attenuated consideration to his circumstances as an Indigenous person due to their incorrect view that these \"play little to no role when sentencing long-term offenders\".132 In re-sentencing Mr. Ipeelee, the Court accepted that his history \"indicates a strong correlation between alcohol use and violent offending\", which means \"abstaining from alcohol is critical to managing his risk in the community\".133 However, it also pointed out \"the conduct constituting the breach was becoming intoxicated, not becoming intoxicated and engaging in violence\" and it must \"focus on the actual incident giving rise to the breach\".134 The Court stated that a fit sentence will seek to manage the risk he continues to pose to the community by addressing his alcohol abuse \"rather than punish[ing] him for what might have been\", which \"would certainly run afoul of the principles of fundamental justice\".135 The Court noted that where Mr. Ipeelee was serving his LTSO there were \"few culturally relevant support systems in place\" and there was no evidence that he consumed alcohol on any occasion prior to this breach.136 Furthermore, the Court noted that in light of Mr. Ipeelee's history of heavy drinking since age 11, \"[r]elapse is to be expected as he continues to address his addiction\".137 131 Ibid. 132 Ibid at para 90. 133 134 135 137 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 The Court substituted a sentence of one year's imprisonment. It took into account this was his first breach of his LTSO and he pleaded guilty, but that abstaining from alcohol is also crucial to his rehabilitation under the long-term offender regime. The Court was satisfied that a one-year custodial sentence would: denounce his conduct; deter him from consuming alcohol in the future; provide him with sufficient time without access to alcohol to get back on track with treatment; and yet, at the same time, not \"suggest to Mr. Ipeelee that success under the long- term offender regime is simply not possible\".138 Application to the circumstances of Frank Ladue In the case of Mr. Ladue, the Supreme Court endorsed the British Columbia Court of Appeal's intervention based on the sentencing judge's failure to give his circumstances as an Indigenous person \"tangible consideration\".139 It also agreed that his was a case \"in which the unique circumstances of the Aboriginal offender indicated that the objective of rehabilitation ought to have been given greater emphasis\".140 It cited the majority's consideration of Mr. Ladue's desire to succeed, his demonstrated capacity for abstinence, and the fact that \"[r]epeated efforts at abstinence are not unusual for those dealing with addiction\".141 The Supreme Court also agreed with the majority decision that a three- year prison sentence would not be proportionate, especially in light of the fact that his exposure to the temptation of drugs in Vancouver was \"a result of errors made by correctional officials\".142 Justice Rothstein's partial dissent In contrast to the Supreme Court of Canada's judgments in Gladue and Wells, which were unanimous, the Ipeelee decision includes a set of partially dissenting reasons from Justice Rothstein. While he stated that he agreed with much of what was written in the majority judgment \"in the context of general sentencing principles and application of those principles to Aboriginal offenders\", Justice Rothstein disagreed with 138 Ibid at para 93. 139 Ibid at para 95, citing Ladue, supra note 20 64. 140 Ibid. 141 Ibid, citing Ladue, supra at para 96.132 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B the majority's approach to sentencing Indigenous people for breaching a condition of an LTSO.143 In his view, the protection of society is the paramount consideration when it comes to sentencing for such breaches. He agreed s 718.2(e) \"is mandatory and must be applied in all cases, including the case of long-term Aboriginal offenders\", but was of the view that \"alternatives to a significant prison term will be limited\" in this context.144 In his own summary of the Gladue principles, Justice Rothstein agreed that s 718.2(e) requires sentencing judges to consider background and systemic factors in crafting a sentence, as well as \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances, with particular attention to Aboriginal offenders\".145 He echoed the majority's clarification that they provide \"context for the sentencing judge to determine the appropriate sentence\" rather than \"an excuse or justification for criminal conduct\".146 He also rejected the way in which they were characterized by critics as a \"race-based discount\" or mandating the artificial reduction of incarceration rates.147 Moreover, he agreed the Gladue principles require sentencing judges to guard against racial discrimination in sentencing, \"such as the propensity of Aboriginal offenders to received unjustifiably longer sentences than non-Aboriginals or imprisonment when non-Aboriginals would not be imprisoned\".148 At the same time, Justice Rothstein asserted that \"[t]he role of a sentencing judge in remedying such injustice may most effectively be carried out through alternative sentencing\", which \"requires that they be presented with viable sentencing alternatives to imprisonment that may play a stronger role 'in restoring a sense of balance to the offender, victim, and community, and in preventing future crime'\".149 He noted that this lies within the discretion of the sentencing judge in their evaluation of the options \"with regard to the particular individual, the threat they pose, and their chances of rehabilitation and reintegration\".150 143 Ibid at para 99. 144 Ibid at para 145 146 at para 147 148 Ibid para 149 Ibid at para 128. 150 Ibid.133 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 In light of Justice Rothstein's interpretation of the long-term offender regime having the protection of society as its paramount consideration, he asserted that \"alternatives to imprisonment become very limited\".151 He did not rule out alternatives but wrote that they \"must be viable\" and the sentencing judge must be \"satisfied that they are consistent with protection of society\".152 Justice Rothstein noted alternatives may include returning Indigenous people to their communities but \"this must be done with protection of the public as the paramount concern\".153 He pointed out that \"Aboriginal communities are not a separate category entitled to less protection because the offender is Aboriginal\".154 In Justice Rothstein's view, where the breach of an LTSO \"goes to the control of the Aboriginal offender in the community, rehabilitation and reintegration into society will have faltered, if not failed\" and the sentencing judge may have no other alternative but to separate them from society for a significant period of time.155 However, he stated that their Indigenous status should be taken into account during the period of incarceration \"for the purpose of providing appropriate programs that are intended to rehabilitate the offender so that upon release, the substantial risk of reoffending may be controlled\".156 Justice Rothstein would have upheld the three-year prison sentence imposed on Mr. Ipeelee based on deference to the reasons given by the sentencing judge. He would have also upheld the one-year sentence imposed on Mr. Ladue by the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. However, he would have done so based on the Correctional Service of Canada's partial responsibility for his breach by placing him in Vancouver and denying him a realistic opportunity for rehabilitation by \"bureaucratic error\" rather than any failure of the sentencing judge to properly apply s 718.2(e).157 151 Ibid at para 130. 152 Ibid at 157.134 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Conclusion The Supreme Court of Canada's reasons in Ipeelee are every bit as nuanced and dense as those provided in the Gladue decision. Among other things, the Supreme Court clarified how systemic and background factors can impact an Indigenous person's culpability by shedding light on why they ended up before the court. As this links these factors to one of the two variables that determine the proportionality of any sentence\u2014namely, the degree of responsibility of the offender\u2014the Court clarified that they will be relevant regardless of the gravity or \"seriousness\" of any particular offence. And as proportionality is not only the fundamental principle of sentencing under the Criminal Code but also linked to ss 7 and 12 of the Charter, the impacts of systemic and background factors on an Indigenous person's moral blameworthiness are relevant in all sentencing contexts, including the sentencing of long-term offenders. In terms of process, the Supreme Court also endorsed the use of Gladue reports and implied that case-specific information would be required in every case going forward, in contrast to the more permissive approach in Gladue and Wells. In this way, the Ipeelee decision appears to incorporate the Supreme Court's earlier clarification of judicial notice in Spence. The Supreme Court also clarified how the Gladue principles impact sentencing for breaches of long-term supervision orders in particular, again demonstrating how these principles must be adapted to different statutory contexts under the Criminal Code, just as it had done in Wells. However, in this particular sentencing context the Court was faced with two long-term offenders who had long since been displaced from their communities, reducing the scope for more innovative sentencing options, as noted by Justice Rothstein. In this context, community-specific perspectives and community justice initiatives were given very little attention in comparison to Gladue and Wells. This is not to say that any of these principles and considerations were jettisoned from the jurisprudence as the Court made it clear that the different values of Indigenous communities continue to play a role in the Gladue framework. However, the legal and factual context in which Ipeelee was decided may help explain why Indigenous perspectives and Indigenous community-based programming featured less prominently in Ipeelee than in Gladue and Wells. Perhaps the most important and challenging consequence of Ipeelee is that it upended the approaches that were adopted by several appellate courts almost immediately after the Gladue decision was issued. This suggests that the lower court Gladue jurisprudence prior to 2012 must 135 Chapter 7: Long-term Offenders and Misconceptions in IpeeleeCHAPTER 7 be approached with caution and interpreted through the lens of Ipeelee's clarifications to the law. The Supreme Court of Canada insisted that it is an error in principle to insist on a direct link or connection between the systemic and background factors of an Indigenous community and the person being sentenced, explicitly rejecting the approaches adopted in post-Gladue decisions of the Alberta and Saskatchewan Courts of Appeal. However, it also insisted these factors must be rationally related to the sentencing process and \"tied in some way\" to the particular offender and offence. The gap between these statements is difficult to bridge without reference to the appellate approaches that the Supreme Court either reproached or endorsed in Ipeelee. Likewise, the Court clarified that the Gladue principles must be considered even when sentencing an Indigenous person for a serious offence, but in doing so it emphasized the length of prison terms in this long-term offender context rather than exploring available alternatives. In short, the Ipeelee decision clarifies the Supreme Court's decisions in Gladue and Wells, but these earlier decisions still provide important independent insight into the relevant considerations under s 718.2(e).136 CHAPTER 8: EXTENDING THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES BEYOND S 718.2(E) The Supreme Court of Canada has yet to comprehensively reassess the Gladue principles and how they are being applied by lower courts in the wake of its various clarifications in Ipeelee. To the degree that the Supreme Court has addressed these principles in context to s 718.2(e) since Ipeelee it has done so only in passing. For example, it has addressed how the principles influence dangerous offender applications, albeit not in a matter involving an Indigenous person facing such an application.1 It has also demonstrated how the Gladue principles and s 718.2(e) can factor into constitutional scrutiny under s 12 of the Charter in its decision regarding the mandatory victim surcharge in Boudreault.2 Yet neither case provides much insight into the future direction of the jurisprudence, instead focusing on its contextual relevance in broader constitutional challenges. To the degree that the Supreme Court has indicated new trajectories for the Gladue principles\u2014or at least related and analogous considerations\u2014it has done so in a series of cases that explore and demarcate their relevance in contexts that were unlikely to be contemplated when s 718.2(e) was enacted. To date, the Supreme Court has declined to extend the Gladue principles so as to provide a broader basis for judicial review of exercises of prosecutorial discretion. However, its core principles have been extended to decision-making within the correctional system. Likewise, they have led to recognition of the disproportionate vulnerability of Indigenous women and girls to crime as a distinct issue within the broader phenomenon of systemic discrimination against Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. Each of these developments will be addressed in turn. 1 See R v Boutilier, 2017 SCC 64. 2 See R v Boudreault, 2018 58 at para 83.137 Chapter 8: Extending Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 The court's non-delegable duty to craft a fit sentence under s 718.2(e) in Anderson In Anderson, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously rejected the proposition that \"Crown prosecutors are constitutionally required to consider the Aboriginal status\" of an accused when deciding whether or not to seek a mandatory minimum sentence for impaired driving\".3 Mr. Anderson had been charged with impaired driving and brought a Charter challenge to a Crown prosecutor's decision to seek a mandatory minimum sentence of not less than 120 days' imprisonment against him under s 255 of the Criminal Code by reason of five previous impaired driving-related convictions. He successfully challenged the provisions underlying the mandatory minimum penalty at trial on the basis that they violated ss 7 and 15(1) of the Charter. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal then upheld the decision on the basis that it \"renders a sentencing hearing fundamentally unfair\" when a prosecutor tenders a notice to seek a mandatory minimum under s 255 without considering an accused's Indigenous status, leading to a s 7 Charter breach.4 The Supreme Court, however, allowed an appeal and determined that \"there is no principle of fundamental justice to support the existence of such a constitutional obligation\".5 The Crown's decision to seek a greater punishment is instead \"a matter of prosecutorial discretion which is reviewable by the courts only for abuse of process\".6 The Supreme Court rejected Mr. Anderson's Charter challenge on two bases: (1) it \"conflate[d] the role of the prosecutor and the sentencing judge by imposing on prosecutors a duty that only applies to judges\u2014 the duty to impose a proportionate sentence\"; and (2) the principle of fundamental justice asserted did not meet the test that governs such principles.7 While the second basis for allowing an appeal is not directly relevant to the Gladue principles, the first basis required greater attention to Ipeelee. 3 R v Anderson, 2014 SCC 41 at para 1 [Anderson]. 4 Ibid at para 5 at para 20.138 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Sentencing judges must apply the Gladue principles to respect proportionality The Supreme Court acknowledged that proportionality was described in Ipeelee as not only \"the sine qua non of a just sanction\" but also a principle of fundamental justice.8 It also reiterated its conclusion that an Indigenous person's systemic and background factors may bear on \"the degree of responsibility of the offender\" for the purposes of determining a proportionate sentence \"to the extent that they shed light on his or her level of moral blameworthiness\".9 The Court pointed out that the \"fundamental principle of proportionality\" has been codified in s 718.1 of the Criminal Code as well.10 The factors listed in s 718.2, including \"Aboriginal status\", were described as factors that sentencing judges \"must consider when crafting a fair and just sentence that accords with the fundamental principle of proportionality\".11 The Supreme Court also restated that \"the Gladue principles bear on the ultimate question of what is a fit and proper sentence and assist the judge in crafting a sentence that accords with the fundamental principle of proportionality\".12 Nor did it resile from the statement in Ipeelee that a sentencing judge's failure to consider an Indigenous person's unique circumstances \"breaches both the judge's statutory obligations, under ss. 718.1 and 718.2 of the Code, and the principle of fundamental justice that sentences be proportionate\".13 The proportionality of a sentence is the judge's responsibility, not the prosecutor's Yet while the Court accepted that proportionality is a fundamental principle of justice, it noted that Gladue and Ipeelee address \"the sentencing obligations of judges to craft a proportionate sentence for Aboriginal offenders\" and make no mention of prosecutorial discretion.14 It found no support in either decision for the proposition \"that prosecutors must consider Aboriginal status when making a decision 8 Ibid at para 21, citing R v Ipeelee, 2012 at citing 8 at paras 39, 73. 10 Ibid at para 22. 11 Ibid. Ibid at para 13 Ibid, citing Ipeelee, 87. at para 25.139 Chapter 8: Extending the Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 that limits the sentencing options available to a judge\".15 In the Court's view, this argument conflated \"the distinct roles\" of the judge and the prosecutor in the sentencing process without any basis in law.16 It stated that it is \"the judge's responsibility\" to impose sentence and craft a proportionate sentence within the applicable legal parameters.17 To the extent that a mandatory minimum regime \"requires a judge to impose a disproportionate sentence, the regime should be challenged\".18 In other words, the constitutional implications of the Gladue analysis must be addressed head-on rather than by review of Crown decisions. Gladue has relevance in extradition but does not apply to prosecutorial discretion Mr. Anderson's argument in part relied on the Leonard decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in which it had been held that the Minister of Justice was required to consider the \"Aboriginal status\" of two Indigenous people in deciding whether to surrender them to the United States.19 The Ontario Court of Appeal had found that \"the Gladue factors are not limited to criminal sentencing but ... should be considered by all 'decision-makers who have the power to influence the treatment of aboriginal offenders in the justice system' (Gladue, at para. 65) whenever an Aboriginal person's liberty is at stake in criminal and related proceedings\".20 The Ontario Court of Appeal found that extradition fits into this \"category\" of matters to which the Gladue principles apply.21 The Supreme Court stated that this excerpt from the Leonard decision should not be taken out of context.22 It interpreted the Ontario Court of Appeal's reasons as being premised on the Minister of Justice's statutory duty to determine whether surrender would be unjust or oppressive, which requires the comparison of likely sentences in the foreign state and Canada\u2014\"a task which is impossible to do without reference to Gladue 15 Ibid. 16 Ibid. 17 Ibid. 18 Ibid. 19 Ibid at para 25, citing United States of America v Leonard, 2012 ONCA 622, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 35086 (7 March 2013) [Leonard]. 20 Ibid at para 26, citing Leonard, supra note 19 at para 85. Ibid. 22 Ibid at para 27.140 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B principles\".23 The Supreme Court therefore rejected Mr. Anderson's argument that Leonard supports a \"much broader application of Gladue\" to exercises of prosecutorial discretion.24 Although in doing so it did affirm Gladue's relevance to extradition. Routine judicial review of prosecutorial decision-making would be unworkable The Supreme Court went on to reject Mr. Anderson's Charter argument as asserting a principle that is \"contrary to a long-standing and deeply rooted approach to the division of responsibility between the Crown prosecutor and the courts\".25 It held that requiring prosecutors to consider an individual's \"Aboriginal status\" before electing to pursue a mandatory minimum sentence \"would enormously expand the scope of judicial review of discretionary decisions made by prosecutors\".26 It listed various examples of decisions by prosecutors that could limit a sentencing judge's options as to be potentially subject to judicial oversight under this principle. The Court held that the Crown's decision to seek a mandatory minimum \"is a matter of prosecutorial discretion\" that should not be open to \"routine judicial review\".27 This would be \"contrary to our constitutional traditions\".28 Judges can still address Crown conduct in court and decisions motivated by prejudice The Supreme Court of Canada also provided an expansive interpretation of prosecutorial discretion that is not relevant here. It clarified that only conduct constituting an abuse of process will provide a basis for judicial review of prosecutorial discretion. Yet it did note that \"Crown decisions motivated by prejudice against Aboriginal persons would certainly meet this standard\".29 The Court also affirmed that judges have an implicit power to govern their own process, which can allow for judicial 23 Ibid. 24 Ibid at para 28. 25 Ibid at para 26 Ibid at para 31. 27 at para Chapter 8: Extending the Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 intervention into a prosecutor's \"tactics and conduct before the court\" in the absence of any abuse of process.30 While the Supreme Court's decision in Anderson makes it clear the Gladue principles are not free-standing constitutional principles that displace the constitutional separation of powers or the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings, it has not prevented these principles from being applied in contexts beyond the strict application of s 718.2(e). The most notable example would be the Court's subsequent decision in Ewert which expanded their ambit to the correctional system through a purposive interpretation of a wholly distinct legislative provision and regime. The need for Indigenous difference to be accommodated within corrections in Ewert In Ewert, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) was statutorily obliged to validate psychological and actuarial risk assessment tools for use on Indigenous people before relying on them.31 Mr. Ewert, who identifies as M\u00e9tis, argued at trial that the CSC breached its enabling statute and his rights under ss 7 and 15 of the Charter by relying on five psychological and actuarial risk assessment tools to conduct needs and risk assessments on him while incarcerated. He argued that the tools had been developed and tested on predominately non-Indigenous populations, had not been validated for application to Indigenous people, and could be culturally biased. The Federal Court agreed that the CSC breached its duty to \"take all reasonable steps to ensure that any information about an offender that it uses is as accurate ... as possible\" under s 24(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA)32 when it relied on these tools in spite of long-standing concerns over their validity when applied to Indigenous people.33 This was also found to be a breach of Mr. Ewert's rights under s 7 of the Charter as these tools were used in making decisions related to his security classification, his suitability for parole, temporary absence requests, and in labelling him a psychopath.34 The Federal Court of Appeal allowed an appeal on the basis that Mr. Ewert had failed to prove 30 Ibid at para 61. 31 Ewert v Canada, 2018 SCC 30 at para 6 [Ewert]. 32 Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20 [CCRA ]. 33 Ewert, supra note 31 at Ibid at para 19.142 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B the tools were inaccurate on a balance of probabilities.35 Yet upon further appeal, a majority of the Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge that the CSC had breached its statutory obligation, while dismissing his Charter claims.36 The Correctional Service of Canada must advance substantive equality in corrections As the Ewert decision arises in a prison law context rather than a sentencing matter it is not a case where the Gladue principles could apply by virtue of the statutory direction to sentencing judges in s 718.2(e). Instead, this decision is focused on the interpretation of other provisions within an entirely different statute. Nevertheless, the majority decision makes it clear that the same deeper concerns that underlie Parliament's statutory direction to courts in s 718.2(e) are reflected in Parliament's direction that the CSC must ensure \"correctional policies, programs and practices respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and are responsive to the special needs of [...] aboriginal peoples\" in s 4(g) of the CCRA . The Supreme Court characterized this as \"a direction from Parliament to the CSC to advance substantive equality in correctional outcomes for, among others, Indigenous offenders\".37 Furthermore, it represents Parliament's acknowledgement of the long-standing concern over \"the systemic discrimination faced by Indigenous persons in the Canadian correctional system\".38 Ameliorating systemic discrimination in corrections requires differential treatment The Supreme Court's prior decisions in Gladue and Ipeelee allude to substantive equality in addressing how s 718.2(e) furthers equality by sentencing Indigenous people in a way that accommodates their differences, but this precise phrase is never used in either case. In Ewert, however, the Court clarifies the relationship between the problem of systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system and the role of 35 Ibid at paras 23-24. 36 Ibid at para 53. 38 Ibid.143 Chapter 8: Extending the Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 substantive equality in its solution. The Court points out that the statutory obligation imposed on the CSC to respect Indigenous difference and respond to Indigenous people's special needs, among others, \"reflects the long-standing principle of Canadian law that substantive equality requires more than simply equal treatment and that, indeed, 'identical treatment may frequently produce serious inequality'\".39 This was also found to reflect Parliament's view that Indigenous people \"are among the most vulnerable to discrimination in the correctional system\".40 The CCRA 's legislative history corroborated this view as well. Indigenous alienation and systemic discrimination are not limited to sentencing The Supreme Court found that s 4(g) of the CCRA aims to remedy \"at least in part, the troubled relationship between Canada's criminal justice system and its Indigenous peoples\".41 It noted that \"[t]he alienation of Indigenous persons from the Canadian criminal justice system has been well documented\".42 And while this issue has in the past been most extensively discussed by the Supreme Court in context to s 718.2(e) and its application in sentencing, \"it is clear that the problems that contribute to this reality are not limited to the sentencing process\".43 The Court went on to reiterate its judicial notice of the fact that \"discrimination experienced by Indigenous persons, whether as a result of overtly racist attitudes or culturally inappropriate practices, extends to all parts of the criminal justice systemic, including the prison system\".44 The Court then equated s 4(g) of the CCRA with s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code more directly. It found Parliament has recognized \"an evolving societal consensus that these problems must be remedied by accounting for the unique systemic and background factors affecting Indigenous peoples, as well as their fundamentally different cultural values and world views\".45 Whereas s 718.2(e) embodies this recognition 39 Ibid at para 54, citing Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 SCR 143, 1989 CanLII 2. 40 Ibid. 41 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B in sentencing, the same \"broader problem\" underlies Parliament's direction in s 4(g) of the CCRA .46 A fair and effective criminal justice system requires the accommodation of difference The Supreme Court also found that the correctional system's statutory objectives cannot be fully achieved without accommodating the differences specifically addressed in s 4(g). The CSC is statutorily directed to provide for the humane custody of offenders, use only necessary and proportionate measures, and assist in rehabilitation and reintegration into the community to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.47 The Court noted that achieving these objectives for Indigenous people requires the CSC to \"ensure its policies and programs are appropriate for Indigenous offenders and responsive to their needs and circumstances, including needs and circumstances that differ from those of non-Indigenous offender populations\".48 The Court pointed out that the accommodation of the unique circumstances, cultures, and worldviews of Indigenous peoples is critical to corrections but not limited to this aspect of the criminal justice system. In doing so, it rephrased one of its statements in Ipeelee: [...] For the correctional system, like the criminal justice system as a whole, to operate fairly and effectively, those administering it must abandon the assumption that all offenders can be treated fairly by being treated the same way.49 Systemic discrimination against Indigenous people in corrections has not improved The Supreme Court went on to find that the situation faced by Indigenous people in the correctional system has not improved since s 4(g) was enacted two and a half decades earlier. Instead, it found that recent reports indicate the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people \"has continued to widen on nearly every indicator of correctional 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid at para 59, citing CCRA , Ibid. para Chapter Extending the Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 performance\".50 It identified five different examples of disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in corrections in the reports it reviewed: (i) Indigenous people are more likely to receive higher security classifications; (ii) Indigenous people are more likely to spend more time in segregation; (iii) Indigenous people are more likely to spend more of their sentence in prison before first release; (iv) Indigenous people are under-represented in community supervision populations; and (v) Indigenous people are more likely to return to prison on revocation of parole.51 The Court therefore concluded that the concerns leading to s 4(g)'s enactment in the early 1990s are \"no less relevant today\" and the provision must be given meaningful effect in the face of these ongoing disparities.52 The Supreme Court's conclusion that systemic discrimination against Indigenous people within the correctional system has not improved since the early 1990s may be relevant to sentencing and the application of s 718.2(e) in that it reinforces the Court's earlier finding in Gladue that incarceration has a disproportionately adverse impact on Indigenous people and they are less likely to be rehabilitated by a custodial sanction. While the practices of the CSC may have changed since then, the disparities clearly persist. Yet in Ewert, the Supreme Court's attention is squarely on the discretionary decision-making of the CSC and its duty to further substantive equality in correctional outcomes. It again imports language from Gladue and Ipeelee into this distinct statutory context: Although many factors contributing to the broader issue of Indigenous over-incarceration and alienation from the criminal justice system are beyond the CSC's control, there are many matters within its control that could mitigate these pressing and societal problems[.]53 50 Ibid at para 60. 51 Ibid, citing: Canada, Office of the Correctional Investigator, Spirit Matters: Aboriginal People and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act: Final Report (2012); Canada, Office of the Correctional Investigator, Annual Report 2015-2016 (2016); Canada, Office of the Auditor General, 2016 Fall Reports of the Auditor General of Canada: Report 3\u2014Preparing Indigenous Offenders for Release\u2014Correctional Service Canada (2016). Ibid at para 61. at para 69. 146 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Concerns over cultural bias in actuarial risk assessment tools need to be addressed The Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge that the CSC's failure to confirm the validity of the actuarial risk assessment tools impugned in this case was contrary to its statutory duty to respect the cultural and linguistic differences of Indigenous people in s 4(g).54 The trial judge found the tools were susceptible to cultural bias and the CSC's failure to address this concern meant the information generated by these tools, which influences many of the CSC's decisions, \"may be less accurate in the case of Indigenous inmates\".55 This failure to inquire into their validity also risked undermining the broader purposes of the CCRA as the scores they generated were considered in decisions relating to Mr. Ewert's security classification, escorted temporary absences, and parole, all of which are areas where \"Indigenous inmates reportedly lag behind non-Indigenous inmates\".56 The Court held that the risk that these actuarial tools may overestimate the risk posed by Indigenous people could unjustifiably contribute to disparities in correctional outcomes in a variety of areas where Indigenous people are already disadvantaged, potentially leading to harsher prison conditions, higher security classifications, unnecessary denial of parole, reduced access to rehabilitative opportunities, and reduced access to Indigenous specific-programming.57 As a result, any overestimation of the risk posed by Indigenous people would not only undermine the promotion of substantive equality in correctional outcomes for Indigenous inmates, it would also frustrate the CSC's statutory purposes of providing humane custody, and assisting in the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration in the community as well.58 In this final respect, the Ewert case has additional relevance to sentencing proceedings if the same or similar actuarial tools are applied by court experts and probation officers, and their outcomes are in turn relied upon by the courts. To the degree that existing disparities for Indigenous people in corrections might be perpetuated by the overestimation of 54 Ibid at para 63. 55 Ibid. 56 Ibid at para 57 Ibid at para 65. 58 Ibid.147 Chapter 8: Extending the Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 risk this may reinforce the finding in Gladue that incarceration is a less appropriate or useful sanction for Indigenous people as well. Yet the Ewert case arises from a civil action against the CSC in the Federal Court system and its findings are structured around guiding the future actions of that particular federal agency. While the Supreme Court of Canada does not expressly describe its analysis as an extension of the Gladue principles to the CSC, several of the basic principles it does articulate can be found within Gladue and Ipeelee and they appear to have been imported mutatis mutandis into the distinct statutory context of the CCRA . The Court's subsequent decisions indicate even broader horizons for the applicability of these basic principles by relating them to the circumstances of Indigenous victims, particularly women and girls. Addressing biases, prejudices, and stereotypes against Indigenous women in Barton In Barton, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed an appeal from the jury's decision to acquit a non-Indigenous man, Mr. Bradley Barton, for manslaughter of an Indigenous woman, Ms. Cindy Gladue.59 The decision largely turned on the trial judge's failure to comply with s 276 of the Criminal Code, which governs the admissibility of evidence about a complainant's prior sexual activities. The facts of this case are well- known and most of its legal principles are well beyond the scope of this publication. However, the Supreme Court's reasons in Barton do touch on some of the deeper principles underlying the Gladue analysis, such as the pervasive impacts of widespread bias against Indigenous people throughout the criminal justice system, as well as the systemic and background factors that impact Indigenous people as victims as well as offenders. Building on its prior decision in Williams, the Supreme Court held that \"trial judges, as gatekeepers, play an important role in keeping biases, prejudices, and stereotypes out of the courtroom\".60 One of the tools at their disposal is their ability to provide instructions to the jury that are crafted to expose these biases, prejudices, and stereotypes and that 59 R v Barton, 2019 SCC 33. 60 Ibid at para 197.148 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B can encourage jurors to discharge their duties fairly and impartially.61 The Court also took into account the systemic and background factors impacting Indigenous people, which stem from \"a long history of colonialism, the effects of which continue to be felt\".62 In this case, these serious injustices, including the high rates of sexual violence against Indigenous women, provided an important historical, cultural, and social context.63 After canvassing its prior findings of racism and discrimination in the criminal justice system in Williams, Gladue, Ipeelee, and Ewert, the Supreme Court acknowledged that \"when it comes to truth and reconciliation from a criminal justice system perspective, much-needed work remains to be done\".64 After setting out this broader context for the development of the criminal law, the Court concluded that reasonable steps need to be taken \"to address systemic biases, prejudices, and stereotypes against Indigenous persons\u2014and in particular Indigenous women and sex workers\u2014head-on\".65 The Supreme Court concluded that it would be advisable in future cases where the complainant is an Indigenous woman or girl for the trial judge to provide an express instruction aimed at countering prejudice against Indigenous women and girls that moves beyond more generic instructions to reason impartially and without sympathy or prejudice.66 The Court advised that this could include \"explaining to the jury that Indigenous people in Canada\u2014 and in particular Indigenous women and girls\u2014have been subjected to a long history of colonization and systemic racism, the effects of which continue to be felt\".67 In other words, the trial judge can alert the jury to the systemic and background factors Indigenous complainants face. The Court also advised that the trial judge can dispel the troubling stereotypical assumptions about Indigenous women who perform sex work, listing pervasive beliefs about their sexual availability, the inherent risk of engaging in sex work, and their lessor credibility, among others.68 61 Ibid. 62 Ibid at para 63 Ibid para 65 at para 66 67 Ibid at para 201. 68 Ibid.149 Chapter 8: Extending the Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 The Supreme Court proceeded to link the value of these instructions to \"several core concepts upon which our justice system rests, including substantive equality, which represents the animating norm of s. 15 of the Charter\".69 In keeping with this, the Court described the instructions as \"better ensur[ing] that Indigenous women and girls receive the full protection and benefit of the law in sexual assault cases\" by \"address[ing] biases, prejudices, and stereotypes against Indigenous women and girls openly, honestly, and without fear\".70 In other words, equal protection and benefit of the law can be achieved by recognition of how Indigenous women and girls are differently situated in light of the biases, prejudices, and stereotypes they face in the criminal justice system. Building on Ewert, the Court's decision in Barton demonstrates how the systemic and background factors faced by Indigenous people, including racism and discrimination in the criminal justice system itself, have contextual relevance far beyond sentencing. Here the same broad judicial notice of social facts that informed Williams, Gladue, Ipeelee, and Ewert has informed a further development of the law in jury instructions for sexual assault trials. Just as the constitutional principle of substantive equality supported the extension of these considerations to decision making in the corrections system, here it supported their extension to evidentiary protections at trial.71 The Supreme Court also pointed out how systemic and background factors can make Indigenous women and girls vulnerable, linking them to disproportionate rates of victimization. This last point has been further developed in the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Friesen. Addressing the heightened vulnerability of Indigenous children as victims in Friesen In Friesen, the Supreme Court of Canada provided detailed guidance on various topics of relevance to sentencing in general, including the appropriate role of appellate courts, the limits that appellate deference imposes on sentencing ranges and starting points, and the wrongfulness of sexual offences committed against children.72 Most of the conclusions in Friesen have only peripheral relevance to the focus of this book, but the 69 Ibid at para 202, citing Withler v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 12 at para 2. 70 Ibid at para 204. 71 Similar considerations could conceivably inform the credibility assessments of a judge as trier of fact as well: R v AS, 2016 ONSC 6965 at paras 9.150 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART B Court does reach several conclusions about the heightened vulnerability of Indigenous children to sexual violence and how this can \"perpetuate the disadvantage they already face\".73 The Court took note of statistical evidence that Indigenous people experience childhood sexual violence at a disproportionate level.74 It also acknowledged that the conditions that place many Indigenous children and youth at a heightened risk of being victims of sexual violence are in part consequences of \"Canadian government policies, particularly the physical, sexual, emotional, and spiritual violence against Indigenous children in Indian Residential Schools\".75 Furthermore, over-representation of Indigenous children and youth in the child welfare system was recognized as making them \"especially vulnerable to sexual violence\".76 The Supreme Court accepted on this basis that both the racialized nature of an offence where an Indigenous child is the victim and the overall sexual victimization of Indigenous children can be considered by sentencing judges.77 In doing so, the Court has taken into account the systemic and background factors that Indigenous children and youth face as victims and indicated that they have relevance to sentencing as well. It has once again cast these considerations in the language of equality jurisprudence by pointing out how they perpetuate disadvantage for Indigenous children and youth as victims. At the same time, the Supreme Court also clarified that the Gladue principles nevertheless must be applied to the individual being sentenced for the offence if they are also Indigenous, even in \"extremely grave cases of sexual violence against children\".78 In other words, the relevance of systemic and background factors to the vulnerability of an Indigenous victim does not nullify the relevance of systemic and background factors to the moral blameworthiness of an Indigenous offender or the effectiveness of alternative sanctions. Yet the Friesen decision does demonstrate how 73 Ibid at para 70. 74 Ibid, citing Statistics Canada, \"Victimization of Aboriginal people in Canada, 2014\", by Jillian Boyce (Ottawa: Minister of Industry, 2016). 75 Ibid, citing British Columbia, Representative for Children and Youth, Too Many Victims: Sexualized Violence in the Lives of Children and Youth in Care (Victoria: Representative for Children and Youth, 2016). 76 Ibid. 77 Ibid, citing Tracey Lindberg, Priscilla Campeau & Maria Campbell, \"Indigenous Women and Sexual Assault in Canada\", in Elizabeth A Sheehy, ed, Sexual Assault in Canada: Law, Legal Practice and Women's Activism (University of Ottawa Press, 2012). 78 Ibid at para 92.151 Chapter 8: Extending the Gladue Principles Beyond s 718.2(e)CHAPTER 8 these factors can be relevant to sentencing in a variety of ways, just as Ewert and Barton demonstrate their relevancy beyond the confines of the sentencing process itself. Conclusion Several of the Supreme Court of Canada's decisions since Ipeelee indicate how the broader context it acknowledged when interpreting s 718.2(e)\u2014 namely, Indigenous peoples' alienation from the justice system and the pervasive systemic discrimination they face within it\u2014have relevance to the evolution of Canadian law in other contexts. Likewise, the same systemic and background factors of Indigenous people that must be taken into account when sentencing them as offenders can have similar relevance to their needs in a correctional setting, the risks they face of prejudice and stereotyping in jury trials, and their vulnerability as victims of criminal offences. In this way, the principles have clear application beyond s 718.2(e), at least if interpreted broadly as a call for the recognition and accommodation of several specific forms of Indigenous difference. On the other hand, the Gladue principles are not free-standing constitutional principles that compel courts to abandon other constitutional traditions like the adversarial process and prosecutorial independence, as confirmed in Anderson. They can have constitutional implications by virtue of their relationship with the principle of proportionality and the principle of substantive equality. When tethered to these broader constitutional concepts, the Gladue principles may be imported into other contexts, ranging from extradition proceedings to correctional decisions. These evolutions have been guided by the social context of Indigenous alienation, systemic discrimination, and the devastating legacies of colonialism as well. However, they are also grounded in the specific statutory provisions and legal context before the courts in each specific case. ABORIGINAL PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR OWN CULTURES...

THE RELATIONSHIP OF COLONIALISM PROVIDES THE UNIQUE AND CASE-SPECIFIC CIRCUM - STANCES OF INDIGENOUS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVES154 PART C: THE UNIQUE AND CASE-SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF INDIGENOUS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVES While the Supreme Court of Canada's jurisprudence provides authoritative statements on the framework to be applied whenever an Indigenous person is sentenced, it has done so by way of broad principles rather than articulating a single test. The Gladue framework directs the attention of sentencing judges, counsel for both sides, and the authors of pre-sentence reports towards the unique circumstances of Indigenous people, but does so without purporting to exhaustively describe all the circumstances that might arise. The framework also requires modifications to the sentencing process itself to ensure these circumstances are carefully explored, but without precisely prescribing how this is to be accomplished in practice. As summarized earlier in this publication, a long line of task forces and commissions of inquiry preceded the Gladue decision, they were the source for its factual foundations, and they can clarify the social facts that must now inform any sentencing proceeding involving an Indigenous person. However, lower courts have been left to determine how this broader social context impacts the adjudicative facts on which each sentencing decision turns. What follows in the next three chapters is a synthesis of the most commonly explored unique circumstances based on the jurisprudence to date, as well as a summary of the ways in which sentencing procedures have been modified to ensure these circumstances are thoroughly canvassed. The cases and their factual findings in this part of the book provide data points as much as they do precedents.155 No one judgment, checklist, or publication can address every possible circumstance that might distinguish Indigenous offenders, victims, and communities from others in context to an individualized approach to sentencing. The Gladue analysis must be applied when sentencing individuals whose culture, heritage, upbringing, language, experiences, and community connections will vary widely from one case to the next. It is a sentencing methodology that is equally mandatory in Toronto, Ontario and Kugluktuk, Nunavut, sentencing circles and specialized courts, and with sensitivity to the differing legal, historical, cultural and social contexts in each setting. The Gladue framework may also have distinct procedural implications for a bail hearing as compared to a dangerous offender application. By drawing the attention of counsel, the courts, and authors of court reports to the many circumstances that make Indigenous people unique, the Gladue principles act as a centrifugal force that expands the ambit of sentencing considerations even as the criminal justice system's recognition of these circumstances consolidates over time. The modest ambition of the next three chapters is to facilitate this process by identifying some of the most commonly discussed examples in the reported cases to date, as well as procedural modifications to ensure they are explored in practice. 156 CHAPTER 9: UNIQUE SYSTEMIC AND BACKGROUND FACTORS The first of the two categories of \"unique circumstances\" that judges must pay particular attention to when sentencing an Indigenous person has been summarily described by the Supreme Court of Canada as \"[t]he unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts\".1 These are frequently referred to as an Indigenous person's \"Gladue factors\".2 While convenient, this term can be deceiving in its simplicity. As should be apparent from the preceding chapters, an Indigenous person's systemic and background factors describe their circumstances when viewed through a prism of judicially-noticed social facts about the legacies of settler colonialism and systemic discrimination that contribute to Indigenous over-incarceration.3 These factors are often personal to the individual being sentenced, but the systemic and background factors of their broader communities also provide important context.4 Furthermore, these factors represent only one of two categories of unique circumstances that must be taken into account, \"at the very least\", whenever an Indigenous person is being sentenced.5 The Supreme Court has insisted that this first category of circumstances requires the courts to bear in mind both the history of Indigenous peoples' maltreatment in Canada and the legacy of that treatment in terms of disproportionate rates of social and economic marginalization and systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system. In the words of Justice LeBel in Ipeelee, sentencing judges must take judicial notice 1 R v Gladue, [1999] 1 SCR Canada (Minister of Justice), 2019 BCCA 364 at para 73. 3 R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 at para 77 [Ipeelee]. 4 See for example: R v Jack, 2008 BCCA 437 at paras 29-30, 45-46; R v Collins, 2011 ONCA 182 at para 33 [Collins]. 5 R v Wells, 2000 SCC 10 at para 38.157 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 of: (i) \"such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools\"; and (ii) \"how that history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples\".6 The Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba describes these same factors as the \"intertwined and interdependent factors\" of \"[c]ultural oppression, social inequality, the loss of self-government and systemic discrimination\".7 Taken together, these factors \"provide the necessary context for understanding and evaluating case-specific information presented by counsel\".8 Sources of case-specific information will be addressed in greater detail in a subsequent chapter. For now, it is worth simply noting that this contextualized approach to an Indigenous person's case- specific circumstances has potential relevance to questions of moral blameworthiness, the effectiveness of incarceration as a sanction, and the relevance and priority of restorative sentencing principles in relation to other sentencing goals, among other things.9 The Supreme Court has never drawn a clear line between what it views as background factors and what it views as systemic factors, nor are these concepts easily disentangled. In Gladue, however, the Court specifically referred to \"background factors\" as a way of describing how \"[y]ears of dislocation and economic development have translated, for many aboriginal peoples, into low incomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or irrelevance of education, substance abuse, loneliness, and community fragmentation\".10 In Ipeelee, on the other hand, the Supreme Court described \"systemic factors\" as facially neutral socioeconomic characteristics like an individual's employment status, level of education, and family situation that play a role in systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system.11 These two sets of factors are closely related and overlap in complex ways. Nevertheless, it may be helpful to recognize that systemic and background factors include both: (i) various events, policies, and processes that make Canada's maltreatment of Indigenous peoples distinct and 6 Ipeelee, supra note 3 at para 60. 7 Ibid at 83. 8 Ibid at para note 3 at para 67.158 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C underpin disproportionate rates of social and economic deprivation and marginalization among Indigenous peoples; and (ii) how these enduring legacies of settler colonialism, displacement, and cultural oppression fuel compounding and often unintentional systemic discrimination within the criminal justice system. Due to the complex relationships between the systemic and background factors canvassed in Gladue, Ipeelee, and subsequent jurisprudence, this chapter draws attention to some of the most common factors addressed in the case law to date, while highlighting how they have come together in unique constellations for particular individuals in past cases. Colonialism provides a historical and conceptual link between various factors First, it is worth reiterating what makes the circumstances of Indigenous people unique for the purposes of sentencing. The Supreme Court has directed sentencing judges to take judicial notice of a broad range of discrete events, policies, and processes that make Canada's treatment of Indigenous peoples distinct, with a particular focus on the pervasive legacies of settler colonialism and discrimination against Indigenous individuals and collectives. Many of these factors have been thoroughly researched and documented in the reports and commissions of inquiry canvassed in Chapter 2. These included commissions with a national scope, such as the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, and those with a regional focus, such as the Cariboo-Chilcotin Justice Inquiry. Their findings illustrate that in spite of the diversity of ways in which Indigenous nations, communities, and individuals have been impacted by settler colonialism and discrimination, the legacies of these histories are distressingly consistent, as seen in disproportionate rates of socioeconomic deprivation and marginalization for Indigenous peoples across the country, as well as in other settler colonial states. In the words of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, it is \"[t]he relationship of colonialism [that] provides an overarching conceptual and historical link in understanding much of what has happened to Aboriginal peoples\".12 12 Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Bridging the Cultural Divide: A Report on Aboriginal People and Criminal Justice in Canada (Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada, 1996) at 47 [Bridging the Cultural Divide].159 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 Each Indigenous nation or community has its own unique history and factors In spite of the common legacies that settler colonialism and discrimination have left among Indigenous peoples across Canada, many sentencing judges are nevertheless sensitive to the unique histories and experiences of specific Indigenous nations and communities in their analyses. To illustrate the diversity of contextual factors that may be considered in sentencing decisions it is worth considering a few specific examples: In Dantimo, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice canvassed how the Ojibway, Odawa, and Pottawatomi of Manitoulin Island were historically displaced and divided into different reserves to accommodate non-Indigenous settlement on the island, how their resultant land claims have remain unsettled for several decades, and how these circumstances might feed into systemic issues on the island, as well as their alienation from the justice system.13 In Ladue, the British Columbia Court of Appeal took into account how the Kaska of Ross River in the Yukon face intergenerational impacts from sexual and physical abuse and violence at the hands of members of the United States Army during the construction of a pipeline through their territory during the 1940s.14 In Drysdale, the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench considered how an adopted individual's birth parents were two of the \"tent village people\" who lived in crowded, uninsulated polyethylene tents outside of Lynn Lake, Manitoba until the mid-1980s.15 They lived without power or water service, they were unable to either enter Lynn Lake without a police escort or enrol their children in local schools, their homes were forcibly relocated away from Lynn Lake on multiple occasions, and many of their children were apprehended.16 In Wabason, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered how Whitesands First Nation in northern Ontario experienced significant upheaval after being flooded out in the 1940s, forcing community members to relocate and rebuild elsewhere.17 13 R v Dantimo, [2009] OJ No 655 (QL), CanLII 6627 (Ont Ct) at paras 8, 14 v Ladue, 2011 BCCA 101 at para 6 [Ladue]. 15 R v Drysdale, 2016 SKQB para 14 [Drysdale]. 16 paras 17 Wabason, 2016 ONSC 349 at para 82, rev'd on other grounds 2018 ONCA 187. 160 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C In Tukkiapik, the Quebec Superior Court considered how the way of life of the Inuit of Kuujjuaq was impacted by government practices and policies resulting in community relocations, the rapid introduction of a sedentary lifestyle, and the slaughter of Inuit sled dogs in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as the introduction of the residential school system to Nunavik.18 In Wolfleg, the Alberta Court of Appeal considered how the Siksika of southern Alberta were impacted by the arrival of missionaries, smallpox, and decreased bison populations in the mid-19th century, as well as the arrival of the CP rail in the 20th century, and how these contextualize their contemporary situation.19 Unpacking the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools In addition to regional or community-specific factors, sentencing judges are often faced with more generalizable experiences of colonialism and systemic discrimination across the country, especially those that reflect government policies applied to all First Nations, as well as M\u00e9tis and Inuit in many instances. The residential school system is likely the best- known example. In addition, sentencing judges have acknowledged the impacts of day schools, the Indian Act, and the Sixties Scoop, both on individuals and communities, in myriad sentencing decisions. In order to better demonstrate how these events, policies, and processes have left a legacy of economic and social deprivation for Indigenous peoples, several common examples will be explored in greater detail. Intergenerational and direct impacts from attendance at residential schools Many sentencing judges have taken judicial notice of either the direct or intergenerational impacts of the residential school system.20 While the residential school system was not explicitly referenced in the guidance set 18 R c Tukkiapik, 2018 QCCS 5938 at paras 167-182 222 paras 82-83, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38542 (13 June 2019) [Wolfleg]. 20 See for example: R v Charlie, 2012 YKTC 5 at paras 6-10 [Charlie]; R v Gabriel, 2013 MBCA 45 at paras 27-28; R v Charles, 2015 SKQB 302 at paras 16, 33; R v Denny, 2016 v ONSC 2017 ABPC supra note 19 at paras 82-84.161 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 out in Gladue, it was linked to Canada's overall history of colonialism in Ipeelee and has become a common and well-accepted factor in sentencing decisions since then. In order to make the scope and content of these impacts clear, many sentencing decisions cite former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's apology to the survivors of the residential school system in 2008.21 In that apology, the harms of the residential schools were described as including: forcibly removing children from their homes and communities; leaving many inadequately fed, clothed, and housed; depriving all of the care and nurturing of their parents, grandparents, and communities; prohibiting the use of Indigenous languages and cultural practices; and leaving a damaging impact on Indigenous culture, heritage, and language.22 The apology also acknowledged that many children died while attending residential schools and many others returned with tragic accounts of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, neglect, and separation from powerless families and communities.23 Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper described the policy objectives of the residential schools as follows: ...Two primary objectives of the Residential Schools system were to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture. These objectives were based on the assumption that Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, \"to kill the Indian in the child\". Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country.24 Several sentencing judges have also referred to the extensive findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as set out in its 2015 final report, in order to clarify the various impacts of which they have taken judicial notice.25 Among other things, the Truth and Reconciliation 21 See for example: R v Quock, 2015 YKTC 32 at para 113 R v Armitage, 2015 note 21 at para 113. 23 Ibid. 24 Ibid. 25 See for example: supra at 114-118; ONCJ 729 at Andrew, supra paras 41-42.162 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Commission canvassed the intergenerational nature of the many harms caused by the residential schools: The impacts of the legacy of residential schools have not ended with those who attended the schools. They affected the Survivors' partners, their children, their grandchildren, their extended families, and their communities. Children who were abused in the schools sometimes went on to abuse others.26 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that residential school survivors \"not only lost their connections to parents, but also found it difficult to become loving parents\".27 Due to the low expectations that principals and teachers had for Indigenous students at these schools, they also received a \"poor-quality education [that] led people into chronic unemployment and underemployment\".28 The Commission found that residential school survivors are more likely to live in low-income households and to have experienced income insecurity than Indigenous people who did not attend the schools.29 Poverty and a lack of employment opportunities are in turn linked to domestic violence and lower educational attainment for one's children, demonstrating how these impacts are not limited to the former attendees themselves.30 Intergenerational and direct impacts from attendance at day schools The direct and intergenerational impacts of attendance at \"day schools\"\u2014schools Indigenous students were compelled to attend but without residing there\u2014may be less widely known than those of the residential schools. Nevertheless, various abuses and impacts from day school attendance have often been recognized as relevant factors in sentencing decisions to date, the majority of which parallel those suffered by residential school survivors.31 While there is not yet any equivalent 26 As cited in Nashkewa, supra note 25 at para 42. 27 Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Canada's Residential Schools: The Legacy , The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, vol 5 (Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2015) at 4. 28 Ibid at 61. 29 Ibid at 233. 30 Ibid. 31 See for example: R v Anderson, 2016 MBPC 28 at para 13; R v Hall, 2019 ABQB 343 163 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 report to that of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to explain the systemic impacts of day school attendance on Indigenous peoples, class action litigation has thoroughly addressed this topic to date. In 2019, the Federal Court approved a settlement agreement for a class action brought on behalf of former day school students, in addition to their spouses, children, and grandchildren.32 The Court described the action as addressing \"allegations of assault, abuse and mistreatment\", as well as \"mockery, belittlement, and physical, sexual, cultural and emotional abuse\".33 In the settlement agreement, the Government of Canada \"acknowledges that children were divided from their families and culture and were denied their heritage\" and \"[m]any were physically, emotionally and sexually abused\".34 The Federal Court pointed out that the principle difference between residential schools and day schools was that day school students went home at night, but many of the same abuses recognized in the residential school settlement were inflicted on those attending day schools as well.35 Attendance at the day schools was compulsory and truancy resulted in punishment for children and their parents.36 In spite of these parallels with the impacts faced by residential school survivors, \"Indian Day School survivors were largely left out of [that] earlier settlement\".37 The Federal Court also summarized the following impacts of the day schools: These schools had profoundly negative effects on many of their students. The representative plaintiffs were exposed to a program of denigration, psychological abuse and physical violence often for such simple things as speaking their own language to others of their community at the schools. This experience had a deep and lasting impact on the representative plaintiffs, impairing at para 70 [Hall]; R v Bellegarde, 2019 SKPC at paras 72, R v Dusome, 2019 ONCJ 444 at 14; R v Smith, 2019 BCSC [Smith]; R v CGG, 2017 MBQB 61 at paras 6, 20. 32 McLean v Canada, 2019 FC 1075.

Children removed from their families are severed from their roots and grow up not knowing what it is to be Inuit, M\u00e9tis or a First Nations member. Yet they are set apart from their new families and communities by visible difference and often made to feel ashamed of their origins. At the same time, their home communities and extended families are robbed of part of the next generation.41 In addressing the merits of a Sixties Scoop class action in Ontario, Justice Belobaba of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice stated summarily that \"the Sixties Scoop happened and great harm was done\".42 He described 38 Ibid at para 19. 39 See for example: R v Nicholls, 2015 ONSC 8136 v TL, 2018 ONCJ 107 at para 81 [TL]; R v Spence, 2019 MBQB 136 at para 13; Smith, supra note 31 at para 27; R v Paul, 2019 SKQB 142 at para 12. 40 See Brown v Canada (Attorney General), 2013 ONSC 5637 at paras 1, 3 [Brown]. 41 Nicholls, supra note 39 at 11.

In the foster and adoptive system, Aboriginal children vanished with scarcely a trace, the vast majority of them placed until they were adults in non-Aboriginal homes where their cultural identity and legal Indian status, their knowledge of their own First Nation and even their birth names were erased, often forever.45 In approving a Canada-wide settlement of class actions on behalf of Indigenous children apprehended during the Sixties Scoop, Justice Shore of the Federal Court described the various harms inflicted on these individuals as follows: The loss of cultural identity of children taken from their traditional homes led to a loss of cultural belonging. Loss of culture, language and identity led to a loss of personal and collective essence for vulnerable children who were \"scooped\" from 1951 to 1991. The loss of belonging took away the reason and purpose for life of individuals who lost the direction for a life journey before it could even begin.

The attempt to commit \"cultural genocide\" of entire Indigenous nations, as stated by former Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, is that which she defined as \"the worst stain in Canada's human rights record\".46 In a more contemporary child apprehension context, Justice Chappel of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has identified connections between the residential school system, the Sixties Scoop, and continuing high rates of apprehension for Indigenous children in Canada.47 She identified a \"growing body of evidence indicating that the negative effects of the Residential Schools experience and the Sixties Scoop, coupled with prejudicial attitudes towards Aboriginal peoples and their parenting, have led to an ongoing over-representation of Aboriginal children in foster care, mostly in non-Aboriginal homes\".48 She also pointed to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's conclusion that the current overrepresentation of Indigenous children in foster care indicates \"Canada's child welfare system has simply continued the assimilation that the residential school system started\".49 The Federal Court of Appeal has likewise expressed concern over the disproportionate rate at which Indigenous children continue to end up in foster care with non-Indigenous caregivers in Canada, as well as the importance of Indigenous children \"maintain[ing] some connection with [their] culture, heritage and, ideally, territory, to help foster a sense of belonging and pride\".50 The Court pointed out that the significance of this kind of connection for Indigenous children is explicitly set out in Article 30 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and has been acknowledged by the Standing Senate Committee on Human Rights.51 The Court also emphasized the 46 Riddle v Canada, 2018 FC 641 at para 5.

He described the child welfare system as \"failing the most vulnerable of our population\"\u2014namely, Indigenous children.53 He took note of how \"[y]oung teenagers (children really, in newly developed adult bodies) are warehoused in motel rooms in Winnipeg and Vancouver because there are not enough Foster parent homes or groups homes available anywhere in Canada that can meet the volume of children in care\".54 Justice Campbell also noted how these children \"are removed from their parents, their community and their culture\" and \"when living in hotels in large cities [they] become easy prey for the predators that seek them out ... and these needy, damaged teens are easy to identify and exploit\".55 In light of such concerns, it may not be surprising to find that many sentencing decisions recognize an Indigenous person's direct and intergenerational experiences with the child welfare system as a Gladue factor regardless of whether these experiences fit within the particular time period known colloquially as the Sixties Scoop.56 The disproportionate rate at which Indigenous children are apprehended may have other implications for sentencing as well, such as collateral consequences for Indigenous parents who are being sentenced or the magnification of harm to Indigenous complainants who risk triggering child apprehensions when they report offences against their children.57 The Silenced Citizens\u2014Effective Implementation of Canada's International Obligations with Respect to the Rights of Children (April 2007). 52 Ibid at para 91.

According to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the Indian Act \"is widely recognized for controlling virtually everything that touches Indian people\" and it \"has long been universally labeled as paternalistic and a relic of past colonial practices\".59 Part of the original intent and purpose of this legislation was \"the assimilation of Indians into mainstream non- Indian society\".60 The imposition of the Indian Act on First Nations also reflects the Canadian government's historic intention to treat the members of First Nations as having the legal status of \"minors\", \"wards\" or \"children of the State\" under the guardianship or \"tutelage\" of the federal government until assimilated into non-Indigenous society.61 While there have been several amendments to the Indian Act since 1876, it still delegates \"meaningful management of reserve lands\" and \"broad discretionary powers over the implementation of the Act as well as the daily lives of Indians on reserves\" to federal ministers rather than First Nations themselves.62 58 See for example: R v RKD, 2013 BCPC 253 at 23; R v Hilbach, 2018 ABQB 526 at para 35, aff 'd in part 2020 ABCA 332; R v McKay, 2020 MBQB 106 565 at para 43, citing Canada, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: Looking Forward, Looking Back, vol 1 (Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada, 1996) at 256-57. Note that the Court of Appeal's use of the term \"Indian\" rather than \"Aboriginal\" or \"First Nations\" in its reasons was solely to avoid confusion by using the language of the Indian Act in analyzing the history of that legislation (para 2). 60 Ibid at para 65. 61 at 73, 76.169 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 As noted in a decision authored by Justice Grammond of the Federal Court, the Indian Act and related policies also sought to undermine and displace both the traditional leadership of First Nations and their distinct legal traditions: Despite the occasional recognition of Indigenous law by Canadian courts, the overall tendency was, for a long period, one of denial and suppression[.] [...] As early as 1869, Parliament enacted provisions allowing the government to suppress traditional systems of governance and replace them with elected councils to govern the affairs of communities (An Act for the gradual enfranchisement of Indians, the better management of Indian affairs, and to extend the provisions of the Act 31st Victoria, Chapter 42, SC 1869, c 6, s 10).63 As noted by Justice Gibson of the Ontario Court of Justice, the Indian Act and related policies allowed the federal government to closely control the daily lives of First Nations through the appointment of Indian agents who were \"automatically appointed as justices of the peace with full authority to conduct trials anywhere in the country involving Indians charged with violating the Indian Act and certain crimes under the Criminal Code\".64 Justice Gibson also quotes the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba's description of the broad impacts of Indian agents and the Indian Act on the autonomy of First Nations and their members: In every aspect of life, from criminal law to education to religious expression, from hunting to agriculture, from voting to the use of lawyers, Aboriginal people ran into regulations that restricted their freedom. Traditional systems of government were replaced by a restricted and illusory form of democracy in which only adult men had a voice and a vote. All real power rested with the Indian agent who supervised voting, chaired the meetings, kept the official records, decided when, where and if chief and council would meet and controlled council's agenda.65 As a further example, Justice Phelan of the Federal Court has canvassed evidence of Canada's historic \"starvation policy\" that was imposed in the Prairies following the collapse of the bison hunt.66 This included 63 Pastion v Dene Tha' FC 648 9. 64 Morrisseau, supra note 58 at para 36, citing Manitoba, Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba (Winnipeg: Province of Manitoba, 1991), vol I [Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba] at 70. 65 Ibid at para 35, citing Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, supra note 64 at 64. 66 Watson v Canada, 2020 FC 128 at para 27.170 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C the limiting of rations to get First Nations to leave certain areas, the provision of substandard rations, and a Work for Rations Program to provide limited rations in exchange for Indigenous labour on home farms.67 Justice Phelan also accepted evidence to the effect that \"Prime Minister John A. Macdonald said it was bad policy to feed bands well, in support of the continued provision of starvation allowances\".68 Furthermore, he accepted evidence of an Indian agent being \"specifically instructed to give as little rations as possible to able bodied Indians who would not or were not at work\" in the Crooked Lakes area of what is now southern Saskatchewan.69 As a broader example of the Indian Act and related policies' impacts on Indigenous autonomy, Justice Martineau of the Federal Court has canvassed how these displaced Indigenous peoples' traditional mechanisms for policing and the collective regulation of social order.70 He noted how s 104 of the Indian Act stipulated that \"[a]ny constable may, without process of law, arrest any Indian or non-treaty Indian whom he finds in a state of intoxication, and convey him to any common gaol, house of correction, lock-up or other place of confinement, there to be kept until he is sober\".71 He also took note of Indian agents' broad discretion to impose fines and imprison both status and non-status individuals under earlier versions of this legislation.72 Justice Martineau also addressed how the history of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) intersects with the history of the Indian Act and various related policies. Of particular note, the RCMP (formerly known as the North West Mounted Police) enforced \"infamous measures such as compulsory school attendance for Indian children and the placement of Indian children in residential schools, the prohibition of traditional spiritual practices, which became offences under the Indian Act (see former section 114), and the pass system under which residents of reserves had to obtain written permission to leave the reserve\".73 67 Ibid. 68 Ibid at para 208. 69 Ibid. 70 Picard v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FC 747 at paras 55-58, aff 'd Quebec (Attorney General) v Picard, 2020 FCA 74, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39210 (26 November 2020). 71 Ibid at para 57, citing the Indian Act, RSC 1886, c 43. 72 Ibid. 73 Ibid at para Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 Contextual and historical facts such as these may help illuminate why the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples' concluded in 1996 that \"[i]t has been through the law and administration of justice that Aboriginal people have experienced the most repressive aspects of colonialism\".74 Loss and denial of status and band membership under the Indian Act In spite of the harmful legacies of the Indian Act on the autonomy of First Nations and their members, courts have also acknowledged adverse impacts on those excluded from its provisions. That is to say that several decisions recognize that loss or denial of status or band membership under the Indian Act, either for the individual being sentenced, their family members, or their ancestors, can also be a relevant factor in sentencing.75 This is linked to a long and complex history of laws, policies, and practices aimed at restricting the number of individuals who are recognized as \"Indians\" in Canada, which will be briefly summarized here for ease of reference. Registration (or status) under the Indian Act may carry with it a number of tangible benefits, \"such as extended health benefits, financial assistance with post-secondary education and extracurricular programs, and exemption from certain taxes\", as well as intangible benefits in terms of \"acceptance within the aboriginal community\".76 Registration under the Indian Act is often closely linked to band membership as well, which determines one's right to reside in that community and vote for its leaders.77 Historic versions of the Indian Act included \"enfranchisement\" provisions to encourage members of First Nations to give up their status and band membership, as well as their ability to pass these on to future generations, in exchange for such incentives as Canadian citizenship, the right to vote in Canadian elections, and property rights.78 These were 74 Ibid at para 56, citing Bridging the Cultural Divide, supra note 12 at 57. 75 See for example: R v Florence, 2015 BCCA 414 at paras 29-30; Collins, supra note 4 15-16; 31 at paras 2020 ONCJ 128 at paras 47-51, 53. 76 McIvor v Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153 at para 70, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 33201 (5 November 2009). 77 Canada (Attorney General) v Larkman, 2012 FCA 204 at para 12 [Larkman]. 78 Canada (Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FCA 200 at para 11 [Canada (HRC) v 'd 2018 SCC 31.172 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C \"designed to encourage Aboriginal people to renounce their heritage and identity, and to force them to do so if they wished to take a full part in Canadian society\".79 Individuals also automatically lost their status under the Indian Act after receiving higher education, or becoming doctors, lawyers, or ministers.80 Those who served in the two World Wars were required to enfranchise along with their entire families, and anyone who left Canada for more than five years without permission lost their status as well.81 The Federal Court of Appeal has described this enfranchisement policy as \"one of the most oppressive policies adopted by the Canadian government in its history of dealings with Aboriginal peoples\".82 There is also a long history of legislation depriving First Nations women of status under the Indian Act, dating back to as early as 1857.83 Up until 1985, the rules under the Indian Act governed the passing of status on to children with \"a patrilineal concept of descent that was foreign to many indigenous traditions\", relying almost entirely on the status of a child's father.84 Furthermore, prior to 1985 women lost their status upon marriage to a man without status, making their children ineligible for registration under the Act.85 The only exemption to this patrilineal rule was in relation to \"illegitimate children\".86 The provisions governing status under the Indian Act have since been subject to multiple successful Charter challenges and subsequent amendments aimed at addressing this legacy of gender discrimination against Indigenous women.87 The Supreme Court of Canada itself has recognized how the various enfranchisement provisions under the Indian Act have \"often led to the denial of status and the severing of connections between band members and the band\".88 Many individuals whose families and ancestors were 79 Corbiere v Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 SCR 203 at para 88, 1999 para 10. 83 Corbiere, supra note 79 at para 86. 84 Canada (HRC) v Canada (AG), supra note 78 at para 13 85 Gehl v Canada (Attorney General), 2017 ONCA 319 at para 7. 86 Ibid at Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 directly affected by these policies \"are now living away from reserves, in part, because of them\".89 While more recent amendments to the Indian Act attempt to address the legacy of discrimination against First Nations women by reversing some forms of enfranchisement, status alone may not reverse the severing of community connections. The Supreme Court has recognized that First Nations people living off-reserve are vulnerable and disadvantaged, and they may be stereotyped as \"less Aboriginal\" and \"less valuable members of their bands\".90 In light of all these circumstances, loss or denial of status under the Indian Act can be linked to community and cultural dislocation, loss of social, economic, and community supports for those with status, and, in some cases, a legacy of discrimination that is unique to First Nations women and their descendants. Constellations of constraining socio- economic factors as a legacy of colonialism There are complex relationships between Canada's history of colonialism and systemic discrimination against Indigenous peoples, the disproportionate rates of economic and social marginalization that Indigenous peoples face, and the individual circumstances of any one Indigenous person who might find themselves before the courts, not to mention the circumstances of communities and victims. This can make the Gladue principles challenging to conceptualize and apply in practice. The Supreme Court of Canada has been clear that sentencing judges must take judicial notice of more than just the fact that government actions and policies like community relocations and the residential school system have negatively impacted Indigenous individuals, their families, and their communities. They must also take judicial notice of how these impacts are reflected in the contemporary statistical and demographic reality in which many Indigenous individuals and collectives find themselves, including higher rates of substance abuse, suicide, and unemployment, and disproportionately less income and formal education.91 89 Ibid. 90 Ibid at paras 91-92. 91 at para 60. 174 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C The constrained socio-economic circumstances that affect many Indigenous people can in turn shed light on their moral blameworthiness.92 These circumstances may be relevant to sentencing in other ways as well.93 Several socio-economic circumstances that are commonly considered as part of the application of the Gladue principles have been outlined below for greater clarity. Individual, familial, and collective experiences of racism and discrimination Numerous sentencing decisions have recognized an individual's experiences of racism as a relevant factor for sentencing, whether these have occurred in school, employment, foster care, out-adoption, specific communities, or Canadian society at large.94 These experiences can be relevant to moral blameworthiness and sentencing principles in nuanced and compounding ways that may warrant close examination. Experiences of racism often appear to illuminate an individual's circumstances in ways that are integrally linked with other systemic factors. For example, several sentencing judges have considered the circumstances of Indigenous people whose formal education in non-Indigenous schools was impacted or cut short due to racism, racially motivated bullying, and related behavioural problems when this has led to conflicts with teachers or other students, thus linking it to lower educational attainment.95 Experiences of racism in the workplace may provide a link to unemployment or lower salaries.96 Other sentencing decisions have 92 Ibid at para 73. 93 R v Crazyboy, 2012 ABCA 228 at para 32. 94 See for example: R v AJ, 2015 SKQB 156 at paras 34-35, 64 [AJ]; supra v Syliboy, 2018 NSPC at 24, 94 [Diabo]; v Bear, 2019 SKQB 22 at paras 17, 72; R v Ahpay, 2018 SKQB 147 at para 13 v Heimbecker, 2020 SKQB 304. 95 See for example: R v SL, 2012 MBPC 22 at para 94; v TMB, 2014 1961 at para 84; R v Smoke, 2014 MBCA 91 at para 47; R v O'Connor, 2014 ABPC 264 at paras 23, 34 [O'Connor]; R v Sutherland- Cada, 2016 2017 82 at 60; R v Dennis, 2018 BCPC 270 at paras 13, 24, 29, 33; R v Arcand, 2019 SKQB at 94 at para 34; R v Okemahwasin, 2015 SKPC 71 at para R v Burke, 2018 SKPC 43 at para 22; R v Tremblay, 2018 ABQB 400 at para 26 175 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 considered how racism leads some Indigenous people and their families to conceal or deny their heritage and community connections, linking this to other factors like loss of culture and displacement.97 Racism may also play a part in family breakdown or an individual's difficulties in foster care, out-adoption, or families of mixed heritage.98 Depending on its source, it could colour how an individual views authority figures.99 Or it could nudge them towards involvement in street gangs, which one sentencing judge described as exploiting the \"righteous anger\" of Indigenous youth and \"manipulat[ing] it into petty criminality\".100 Some decisions have considered how Indigenous people of mixed heritage can grow up facing discrimination or bullying from Indigenous and non-Indigenous peers, leading to cultural dislocation and negative impacts on their sense of self-esteem and self-worth.101 Individual and collective experiences of racism may likewise shed light on a particular offence\u2014for example, when that offence reflects underlying racial tensions. In Skead, Justice Gibson of the Ontario Court of Justice discussed how the long-standing treatment of Indigenous peoples in northwest Ontario provided context for a violent assault by two Anishinaabe men against a non-Indigenous man who made it clear they were unwelcome at a party and may have made \"some disrespectful comments\" towards them when asking them to leave.102 Justice Gibson saw this as an example of how unconscious racial tensions \"play out over and over again, fuelled by old resentments\".103 Racism can also shed light on an individual's history of involvement in the justice system. As addressed earlier in this publication, the Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly acknowledged the detrimental impacts [Tremblay]; Diabo, supra note 94 at paras 19, 94. 97 See for example: R v Bannon, 2011 ONSC 3000 at at paras 64; R v Hamilton, 2020 SKPC 19 at para 44. 98 See for example: R v Alton, 2012 ONSC 5500 at para 52; v Crawford, paras 101, 107; R v Pouce 255 at para 11; R v 84, 86-87 [Zaworski]; Grandinetti, supra note 94. 99 R v Wolfe, 2016 SKQB 11 at para 66. 100 R v Skead, 2015 ONCJ 790 at 13-14 [Skead]. 101 See for R v Brown, 2018 at para Zaworski, supra 79, 84, 102 Skead, supra note 100 at 5. 103 Ibid at 14.176 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C of widespread racism and systemic discrimination against Indigenous people throughout the criminal justice system itself, which includes biases, stereotypes, and assumptions about their credibility, worthiness, and criminal propensity, overtly racist attitudes, and culturally inappropriate practices.104 Similarly, experiences of racism in policing may help contextualize someone's attitude towards the justice system, while also casting light on other systemic factors they face. For instance, the Supreme Court has acknowledged the impacts of the disproportionate policing of racialized and low-income communities, including practices such as street checks and carding.105 The Court accepted that this \"takes a toll on a person's physical and mental health\", \"impacts their ability to pursue employment and education opportunities\", \"contributes to the continuing social exclusion of racial minorities, encourages a loss of trust in the fairness of our criminal justice system, and perpetuates criminalization\".106 Gang involvement and exposure Several judgments have considered either a person's own involvement in gangs or their exposure to high rates of gang activity in their community as relevant Gladue factors.107 This is often connected with an individual's other systemic and background factors, such early exposure to substance misuse, family histories of criminal involvement, and cognitive deficits from conditions like Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), with the result that their involvement in gangs and violence \"should not be surprising to anyone\".108 Gangs may be able 104 See R v Barton, 2019 SCC 33 at para 199, citing: R v Williams, [1998] 1 SCR at Canada, 2018 SCC 30 at para 57. 105 R v Le, 2019 SCC 34 at paras 89-97. 106 Ibid at para 95, citing: Michael H.

It is entirely understandable that he might seek the comparative structure, companionship, personal protection and safety of a gang over the chaos, disharmony and violence of his home life. Okimaw conformed to gang culture expectations throughout his formative teenage years and into young adulthood. We emphasize that we are talking about the realities of Okimaw's existence, not approving his choices. Gang participation was one of the worst things that could have happened to him: its re-enforcement of anti-social thinking and its withering of empathy dragged him further into anti-social behaviour. Providing more positive options for disoriented youth is a compelling social need that unfortunately the criminal justice system cannot meet. But the criminal justice system, as Gladue teaches, cannot be oblivious to the cumulative distortive effects of a lack of pro-social options, and the resultant bad choices of individuals. It is very difficult to break cycles, once ingrained.111 In Sellars, the British Columbia Court of Appeal demonstrates how high rates of gang violence in a particular community and an individual's own gang affiliation can have relevance to several competing sentencing principles and provisions.112 The Court of Appeal found that gang-related gun violence in the community of Williams Lake and its surrounding Indigenous communities highlighted the relevance of denunciation and deterrence in sentencing Mr. Sellars for unauthorized possession of a 109 See Skead, supra note 100 at 13-14. 110 R v Jimmy, 2009 SKQB 124 at para 32; R v Harper, 2016 at R v Ndlovu, 2017 supra note 94 at para 92. 111 supra note 107 at para 77. 112 Sellars, supra note 107. 178 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C loaded handgun.113 At the same time, the Court found that his moral blameworthiness was mitigated by his background circumstances, which included how he was pressured and socialized into a gang as a youth by older males in his community, which in turn was linked to other factors like early exposure to substance use, mental and physical health issues, suicide attempts, and deaths among family and friends.114 Furthermore, Mr. Sellars consciously disassociated from gang involvement, which required him to move away from his community, and this made his past gang involvement relevant once more as one of several exceptional rehabilitative initiatives to be considered in sentencing.115 Similarly, in MacLeod, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal addressed how an individual's frank disclosure of his background as \"an actively- involved gang member\" to a pre-sentence report writer required nuanced attention in sentencing.116 The Court insisted that someone's history of active gang involvement cannot elevate their sentence if doing so amounts to punishing them for \"offences that have gone uncharged\", but accepted that such a background might indicate an offence \"was not entirely out of character\".117 At the same time, the Court of Appeal held that it would be an error to treat someone's frank and voluntary disclosure of past criminal behaviour\u2014in this case, made \"in an effort to demonstrate to the sentencing court that he had abandoned the gang lifestyle\"\u2014as elevating moral blameworthiness.118 The Court emphasized the importance of thorough and quality information for individualized sentencing, urging that \"offenders must not be deterred from putting the necessary evidence before the sentencing court\".119 It also found that Mr. MacLeod's post-offence conduct, which included participation in anti-gang programming, was mitigating to the degree it indicated his receptiveness to rehabilitation and promoted a sense of responsibility and acknowledgment of harm.120 113 Ibid at paras 6, 27. 114 10-11, 27. 115 Ibid at paras 11-12, 116 v MacLeod, 2018 SKCA 1. 117 Ibid at para 41. 118 at 42. 120 Ibid at paras 7, 43.179 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 Geographic challenges such as community isolation and remoteness Many judgments have considered geographic factors like isolation or the remoteness of an Indigenous community as relevant to sentencing, echoing the earliest jurisprudence on accommodative sentencing of Indigenous people canvassed in Chapter 1.121 Often a community's geographic remoteness will shed light on an Indigenous person's moral blameworthiness through its relationship with other systemic factors, such as high rates of unemployment, crime, violence, substance abuse, or FASD, overcrowding and inadequate housing, or limited access to recreational resources, social services, or health services.122 These same factors may also have relevance to other sentencing principles to the degree they make community members more vulnerable to criminal offences.123 This may require sentencing judges to balance the rehabilitative value of an individual's community connection against a remote community's own safety concerns.124 Multiple systemic and background factors may overlap and compound in some isolated communities. In Black, for example, Justice Harris of the Ontario Court of Justice provided the following bleak description of the Ojibway community of Pikangikum First Nation, which is only accessible by expensive flights or a seasonal ice road: Geographic isolation has translated into depreciated opportunity for access to standard health care, steady employment and functioning public services, leading to a higher than average poverty rate amongst most residents of the community over multiple generations. Housing conditions are generally poor with broken windows and graffiti being prevalent around the community. Sanitary running water and sewage for homes are improving slowly, however, many homes do not have access 121 See for example: R v Jimmie, 2009 BCCA 215 at paras 9, R v 2016 397 at v at v Casimir, 2016 BCSC 65 at paras 20, 47; R v McLeod, 2018 MBQB 73 at para 34. 122 See for example: R v JNJ, 2004 1007 at at para 4; R v Obed, 2006 NLTD 155 at paras 14, 67 [Obed]; R v Masakayash, 2015 ONCJ 655 at paras 9, 21, 23-24; Wesley, 2016 ONSC paras 62-63 [Wesley], aff 'd 2018 ONCA 636; R 2019 BCCA 244 at para 91 [Pete ]; R c Carrier, 2020 QCCQ 110 at paras 28-29, 44. 123 Obed, supra note at Wesley, supra note paras Criddle, 2014 BCPC 108 at paras 17-21, 29. 124 See for example: R v Schafer, 2019 YKTC 41 at paras 14-15, 18, 31-35, 42.180 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C to these services and many are compromised by deficient or unreliable home heating and electricity during winter months. It is not uncommon to have several families living in one home or sharing any available space for shelter.125 Geographic isolation may also negatively impact how community members perceive the criminal justice system. In Itturiligaq, for example, Justice Bychok of the Nunavut Court of Justice pointed out how the remoteness of Nunavut's hamlets and their reliance on circuit courts exacerbate Inuit alienation from the justice system: As I explained in Anugaa, this court travels to all 25 of our territory's far-flung and remote communities. Many months may pass in the smallest hamlets between court sittings. By the time cases are dealt with in court, many parties have already reconciled and have moved on with their lives. Resentment and stress are triggered when the justice system insists these proceedings continue to a legal resolution. Resentment, stress and anger often arise when offenders are sent to jail outside the community against the express wishes of the victim, family and sometimes the community.126 With regards to Indigenous people living in urban centres, the remoteness of their community of origin may factor into their experiences of isolation, displacement, and cultural loss. For example, an Indigenous man from the St. Teresa Point First Nation in northern Manitoba who grew up in Winnipeg was described as follows in Taylor: Mr. Taylor has gone through experiences that he has encountered through the \"main stream\" process of the non- aboriginal society. In the early years of his education Mr. Taylor left home at an early age to get \"proper\" education in the City of Winnipeg. Throughout his displacement in an alien environment he began to lose contact with his home due to the geographic remoteness of his home. It was at this point he started experiencing the social distractions of the city. Mr. Taylor has [...] faced negative social barriers that he has had to struggle with and through his tribulations he has managed to keep himself focused on the road to good health.127 125 R v Black, 2014 ONCJ 236 at paras 52-53. 126 R 31 at para 120 [Itturiligaq], rev'd on other grounds 2020 NUCA 6, citing R v Anugaa, 2018 NUCJ 2. 127 R v Taylor, 2008 MBPC 21 at para 17.181 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 Individuals who grew up in remote communities may be particularly ill-prepared for urban life, which can make them vulnerable to negative influences, homelessness, street involvement, and victimization.128 Likewise, individuals whose childhoods are divided between remote communities and urban settings may face culture shock, social deprivation, and \"profound difficulties adjusting\"\u2014for example, someone who has been apprehended as a child, adopted into a non-Indigenous family, and then repatriated to a remote community with which they are wholly unfamiliar and disconnected.129 Furthermore, the geographic isolation of a community, whether due to its location or its infrastructure deficits, may shed light on the appropriateness or impact of particular conditions or sanctions. For example, a driving prohibition may have a greater adverse impact on someone from a remote community who relies on driving to make a living.130 Similarly, constrained transportation options in a community may affect someone's ability to comply with certain probation or bail conditions, as well as their ability to access the courts to have these conditions amended or reviewed.131 The lack of transportation alternatives in remote areas may even have contextual relevance to the circumstances of an impaired driving offence.132 Many sentencing judges have also recognized the additional hardships that Indigenous people from northern communities face if they are sent to penitentiaries in southern Canada, echoing the early cases addressed in Chapter 1.133 For example, Justice Bychok of the Nunavut Court of Justice has pointed out that the lack of a federal penitentiary in Nunavut means \"Inuit must serve their federal prison time in the south where they are forced to live in isolation from their culture, family and social networks\".134 For a \"traditionally raised Inuk\" who is \"intimately connected to his land\u2014the land of his ancestors\", this can mean that the negative impact of incarceration is \"multiplied\".135 128 See for example: R v Okemow, 2016 MBQB 240 at para 16; R v Traverse, 2019 MBPC 15 at 13-14; c Benjamin, 2018 QCCS 5937 paras 149-151, paras 7-8. 130 R v Calliou, 2019 ABCA 365 at paras 11, 13. 131 R v Rowan, 2018 ABPC 208 at paras 38, 44. 132 R v Patrick, 2017 BCPC 223 at para 57. 133 R v Cooper-Flaherty, para 99. 134 Itturiligaq, supra 126 Ibid at para 111.182 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C In Iserhoff, Judge Ladouceur of the Court of Quebec considered the hardships associated with detention in a southern facility as collateral consequences in the sentencing of two Cree men from northern Quebec, noting that they resulted from Quebec's failure to implement the terms of a land claims agreement.136 Judge Ladouceur found that a Cree inmate would be held in a detention centre \"far away from his family and community, making it more difficult to receive visits from his loved ones and maintain a connection with his culture\".137 He also noted that a Cree inmate \"would be imprisoned in a cultural environment that is fundamentally different from his Aboriginal culture and where he is demographically unrepresented, which contributes to making his imprisonment a more difficult challenge\".138 He also found a Cree inmate would be statistically less likely to be granted temporary absence in preparation for conditional release and release on parole.139 For some northern communities there may be sentencing options provided for in the Criminal Code that are simply unavailable due to a lack of resources or their remoteness. In Sequaluk, for example, Justice Grenier of the Superior Court of Quebec heard an appeal from sentence in which it was argued that an intermittent sentence had been denied an Inuk woman from Nunavik on a discriminatory basis.140 Counsel for both parties agreed intermittent sentences are never imposed in Nunavik as they would need to be served at distant detention centres.141 Justice Grenier held that this violated the equality rights of the Inuit and other inhabitants of Nunavik.142 The sentence was varied so as to be served intermittently and suspended until the Quebec government designates adequate facilities in Nunavik for intermittent sentences. The Quebec Court of Appeal subsequently overturned this decision based on the procedural ground that a notice of constitutional question was never served on the Attorney General of Quebec.143 However, this type of systemic factor within the justice systemic may still be relevant in 136 R c Iserhoff, 2019 QCCQ 2339. 137 Ibid at para 172. 140 Sequaluk c R, 2018 QCCS QCCA Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 sentencing proceedings.144 Notably, Justice Gibson of the Ontario Court of Justice came to a similar conclusion in the Turtle decision where he concluded that the practical unavailability of intermittent sentences for members of the Pikangikum First Nation in Ontario breached s 15 of the Charter.145 Experiences and cycles of abuse, violence, and victimization/criminalization Many sentencing decisions have recognized an individual's exposure to violence or abuse, whether sexual, physical, psychological, emotional, or spiritual, as a relevant Gladue factor.146 An individual's exposure to violence or abuse, whether as a direct victim or a witness, may cast light on their difficulties forming healthy relationships, their learned behaviours, their issues with anger management, their lack of insight into their own difficulties, or other factors like substance abuse.147 In some cases it may be linked to more specific mental health conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder.148 It may even provide context for better understanding an individual's actions or statements.149 Often an individual's experiences of violence and abuse may be traceable back to the intergenerational impacts of other factors like the residential school system.150 In one particularly compelling but unusual example, TG, Judge Philp of the Provincial Court of Alberta was faced with a Cree man convicted of assault causing bodily harm as a result of the \"aggressive and unusual punishments of both a physical and psychological nature\" 144 R c Mianscum, 2019 QCCQ 3829 at para 60. 145 R v Turtle, 2020 ONCJ 429. 146 See for example: Ladue, supra note 14 at para 124 at v v at v supra note 122 at para 91; 2019 ABCA 351 at para 6; S(D), supra note 57 at para 72. 147 See for example: R v Aqqiaruq, 2009 NUCJ 26 at para 23; v Peters, ONCA TMB, supra 2013 ONCJ 423 at para v LM, 2018 NWTTC at 31-33, 36. 148 v VK, 2006 SKPC at paras 28, 52; R v Schinkel, 2015 YKCA 2 at para 29; R v Smith, supra note 31 at para 49; R v Ward, 2019 NBQB 68 at para 48. 149 See for example: R v Campbell, 2017 ABCA 147 at paras 2-3. 150 See for example: R v Bull, 2015 ABPC 256 at para 56; GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C that he inflicted on his step-daughter, including biting various parts of her body.151 Judge Philp explained how T.G.'s own experience of abusive discipline as a child linked his offence back to the residential school experiences of past generations: Parenting is learned behaviour, often passed down from generation to generation. The residential schools which Aboriginal Canadians were forced to attend are generally known to have been institutions where abuse and neglect were rampant. Both T.G.'s grandfather and father attended residential school. It is not difficult to accept that the abuse which T.G. faced as a child was a result of abuse his grandfather and father faced in this school system. A chain of learned abuse from \"disciplinarian\" to child passed down from residential school to T.G.'s grandfather and father, to T.G., to [the victim] L.T. While T.G. must still be held responsible for his actions, the moral culpability of his conduct is reduced by the fact that this offence has roots firmly planted in the abuse inflicted on Aboriginals forced into residential schools.152 Experiences of violence and abuse may have particular relevance to the moral culpability of Indigenous women who have been recognized as \"amongst the most vulnerable segments of our population\".153 An Indigenous woman's vulnerability due to systemic issues and past victimization may make her vulnerable to coercive exploitation and recruitment into criminal conduct like drug trafficking.154 Her past victimization and experiences of violence may also help contextualize her own violent offences.155 This has been described as a \"victimization- criminalization continuum\" in which \"Gladue factors will be intertwined\" and \"[v]ictimization is often [...] reproduced as violence\".156 In some cases, victims may even be unwilling to rely on the criminal justice system for their own protection due to a fear of being criminalized 151 R v TG, 2012 ABPC 251 at paras 152 Ibid at 17. 153 See Nashkewa, supra note 25 at para 44.

This is very clearly illustrated in one decision of the Nunavut Court of Justice where an Inuk woman was charged with breaching a no-alcohol bail condition after she called the RCMP to report she was being assaulted by her stepfather.157 The Justice of the Peace sentenced her to an absolute discharge and expressed the concern that the RCMP's actions could dissuade victims like her from reporting crime and seeking the RCMP's assistance.158 He pointed out that he had been faced with a very similar case one-year prior when an Inuk woman was charged with breaching a no-alcohol bail condition after she reported being assaulted by her boyfriend.159 The Justice of the Peace highlighted various reports detailing the reluctance of Indigenous women in general, as well as Inuit women specifically, to call the police when they face violence due to such negative experiences, including the Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.160 Personal, familial, and community-level impacts of alcohol and drug misuse Countless sentencing decisions have accepted personal, familial, or community-level alcohol or drug abuse as relevant to the application of the Gladue principles.161 This is rarely contentious, perhaps due to the Supreme Court of Canada's explicit references to high rates of substance abuse in both Gladue and Ipeelee.162 In many cases sentencing judges have been able to clearly link an individual's offence and their own difficulties with drugs or alcohol back to personal, familial, and historic trauma.163 Such linkages may nevertheless be worth illustrating through examples. 157 R v A(M), 2020 NUCJ 4. 2018), 08-18-879 (Nu Ct J) [transcript on file with author]. 160 Ibid at paras 19, 25. 161 See for example: Peters, supra note 147 at paras 2012 1755 at paras 16;

This summary includes both legal conclusions and factual findings. This is not to suggest past expert evidence and courts' associated findings of fact should be uncritically invoked and relied upon as though they were precedents.180 Instead what 173 R v Willier, 2016 ABQB 241 at paras 2, 57. 174 Ibid paras 175 para 108. 176 177 at para 110. 178 See for supra note 20 at para 37; Drysdale, supra paras MG, 2017 ABCA 163 at para 5; R v McDonald, 2018 BCPC 244 at para 85; R v Charlie, 2018 YKTC 44 at para 52, aff 'd 2020 YKCA 6; R v Blackplume, 2019 ABPC 273 at para v SKCA 52 at paras [JP]; McKay, supra note paras v Paquette, 2020 ABPC 173 at paras 148-149; R v Head, 2020 ABPC 211 at paras 59-63. 179 See for example: R v W ALD, 2004 SKPC 40 at paras 40-41; R v Harper, 2009 YKTC 18 at paras R v FD, 2016 ABPC 180 See Greckol JJA JA at para 188 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C follows is an overview of several broad social facts relating to FASD, the relevance of which will depend on the evidentiary record before the court in a given case. FASD has been described as \"a non-clinical umbrella term that refers to a range of cognitive deficits associated with disabilities incurred when a mother uses alcohol during her pregnancy\".181 The potential relevance of this permanent disability to sentencing is readily apparent from some of its symptoms, which could include \"poor memory, impulsiveness, [and an] inability to appreciate fully the consequences of one's actions\".182 Where FASD leads to cognitive deficits that undermine an individual's ability to restrain their urges and impulses, to appreciate their actions are morally wrong, or to comprehend the causal link between court- ordered punishment and the crime for which they are convicted, they may lessen the relevance of deterrence and denunciation and mitigate moral blameworthiness.183 Individuals with this condition also \"generally do poorly in prison and are often victimized by other inmates\".184 The cognitive deficits associated with FASD will vary from one individual to the next and for this reason they are ordinarily established through expert evidence like medical reports.185 However, constraints on the availability of FASD assessments may qualify as a systemic factor that could contribute to Indigenous over-incarceration.186 In McKay, Judge Devine of the Provincial Court of Manitoba took into account the observations of senior professionals who suspected Mr. McKay\u2014 an Oji-Cree man from a remote and under-resourced northern community\u2014suffers from FASD and related deficits.187 While she did not have any medical reports before her, Judge Devine held that 24, interpreting R v Daley, 2007 SCC 53 at para 86; Alberta Report v Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), 2002 ABQB 1081 at paras 21, 27-28, interpreting Williams, supra note 104 at para 54. 181 R v Ramsay, 2012 ABCA 257 at para 15 [Ramsay], citing Kent Roach & Andrea Bailey, \"The Relevance of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in Canadian Criminal Law from Investigation to Sentencing\" (2009) 42 UBC L Rev 1. 182 Ibid. 183 Ibid at paras 20-25. 184 R 6-8. 185 Ramsay, supra note 181 at paras 15, 20.

They may not be able to connect institutional rules and their own behaviour. They may react inconsistently, in accordance with their own immediate needs. Misunderstanding a person with FAS can result in inappropriate punishment. If punishment is a regular occurrence, the individual with FAS will be categorized accordingly. Given that they could not foresee this possibility in the beginning, so as to avoid it, it is unrealistic to expect them to be able to resolve it successfully on their own. It simply will not happen without understanding and help.191 As Judge Trueman later described in Gray , the majority of those who suffer from FASD \"will look normal, have normal physical development, and test in the normal range for intelligence\" while nevertheless suffering from \"an organic brain disorder\".192 It is thus often a \"hidden disability\" that goes undiagnosed but leaves individuals both \"cognitively damaged\" and \"damaged further, psychologically, by being expected to perform above their level of social ability and punished for their failure when they cannot\".193 This condition may lead to learning disabilities, depression, and even suicide and \"reveals itself over time in low incomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or irrelevance of education, substance abuse, and poor living conditions\", as well as criminal acts.194 Furthermore, as noted by Justice Groves of the Provincial Court of Alberta in O'Connor, the impact of this disorder on an individual's ability to anticipate consequences and control impulses means it may shed light on their criminal record and history of breach convictions.195 Whereas 190 R v Mumford, 2007 CanLII 46702 (Ont Sup Ct) at paras 115-124. 191 R v CJM, 2000 BCPC 199 at 9. 192 R v Gray, 2002 BCPC 58 at 22. 193 Ibid at para 26. 194 Ibid at para 29. 195 R v O'Connor, supra note 95 at para 34.191 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 these might be interpreted as \"a wanton disregard for Court orders, with an FASD offender such an interpretation may be harsh\".196 Likewise, as FASD is a permanent disability, the prospects of rehabilitation for an individual afflicted with this condition may need to be understood broadly as available treatment may be limited to structured modification and management of their behaviour.197 These impacts of FASD are by no means specific to Indigenous people, nor do all these cases involve the sentencing of Indigenous people. Nevertheless, they demonstrate how FASD can result in its own systemic issues within the criminal justice system that in turn overlap and compound with other factors outlined in this chapter. Furthermore, as pointed out by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in JP, FASD can be difficult to disentangle from other systemic and background factors when an Indigenous person is prenatally exposed to alcohol due to the equally constrained circumstances of their birth mother.198 Loss of identity, culture, language, values, traditions, and ancestral knowledge As discussed earlier, numerous sentencing decisions have acknowledged how various government policies and programs such as residential schools, the reserve system, community relocations, child apprehensions, and out-adoption have impacted individuals, their families, and their communities through loss of identity, culture, language, values, traditions, and ancestral knowledge.199 However, the relevance of these impacts to other systemic factors, criminal conduct, and sentencing has been contentious at times and therefore warrants closer consideration. Judge Bouchard of the Court of Quebec has canvassed the systemic impacts of language and culture loss through the residential school system in Mequish.200 He noted how residential school survivors were not only \"uprooted from their surroundings\" but \"also deprived of traditional 196 197 Ibid 199 See v Viscount, 2014 BCPC 83 at paras 21, R v Sanderson, 2014 BCSC 2566 at para 58; R v Solomon, 2015 CanLII 92840 (Ont Sup Ct) at 5; R ABPC 57 12; Tukkiapik, supra note 2151 at R v Vaneltsi, 2019 YKTC at para 18. 200 R c 2016 QCCQ 2200 at para 76.192 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C knowledge and their native tongue, which created a generational gulf \" and made it hard for survivors \"to join either white or Aboriginal communities because they had been isolated from both for so many years\".201 This in turn was linked to \"a number of social consequences in the community such as the predominance of drug and alcohol addiction, a high family violence rate, major relationship issues, sexual assaults, low self-esteem, high unemployment rates, low levels of education, and high suicide and incarceration rates\".202 Justice Baird of the British Columbia Supreme Court has similarly commented on the impacts of \"cultural deracination\" in Athey, pointing to the intergenerational effects of Mr. Athey's grandmother's attendance at residential school such as loss of cultural identity, community disconnection, and loss of language, culture and traditions.203 Mr. Athey stated \"that he did not feel he belonged in either world, meaning his aboriginal community or the non-aboriginal world outside it\".204 Justice Baird rejected the Crown's suggestion that this community disconnection could lessen the relevance of Gladue considerations. On the contrary, he found a \"direct link between the accused and the circumstances of his life, and the grim history of cultural deracination and cruelty to which his grandmother was subjected by official federal policy\".205 Justice March of the Ontario Court of Justice has pointed out how cultural loss and dislocation may play into criminality among individuals who were apprehended as children in Kebokee.206 In sentencing an Indigenous man who was taken into state care at age two and passed through numerous foster homes during his childhood, Justice March described Mr. Kebokee as a \"prime example\" of how \"[w]hen taken from their homes and communities, aboriginal children, of course, lose their connection to their people and culture\" and \"become, in so many ways, lost and adrift\".207 The Court noted Mr. Kebokee's own view that \"his upbringing did not instil in him such basic lessons of right from wrong\" and found him still struggling to learn these lessons as an adult.208 201 Ibid. 202 Ibid at para 77.

The Court of Appeal accepted that Mr. Kreko struggled with his identity and his adoption upon learning of it as a teenager, leading to \"feelings of abandonment, resentment, and a sense that he was unwanted\".214 It also found this \"dislocation and loss of identity\" could be \"traced to systemic disadvantage and impoverishment extending back to his great- grandparents\".215 It also took note of studies indicating a higher failure rate for adoptions of Aboriginal children by non-Aboriginal parents in coming to these conclusions.216 The Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in Kreko has been criticized by the Alberta Court of Appeal and treated with caution by other appellate courts, perhaps due to the Court of Appeal's limited reasons 209 R v Karp-Johnson, 2017 ONCJ 314 at 7. 210 Ibid at 8. 211 Ibid at 15. 212 Ibid. 213 R v Kreko, 2016 ONCA 367. 214 Ibid at para 9. at para 24. 216 Ibid.194 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C with respect to how these factors were interrelated.217 Yet the factual findings in subsequent class action lawsuits on behalf of the Sixties Scoop survivors may provide clearer links for courts to consider when sentencing Indigenous people who have been adopted and raised by non-Indigenous parents in the future.218 Conclusion The decisions canvassed in this chapter illustrate the range of systemic and background factors that may need to be addressed in context to the sentencing of Indigenous people, as well as how these factors often interrelate, overlap, and compound. As the Supreme Court of Canada outlined in Gladue, an individual's systemic and background factors can be relevant to sentencing where they shed light on why that individual is before the court, which links back to the fundamental principle of proportionality and the need to assess moral culpability. Likewise, they can shed light on whether incarceration will impact them more adversely than others, and whether prison is likely to deter or denounce their conduct in a way that is meaningful to their community, among other things. As detailed throughout Part B of this book, the Supreme Court has made it clear that close attention to an Indigenous person's systemic and background factors is meant to assist the courts in avoiding the perpetuation of systemic discrimination in the sentencing process. At the same time, the systemic and background factors faced by Indigenous communities and collectives have relevance to the appropriateness of community-based dispositions and the need for broader social healing as well. Furthermore, Indigenous people who are victims of crime also have systemic and background factors that may be relevant to both their vulnerability to particular crimes and the potential need for reconciliation between the victim and offender.219 The need for closer attention to 217 See R v Laboucane, 2016 ABCA 176 at paras 65-68, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 37177 (22 December 2016); R v Rennie, 2017 MBCA 44 at para 20, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 37632 (9 November 2017); R v Bennett, 2017 NLCA 41, Hoegg JA at para 79, dissenting. 218 See Brown, supra note 40, as addressed earlier in this chapter. 219 See for example: R v Morris, 2004 BCCA 305 at paras 62-63, R v v Ledesma, 2012 ABPC 10 at para R v Atkinson, 2012 YKTC 62 at para 33; R v PJB, 2015 BCPC at paras R v Woodford, 2016 MBQB 72 at para 21; R v Johnny, 2016 BCCA 61 at para 21; R v AD, 2019 ABCA 396 at paras 26-30. 195 Chapter 9: Unique Systemic and Background FactorsCHAPTER 9 Indigenous women and children's vulnerability to victimization has not only been directed by the Supreme Court of Canada, it is now subject to explicit statutory direction from Parliament as well.220 For all these reasons, this category of unique circumstances will likely thwart any attempt at a comprehensive list or discrete set of rules purporting to fully and definitively address their potential relevancy. However, since s 718.2(e) directs the judiciary to sentence Indigenous people differently, the recognition of these differences forms a necessary starting point, and it is hoped that this chapter will assist in such an endeavour. 220 See for example: R v West, 2020 BCSC 352 at paras 34-36; R v Iqalukjuaq, 2020 NUCJ 28 at paras 56-67.196 CHAPTER 10: CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES AND SANCTIONS The second set of unique circumstances requiring particular attention in the sentencing of an Indigenous person is analytically distinct from systemic and background factors. The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently framed this second category as \"[t]he types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection\".1 Similar to the first category of circumstances canvassed in Chapter 9, a great deal of nuance and ambiguity is packed into this summary description. At a broader level, it calls for attention to any Indigenous community-specific values and cultural differences as a relevant measure for the appropriateness of particular sentencing procedures and sanctions. This is both apparent from the overall discussion of these unique circumstances in Gladue and implied by the direction that an Indigenous person's \"particular aboriginal heritage or connection\" assists in determining what sanctions and procedures will be appropriate for them. On a more procedural level, it requires the exploration of any culturally relevant or community- specific sentencing options that might be available for the Indigenous person before the court. This chapter will first reiterate some of the broader principles set out by the Supreme Court in relation to these circumstances and then provide a detailed synopsis of lower court jurisprudence regarding common examples of culturally relevant sentencing procedures and sanctions that have been brought into the Gladue framework to date. 1 R v Gladue, [1999] Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 Indigenous perspectives, community views, and cultural differences guide the inquiry In terms of broader principles, it is worth remembering the Supreme Court's direction in Wells that section 718.2(e) requires sentencing judges \"to appreciate relevant cultural differences in terms of the objectives of the sentencing process\".2 Sentencing judges are instructed to both \"conduct the sentencing process and impose sanctions taking into account the perspective of the aboriginal offender's community \".3 This may require sentencing judges to consider an Indigenous community's decision to address criminal activity associated with social problems with a restorative focus, for example.4 In Ipeelee, the Court further explained that culturally appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions bear \"on the effectiveness of the sentence itself \".5 They respond to the direction in Gladue that courts must \"abandon the presumption that all offenders and all communities share the same values when it comes to sentencing and to recognize that, given these fundamentally different world views, different or alternative sanctions may more effectively achieve the objectives of sentencing in a particular community\".6 Where available and appropriate, community-based sanctions are more likely to coincide with distinct Indigenous conceptions of sentencing and the needs of Indigenous people and communities, whereas Indigenous people and communities are generally not well served by incarceration, especially for less serious or non-violent offences.7 Sentencing disparities for similar crimes will be a natural consequence of an individualized approach focused on the particular circumstances of the offence, the offender, and the community in which it took place, and this is particularly apt when sentencing Indigenous people.8 While community-based sanctions may not always be suitable, \"in all instances\" it will be appropriate for the court to attempt to craft the sentencing process and the sanctions imposed in accordance with the relevant \"Aboriginal perspective\".9 2 R v Wells, 2000 SCC 10 at 50 [Wells]. 3 [emphasis para 5 v 2012 SCC at para 74 [Ipeelee]. 6 Ibid. Gladue, at paras 76-77. 9 Ibid at para 74. As summarized in Chapter 2 and noted in Chapter 5, the phrase 198 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Assuming these statements from the Supreme Court amount to more than mere verbiage, each Indigenous community's conception of sentencing and their understanding of the meaningfulness of particular sanctions ought to be explored. Consistent with this view, the British Columbia Court of Appeal has described the Gladue framework as requiring attention to the: (i) distinct worldviews of Indigenous peoples, including the substantive content of justice and the process of achieving justice; and (ii) their different cultural values and experiences.10 Presumably, culturally relevant and appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions assist sentencing judges in tackling these difficult tasks. While these broad statements of principle are no doubt challenging to actualize in individual cases, the Supreme Court has highlighted examples of culturally appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions for Indigenous people. In Gladue, for instance, the Court referenced the then \"relatively recent evolution of innovative sentencing practices, such as healing and sentencing circles, and aboriginal community council projects\" when discussing this second set of unique considerations.11 The Court suggested that finding and imposing an alternative sentence will be facilitated where an Indigenous community \"has a program or tradition of alternative sanctions, and support and supervision are available to the offender\".12 It also held that Parliament's intention was for 718.2(e) to reduce the use of prison as a sanction and expand restorative justice sentencing principles \"with a sensitivity to aboriginal community justice initiatives\".13 In Wells, the Court accepted that the availability of Indigenous-specific addictions treatment programming and a healing lodge could be responsive to this branch of the analysis under s 718.2(e).14 Similarly, in \"Aboriginal perspective\" is used in some of the reports that were before the Supreme Court of Canada in the Gladue appeal to describe Indigenous peoples' distinct worldviews, cultural values, and legal traditions so as to distinguish their perspectives from those implicit in the criminal justice system. See especially Alberta, Justice on Trial: Report of the Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta, vol I (Edmonton: Task Force on the Criminal Justice System and its Impact on the Indian and Metis People of Alberta, 1991) at 9-1. The phrase \"Aboriginal perspective\" is also frequently used by the Supreme Court as short-hand for evidence of an Indigenous people's distinct customs, practices, traditions, and laws. See for example: R v Van der Peet [1996] 2 SCR 507, 1996 CanLII 216 CanLII 302 at paras 112, 147-149. 10 R v Sellars, 2018 BCCA 195 at para 30 [Sellars]. 11 Gladue, supra note para Ibid at para 92. 13 Ibid at para 48. 14 Wells, supra note 2 at para 52.199 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 Ipeelee, the Court concluded that the lack of reliable access to culturally relevant supports, programming, and resources for two long-term offenders helped explain why they ended up breaching their long-term supervision orders\u2014in other words, the absence of culturally appropriate programming helped shed light on why their prior sentences were ultimately ineffective.15 Various lower court decisions have contributed their own insight to how culturally appropriate sanctions and sentencing procedures fit into the analysis. They have also expanded on the list of available procedures and sanctions that warrant close consideration when sentencing Indigenous people. For example, some appellate courts have pointed to \"traditional forms of societal control\", such as peacemaking, sentencing circles, the input of Elders, and temporary community banishment.16 In other contexts they have insisted that sentencing judges must canvass any \"programming, services and controls available in relation to Aboriginal offenders in particular\", whether these exist in correctional institutions or in the community.17 Each will be summarized in turn. Urban networks of support and programming must be considered At the same time, it is also important to recall that the Gladue decision itself involved the sentencing of a Cree woman from Alberta living in an urban centre on Vancouver Island, far from her Indigenous community of origin. In this factual context, the Supreme Court of Canada made it abundantly clear that alternatives to incarceration must be taken into account \"[w]hether the offender resides in a rural area, on a reserve or in an urban centre\", including those existing in \"metropolitan areas\".18 As the Court noted, many Indigenous people in urban centres still remain closely attached to their culture.19 The Supreme Court held that the meaning of \"community\" when it comes to exploring alternatives under s 718.2(e) includes \"any network of support and interaction that might be available in an urban centre\".20 Consistent 15 Ipeelee, supra note 5 at paras 92, 96. 16 CP and JA v R, 2009 NBCA 65 at para 26 [CP and JA] 17 R v Ewenin, 2013 SKCA 50 at para 28. 18 Gladue, supra note 1 at para 84. Ibid 20 Ibid at para 92.200 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C with this view, the Court pointed to a lack of culturally relevant supports in the urban centres of Kingston and Vancouver in Ipeelee as being relevant to why both Mr. Ipeelee and Mr. Ladue had breached their long-term supervision orders. The second branch of the analysis of s 718.2(e) was not rendered inoperative by the mere fact that they were serving these sentences far from their Indigenous communities of origin in Nunavut and Yukon, respectively. In any event, even the absence of an urban support network for Indigenous people will not relieve a sentencing judge of their duty to try to find alternatives to imprisonment.21 Specific examples of culturally appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions The remainder of this chapter focuses on highlighting the nuanced relationships between broader cultural differences and Indigenous perspectives and some existing examples of culturally appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions that can be incorporated into the determination of a fit and proper sentence. In doing so, it is important to note at the outset that sentencing is a highly time-sensitive process given the liberty interests at stake in these proceedings. For this reason, it appears to be the exception rather than the rule for sentencing judges to explicitly address how culturally relevant procedures and sanctions link back to the distinct perspectives and needs of Indigenous peoples. In some cases, however, sentencing judges make these connections overt in their reasons. In Callihoo, for instance, Judge Krinke of the Provincial Court of Alberta pointed out how the Kainai Peacemaking Project on the Blood Reserve finds its roots in pre-contact Blackfoot society.22 Prior to contact, \"the Blackfoot were self-sufficient, living off the land and governing themselves\", including through \"a well-developed justice system, based on Kainai peacemaking\" that provided \"an effective judicial model for addressing all aspects of community life\".23 Judge Krinke found that the contemporary Kainai peacemaking project reflects this \"traditional\" restorative model of justice by focusing on problem-solving and restoration of harmony through restitution and reconciliation.24 This type of community initiative may reflect an Aboriginal perspective 21 Ibid. 22 R v Callihoo, 2017 ABPC 40. para 45.201 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 regarding the objectives under the Criminal Code and the effectiveness of particular sanctions in achieving those objectives, thereby favouring community-based dispositions.25 Judge Krinke's reasons for decision in Callihoo demonstrate how lower courts can further the jurisprudence by addressing different conceptions of sentencing in their appropriate context, just as the Supreme Court of Canada appears to have anticipated in Gladue. In most decisions the links between the Gladue analysis, Indigenous community justice initiatives, and Indigenous-specific programming have received less overt attention. Still, these connections are readily apparent when the jurisprudence is examined in aggregate. Sentencing circles have garnered the most attention in the case law in terms of alternative sentencing procedures that aim to meet the unique needs and perspectives of Indigenous peoples. Other accommodations and innovations have also been addressed in the case law to date, including Indigenous justice committees, family group conferences, and Elder panels. The common threads among these alternative processes help to highlight the many connections between culturally appropriate procedures and more effective outcomes for Indigenous offenders, victims, and communities. Of particular note, all these alternative sentencing mechanisms share a restorative justice focus that blurs the dividing line between procedure and sanction. In the words of Judge Barry Stuart of the Yukon Territorial Court (as he then was), it is often the case that \"process is product\" in this context.26 For example, by incorporating a broader set of voices, restorative justice practices ensure the accused directly faces the community they let down and this in turn may influence \"the ownership of, and commitment to the response\".27 These processes can also serve a therapeutic function for victims who have an opportunity to tell their story beyond the confines of victim impact statements.28 As a result, the distinction between culturally relevant procedures and culturally relevant sanctions is not always clearcut. In some cases, alternative procedures may provide a forum for problem-solving and the design of innovative sanctions or healing plans for sentencing. In others, participation in a restorative justice process has been imposed as a condition for a community-based disposition, effectively treating it as part of the sanction imposed. In spite of these fuzzy boundaries, culturally 25 Ibid at paras 68-86. 26 R v Elias, 2001 YKTC 501 at para 92. 27 Ibid. 28 R v 2001 YKTC 504 at para 44.202 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C appropriate procedures will first be addressed, followed by a summary of sanctions and programming with a less procedural focus. What follows are several common examples of procedures and sanctions that are responsive to this second category of circumstances. They are by no means exhaustive. Justice committees Justice committees are one well-established mechanism through which the members of an Indigenous community can inform sentencing judges about the unique perspectives, needs, and conditions of their community, as well as any community decisions that might have relevance to sentencing. Several of the commissions of inquiry leading up to the enactment of s 718.2(e) strongly endorsed justice committees as a way for Indigenous communities to participate in the overall administration of justice.29 These ideally include a full-time coordinator and a diverse cross-section of community members who collectively assist with sentencing.30 They may be equipped to: provide sentencing recommendations or advice to prosecutors and judges; assist with the preparation of pre-sentence reports; initiate healing or sentencing circles; facilitate and supervise alternative measures for diversion, supervised probation, and conditional release orders, such as community work programs, mediation, and offender reintegration; and otherwise contribute to culturally appropriate processes and sanctions for Indigenous people who enter the criminal justice system.31 Many courts have expressed support for Indigenous justice committees playing a role in the s 718.2(e) analysis.32 Justice Cameron of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal stated in Lemaigre that justice committees 29 See Chapter 2 for a summary of findings from the commissions of inquiry and task forces that pre-dated the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its interpretation in the Gladue decision. 30 Ibid.

Some may be able to provide traditional counselling, guidance, and the supervision of a wide variety of community-specific rehabilitative measures and judicially-imposed conditions, including land-based programs.38 Others may offer specific programs for anger management, victim services, and wellness.39 Some are able to produce reports that detail the unique circumstances of the community and the individual being sentenced in support of the Gladue analysis.40 They may 33 Lemaigre, supra note 32 at para 52. 34 P\u00e9pabano, supra note 32 at para 21. 35 Ibid. 36 Diamond, supra note 32 at para 22.

These variations may reflect Indigenous peoples' unique cultures and traditions, or the unique circumstances of particular communities. For example, justice committees may be comprised of Elders who are respected and who demand respect in a certain Indigenous community.45 They may also be comprised of the hereditary and elected leadership of a First Nation, in addition to community members who lead social development, education, and justice initiatives.46 A justice committee might even include Indigenous and non-Indigenous members if this better reflects the particular community's demographics.47 Courts have occasionally addressed procedural considerations when justice committees participate in the administration of justice as well. For example, counsel for both parties have been urged to be open and transparent about any contact they have with members of these committees as there is a risk that undisclosed representations \"could serve to defeat the whole purpose of obtaining the honest, impartial at para 17 [Appaqaq]; Mianscum, supra note 38 at para 18. 41 R v Taylor (1997), [1998] 2 CNLR 140, 1997 CanLII 9813 (sub nom CA) at paras John, supra note 32 at para 33; Craft, supra note 38 at para 30; R v Brooks, 2008 NSPC 58 at para 35 [Brooks]; R v 'd 42 See for example: R v Evaloardjuk, J No 11 (QL), at 38 at paras R v 2015 NUCJ 31 at R c Neeposh, 2020 QCCQ 1235 at 43 See for example: R v Nattar, [1999] 2002 BCCA 268 note 32 at 259, 263. 44 supra note 40 at para 32 at para 259. 46 Reid, supra note 43 at para 22. 47 R v LTB, ABPC 42 at paras 24-25 [LTB ].205 Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 response desired\".48 The Alberta Court of Appeal has also urged justice committees to be transparent with respect to how their deliberations provide victims with a voice in the proceedings since \"a one-sided inquiry can compromise the credibility and utility of that process\".49 Sentencing and healing circles Sentencing and healing circles provide another well-known procedural mechanism through which Indigenous communities can inform the sentencing process. The use of these circles in the sentencing of Indigenous people pre-dates the enactment of s 718.2(e) by several years. However, these processes quickly came to be recognized as a key way in which this provision could be actualized.50 Sentencing circles were also endorsed by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, as well as other contemporaneous commissions of inquiry in the early 1990s.51 While a distinction between sentencing circles and healing circles is not always clearly drawn in judicial decisions, the former may be viewed as a modification of the ordinary sentencing process to approximate or accommodate the latter. As noted by Chief Justice Bayda of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal (as he then was) in Morin, \"[t]he sentencing circle has its genesis in the healing circle which from time immemorial has been a part of the culture of many First Nations of Canada and of the indigenous people of other countries\".52 Healing circles may be used to facilitate conflict resolution in a wide variety of contexts, including governance disputes, child and family services matters, 48 TJS, supra note 38 at para 32. 49 Arcand, supra note 32 at para 263. 50 See for example: R v Morin, [1995] 4 CNLR 37, v CanLII 9710 1998 CanLII 28731 (Prov Ct) at para 5. See also the summary of the legislative debate on Bill C-41 set out in Chapter 3 of this publication. 51 See Chapter 2 for a summary of findings from the commissions of inquiry and task forces that pre-dated the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its interpretation in the Gladue decision. See especially Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Bridging the Cultural Divide: A Report on Aboriginal People and Criminal Justice in Canada (Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada, 1996) at 109-116 [Bridging the Cultural Divide]. 52 Morin, supra note 50 at 66.206 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C and labour relations.53 They can even provide a process for addressing the trauma, anxiety, and stress associated with the trial process itself.54 And the many applications of healing circles are by no means limited to the mainstream justice system. In contrast, sentencing circles have been described as not so much an example of an Indigenous practice as they are a tool \"to allow members of Indigenous communities to share information with the sentencing judge\".55 Nonetheless, if an Indigenous community has a tradition of using healing circles to resolve conflicts this may reflect their distinct conception of sentencing and their view of the appropriate response to wrongdoing. As Chief Justice Bayda stated in Morin: The circle was premised on two fundamental notions: first, the wrongful act was a breach of the relationship between the wrongdoer and the victim and a breach of the relationship between the wrongdoer and the community, and second, the well-being of the community and consequently the protection of its members and the society generally depended not upon retribution or punishment of the wrongdoer, but \"healing\" of the breaches of the two relationships. The emphasis was primarily, if not entirely, upon a restorative or healing approach as distinct from a retributive or punitive approach.56 Sentencing circles may thus provide a partial accommodation of Indigenous peoples' distinct conceptions of sentencing and legal perspectives, particularly if sensitivity is shown to the diversity of customs, traditions, and laws that distinguish one Indigenous society from another.57 This in turn can demonstrate the judiciary's appreciation of \"the importance of incorporating Aboriginal methods of dispute resolution and the value of encouraging community involvement in 53 See for example: Larocque v Waterhen First Nation, [1998] 2009 CFSRB 75 at para 63; Chief Gayle Strikes With a Gun v Piikani First Nation, 2014 FC 908 at paras 97-98, 163, 170; AB v Brant Family and Child Services (CFSA s 144), 2017 CFSRB 26 at paras 31, 50.

Yet the circle retains the primary principles and protections inherent to the justice system. The circle contributes the basis for developing a genuine partnership between Aboriginal communities and the justice system by according the flexibility for both sets of values to influence the decision making process in sentencing.59 A sentencing or healing circle furthers this partnership by giving a voice to an Indigenous person's community members, family members, and other supports\u2014as well as victims and their own supports\u2014when determining a fit sentence and crafting a community-based disposition.60 This is true even where the sentencing or healing circle takes place \"separately and independent of the judicial system\".61 In other words, sentencing judges have been willing to accept the recommendations of sentencing or healing circles that operate outside the courtroom and without their direct participation so long as they are kept fully informed of the process and outcome.62 This is consistent with the role a circle plays in generating new ideas and a more detailed base of information than might otherwise be available to the sentencing judge.63 It is also consistent with the central focus of these circles on healing at both an individual and a community level.64 As some decisions point out, in order for sentencing and healing circles to be effective they will need to 58 R v Rope, [1995] 2 CNLR 209 at 216, (CA) [Rope]. 59 R v Moses, [1992] 3 CNLR 116 at 140, 1992 CanLII 12804 (Y Terr Ct) at 130 [Moses]. 144 17 [Sellon]; note 50 at paras 9, 23, 29, 30; R v Gregoire, 2009 NLTD 21 at paras 43, 46 [Gregoire]; R v McNabb, 2014 MBPC 10 at paras 15-16, 21 [McNabb]; R v MI, 2018 NSPC 56 at para 5. 61 Manyfingers, supra note 50 at para 121(1). 62 See for example: R v Rich (S) et al (No 1), [1994] 4 CNLR 167 at 172, 1994 CanLII 10459 (NLTD) [Rich]; R v Rich (S) et al (No 2), [1994] 4 CNLR 174 at 175, 1994 60 at para Jacko, 2010 ONCA 452 at paras 32, 81, 92. 63 Moses, supra note 59 at 124; EO, supra note 55 at para 60. 64 note 41 at para 70.208 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C be driven by Indigenous communities and the values, beliefs, concerns, and desires of those communities must be respected by the criminal justice system.65 Several sentencing judges have articulated criteria they consider when assessing whether it is appropriate to seek guidance from a sentencing or healing circle.66 In Joseyounen, Judge Fafard of the Saskatchewan Provincial Court suggested that the utility of the circle depends in part on whether the accused and the victim (or an appropriate proxy) are both willing to participate.67 Judge Fafard also urged that \"[t]he accused must have deep roots in the community in which the circle is held and from which the participants are drawn\" so as to ensure participants know their background, culture, strengths, and weaknesses.68 Likewise, they ought to include Elders or community leaders who will not exercise political influence to the detriment of either the accused or the victim.69 In some cases, special supports for the victim may need to be made available.70 And as the circles are not necessarily designed for fact finding, disputed facts ought to be resolved in advance.71 Finally, the sentencing judge should be willing to take a calculated risk and depart from the usual sentencing range given that the focus of these circles is often on reintegration, rehabilitation, and restoration of harmony in the community.72 Yet these guidelines are not \"carved in stone\" and exceptions may \"not be difficult to find\".73 Appellate courts have been reluctant to impose their own definitive criteria on sentencing judges in terms of defining the precise circumstances in which sentencing circles will be most appropriate.74 A decision to seek guidance from a sentencing circle is \"largely a matter of discretion for the 65 Webb, supra note 60 at 160-161; R v Nicholas, at para 32. 71 Ibid at paras 33-35.

Providing an opportunity for the offender to make amends. Empowering victims, community members, families, and offenders by giving them a voice and a shared responsibility in finding constructive resolutions. 75 R v Munson, 2003 SKCA 28 at para 70.

Building a sense of community and its capacity for resolving conflict. Promoting and sharing community values.82 The emphasis placed on community connections in the early jurisprudence of northern courts should not be taken to mean sentencing circles have limited applicability in urban centres.83 Interpreting their availability in this way would distinctly disadvantage urban Indigenous people in spite of the fact that dislocation to urban centres is often itself a by- product of Canada's colonial history.84 Sentencing circles may be useful in an urban setting so long as they include participants who are still willing and able to supervise a community-based disposition.85 As the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench stated in Cheekinew, \"the term 'community' ought to receive a wide and liberal construction\".86 Likewise, Justice Sherstobitoff of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal encouraged the urban M\u00e9tis community of Saskatoon to take part in sentencing circles in Morin.87 In Gladue, the Supreme Court of Canada endorsed urban networks of Indigenous support and interaction as a form of \"community\" for the purposes of its sentencing framework, providing further support for urban sentencing circles.88 As set out in Chapter 3, the legislative debate for s 718.2(e) included discussion of the success of a sentencing circle in the City of Saskatoon in the early 1990s as a precedent worthy of this explicit statutory backing. If past sentencing ranges indicate a lengthy penitentiary sentence will be appropriate, this may be perceived as a barrier to the use of sentencing circles.89 Yet if participation in a circle still advances the sentencing 82 Ibid. 83 See for example R v SEH, [1993] BCJ No 2967 (QL) (Prov Ct). 84 Elliot, supra note 78 at paras 40, 46.

On a procedural level, they can provide insight into the circumstances underlying the offence, including individual, family, and community dynamics.93 They can indicate whether someone has support from family, community members, or the victim moving forward.94 They can bridge cultural and linguistic barriers.95 They can contribute to crime prevention by facilitating more cooperation between professionals and Indigenous community members.96 Yet in the words of Chief Justice Bayda of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal (as he then was), \"[a] sentencing circle is much more than a fact-finding exercise with an aboriginal twist\".97 A circle \"permits not only a release of information but a purging of feelings, a paving of the way for new growth, and a reconciliation between the offender and those he or she has hurt\".98 The notion of healing in this context also extends to the fact that the community to which the offender has accounted is assuming \"an authority over and responsibility for the offender\".99 90 at 2006 NLTD 154 at paras 76-78, 81 [Poker 45-46; BL, supra note 71 at para 58. 92 R v Holmes, 2018 ABQB 916 at para 5 [Holmes]. 93 See for QJ No 888 (QL), [1994] [VK]; McNabb, note at paras 13, supra note 93 23-26. example: Naappaluk, supra note 93 at 153; Poker, supra note 90 at 3, 47, 54. 96 R v JKE, [1999] YJ No 70. 98 Ibid. 99 Ibid.212 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Framing these substantive outcomes in the language of the Criminal Code, an Indigenous person's participation, apologies, and expressions of remorse within a circle may indicate if the sentencing objectives of specific deterrence, rehabilitation, taking responsibility, and acknowledgement of harm are being achieved.100 Participation in the circle may indicate they are addressing the issues underlying their offending, such as addictions, trauma, and cultural disconnection, with clear relevance to rehabilitation.101 It can also support victim/offender reconciliation and community reintegration.102 Bearing all this in mind, it should not be surprising to find that healing circles will at times form part of a community-based disposition that takes place post-incarceration or in the absence of a prison sentence.103 In other words, these circles provide both culturally appropriate procedures and sanctions in advancing the Gladue analysis. Family group conferencing Family group conferencing provides another means by which an Indigenous person's family and community members can play a key role in the sentencing process. Similar to sentencing circles, family group conferencing was developed from Indigenous practices. In child protection matters, family group conferences bring extended family members together with parents to discuss their underlying issues and dynamics and to formulate a plan of extrajudicial measures so their children can safely return to family care.104 Indigenous family and 100 See for example: 78 BCPC 414 at paras 19, 40; Poker, supra note 90 at para 81. 101 See supra note Jack, 2008 BCPC 332 at paras 59, 74, aff 'd 2008 BCCA 437; R v Michel, 2008 NWTSC 1 at 3; supra note 93 at R v 2019 BCSC 357 at para 14. 102 John, supra note 32 at paras 32-33; Gregoire, supra note 60 note 38 at paras 55-56, App. 103 See for example: R v Fineday, 2007 SKPC 2 at Sch. 2; 6083 at para 46; R v Johnson, 2018 NSSC 10 at paras 14, 43-44. 104 See for example: SP and JP children para 12; Family & Children's Services of St. Thomas & Elgin v AC, 2013 ONCJ 453 at para 139; Children's Aid Society of Toronto v AG, 2015 ONCJ 331 at paras 101-104; New Brunswick (Social (NBQB) at paras MW, 2016 18 at paras 41-42; PL NBQB 79 at paras 10-11.213 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 community members may participate in these processes to facilitate cultural connections and continuity within a kinship network as well.105 These same principles can be incorporated into the sentencing process in a roughly analogous manner, especially for Indigenous youth. Family group conferencing was first developed in New Zealand in order to accommodate Mori culture and traditions in child protection proceedings and the sentencing of youths, and the idea was subsequently imported into Canada.106 In R v MM, Judge Cohen of the Ontario Court of Justice gave a brief outline of how these conferences offer a restorative justice approach to sentencing: In family group conferencing, a meeting is convened with the offender, the victim, their families and supporters in a facilitated but informal setting. The purpose of the conference is to \"give an opportunity for those affected by the crime\u2014the offender, his or her family members and the victim\u2014to reach a solution in a supportive environment\" (see: \"13th Report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs\", Chapter 6, pp. 4-7).107 Judge Cohen went on to state that young people are particularly likely to benefit from restorative justice processes like family group conferencing. These conferences offer the possibility of having young people confront those directly affected by their actions, providing an opportunity to better understand the harm they have caused \"in an immediate, concrete and hence meaningful way\".108 Like other restorative justice processes, family group conferences can also result in \"specific and individualized proposals to remedy the harm\" that may have a more significant impact than other sanctions available to the sentencing judge.109 Statutory authority for conferencing has since been incorporated into the Youth Criminal Justice Act as a sentencing tool for young people. The Act authorizes youth court judges to convene conferences to obtain 105 See for example: Children's Aid Society of the County of Bruce v J(D), 2013 ONSC 717 at paras 36, 95, 97; SSMB v British Columbia (Children and Family Development), 2014 BCSC 662 at paras 22-24; Alberta (Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, Director) v CL, 2020 ABPC 23 at paras 33-38, 216-218. 106 See R v McKay, [1997] AJ 552 (QL), 203 AR 77 (Prov para v M(B), 2003 SKPC 83 at para 54 [M(B)]; R v MAM, 2004 BCPC 438 at para 6 [MAM]; R v Quash, 2014 BCSC 198 at para 56. 107 R v MM, [2001] OJ No 2844 (QL) at para 10, 46 CR (5th) 173 (Ct J). 108 Ibid at para 15. 109 Ibid.214 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C their advice on appropriate extrajudicial measures, conditions for judicial interim release, sentences, and reintegration plans.110 Conferences initiated pursuant to the Act have been recognized as a valuable tool for obtaining relevant Gladue information regarding an Indigenous young person and alternatives to incarceration that might not have been available otherwise.111 They also provide for open and effective communication among a wider circle of individuals concerned with the offending behaviour and circumstances of the young person than would be possible in a formal court proceeding.112 Furthermore, they can provide an opportunity for the victim and offender to meet face-to-face and come away with a greater sense of each other's humanity.113 Similar to sentencing circles, family group conferences can have both procedural and substantive relevance to sentencing. In terms of process, they facilitate information sharing and problem solving.114 In terms of substance, the conference can also provide a vehicle through which responsibility and reparations are addressed, and community and family connections are identified in support of the young person's rehabilitation and reintegration into a more stable family environment.115 Family group conferences aim to both explore how people have been affected by the offence in question and work toward repairing the harm that has resulted.116 According to Judge Reilly of the Alberta Provincial Court (as he then was), they make constructive use of a person's shame as a motivation for them to come to an agreement to repair the harm they have done so they can get back into the community\u2014Judge Reilly termed this \"re-integrative shame\".117 While family group conferences were originally modelled from the Indigenous culture and traditions of Mori in New Zealand, they could provide a more culturally relevant process for Indigenous peoples in 110 Youth Criminal Justice Act, SC 2002, c 1 at s 19; MAM, supra note 106 at para 6, citing Nicholas Bala, \"Diversion, Conferencing, and Extrajudicial Measures for Adolescent Offenders\" (2003) 40 Alta L Rev 991. 111 R v TDP, 2004 SKPC 57 at paras 21, 28-29, 45 Ibid at para 22.

For example, these conferences can be conducted in a circle format that has important symbolism for many Indigenous peoples in Canada, thereby creating a safe environment for the participants to openly share their views.118 In some cases, respected Elders from an Indigenous community will participate.119 Conferencing has been included within probation orders as well.120 Elder panels and participation Elders may be able to provide input into the sentencing process in various ways, including through advisory panels, viva voce evidence, sentencing circles, conferences, support letters, and interviews for Gladue reports. In fact, most specialized sentencing processes for Indigenous people appear to favour the involvement of Elders. Indigenous societies often entrust Elders with important decision-making powers and accord them significant respect.121 As stated by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: Elders are generally, although not exclusively, older members of the community. They have lived long and seen the seasons change many times. In many Aboriginal cultures, old age is seen as conferring characteristics not present in earlier years, including insight, wisdom and authority. Traditionally, those who reached old age were the counsellors, guides and resources for the ones still finding their way along life's path.122 Consistent with this view, many of the commissions of inquiry preceding the enactment of s 718.2(e) called for the creation of Elder advisory panels or other mechanisms for Elder input into the sentencing process.123 In some parts of the country, judges appear to have echoed these calls.124 118 M(B), supra note 106 at paras 55-57. 119 See CJA, supra note 111 at paras 10, 14, 33, 43. 120 See for example: R v AGA, 1998 ABQB 60 at para 65 [AGA ]. 121 Pastion note 121 at para 25, citing Canada, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: Looking Forward, Looking Back, vol 4, Perspectives and Realities (Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada, 1996) at 103. 123 See Chapter 2 for a summary of findings from the commissions of inquiry and task forces that pre-dated the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its interpretation in the Gladue decision. See especially Bridging the Cultural Divide, supra note 51 at 109-116. 124 See for example R v Badman, 1993 ABCA 155 at para 1. 216 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Canadian courts have since recognized that involving Elders in the sentencing process can be responsive to Parliament's direction to pay particular attention to Indigenous peoples' unique circumstances.125 Elders may be given a voice in the sentencing process through the establishment of advisory panels or councils. For example, Elder councils were created in Attawapiskat and Sandy Lake in the early 1990s to propose alternative measures, sit with sentencing judges as advisory panels, and assist in the design and supervision of community- based dispositions.126 In Nunavut, a sentencing judge on circuit can sit with a panel of Elders who will \"make observations about the offender, sometimes in the fashion of a lecture or encouragement to the person to do better for themselves, their family and their community\".127 In this way, Elder involvement in sentencing can be a restorative process in and of itself.128 The traditional guidance of these Elders also helps ensure the Nunavut courts are familiar with each community and its needs.129 The input of Elder panels has therefore been likened to the information on an individual's background factors and sentencing options that is more often sought by way of pre-sentence reports.130 In some cases, Elders' input into the sentencing process might take place in the absence of a formalized justice initiative. For example, they might be called as witnesses to give evidence during the sentencing hearing with respect to the personal circumstances and rehabilitation prospects of the accused, the values and traditions of the community, or their views on an appropriate disposition or conditions.131 Similar to the Elder panels in Nunavut's hamlets, they may directly admonish the individuals being sentenced in some cases.132 The views and proposals of community Elders 125 See for example: R v Wells, 1998 ABCA 109 at para 47; CP and JA v R, supra note 16 at para 26; R v 4 Morrisseau, supra 121 at paras 101-103; v Leigh, 2018 ONCJ 776 at para 76 [Leigh]. 126 R at 170-171, aff 'd [1995] OJ No 342 (QL), 37 CR (4th) 131 (Gen Div) [Willocks]. 127 R v Eegeesiak, 2010 NUCJ 10 at para 54. 128 See for example: R v Kootoo, [2000] Nu J No CanLII 3756 (Ct J) at para 14 [Caza]. 129 R v BT, 2007 NUCA 3 at paras 10, 12-15. 130 Willocks, supra 125 2016 at para R v SA, 2016 ONSC 5355 at paras 19-22, 45. 132 See R Meyook, 2006 YKTC 105 at para 14.217 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 may be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge through a Gladue report as well.133 Elders have provided input by way of sentencing submissions or letters filed in court in some cases.134 Similar to the role of Elder panels, the submissions and testimony of Elders help ensure the courts are alive to both the unique circumstances of the person being sentenced and the perspectives of the community to which they might eventually return.135 Finally, it is worth noting that Elders also play a role in culturally relevant sanctions and dispositions. For example, many community- based sentences for Indigenous people have included conditions for participation in specific programming guided by Elders or Elder counselling in the community.136 Specialized sentencing courts Another way in which the sentencing process has been modified to accommodate Indigenous peoples' unique circumstances and perspectives is through the development of specialized courts. Examples range from a peacekeeping court that sits on the Tsuu T'ina Reserve in southern Alberta to a \"Gladue court\" in downtown Toronto, and they share the goal of facilitating healing and rehabilitation, working closely with community members, and finding different routes through which the principles of sentencing can be achieved.137 Their approach tends to be lengthy, difficult, ongoing, and holistic, and in some cases it will incorporate traditional practices and values.138 In other words, these specialized courts frequently embody restorative justice practices. As noted by Judge Schmidt of the British Columbia Provincial Court, \"[t]he intensity of the process itself shows offenders that the community 133 See for example: R v JN, 2013 ONCA 251 at paras 27, 50; R v DG, 2014 BCCA 84 at para 31 [DG]; R v Carter, 2014 SKPC 150 at para 11 [Carter]; R v TRJ, at paras 134 See R v Jack, [1993] YJ No 52 (QL) ABPC 48 at paras 12-13, 25 v Wells, 2009 ABPC 108 at para 3; R v Campbell, 2013 MBPC 19; R v Johnson, 2013 YKSC 126 at v Lamontagne, 2019 at R v Charlie, 2020 YKCA at para 64. 135 See for example: Stimson, supra note 134 at paras 23-25; R v Aulotte, 2015 ABPC 37 at para 7. 136 See for example: Peters, supra note 50 at para 30(11); R v 2006 28 at note Spencer, supra note 38 at paras 15, 47; R v Sark, 2020 PECA 9 at para 53. 137 R v Williams, 2004 BCPC 459 at 34-39. 138 Ibid at para 40.218 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C decidedly denounces the conduct\" and \"[t]he offender cannot simply enter a guilty plea, and submit to the sentence of the court\".139 In this way, specialized courts can have both procedural and substantive implications for sentencing akin to sentencing circles, conferences, and Elder panels. One early example of a specialized court tailoured to meet the distinct needs of Indigenous peoples is the unified court operating in Nunavut. As the vast majority of Nunavut's residents are Inuit, Justice Bychok of the Nunavut Court of Justice has often described this single-level trial court as a \"Gladue court\" that \" must account for the unique circumstances of Inuit, their culture, history and society\".140 The Court of Justice has long been attentive to both the systemic and background factors that many Inuit face and the unique cultural perspectives that Inuit hold.141 In doing so, many of its decisions acknowledge and engage with Inuit law, traditional justice, and societal values.142 The Nunavut Court of Appeal has accepted that Inuit social values, precepts, and concepts of justice are relevant to sentencing proceedings of the Nunavut Court of Justice so long as there is an adequate record for their case-specific application.143 Among other accommodative features, Elder panels and justice committees facilitate restorative justice approaches and community- based dispositions before the Nunavut Court of Justice.144 Lay Inuit court workers facilitate the administration of justice in a territory with unique cultural and linguistic needs, including by obtaining information on an individual's systemic and background factors and conducting 139 Ibid at para 41. 140 See for example: R v Holland, 2017 NUCJ 3 at para 13 [Holland]; R 1 23 ]; Kippomee, 2018 NUCJ 8 para 26, rev'd on other grounds 2019 NUCA 3; R v Jaypoody, 2018 NUCJ 36 at para 99 [Jaypoody]. 141 See for example Evaloardjuk, supra note 42 at paras 18-26; R v 10 at v at paras See v Sala, 1999 1738 (Nu Ct J); R v Iqaluit (Ct supra note at 75, 94-99.

Note that the term is also incorporated into various territorial statutes in Nunavut, including the Wildlife Act, SNu 2003, c 26 where it is defined as \"traditional Inuit values, knowledge, behaviour, perceptions and expectations\" (s 2). 144 See for example: Kootoo, supra note NUCJ 9 at paras 4; R v 2015 NUCJ 22 at paras 37, 72.219 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 bail hearings.145 There are also community justices of the peace who contribute experience and knowledge of their communities by \"sit[ting] in judgment of their fellow community members\".146 These unique attributes help ensure sentencing judges have adequate and sufficient information to carry out the analysis under s 718.2(e), supplemented by pre-sentence reports and other evidence as needed.147 There are also specialized courts that facilitate the implementation of s 718.2(e) for Indigenous people living in urban areas. One of the best- known examples would be the Gladue courts operating in several cities in Ontario, first piloted in Toronto in 2001 through the joint efforts of judges, academics, and community agencies.148 These dedicated courts were developed as a direct response to the over-incarceration of Indigenous people in order \"to give effect and meaning to Gladue\".149 The Gladue courts address Indigenous peoples' unique circumstances in both bail and sentencing hearings.150 They give meaning and effect to Gladue by reviewing extensive materials and programming assessments, involving Indigenous court workers, and using both Gladue reports and sentencing circles in appropriate cases.151 The Gladue courts also have access to specialized Gladue aftercare workers to provide input, support, and supervision of conditions following the sentencing hearing itself.152 According to Judge Nakatsuru of the Ontario Court of Justice (as he then was), their proceedings see \"much cooperation between the Crown and the defence\", including in assembling as much information as possible regarding an Indigenous person's unique circumstances.153 Likewise, the direct participation of the individual being sentenced may contribute to their level of insight and understanding, consistent with restorative justice practices.154 145 R v Ivarluk, 2005 NUCJ 5 at para NUCA at Chwyl v of at 21 at paras 11-12 [GH]. 146 R v NUCJ 3 37. 147 Oakoak, supra note 125 at paras 19-26; GH, supra note 145. 148 R v Kokopenace, 2013 ONCA 389 at para 140, rev'd on other grounds 2015 SCC 28. 149 R v George, 2012 ONCJ 756 at para 12. 150 See for example: R v Sledz, 2017 ONCJ 151. 151 See for R paras 64, 67, 69; Parent, 2019 ONCJ 523 at paras 96-97 [Parent]. 153 R v Armitage, 2015 ONCJ 64 6, 14 [Armitage]. at para 17.220 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Similar to Ontario's Gladue courts, in British Columbia there are several specialized courts known as First Nations Courts that facilitate the implementation of s 718.2(e), among other things. They have also been described with more inclusive language as Indigenous Community Courts.155 Their sentencing process has been referred to as a \"healing plan\", their proceedings may commence with a prayer or smudge, and they have often involved specialized probation officers, counsellors, Elders, and advisors who are able to liaise with Indigenous communities.156 In short, they provide a more culturally appropriate sentencing process that addresses systemic barriers otherwise limiting access to justice for Indigenous victims and offenders alike.157 First Nations Courts facilitate restorative justice and victim/offender reconciliation by encouraging the direct victims of offences, their family members, friends, and community representatives to attend and speak to an offence's impacts.158 Often participants \"speak to the circumstances in the context of the effects of colonization and the assimilation policies\" and \"serve to assist the court in developing a better understanding of the perceptions and points of view of the Indigenous persons or Indigenous communities impacted by the offences\".159 In addition to direct testimony of this kind, Gladue reports are frequently used in their proceedings as well.160 The First Nations Courts have also applied the following unique guidelines to their sentencing proceedings: ...with the application of Canadian laws, to promote respect for the person, family and community; to recognize culture and language; to acknowledge the importance of education and healing; to take a holistic approach to problem-solving; to recognize the importance of healthy people, families and communities; and, to acknowledge the need for a safe and peaceful community.161 155 SR, supra note 81 at paras 28-30. 156 R v O, 2012 BCCA 129 at para 23. 157 SR, supra note 81 at para 30. 158 R v Fisher, 2017 BCPC 92 at para 39. 159 Ibid. 160 R v CJHI, 2017 BCPC 121 at para 24. 161 R 2011 BCPC 145 at para 2.221 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 Gladue reports as restorative process One further adaptation of the sentencing process has been the development and use of specialized pre-sentence reports to better reflect the unique circumstances and needs of Indigenous peoples\u2014 namely, Gladue reports. Several commissions and studies that addressed Indigenous over-incarceration in the lead up to the enactment of s 718.2(e) had identified the need for improvements to the pre- sentence reports used when sentencing Indigenous people, including more consistent use of these reports, the incorporation of community perspectives, and greater detail, cultural sensitivity, and attention to the other unique circumstances of Indigenous peoples.162 The Supreme Court itself anticipated pre-sentence reports would incorporate Gladue factors, including representations from the relevant Indigenous communities.163 Following the release of the Gladue decision, Gladue reports came to be piloted in several jurisdictions across Canada, starting in Ontario, where Aboriginal Legal Services first developed these reports. Similar to other sentencing innovations for Indigenous people, Gladue reports are designed to be \"restorative in nature\", providing the individual being sentenced with an opportunity for introspection and critical contemplation of their own personal history, \"situat[ing] it in the constellation of family, land and ancestry that informs identity and worth\".164 In keeping with this goal, sentencing judges have occasionally made mention of an individual obtaining insight into their own circumstances and treatment needs by participating in the preparation of a Gladue report and reviewing the final product.165 Where an Indigenous agency, justice committee, or program oversees the preparation of Gladue reports they may directly reflect Indigenous perspectives and community views, including support for 162 See Chapter 2 for a summary of findings from the commissions of inquiry and task forces that pre-dated the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its interpretation in the Gladue decision.

Several of the commissions of inquiry and studies leading up to s 718.2(e)'s enactment identified banishment as a traditional sanction within many Indigenous societies, while distinguishing it from the way in which imprisonment results in de facto banishment but without community control over the terms of reintegration.171 A number of Canadian courts have likewise 166 See for example: R v McDonald, 2018 ONSC 4275 at para note 152 at paras 85-86. 167 supra note 11; DG, supra 133 at para 31; Johnny, 2015 BCSC 615 at para 28, rev'd on other grounds 2016 BCCA 61 [Johnny]; R v Legere, 2016 PECA 7 at v R v Crier, 2020 ABQB 475 at para 34. 168 See for example: R v Quock, 2015 YKTC 32 at para 25. 169 Armitage, supra note 153 at para 21. 170 See for example: R v Pelletier, 2016 ONCJ 628 at para 8; R v James, 2020 YKCA 11 at paras 13, 15. 171 See Chapter 2 for a summary of findings from the commissions of inquiry and task forces that pre-dated the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its interpretation in the Gladue decision. See especially Bridging the Cultural Divide, supra note 51 at 22, 60, 259-260.223 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 acknowledged temporary or even permanent banishment as having roots in the traditional justice practices of Indigenous peoples.172 In practice the term banishment has been used to describe functionally distinct sentencing conditions ranging from a period of land-based isolation within an Indigenous nation's traditional territory to a \"no go\" condition of probation preventing re-entry into the community. Community banishment continues to be practised by some Indigenous communities in Canada today, often drawing on the legal authority of the Indian Act, self-government agreements and statutes, or Indigenous laws and traditional practices.173 This form of community decision generally takes place outside the confines of the sentencing process, possibly constituting a collateral consequence in some cases.174 Yet in what appears to be a comparatively rare practice, sentencing judges have also crafted probationary banishment conditions under the Criminal Code, including at an Indigenous community's express request. As the latter practice is controversial it warrants closer examination here. Just as the sanction of banishment has deep roots within many Indigenous societies, this practice has a long but controversial history in both British and Canadian law.175 More recently, appellate courts have urged that this sanction must be used sparingly.176 In 1968, for example, Justice Dickson of the Manitoba Court of Appeal (as he then was) called for restraint in the use of banishment conditions on public policy grounds: In Canada communities are interdependent and relations between them should be marked by mutual respect and understanding. A practice whereby one community seeks to rid 172 See for example: Saila v R, [1983] NWTJ No 173 [Saila]; Taylor, supra note 41 at para 32; R v Morris, 2004 BCCA 305 at paras 29, 63; CP and JA, supra note 16 at para 26. 173 See for example: Gamblin v Norway House Cree Nation R v Hayes, 2007 ONCA 816; Solomon v Garden River First Nation, 2019 FC 1505. 174 See Chapter 16 for a discussion of collateral consequences in context to the sentencing of Indigenous people.

In 1997, for example, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld a temporary banishment condition requiring a Cree man to spend six months in isolation on a remote island in northern Saskatchewan.180 This condition was proposed during a sentencing circle and administered by the La Ronge Indian Band's justice committee. The Court was satisfied that the central purpose of the condition was rehabilitative\u2014\"for self- discipline, self-treatment, introspection, self-examination of one's goals, one's place in the scheme of life, and such other notions designed to produce a better person\".181 Isolation would also involve a measure of punishment through deprivation of mobility, amenities, and intimate personal contact, but this did not undermine its primary purpose of \"influencing the offender's future conduct and securing his good behaviour\".182 While it is difficult to find references to similar examples of land-based isolation in subsequent jurisprudence, it is possible that some communities continue to facilitate this kind of sanction.183 It is important to point out that the Criminal Code stipulates that the period of isolation or community banishment must be \"desirable... for protecting society and for facilitating the offender's successful 177 R v Fuller (1968), 2 DLR (3d) 27, 67 WWR 78 (Man CA) at 30-31. 178 R v Malboeuf, [1982] 4 CNLR 116, 2540 para 8. note 41. 181 Ibid, Bayda CJS at para 37. 182 Ibid. 183 See example PJB, supra note 38 at paras 11, 32.225 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 reintegration into the community\".184 Prior to 1996, the Code's equivalent statutory language mandated that it be \"desirable... for securing the good conduct of the offender and for preventing a repetition by the offender of the same offence or the commission of other offences\".185 In keeping with these legislative directives, courts have repeatedly insisted that banishment orders must be \"protective rather than punitive\".186 Likewise, there must be a nexus with the offender, protection of the community, and community reintegration.187 In other words, it \"cannot be used simply to punish an offender in the abstract\".188 Banishment conditions have been deemed appropriate in cases where they were used to protect a victim from further interaction with the accused or to facilitate rehabilitation, so long as their geographic scope can be justified.189 Likewise, this kind of condition may be appropriate if the accused consents to the restrictions in question or they facilitate a victim's recovery from the trauma of an offence.190 At the same time, the condition must be crafted with care and restraint, requiring attention to the accused's ties to the area, the level of hardship they will face from displacement, its proportionality with the offence in question, and the reasonableness of its outer boundaries.191 As these conditions are rare and have significant consequences, the accused ought to be given an opportunity to make submissions or lead evidence before such a condition is imposed.192 Courts are also attentive to the views of Indigenous communities in determining whether a period of banishment from their territories will be justified. In Saila, for instance, Justice Weerdt of the Northwest Territories Supreme Court upheld a Justice of the Peace's decision to 184 R v Rowe, [2006] OJ No 3738 (QL), 2006 CanLII 32312 (CA) at para 5, Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 731.2(3)(h) [Rowe]. 185 R v Voong, 2015 BCCA 285 at para 27. 186 R v Klein, 2011 SKQB 94 at para 25; R v Battisti, 2019 ONSC at para 187 R v 2006 SCC 44 at para 13. 188 Deering, supra note 175 at para 18. 189 Ibid; Rowe, supra note 184 at para 6; R v Adam, 2014 BCSC 1943 at paras R v Forner, 2020 BCCA at No CanLII 2357 para 11 [Dunn]; R v Leasak, 2007 ABCA 38, Martin JA at paras 43-44. 191 R v Cardinal, 1999 ABQB 323 at Rowe, supra note supra 2019 QCCQ 5877 at paras 182-186. 192 R 18.226 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C order someone not to return to a high arctic community for one year following his release from prison. He found that both the Justice of the Peace and the accused shared an Inuit cultural background, ostracism is a well-known means of dealing with wrongdoing in Inuit traditions, and the condition recognized the fact that in the eyes of the community his presence would not be welcome until that time had elapsed.193 Several other courts have taken into account whether banishment has been sought by the members or leadership of an Indigenous community in assessing its appropriateness.194 Yet a community's views may not be determinative if the banishment condition is aimed at securing the protection of specific individuals within the community in question.195 This is consistent with the dual bases on which these conditions might be justifiable\u2014namely the rehabilitation of the accused or the protection of victims. Courts have also expressed concern over the risk that banishment conditions have the potential to interfere with rather than further an Indigenous person's prospects for rehabilitation and reintegration into their home community. In Cardinal, for example, the Alberta Court of Appeal struck out a probation condition that banished a Dene man from his home reserve in spite of the fact that the Gladue report before the sentencing judge indicated Mr. Cardinal had employment prospects and access to unofficial counselling there.196 Rather than requiring him to avoid re-integration with his First Nation, the Court amended the probation order to provide for \"a more structured chance to re-engage with his community\".197 Providing for discretionary exceptions to banishment may help balance the rehabilitative needs of the accused against protection of their victims and their home community.198 If someone is likely to eventually return, the community will have a clear interest in facilitating their long-term reintegration and rehabilitation.199 193 Saila, supra note 172 at 176-177. 194 See for example: Dunn, supra note 190 at paras 6, 8; 2010 BCPC 434 at paras 27, 45-47; R v Schafer, 2019 YKTC 41 at paras 14-18, 32 [Schafer]. 195 R v Felix, 2002 NWTSC 63 at para 32. 196 R v Cardinal, 2017 ABCA 396 at para 13, 43, 45. 197 Ibid at paras 43-44. 198 See for example: Dunn, supra note 190 at para 10; R v Emile, 2019 NWTTC 9 at paras 38-41. 199 Schafer, supra note 194 at para 42.227 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 Community service orders Many sentencing judges have sought to actualize s 718.2(e) by requiring an Indigenous person to perform community service hours in a conditional sentence or probation order. This can achieve deterrence as well as restorative justice objectives such as community reintegration, rehabilitation, and reparations, especially where the community service takes place in the area where the offence was committed, whether this is in a rural or urban area.200 Community service can also be framed around culturally relevant activities, such as chopping wood for Elders, harvesting and distributing country foods, or otherwise assisting with events, projects, or ceremonies in the community.201 It is generally appropriate to build on an individual's particular skills and talents in this regard as well.202 A community service order can also facilitate community input and reintegration by having it supervised and administered through an Indigenous justice committee, a First Nation's Band manager, a caseworker, or some other community representative.203 So long as the accused is agreeable, it can also be crafted around underlying systemic and background factors, such as having someone speak publicly in the community regarding their experiences within the residential school system.204 Likewise, it can be linked to the offence\u2014for example, by having someone counsel young people on the dangers or harms 200 See for example: R v Poucette, 1999 ABCA 305 at Sch A (2)(f ); R v Skani, 2002 ABQB 1097 at 69; 58; v Moosomin, 2010 SKPC 182 at paras R v 2012 53 at v at YKTC Sellars, supra note 10 at para 39(h); R v MI, 2018 NSPC 56 at v Diabo, 2018 ONCJ at paras 59, 69; R v Charlie, 2019 YKTC 32 at para 49(10); R v Dennehy, 2019 ABQB 912 at para 60. 201 See for example: AGA, supra note 120 at para 61; Reid, supra note 43 para 33; 32 para 59(c); 'd 2019 858. 202 See for example: R v Richards, [1979] OJ No 1030 (QL), 49 CCC (2d) 517 (CA) 527; example: Sellon, supra note 60 at para 19; at para 74(10).228 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C associated with their criminal conduct.205 Often the precise details of culturally appropriate and community-specific proposals will be outlined in Gladue reports.206 Indigenous programming provided in the correctional system or the community While s 718.2(e) explicitly directs sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions other than incarceration that are reasonable in the circumstances, the task of canvassing culturally appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions may still require attention to the Indigenous programming available within correctional institutions, as well as what is available for transitioning back into the community. The options available in custody may include Indigenous-specific units, Indigenous inmate liaison officers, opportunities for participation in pipe ceremonies, sweat lodges, healing circles, and smudging, and access to Elders and family members.207 There are also healing lodges, community-based residential facilities, and community correctional centres that are designed to facilitate an Indigenous person's reintegration post-incarceration.208 Questions regarding the suitability, eligibility, or availability of these programs will sometimes be addressed in Gladue reports, which can inform the sentencing judge's own non-binding recommendations.209 In some cases, sentencing judges will order the clerk to forward a Gladue report or at least its recommendations to the attention of 205 See for example: R v Logan, [1999] OJ No 3411 927 32593 para 24; R ABQB 353 at 14 [Small-Buffalo]; Appaqaq, supra v Heimbecker, 2020 SKQB 304 at paras 83, 93, 95. 206 See for example: Appaqaq, supra note 40 at para 67; McDonald, 166 at para 58(v). 207 See for example: v Land, at paras v Terriak, 2019 NSPC 40 at paras 208 See for R Kebokee, 2018 ONCJ 173 at paras 122-124; Holmes, supra note 92 at para 16; Bird, 2019 SCC 7 at 209 See 2015 BCSC at v v at paras 24, 54.229 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 correctional officials so as to inform their subsequent decision- making.210 At the same time, the accused may request that some or even all of the information set out in the Gladue report should be withheld to ensure it does not jeopardize their classification in custody.211 This appears to reflect concerns over the use of risk assessment tools in the correctional system, as canvassed in the Ewert decision summarized in Chapter 8. In attending to an Indigenous person's prospects for rehabilitation, sentencing judges may wish to be provided with detailed evidence addressing whether they are likely to have the opportunity to benefit from culturally relevant programming options \"available on paper\" as these may not be available, accessible, or beneficial in practice.212 Likewise, specific and up-to-date information regarding the availability and timing for access to culturally appropriate programming in custody may be needed in order to \"weigh the programs that are available to a particular offender within the institutional setting against the services that could be provided outside the institution\".213 A sentencing judge can also benefit from information regarding an Indigenous person's history of access to and success in culturally relevant programming in custody as this can shed light on whether a federal sentence or a provincial sentence is more likely to further their rehabilitation.214 Past success in culturally relevant programming and treatment during custody can also be highly relevant in dangerous offender and long-term offender proceedings for Indigenous people.215 Likewise, evidence that the accused has already successfully engaged in culturally appropriate programs during remand\u2014such as participation in healing circles or Elder counselling\u2014may help the 210 See for example: R v Kennedy-Money, 2016 ONSC 7051 at para v Quinn, 2016 ABPC para R v Anderson, 2018 BCSC 2528 paras 5, R v Fraser, 2019 v BCSC & Debassige, 2017 ONSC 4749 at paras 43, 57. 212 R v Charlie, 2018 YKTC 44 at paras 56-58, aff 'd 2020 YKCA 6, citing R v Taylor, 2017 YKTC 3 at paras 115-143, 151-152. 64-65, 69, v Dusome, 2019 ONCJ 444 paras 38-44. 213 R v Wilson, 2008 ABQB 588 at para 116, rev'd on other grounds 2009 ABCA 257.

See Chapter 14 for a more detailed discussion of how the Gladue principles have been applied in context to Dangerous Offender proceedings.230 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C judge determine whether they are a good candidate for rehabilitation and community supervision.216 Sentencing judges may also wish to compare the Indigenous-specific programming offered within the correctional system against Indigenous- specific programming available in the community. For instance, residential treatment centres like the Poundmaker's Lodge Treatment Centre in Alberta integrate Indigenous cultural values and spirituality with other forms of therapy and treatment, providing a common option for community-based dispositions.217 Other community-based rehabilitative options for counselling, treatment, and support may be offered in urban centres or within specific Indigenous communities.218 Due to the broad diversity among the available sentencing options and the many potential contingencies regarding what will be suitable and who will be eligible, a thorough and meaningful analysis of culturally appropriate sanctions and procedures is likely to be an information- intensive one. Conclusion The case law canvassed in this chapter shows both divergence and commonalities among the common alternative sentencing procedures and sanctions that courts have considered under s 718.2(e) to date. As the Supreme Court of Canada has directed sentencing judges to consider the needs, values, and decisions of particular Indigenous communities, the available sentencing options in each case may reflect this diversity. Sentencing judges must also consider what would be appropriate in the particular circumstances of a range of different offences by individuals with distinct strengths and needs. Likewise, the needs and perspectives of those who have been harmed or who form part of the support network of the person being sentenced may be relevant. This is the nature of an individualized approach to sentencing that requires attention to a wide variety of circumstances, including but not limited to the unique circumstances of Indigenous people. 216 See for example: R v Sharkey, 2011 BCSC 1541 at paras R v Dickson, 2015 13 at para 54, aff 'd 2015 YKCA 17; v HSS, 2016 BCPC 430 R v 1028 at 49, 84. 217 Small-Buffalo, supra note 205, at para 14. 218 See for example: R v Poitras, 2016 SKQB 367 at paras 22, 42, 44(1)(g); AGA, supra note 120 at para 65.231 Chapter 10: Culturally Appropriate Procedures and SanctionsCHAPTER 10 Yet there are many common threads binding culturally sensitive tools for sentencing like Gladue reports with the examples of sentencing circles, family group conferences, and Elder panels first piloted in the early 1990s. As pointed out in the Gladue decision itself, there is a common emphasis on restorative approaches and community-based sanctions among the legal and cultural traditions of Indigenous peoples across Canada. Where alternative procedures and sanctions assist in addressing criminal wrongdoing in a more holistic way\u2014whether this is by incorporating the perspectives of family and community members or addressing the needs of victims\u2014they are more likely to find consonance with Indigenous peoples' distinct perspectives and traditional concepts of sentencing. At the same time, the Supreme Court has also emphasized the need to merge judicial notice of this general approach with case-specific information, which can ensure Indigenous perspectives and traditions are reflected with greater accuracy and specificity. This could mean attention to unique circumstances ranging from Nisga'a shame feasts in northern British Columbia to the sacred and spiritual values associated with eating game meat and hunting for the Cree of northern Quebec.219 In other words, the Gladue framework can be applied in a way that is attentive to the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and their distinct perspectives. Questions around the sources and sufficiency of this kind of case-specific information will be addressed in the following chapter. 219 See for example: Kawapit, supra note 38 at paras 356 15.232 CHAPTER 11: THE NEED FOR CASE-SPECIFIC INFORMATION The Supreme Court of Canada has long insisted that a sentencing judge needs to have the \"fullest possible information\" regarding the background of the individual before them in order to be in a position to craft a fit and proportionate sentence.1 The Court has made it equally clear that paying attention to the unique circumstances of an Indigenous person places particularly weighty informational demands on the day-to-day functioning of the courts. This is moderated by directing sentencing judges to always take judicial notice of the broader systemic and background factors that impact Indigenous peoples, as well as the restorative approach to sentencing that generally has greater relevance to them.2 Yet the case law to date illustrates a great diversity of systemic and background factors with potential relevance to the sentencing of an Indigenous person.3 The same is true of community-based, culturally relevant sentencing procedures and sanctions that might be appropriate and available in any given case.4 Perspectives on sentencing and justice also vary among Indigenous nations, communities, groups, and individuals.5 In short, \"[t]he unique circumstances of aboriginal offenders are both general and specific in nature\".6 It is therefore expected that sentencing judges will explore both general, community-level factors and those particular to the individual being sentenced.7 1 R v Gardiner, [1982] 2 SCR 368 at 414, 1982 CanLII 30 [Gardiner]. 679 at para 83 [Gladue]. 3 See the detailed discussion of unique systemic and background factors in Chapter 9. 4 See the detailed discussion of culturally appropriate procedures and sanctions in Chapter 10. 5 See for example: R v Morris, 2004 BCCA 305 at paras 62-70 [Morris]; R v Elliot, 2015 295 12-13, 16, 24; R v NUCA 3, Berger JA at paras 87-89, concurring. 6 R v Harry, 2013 MBCA 108 at para 61 [Harry ].

Prior to summarizing the jurisprudence of lower courts to date, however, it is worth briefly reiterating the principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in this regard. In Gladue, the Supreme Court clearly anticipated that case-specific information would be adduced by \"counsel on both sides\".8 Sentencing judges have a duty to seek further information if counsel fail to adequately address this need.9 Furthermore, whenever an Indigenous person is the subject of a pre-sentence report, both categories of their unique circumstances will require \"special attention\".10 The Supreme Court anticipated that authors of pre-sentence reports would seek representations from the relevant Indigenous community, \"which will usually be that of the offender\".11 Sentencing judges are also empowered to call witnesses to testify regarding reasonable alternatives \"in appropriate circumstances and where practicable\".12 Appellate courts, for their part, should consider any relevant and admissible fresh evidence that is made available in a sentence appeal.13 At the same time, the Supreme Court later cautioned in Wells that this should not \"transform the role of the sentencing judge into that of a board of inquiry\", further inquiries will be limited to appropriate circumstances and where practicable, and these determinations by the sentencing judge should be given deference on appeal.14 In Ipeelee, the Supreme Court gave renewed attention to the importance of case-specific information. Beyond taking judicial notice of broader social facts underlying Indigenous over-incarceration, \"additional case-specific information will have to come from counsel and from the pre-sentence report\".15 Sentencing judges must take judicial notice of the generalizable circumstances of Indigenous people in Canada as \"the necessary context for understanding and evaluating the case-specific information presented 8 Gladue, supra note 2 at para 83. 9 Ibid at 84. 10 para 84. 13 Ibid at para 85. 14 R v Wells, 2000 SCC 10 at para 55 [Wells]. 15 R v Ipeelee, SCC 13 at para 59 [Ipeelee].234 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C by counsel\".16 The Court also noted it had become \"current practice\" by 2011 to obtain case-specific information in a Gladue report\u2014\"a form of pre-sentence report tailored to the specific circumstances of Aboriginal offenders\".17 Bringing this information before the court \"in a comprehensive and timely manner\" was said to be \"indispensable to a judge in fulfilling his duties under s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code\".18 As this chapter demonstrates, a complex jurisprudence has arisen in response to these directives. Courts across the country have grappled with fundamental questions around the level of case-specific information needed in any given context, the most efficient means of collecting, collating, and placing it before the courts, and the distinct roles sentencing judges, counsel, and the state play in fulfilling the promise of s 718.2(e). While lingering questions remain unanswered, existing case law provides a demanding but flexible framework to guide the work of sentencing judges, counsel, and state actors. Sources of case-specific information One of the most contentious issues in the jurisprudence to date has been the debate over the best way for sentencing judges to obtain case-specific information with respect to an Indigenous person's unique circumstances. Counsel will play a crucial role in ensuring an adequate record. Likewise, alternative sentencing procedures such as justice committees, sentencing circles, family group conferences, and Elder panels can all contribute relevant case-specific information. However, it is Gladue reports and pre- sentence reports that receive the most attention from courts as more commonplace sentencing tools. Specialized Gladue reports were developed shortly after the Supreme Court stated that it expected pre-sentence reports to pay special attention to the unique circumstances faced by Indigenous peoples in the Gladue decision. When the utility of Gladue reports was first explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in Ipeelee, they gained greater national attention and some decisions went so far as to suggest they would become mandatory in all future sentencing proceedings for Indigenous people.19 The headnote for Ipeelee in the Supreme Court Reports accorded 16 Ibid at para 60. 17 Ibid. 18 Ibid. 19 See for example: R v Gouda, 2013 ABQB 121 at para 1 [Gouda]; R v Mattson, 2014 235 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 with this view, where Justice LeBel's endorsement of Gladue reports is paraphrased in more absolute terms: A Gladue report is an indispensable tool to be provided at a sentencing hearing for an Aboriginal offender and it is also indispensable to a judge in fulfilling his duties under s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.20 However, most jurisprudence has articulated a more flexible position on this issue. In the words of Justice Pomerance of the Ontario Superior Court in Corbiere: There is no magic in a label. A \"Gladue Report\" by any other name is just as important to the court. Its value does not depend on it being prepared by a particular agency. Its value does hinge on the content of the document and the extent to which it has captured the historical, cultural, social, spiritual and other influences at play in this context.21 The British Columbia Court of Appeal reiterated this view in Lawson, holding that it is the information ordinarily contained within a Gladue report that is indispensable rather than its particular source.22 This more flexible approach was summarized as follows: A Gladue report may be provided by a variety of people of diverse experience and background who have access to, or can obtain, information that is reliable and relevant. A formal Gladue report is not necessary to provide the court with Gladue information; Gladue information may also be provided to the Court through a pre-sentence report.23 Counsel also play an important part in supplementing gaps in the record. As stated by Chief Judge Cozens of the Yukon Territorial Court (as he then was) in Blanchard: In the absence of a true Gladue report, it is critical that pre- sentence reports contain some details about an offender's aboriginal status and circumstances. Where the pre-sentence ABCA 178 at para 50 [Mattson]; R v 308 at para 8 [Napesis]. 20 Ipeelee, supra note 15 at 435. See also R v McNeil, 2020 ONCA 595 at para 36. 21 R v Corbiere, 2012 ONSC 2405 at para 23 [Corbiere]. 22 R v Lawson, 2012 BCCA 508 at para [Lawson]. 23 Ibid at para 27.236 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C report does not contain sufficient relevant information, defence and Crown should be prepared to make submissions and, if necessary, call relevant evidence.24 In other words, the adequacy of Gladue information before the sentencing judge will be measured by an assessment of its content and level of detail, and sentencing judges will neither defer to the label a report is given nor the agency that provides it.25 In part this could reflect the lack of national standards and the diversity of approaches applied in the preparation of Gladue reports and pre-sentence reports from one jurisdiction or agency to the next.26 Regardless of its underlying rationale, this focus on substance over form imposes a greater burden on the judges who are tasked with scrutinizing the materials before them and assessing their sufficiency prior to sentencing an Indigenous person. Likewise, counsel for both parties bear their own obligations, as does the state. Prior to addressing each of these actor-specific obligations in detail, the typical sources of relevant case-specific information warrant closer attention. Sentencing submissions and evidence adduced by counsel Submissions from counsel can play an important role in ensuring an Indigenous person's unique circumstances are properly explored during sentencing. Sentencing hearings are not governed by \"the formalities and technicalities characteristic of the normal adversary proceeding\", such as the strict rules of evidence applied at trial.27 As set out in s 726.1 of the Criminal Code, sentencing judges must consider any relevant information placed before them, \"including any representations or submissions made by or on behalf of the prosecutor or the offender\".28 Likewise, s 724(1) authorizes the courts to accept \"any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings and any facts agreed on by the prosecutor 24 R v Blanchard, 2011 YKTC 86 at para 25 [Blanchard], cited with approval in Lawson, supra note 22 at para 27. 25 See for example: Harry, supra note 6 at para 63; R 2016 v Wolfleg, 2018 ABCA 222 at para 52, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38542 (13 June 2019) [Wolfleg]. 26 See for example R v Gamble, 2019 SKQB 327 at paras 44-52, 74-77 [Gamble]. 27 Gardiner, supra note 1 at 414. 28 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 726.1.237 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 and the offender\".29 In this context, factual assertions from counsel and the accused \"acquire the force of evidence unless challenged\".30 Comprehensive submissions from counsel will be particularly important when the time required for the preparation of a pre-sentence report or a formal Gladue report might prejudice the accused.31 For example, if the preparation of a Gladue report will take several weeks, the parties are proposing far shorter periods of custody, and the accused will remain in pre-trial custody during the report's preparation, the accused should not be forced to surrender days if not weeks of their life just to have the Gladue principles fully considered.32 In such time-constrained circumstances, the sentencing judge may be in a position to instead engage in \"meaningful dialogue\" with counsel with respect to the Gladue principles and any appropriate sentencing options that might be available.33 If the factual assertions counsel make in their submissions are disputed, they will need to be proven through some form of admissible evidence, which can include credible and trustworthy hearsay.34 Relevant and reliable evidence with respect to community perspectives, culturally appropriate sanctions and procedures, and both individual and collective systemic and background factors can be garnered from a wide variety of sources. Such details have been addressed by hearing directly from witnesses in past cases, including Elders, Indigenous court workers, family members, community leaders, community members, and community-based support workers.35 They have also been addressed through written statements and letters obtained from community members, family members, existing court- ordered reports and assessments, child welfare records, corrections records, and adjudicated decisions from the Independent Assessment Process pursuant to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.36 29 Ibid, s 724(1). 30 R v FJH, 2017 BCSC 181 at paras 28-29. 31 See for example R v Gruben, 2013 NWTSC 59 at 2. 32 R v Contreras, 2019 ONSC 3152 at para 25. 33 Ibid at para 31. 34 R v Pahl, 2016 BCCA 234 at para 54. 35 See for example: R LLJ, v JRS, 2010 SKQB 33 at paras 69-77; R v Johnnie, 2016 BCPC 96 at paras 56-73; R v Ryan, 2019 NSPC 35 at paras 40-54; R v Lerat, 2020 SKPC 2020 at 60-63 238 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C The Indigenous person undergoing sentencing will be an obvious source for relevant information about their own circumstances.37 That said, it is worth recalling that the Gladue principles mandate the consideration of these individual circumstances within a broader systemic and background context that could involve circumstances beyond their personal knowledge, and some may struggle to even meaningfully articulate their own personal situation depending on the nature of their constrained circumstances.38 Some sentencing judges may caution against reliance on submissions from counsel as a substitute for a Gladue report.39 Others have been satisfied that the record adduced by counsel is so extensive they essentially have \"the equivalent of a Gladue report\" before them.40 If so, they may determine no further reports are needed.41 Yet amassing an equivalent record to a Gladue report in every case would impose a considerable burden on counsel that may go unremunerated and for which they may not be adequately trained.42 If nothing else, submissions from counsel can assist in filling gaps in the record whenever a court-ordered report would be too impractical.43 Pre-sentence reports authored by probation officers Information regarding an Indigenous person's unique circumstances can also be obtained through a pre-sentence report authored by a probation officer. Section 721(1) of the Criminal Code expressly authorizes sentencing judges to order the preparation of these reports. The Code also prescribes their basic content and authorizes the enactment of more at para 45; R v Aulotte, 2015 ABPC 37 at para R v 2015 681 at v Ahpay, 2018 SKQB at v BCSC 1397 at 37 Gamble, supra note 26 at paras 67-68. 38 See for example: R v Lewis and Lewis, 2014 BCPC 93 at 16-17 [Lewis Peepeetch 2019 SKQB 132 at 17, R v Chappell, 2020 BCSC 536 at paras 15-16, 64. 39 See Rich, 2020 CanLII 32237 (NL Prov Ct) 36 at para 7. 41 Ibid. 42 Lewis and Lewis, supra note 38 at para 15; CJHI, supra note 38 at paras 27-29; 2019 ONCJ 523 at paras 78-86, 147 [Parent]; 2019 BCPC 314 at para 41 [TLC ]. 43 See for example R v Kuliktana, 2020 NUCA 7 at para 33.239 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 detailed regulations in each jurisdiction.44 While probation officers have not been statutorily directed to canvass Indigenous peoples' circumstances in the Criminal Code, sentencing judges are empowered to specify what each report ought to contain.45 A pre-sentence report's overall purpose is to provide \"a context against which the principles of sentencing can be more accurately applied\".46 If the report is prepared for an Indigenous person, their unique circumstances will no doubt form a crucial part of that context. Since the Criminal Code authorizes provincial governments to adopt differing approaches to the content, format, and structure of pre- sentence reports from one jurisdiction to the next, generalizations should be approached with caution. Current jurisprudence suggests that in at least some instances, pre-sentence reports have been a useful and reliable source of case-specific information for the analysis required by s 718.2(e). They are intended to provide \"an accurate, independent, and balanced assessment of an offender, [their] background and [their] prospects for the future\".47 An independent report has certain advantages over submissions from counsel, especially when the factual assertions of the person being sentenced can be verified or corroborated through collateral interviews.48 Yet the case law to date makes it equally clear that the level of Gladue information in these reports can vary greatly from one to the next. Moreover, the process through which Gladue information is collected, collated, and presented to the court in risk-focused pre- sentence reports can be problematic for the contextual analysis required by s 718.2(e). In favour of their use, Saskatchewan case law to date suggests sentencing judges in that province have been generally satisfied with the level of Gladue information they provide, especially when amplified by counsel's own contributions to the record.49 This could reflect the specific training probation officers in Saskatchewan are receiving on how to include Indigenous peoples' circumstances in their reports.50 This is not to say that obtaining Gladue information through court-ordered pre-sentence 44 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, ss 721(2), (3). 45 Ibid, s 46 R v Carrera-Vega, 2015 ONSC 4958 at para 20. 47 R v Junkert, 2010 ONCA 549 at para 59. 48 R v Choken, 2012 MBPC 44 at para 36; R v Morgan, 2014 YKTC 57 at paras 41-45. 49 See for example: R v Desjarlais, 2019 SKQB 6 at paras 30, 33 [Desjarlais]; R v Sand, 2019 SKQB 18 at para 48 [Sand]; R v Angus, 2020 205. 49 at para 13.240 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C reports has always proceeded smoothly in Saskatchewan based on reported case law.51 However, in the absence of a formal process or dedicated funding for Gladue reports, sentencing judges appear to accept pre-sentence reports as their default source for this key information.52 The Chief Justice of Nunavut has adopted a similar position in the absence of any formal and publicly funded process for obtaining Gladue reports in that territory.53 On the other hand, sentencing judges in several other jurisdictions have described the level of Gladue information in pre-sentence reports in far less flattering terms. In Noble, for example, Judge Joy of the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador portrayed sentencing judges in Labrador as being \"served up the thin gruel\" of pre-sentence reports with a \"Gladue Perspective\" authored by probation officers with neither adequate time nor training to properly address the information required by s 718.2(e).54 In Derion, Judge Giardini of the British Columbia Provincial Court described a pre-sentence report's treatment of an Indigenous person's unique circumstances as \"woefully inadequate\" and \"of absolutely no assistance\" when only two paragraphs were dedicated to this topic.55 In Awashish, Judge Ladouceur described the Gladue information in pre-sentence reports as being \"but the tip of the iceberg\" in most cases.56 Similarly, Justice Monnin of the Manitoba Court of Appeal criticized pre-sentence reports that merely purport to address Gladue factors while providing nothing more than \"a short history of the accused's home community and the general loss of culture and identity that has afflicted aboriginal communities generally\".57 Judicial rebukes of this sort may have encouraged reforms in some of these jurisdictions.58 51 See for example: Sand, supra note 49 supra note 38 at para 10. 53 See R v GH, 2020 NUCJ 21. 54 R v Noble, [Derion]. v AAHN, BCPC 425 at para Lewis and Lewis, supra note 38 at para 20; R v Keitlah, 2014 BCPC 202 at para 56 R c Awashish, 2020 QCCQ 3614 at para 19 [Awashish]. 57 LLDG, 2012 MBCA 106 at para 30 [LLDG]. See also R v C(OE), 2013 MBCA 60 at para 29. 58 See for example Harry, supra note 6 at para 83.241 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 One key barrier for probation officers tasked with eliciting Gladue information for pre-sentence reports arises from their overall role in the administration of justice and how they may be perceived by their interviewees as a result. As Judge Challenger of the British Columbia Provincial Court succinctly states in Lewis and Lewis: Gathering information from offenders about the impact of the Gladue factors on their families and their lives is a difficult task and probation officers are not well positioned to do so effectively. The experiences of First Nations people often involve significant trauma and often involve egregious conduct by family and community members. Most people would be very reluctant or unable to share intimate and disturbing information about the trauma they have experienced with a person who is not independent and whose role includes investigating and reporting criminal charges against them.59 Concerns have also been raised with the use of pre-sentence reports as a source of Gladue information in light of how they employ actuarial risk assessment tools. Some sentencing judges have suggested that the prediction of future risk of recidivism in these reports tends to distract from the task of crafting a proportionate sentence.60 Likewise, if a pre- sentence report is prepared with a focus on obtaining risk-scoring data, the author may be steered away from the kinds of contextual information that the court requires.61 When a pre-sentence report is ordered for an Indigenous person, tensions between their predicted risk of recidivism and the proportionality of their sentence will be heightened, as will the tension between the gathering of risk scoring data and the need for a more contextual inquiry into their unique circumstances. This is because many of the risk factors that are assessed through actuarial tools\u2014such as a personal history of substance abuse, family violence, or unemployment\u2014overlap with the systemic and background factors that have been identified in Gladue and Ipeelee and related jurisprudence. 59 Lewis and Lewis, supra note 38 at para 14.

See for example: R v Galloway, 2004 SKQB 130 at para 29; R v Derby, 2013 paras 60 See for example: R v Elliott, 2004 NSPC 71 at paras 17, 20-22; R v MDD, 2004 106 at v SMR, 2004 SKPC 131 at paras 45-52. For similar concerns expressed in other contexts see: R v Legere (1995), 22 OR (3d) 89 at 101, 1995 CanLII 1551 (CA); R v Boutilier, 2017 SCC 64, para 118, dissenting. R v CJA, 2005 SKPC 10 at para 43.242 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C To understand this concern, it is worth recalling that the Supreme Court of Canada has directed sentencing judges to ensure that systemic factors do not inadvertently lead to discrimination in Ipeelee.62 This can occur when facially neutral socioeconomic factors like employment status are relied upon to justify incarceration since doing so will have a disproportionate impact on Indigenous people due to overall lower employment rates.63 As Judge Pollack of the Manitoba Provincial Court points out in Nepinak, this direction may be difficult to reconcile with the use of actuarial tools that inevitably classify Indigenous people with prominent Gladue factors in a higher risk category.64 Judge Pollack is by no means the only sentencing judge urging caution in relying on risk scores in pre-sentence reports for Indigenous people so as to avoid perpetuating systemic discrimination.65 It is important to note that this concern is related but somewhat distinct from the uncertainty recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ewert as to whether all of these actuarial tools have been adequately and scientifically validated for use on Indigenous people.66 As stated in Quock by Chief Judge Cozens of the Yukon Territorial Court (as he then was), the overlap between systemic factors and risk factors makes it important for a sentencing judge to understand the context in which each risk factor exists and then assess whether a plan can be identified to significantly reduce the risk factor, such as Indigenous- specific treatment methods.67 This may raise questions about the way in which pre-sentence reports are prepared and whether their methodology facilitates this kind of contextualized analysis for Indigenous people, in contrast to specialized Gladue reports.68 While pre-sentence reports always contain some personal history regarding the accused, they remain primarily focused on assessing their risk of recidivism.69 62 Ipeelee, supra note 15 at para 67. 63 Ibid. 64 R v Nepinak, 2017 MBPC 62 65 See for example: MBQB 105 at paras [Quock]; R v Head, 2020 ABPC 211 at para 32 [Head ]. 66 See Ewert v Canada, 30 at paras 49-50, 63-67. 67 Quock, supra note 65 at para 96.

As summarized in Chapter 10, these specialized reports were first piloted in Ontario by Aboriginal Legal Services immediately following the Supreme Court's call for special attention to Indigenous peoples' circumstances in pre-sentence reports in Gladue. They are also responsive to recommendations in the studies and reports considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gladue, especially with respect to the need for cultural sensitivity in the preparation of pre-sentence reports and greater inclusion of community perspectives.72 In contrast to the risk-focused pre-sentence reports that are prepared by probation officers, the methodology underlying the preparation of Gladue reports has been described as \"restorative in nature\", incorporating self-reflection, the diverse perspectives of family and community members, and broader inter-generational contexts and histories.73 Section 721 of the Criminal Code clearly authorizes sentencing judges to order probation agencies to prepare pre-sentence reports in the form of Gladue reports.74 Yet there is no equivalent statutory provision to order 70 See for example: Lawson, supra note 22 at para 27; R v Park, 2016 MBCA 107 at para [Park ]; R v Matchee, 2019 ABCA 251 [Matchee]. 71 See for example: R v Kakekagamick (2006), 214 OAC 127, 2006 CanLII Zoe, 2020 NWTCA 1 [Zoe ]. 72 See Chapter 2 for a summary of findings from the commissions of inquiry and task forces that pre-dated the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its interpretation in the Gladue decision.

For example, when sentencing judges in British Columbia have ordered Gladue reports, the specific arrangements have often been left up to counsel and British Columbia's legal aid organization.76 In the absence of any equivalent process in Saskatchewan, the courts have concluded that they have an inherent or implied power to compel the provincial government to commission the preparation of Gladue reports as necessary.77 In both provinces Gladue reports have been privately funded by the accused as well.78 Regardless of the source of funding for Gladue reports, they are often treated analogously to conventional pre-sentence reports in that the same general requirements of balance and objectivity apply.79 Gladue reports are not meant to be conveying the personal opinions of their authors nor should they strongly recommend specific sentences, although they may include suggestions or proposals for restorative or rehabilitative options.80 In other words, Gladue report writers should not be effectively providing sentencing submissions, nor should they be expected to.81 Gladue reports are not expert reports either, though the writer's training and background may influence the weight they are assigned.82 The authors of Gladue reports should also be independent of the parties \"to avoid the risk of the author straying into advocacy\".83 Likewise, the objective and independent status of Gladue reports ought to be reflected in how they are administered and provided to the court in the sense that they should not be \"in the control\" of the defence.84 Courts have often recognized Gladue reports as a useful means by which the details of an Indigenous person's unique circumstances can be placed before 75 Desjarlais, supra note 49 at para 30. 76 See R v McCook, 2015 BCPC 1; supra note 38; Gamble, supra note 78 See for example: R FDW, 2018 BCPC 374 at para 30; supra note 35 at para 2. 79 Lawson, supra note 22 at para 28. 80 Ibid.

They are typically prepared by an \"empathetic peer\" who conducts a series of in-person interviews with the subject and collaterals.92 As Gladue report writers are independent from the criminal justice system and typically Indigenous people themselves, they may be better positioned to develop a rapport with interviewees so they can have candid and detailed discussions about sensitive topics.93 As noted by Judge Wolf of the British Columbia Provincial Court in TLC , this was one of the conclusions from a study that compared the value of pre- sentence reports to Gladue reports in that province.94 85 See for example: R v DAH, 2010 BCPC 313 at paras 31-33; R v Sutherland, 2010 ONCJ 103 at para 41; R v Sam, 2013 ABCA 174 at para 35; R v Sidney, 2013 YKTC 61 at para R v Nippi, 2015 at v at v Demmons, 2016 BCPC 363 at para 23; R v Hall, 2019 ABQB 343 at para 68. 86 See for example: R v Magill, 2013 YKTC 8 at para v Fontaine, 2014 BCCA 1 at para ABPC at para supra note 25 supra note 55 at para 13; R v Lilley, 2016 YKTC 56 at para 16. 88 See for example: R v Brown, [2009] OJ No 979 (QL), 2009 CanLII 9760 (Sup Ct) at para BCCA 318 paras 14-17; Noble, supra note 54 at 55; R v Pantherbone, 2018 ABPC 142 at para 15. 89 See for example: R v Leigh, 2018 ONCJ 776 at para 26; TLC , supra note 42 para See for example: R v Sutherland-Cada, 2016 ONCJ 650 at para v Armitage, 2015 ONCJ 64 at para 21. 92 See: Sand, supra note 49 at para 47; Parent, supra note 42 at para 149. 93 See for example: Lewis and Lewis, supra note 38 at para 14; R v Bernard, 2017 NSSC 129 at para 43.246 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C The frank discussions that go into Gladue reports can bring to light crucial information that might otherwise remain undiscovered, such as an accused's Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.95 In RDF , for instance, an Indigenous youth's mother admitted to a Gladue report writer that she had consumed significant amounts of alcohol during her pregnancy with the accused whereas she had previously denied any prenatal alcohol use during her telephone interviews with court experts.96 One of those experts later testified that it would not be unusual for a mother to be less than forthcoming about alcohol use during pregnancy due to feelings of guilt, shame, or fear.97 It appears that the accused in RDF would not have been diagnosed without this candid admission from his mother.98 Nevertheless, sentencing judges have found deficiencies in some Gladue reports, just as they have in some pre-sentence reports. Some Gladue reports put before the courts have been criticized for verging on advocacy, employing leading questions, taking a \"cut-and-paste\" approach, or otherwise lacking in objectivity or specificity.99 Some information provided via Gladue reports has been given little to no weight when inconsistencies with other evidence went unaddressed or the subject's self-reporting on contested topics went uncorroborated.100 This could reflect a lack of national standards or varying approaches from one writer or agency to the next.101 If nothing else, it underlines why the sentencing judge and counsel play key roles in assessing, clarifying, and supplementing the record regardless of the particular source of case- specific information in any given case. 95 See: Okimaw, supra note 81 at para 2017 ABCA 396 at para R v Milligan, 2018 at v Taniskishayinew, 2018 at SKQB 96 at paras 26-41, rev'd in part on other grounds 2020 SKCA 52; Head, supra note 65 at para 15. 96 R v RDF, 2019 SKCA 112 at paras 121, 126, 130, 197-201. 97 Ibid at para 198. 98 Ibid at para 200. 99 See for example: Lawson, supra note 22 at para 33; R v Soloway, 2012 ABQB 554 at v Land, 2013 ONSC 6526 at para R v 2013 at ABCA at para 24; Head, supra note 65 at para 37. 101 See Gamble, supra note 26 at paras 31, 34-35, 45-50, 74-77.247 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 The obligations placed on sentencing judges In keeping with the Supreme Court of Canada's guidance, appellate courts have often emphasized that s 718.2(e) imposes an affirmative statutory duty on sentencing judges to consider the unique circumstances of any Indigenous person appearing before them.102 Crown and defence counsel have their own obligations to place sufficient case-specific information before the court, but when they fail to do so adequately the sentencing judge will be obliged to take further action, such as requesting that additional evidence be adduced via witness testimony.103 Likewise, judicial notice can play a more pronounced role when the record before the sentencing judge has gaps with respect to an Indigenous person's unique circumstances.104 According to the Alberta Court of Appeal in Okimaw, the sentencing judge's duty to consider case-specific information and how it impacts an Indigenous person's moral blameworthiness is a responsibility that cannot be delegated to either a Gladue report writer or to counsel for the parties.105 This is also reflected in Anderson, where the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized that it is the judge alone who is constitutionally obliged to craft a proportionate sentence for an Indigenous person that accounts for their unique circumstances.106 This duty is one that must not be conflated with the distinct roles that counsel play in sentencing: It is the judge's responsibility to impose sentence; likewise, it is the judge's responsibility, within the applicable legal parameters, to craft a proportionate sentence. If a mandatory minimum regime requires a judge to impose a disproportionate sentence, the regime should be challenged.107 This onerous duty placed upon sentencing judges under s 718.2(e) requires close scrutiny of the information set out in the reports before 102 See for example: Kakekagamick, supra note 71 at paras 3 at note para 32; Wolfleg, note 25 at para 61. 104 See for example: R v Wilson, 2018 BCSC 1405 at paras 76-81; R v Stevens, 2020 para 30. 105 Okimaw, supra note 81 at para 66.

They cited various studies and reports as a basis for the substantive content of this judicial notice in Gladue and Ipeelee. These judicially noticed facts are the very antithesis of case-specific information within the Gladue analysis, but the topic still warrants attention here in order to explore how courts have drawn links between the Supreme Court's generalizable statements and the individualized, case-specific information before them in any given matter. In Ipeelee, the Supreme Court encouraged lower courts not to hesitate in taking judicial notice of contextual factors, but clarified how they serve to provide a framework for deeper understanding and analysis of case- specific information.110 In doing so, lower courts have at times drawn on more precise factual conclusions in the reports of past commissions of inquiry when addressing how systemic and background factors cast light on the adjudicative facts before them.111 They have not always limited themselves to the specific reports before the Supreme Court in Gladue and Ipeelee either.112 Some judges have also followed the Supreme 108 Kakekagamick, supra note 71 at note 19 at para 4. 110 Ipeelee, supra note 15 at para 60. A similar approach to distinguishing between social facts and adjudicative facts regarding Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder can be found in R v Ramsay, 2012 ABCA 257. 111 See for example R v Paulson, 2020 ONCJ 86 at para 32, citing \"False Assumptions and a Failed Relationship\" in Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal People, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: Looking Forward, Looking Back, vol 1 (Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada, 1996). 112 See for example TLC, supra note 42 at paras 64-67, citing Canada, National Inquiry 249 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 Court's lead by relying on academic publications to accomplish this task.113 Others have made more general reference to concepts within the social sciences that appear to corroborate the social facts judicially noticed in the Gladue analysis, perhaps to point out potential avenues for counsel to explore in the factual record in future cases or simply to further corroborate these judicially noticed facts.114 In some cases, sentencing judges have referenced information sources such as up-to-date statistics, academic literature, or government reports addressing either the current state of Indigenous over-incarceration or circumstances of specific Indigenous communities.115 Likewise, in cases where sentencing judges regularly sit in Indigenous communities, this could enrich their ability to take judicial notice of generalizable local circumstances and available sentencing options.116 However, this kind of generalizable firsthand knowledge does not displace the need for individualized information about the particular Indigenous person who is before the court for sentencing.117 These cases appear to reflect the general principle that sentencing proceedings can be more informal and broader in scope than trials, and the strict rules of evidence do not apply in this context.118 However, the greater latitude afforded to judicial notice in sentencing proceedings will still be constrained by the parties' respective procedural fairness rights.119 into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (Ottawa: 2019). 113 See for example R v Drysdale, 2016 SKQB 312 at para 3, citing David Milward, \"The Sentencing of Aboriginal Accused with FASD: A Search for Different Pathways\" (2014) 47 UBC L Rev 1025 [Drysdale]. 114 See for example: R v BR, 2016 MBPC 74 at para 23; R v JW, 2017 NWTTC 20 at para R v Schafer, 2019 at v MLC, See 2010 at at R v Moore, 2018 NSPC at McKay, 2020 SKPC 24 at paras 42-43; R v James, 2020 YKCA 11 at para 37; R v Kapolak, 2020 NWTTC 12 at paras 66, 69-70. 116 NUCA 2020 QCCQ 2668 Ehaloak, NUCA 4 at paras 43-45. 118 R v 2002 ABCA 44 at para 25, citing Gardiner, supra note 1.

In Sim, Justice Sharpe of the Ontario Court of Appeal characterized this directive as \"requir[ing] the criminal justice system to alter its procedure and adopt a more inquisitorial approach when sentencing an aboriginal offender\".120 The Alberta Court of Appeal appears to echo this view when stating that \"[t]here is no onus on the offender to bring his aboriginal person circumstances into the framework of relevance for sentencing purposes\", pointing out that \"[t]hese facts can be relevant in more than one way and even judicial notice is available\".121 On the other hand, several appellate decisions have still insisted that sentencing remains adversarial in context to s 718.2(e) and counsel still bear \"the primary responsibility for assembling the evidence\".122 More broadly, the role of the sentencing judge is that of \"a neutral, passive arbiter\" and sentencing hearings are \"basically adversarial\".123 In light of this, the obligations imposed on sentencing judges under s 718.2(e) should not be seen as a call for judicial advocacy. Instead, as noted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Shanoss, \"[w]hat matters is that a judge has an adequate record\".124 As a matter of basic practice, sentencing judges may need to ask if the individuals before them identify as Indigenous in order to know if they are entitled to an exploration of their unique circumstances under s 718.2(e).125 In Whitstone, Justice Zuk of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench heard an appeal from a self-represented Indigenous woman who had been sentenced without any explicit consideration of her unique circumstances. Neither the Crown nor defence counsel alerted the sentencing judge to the fact that she was Indigenous, although it was made clear that she was a resident of Thunderchild First Nation.126 The Court held that her residency 120 R v Sim (2005), [2006] 2 CNLR 298, 2005 CanLII 37586 (Ont CA) at 25 [Sim]. 121 See: v Crazyboy, 2012 ABCA at para 32 [Crazyboy]; R v Laboucane, 2016 ABCA 176 at para 71, leave to appeal to SCC refused 37177 (22 December 2016) [Laboucane]. 122 R v Bonnetrouge, 2017 NWTCA 1 at para 24 [Bonnetrouge]. See v Edmonds, 2012 ABCA 340 at para 15; R v Heiney, 2018 BCCA 313 at para 48 [Heiney]. 123 R Hamilton, [2004] OJ (QL), 2004 CanLII 5549 249 at 125 See: at 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 \"ought to have drawn the sentencing judge's attention to enquiring if Ms. Whitstone was of aboriginal ancestry\".127 Yet even in cases where this is less obvious, Justice Zuk concluded that a sentencing judge's duty under s 718.2(e) extends to making inquiries to determine whether the person they are sentencing is Indigenous.128 While it would be reasonable to expect counsel to make the courts aware of this basic fact in most cases, counsel's failure to do so did not relieve the sentencing judge of his own duty to make this determination in Whitstone.129 As for playing a more proactive role, it is worth recalling the Supreme Court's caution in Wells that the analysis under s 718.2(e) does not transform the sentencing judge into a board of inquiry. Placing this in context, Mr. Wells unsuccessfully argued before the Alberta Court of Appeal that it was an error in principle for the sentencing judge to fail to make further inquiries beyond the pre-sentence report.130 In support of this position, he cited the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench decision in Hunter, where it was held that a sentencing judge has the statutory power to compel the Crown to investigate and report back on a First Nation's social conditions in furtherance of s 718.2(e).131 The Court of Appeal clarified that the power to compel this kind of inquiry is permissive rather than mandatory, and it could not have been Parliament's intention for sentencing judges to make inquiries of their own initiative in every proceeding involving an Indigenous person.132 Clearly there is a limit to the interventions expected of sentencing judges under s 718.2(e), with the investigation ordered in Hunter setting a high water mark. Nevertheless, courts often have taken an active role in ensuring they have sufficient information before them to fulfill the requisite analysis under s 718.2(e). In Reid, for example, the British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed a Heiltsuk man's appeal from sentence on the strength of fresh evidence that the Court of Appeal requested in support of a conditional sentence being served in the community of Bella Bella.133 The Court noted that the sentencing judge had been alive to deficiencies in the information before him, but he did not appear to have turned his 127 Ibid at para 36. 128 Ibid at para 37. 129 Ibid at para 36. 130 R v Wells, 1998 ABCA 109 at paras 58-62 [Wells ABCA]. 131 R R v Reid, 2002 BCCA 268.252 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C mind to whether he should make further inquiries to explore the Bella Bella community's willingness to consider Mr. Reid as a candidate for a community-based sentence, or whether he had taken steps to overcome his addiction in support of such a disposition.134 The Court of Appeal itself was not satisfied with the level of information placed before it on appeal so it requested that appellate counsel make further inquiries of the Heiltsuk community and it gave significant weight to the results of these further inquiries in its final disposition.135 In difficult cases sentencing judges may find they need more information than what is available in a pre-sentence report or a Gladue report. In Drysdale, for instance, Justice Zarzeczny of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench was faced with sentencing an Indigenous man convicted of assault who had a lengthy criminal record, significant Gladue factors, and cognitive and physical impairments that included FASD.136 After a three-day sentencing hearing, the Court imposed a further custodial sentence of 45 days beyond time served followed by three years' probation on the basis that Mr. Drysdale's risk of recidivism would be best managed in the community.137 Justice Zarzeczny came to this decision only after hearing from witnesses called by both Crown and defence counsel regarding programs and sentencing options in custody and in the community, in addition to the information set out in a comprehensive Gladue report before the court.138 These examples are clearly less interventionist than the inquiries that were first made in Hunter and later argued for in Wells. They may demonstrate how sentencing judges can actively mediate the depth and breadth of case-specific information before them without transforming the proceeding into something akin to a commission of inquiry. Assessing the adequacy of Gladue information The sentencing judge's function is most often that of a gatekeeper with respect to Gladue information. Ultimately, it is their obligation to assess both categories of circumstances identified in Gladue. It is therefore 134 Ibid at para 17. 135 Ibid at para 2. 136 Drysdale, supra note 113. 137 Ibid at paras 69, 72, 75. 138 Ibid at paras Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 \"axiomatic that, in conducting such an evaluation, the sentencing judge must have access to the necessary information\".139 If they proceed without sufficiently detailed information regarding an Indigenous person's individual background and circumstances that speak to their moral blameworthiness then this may invite appellate scrutiny.140 Likewise, crafting a sentence without access to information with respect to the availability and practicality of any culturally relevant sanctions and procedures could constitute an error in principle as well.141 Sentencing judges are directed to identify any shortcomings in the information before them, and to order supplementary reports or call for further viva voce evidence as needed.142 Since they are the ones who are ultimately obliged to craft a sentence with s 718.2(e) in mind, they are well-positioned to assess whether they have adequate \"individualized information\" with an appropriate \"richness of detail\" to accomplish this task.143 In support of this gatekeeping function, some members of the judiciary have developed detailed checklists and questions that sentencing judges should be able to answer in order to craft a proportionate sentence for an Indigenous person. For instance, Judge Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan (as she then was) provided a detailed list of factors to consider in an article published in the Criminal Law Quarterly in 2000, which has since been cited by courts across the country: A. Is the offender an Aboriginal person? \"Aboriginal person\" is defined according to s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, as being Indian, Metis (of mixed ancestry) or Inuit. If the answer is yes, determine what community or band the defendant is from. Does the defendant reside in a rural area, on a reserve or settlement land, or in an urban centre? B. What unique circumstances have played a part in bringing this offender before the courts? The sentencing judge must consider some of the following issues/factors and query counsel or unrepresented offenders. 139 Peepeetch, supra note 38 at para 40. 140 See for example Wolfleg, supra note 25 at paras 50, 81, 113, 115, 119. 141 See for example R v Macintyre-Syrette, 2018 ONCA 259 at paras 2, 14, 19-24 [Macintyre-Syrette]. note 141 para supra THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C has this offender been affected by substance abuse in the community? has this offender been affected by poverty? has this offender been affected by overt racism? has this offender been affected by family or community breakdown? has this offender been affected by unemployment, low income and a lack of employment opportunity? has this offender been affected by dislocation from an Aboriginal community, loneliness and community fragmentation? A pre-sentence or pre-disposition report might be of great benefit to the court in canvassing some of these issues. In order to sensibly ask these questions, it is helpful if counsel, or the judge as the case may be, understands the historical and societal context of these questions. For example, has a community been relocated? Has a significant proportion of the Aboriginal community moved to urban centres? Have many of the members of this community been affected by abuses at Residential Schools? What are the reasons for these developments? Many of these issues have been thoroughly studied by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, the reports from which are a valuable educational resource for those unfamiliar with the broader context.144 In Laliberte, Justice Vancise of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal cited this same article with approval and articulated a very similar framework that has since been adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal: 1) Whether the offender is aboriginal, that is, someone who comes within the scope of s. 25 of the Charter and s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982; 2) What band or community or reserve the offender comes from and whether the offender lives on or off the reserve or in an urban or rural setting. This information should also include particulars of the treatment facilities, the existence of a justice committee, and any alternative measures or community-based programs. 144 See R v Watts, 2016 ABPC 57 at para 63, citing Judge Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, \"Sentencing within a Restorative Justice Paradigm: Procedural Implications of R v Gladue\" (2000) 43 CLQ 34.

Within this heading it would be useful for the Court to determine whether or not crime prevention can be better served by principles of restorative justice or by imprisonment. 5) What sentencing options exist in the community at large and in the offender's community. For example, does an alternative measures program exist in the offender's community if he lives on a reserve?145 Finally, Judge Whalen of the Nova Scotia Provincial Court has provided her own detailed list of questions that sentencing judges ought to be in a position to answer in Rose: (i) Does the community support the offender and think that he/she is capable of change? (ii) What are the main social issues affecting the community? (iii) How has the community addressed those issues? (iv) Is there a willingness and capability of the community to assume responsibility for providing restorative approaches to criminal behaviour? (v) Does the community have a program or tradition of alternative sanctions? (vi) What culturally relevant alternatives to incarceration can be set in place that are healing for the offender and all others involved, including the community as a whole? (vii) Does the community have resources to assist in supervision of the offender? (viii) What is the offender's understanding of and willingness to participate in traditional Aboriginal justice, whether through the identified Aboriginal community or local First Nations support agencies? (ix) What mainstream/non-traditional healing resources are available to the offender? 145 Laliberte, supra note 144 para 15.256 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C (x) What is the quality of the offender's relationship with family and extended family? (xi) Who comprises the offender's support network: spiritual, cultural, family, community?146 In addition to these lists, guidance on how to assess the adequacy of the case-specific information in the record can be found in cases where courts have closely scrutinized pre-sentence reports or Gladue reports to determine whether further information was needed. To date, this has most often occurred in cases where an application is made to admit a Gladue report as fresh evidence on appeal.147 However, a similar analysis can be found in cases where courts canvass whether supplementary reports ought to be ordered prior to the sentencing of an Indigenous person.148 In Legere , for instance, the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal carefully contrasted the contents of a pre-sentence report against those of a Gladue report.149 It concluded that the court below erred in sentencing a Mi'kmaw man without adequate information regarding his unique circumstances. The pre-sentence report was \"detailed and apparently thorough\", it canvassed his Indigenous heritage and connection, and it provided \"a snap shot of Legere's unhappy life\".150 However, it failed to address the unique systemic or background factors that played a role in bringing Mr. Legere before the courts, and it also failed to detail the \"particular programming which may be appropriate to this Aboriginal offender\".151 A Gladue report was therefore admitted as fresh evidence. This report canvassed the harms done to Mr. Legere's mother by the residential school system and other policies, the effects of inter- generational and multi-generational trauma, and how these all were linked to his mother's alcoholism and his own pain and suffering.152 The Court of Appeal further noted that the Gladue report writer spoke to counsellors and employment opportunities in the Mi'kmaq community on Lennox Island, interviewing several community members as well as Mr. Legere's non-Indigenous relatives.153 In contrast, the only members 146 R v Rose, 2013 NSPC 99 at para 31. 147 See supra note 71; Zoe, note 71. 148 See for example R v Karau, 2014 ONCJ 207. 149 Legere, supra note paras 153 23.257 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 of the Indigenous community that the pre-sentence report's authors had spoken to were Mr. Legere himself and his brother.154 The Alberta Court of Appeal provides similar guidance in Wolfleg.155 A Gladue report was admitted as fresh evidence to fill informational gaps in the materials before the court below, including a pre-sentence report.156 The Gladue report canvassed historical and contemporary issues facing Mr. Wolfleg's community in detail.157 It also addressed the continuing inter-generational trauma his immediate family has suffered, including abuse in residential schools, racism and further abuse in non-residential schools, sexual abuse in the family, domestic violence, his father's incarceration, and physical and emotional violence from his brother.158 In contrast, the information in the pre-sentence report before the Court of Appeal was described as cursory and incomplete, failing to address the historical, systemic, background, and individual circumstances that the sentencing judge needed to properly assess Mr. Wolfleg's moral blameworthiness.159 In Macintyre-Syrette, the Ontario Court of Appeal provides guidance on the level of information needed to assess alternative sanctions and procedures.160 It held that the court below erred by proceeding in spite of gaps in the materials, which included both a pre-sentence report and a Gladue report.161 The Court of Appeal took issue with the Gladue report's recommendations being prepared without interviewing anyone outside the accused's own family.162 Nor was there any indication of engagement of the broader community, or any explanation for this omission.163 Without these details, the sentencing judge could not possibly understand with any specificity what might be done \"to promote reconciliation within that community and other goals of restorative justice\".164 Both reports indicated the community was divided over the accused yet failed to 154 Ibid. 155 Wolfleg, supra note 25. 156 Ibid para 159 Ibid at para 112. 160 Macintyre-Syrette, supra note 141. 161 Ibid at para 19. 162 Ibid at para 21. at para 21. 164 Ibid.258 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C address how he might reconcile himself with his First Nation.165 The Court of Appeal anticipated a more detailed proposal that thoroughly addressed the specific institutions and ceremonies in the community, the individuals who would need to be involved, and any relevant community practices that might reconcile Mr. Macintyre-Syrette with his community.166 One challenge courts face in assessing the adequacy of the record is that these evidentiary gaps are not always apparent without the benefit of hindsight once a more detailed report is admitted as fresh evidence on appeal.167 However, appellate guidance can still assist at first instance, as demonstrated in the reasons for decision of Justice Kalmakoff of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench (as he then was) in Peepeetch.168 In addressing an application for a court order for a state-funded Gladue report, Justice Kalmakoff closely scrutinized the pre-sentence report already before him. This report canvassed personal information, including references to Mr. Peepeetch's family and significant current relationships, his health history, his education and employment history, and his criminal record.169 It also touched on his First Nations ancestry, briefly mentioned his mother's attendance at residential school, and discussed his experiences of being subjected to racism.170 However, it failed to \"venture much below the surface with respect to any of the areas particular to Mr. Peepeetch's Aboriginal heritage\", providing little detail about his childhood and failing to explore either the intergenerational impact of his mother's residential school experience or the history and pattern of alcohol abuse and drinking and driving in his family.171 It also failed to provide details regarding the resources available in the First Nations to which Mr. Peepeetch is connected or to give any insight on how they might form part of a viable sentencing alternative.172 Each of these cases makes it abundantly clear that an Indigenous person's unique circumstances need to be given sustained and in-depth attention within sentencing proceedings. However, the level of detail 165 Ibid at para 22. 166 Ibid at para 23. 167 See for example Chickekoo, supra note 71 at para 12. 168 Peepeetch, supra note 38. 169 Ibid at para 47. 170 Ibid at para 48. 171 Ibid at para 49. 172 Ibid.259 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 required may vary depending on the context.173 Likewise, in at least some jurisdictions, appellate courts have been reluctant to adopt the same exacting standards set out in the cases summarized above.174 This may reflect an ongoing dialogue between the judicial and executive branches of government in light of the fiscal implications of deeper access to case- specific information.175 Case law that has emerged to date with respect to state obligations will be addressed later in this chapter. Addressing waiver of case-specific information If an Indigenous accused does not wish to have detailed, individualized information regarding their unique circumstances collected and presented to the court, they are entitled to waive this right so long as the waiver is \"express and on the record\".176 According to the Ontario Court of Appeal, waiver must be \"clear and unequivocal, made with full knowledge of the right that is surrendered and of the effect of waiver of that right\".177 These safeguards reflect the general principle that applies whenever a party waives a procedural right enacted for their benefit.178 This gives rise to yet another gatekeeping role for sentencing judges as they may have a paramount right to \"require compliance notwithstanding a desire to waive\", and it will ultimately be up to them to determine what safeguards must be respected \"in order to protect the certainty and the integrity of the judicial process\".179 At a minimum, sentencing judges ought to clarify whether reliance on Gladue circumstances has been intentionally waived rather than presuming this to be so based on the limited attention they may be paid by counsel.180 173 See for example Chapter 13 for a summary of case law addressing the application of the Gladue principles in bail hearings and the need for a more flexible approach to case- specific information in that specific context. 174 See for example: R v Bennett, 2017 NLCA 41 at paras 28-36 37 24-25 [Jackson]. 175 See 88 at para [Perley ]. 176 Kakekagamick, supra note 71 at para 44. 177 R v Pelletier, 2012 ONCA 566 at para 142. 178 Ibid, citing Korponay v Canada (Attorney General), [1982] 1 SCR 41 at 49, 1982 CanLII 12 [Korponay]. 179 Korponay, supra note 178 at 48. 180 See for example: Park, supra note 70 at paras 28, 47; Bennett, at paras 20-22, 26, 68.260 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Sentencing judges should also clarify whether an Indigenous accused wishes to waive their right to have a full Gladue report prepared rather than entirely waiving their right to have their unique circumstances considered under s 718.2(e). In Gilliland, the British Columbia Court of Appeal found that a sentencing judge erred by failing to distinguish between waiver of the consideration of (1) the systemic factors that affect Indigenous people generally and (2) case-specific, individualized information.181 When only the latter right has been waived, the sentencing judge must still take judicial notice of the former.182 Mr. Gilliland waived the preparation of an individualized Gladue report but still provided the sentencing judge with detailed submissions on his life experiences. The Court of Appeal held that these submissions therefore needed to be reviewed against the broader social facts that are subject to judicial notice under s 718.2(e).183 Other appellate courts have likewise held that a sentencing judge's obligation to consider case-specific information and apply s 718.2(e) persists even when the accused waives the preparation of a Gladue report.184 In Matchee, for example, the Alberta Court of Appeal held that the sentencing judge erred by failing to recognize the connection between Mr. Matchee's circumstances and the attendance of his mother and grandmother at residential schools.185 While Mr. Matchee waived his right to have a Gladue report prepared, the Court of Appeal nevertheless found his moral blameworthiness to be diminished based on the Gladue factors canvassed in a pre-sentence report before the sentencing judge at first instance.186 Waiver of the preparation of a full Gladue report clearly did not relieve the sentencing judge of the need to give s 718.2(e) a robust application in any event. Sentencing judges are thus placed in a challenging position of having to reconcile their duty to craft a fit and proportionate sentence\u2014which requires attention to an Indigenous person's unique circumstances\u2014with the right of the accused to make strategic choices, often motivated by time constraints. Many sentencing judges explicitly address whether sufficient information is available by other means or whether other circumstances 181 Gilliland, supra note 6 at paras 14-15. 182 Ibid at Kanatsiak QCCS, supra note 104 at paras 98-108. 184 See for example: R v ERC, 2016 MBCA 74; R v House, 2016 ABCA 414 at 10; Matchee, supra 186 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 explain the waiver, making it transparent that the choice was an informed one.187 Where there is no formal waiver but the accused declines to cooperate with the preparation of a Gladue report, a similar approach can provide transparency as to why sentencing proceeded in its absence.188 In some cases, a sentencing judge might go a step further by requesting that a Gladue report still be prepared out of an abundance of caution, effectively overriding the accused's election.189 However, the Supreme Court and several appellate courts have all confirmed that an Indigenous person is entitled to waive the consideration of their case-specific information so long as the waiver is clear, informed, and on the record.190 Ensuring adequacy of reasons for sentence One further consideration with respect to the sufficiency of case-specific information before the court will be how this record clarifies and buttresses their reasons for sentence. Appellate courts take a functional approach when reviewing the adequacy of reasons, examining a lower court's reasons in context to the record and submissions that were before them.191 Less detailed reasons may be acceptable where there is an extensive evidentiary record that still permits meaningful appellate review.192 When an appeal is heard with respect to the application of s 718.2(e), an appellate court therefore reviews the reasons for sentence in light of the submissions and all other sources of case-specific information before the court, including any Gladue reports or pre-sentence reports.193 This is not to say that an extensive record will be sufficient without more. In Gladue, the Supreme Court merely urged sentencing judges to provide \"at least brief reasons\" that explain how they have paid attention 187 See for example: R v ONM, SM & CWS, 2011 at 803 at paras 42-45; R v Simpson, 2019 ABQB supra Decaire, 2020 ABPC 25 at para 11. 188 See for example R v Louie, 2018 BCSC 937 at paras 9-10. 189 See for example Jackson, supra note 174 at paras 27-30, 36. 190 Ibid. 191 R v REM, 2008 51 at 37-41 para v Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board, 2007 SCC 41 at para 101. 193 See for example R v Good, 2012 YKCA 2 at paras 25-33.262 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C to the circumstances of Indigenous people, finding no statutory duty to do so.194 Yet in Ipeelee the Court revisited this topic by endorsing appellate intervention when the sentencing judge fails to give \"tangible consideration\" to an Indigenous person's circumstances in their reasons, indicating reasons may no longer be optional.195 Many appellate decisions have since insisted that sentencing judges must explicitly address Indigenous people's unique circumstances in their reasons, as well as how systemic and background factors contributed to them.196 This can ensure fair and accurate decision-making by directing their attention to salient issues in the analysis.197 Nevertheless, having comprehensive Gladue information in the record still plays a key part in ensuring reasons for sentence are intelligible and transparent, thereby facilitating meaningful review on appeal.198 And the intended audience of a judge's reasons extends beyond appellate courts and the parties to the broader public or community at large.199 As the Alberta Court of Appeal points out in Wolfleg, comprehensive Gladue information can play a role in fostering reconciliation in the latter regard: Proper application of Gladue principles by sentencing judges serves the broader public interest, by ensuring transparent judicial method. Moreover, this court's insistence on the proper application of Gladue principles in all sentencing matters involving Aboriginal offenders is essential to ensuring meaningful appellate review of sentences involving Aboriginal offenders. Fidelity to the values underpinning these public interest objectives is instrumental to the advancement of reconciliation with all Indigenous peoples.200 194 Gladue, supra note 2 at para 85. 195 Ipeelee, supra note 15 at para 95. 196 See for para 35; note 121 at para 5. 197 REM, supra note 191 at para 12. 198 See for example: R v Anderson, 2018 MBCA 42 at 191 at paras 12-13, 37. 200 Wolfleg, supra note 25 101.263 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 The obligations placed on counsel for both parties The case law to date also provides guidance on the respective parts played by Crown and defence counsel in amassing case-specific information before the court. It has been clear since the Gladue decision that \"counsel on both sides\" share in this obligation.201 Many appellate decisions have since echoed this basic directive, emphasizing that the Crown, the defence bar, and other agencies in the criminal justice system must all work to ensure adequate Gladue information is available to the court.202 This may suggest that a more inquisitorial approach to s 718.2(e) is appropriate in the sentencing process.203 However, in Wells, the Supreme Court situated the roles of Crown and defence counsel in adducing case- specific information within \"our adversarial system of criminal law\".204 For this reason it may be worth examining the respective obligations of Crown counsel and defence separately, at least to the extent possible based on the limited direction on this topic in the case law to date. Crown counsel The role of the prosecution in implementing s 718.2(e) may be best understood in context to the special role the Crown plays in the overall administration of criminal justice. The Crown's paramount function in a criminal proceeding has been described as a quasi-judicial one in the sense that the Crown must assist the court in the furtherance of justice rather than simply striving for a conviction.205 While this precludes the adoption of \"a purely adversarial role towards the defence\", it is still anticipated that Crown counsel will be strong advocates and pursue legitimate results to the best of their ability.206 In other words, the Crown plays a \"dual role as both advocate and minister of justice\" and must balance strong advocacy against this overriding, quasi-judicial 201 Gladue, supra note 2 at para 83. 202 Laliberte, supra note 144 at para 58. See also: R v CP and JA, 2009 NBCA 65 at para 6; Park, supra note 70 at para 31. 203 Sim, supra note 120 at para 25. 204 Wells, supra note 14 at para 54 [emphasis added]. 205 Boucher v The Queen (1954), [1955] SCR 16 at 22-25, 1954 CanLII 3; R v Roberts [1973] OJ No 932 (QL), 14 CCC (2d) 368 (CA) at 370. 206 R v Cook, [1997] 1 SCR 1113, 1997 CanLII 392 at para 21.264 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C purpose.207 As ministers of justice, prosecutors have \"a duty to ensure that the criminal justice system operates fairly to victims of crime, the public and the accused\".208 Among other things, they must do whatever is reasonably required to assist the sentencing judge in avoiding error.209 With these principles in mind it is not surprising to find the Crown assisting the court by presenting case-specific information in support of the Gladue analysis in many cases. As a strong advocate within an adversarial system, the Crown may wish to adduce case-specific information to bolster its own position. For example, filling gaps in the record with respect to Gladue information could help ensure the Crown's expert evidence is as reliable as possible in the sense of properly accounting for these circumstances.210 More generally, whenever Crown counsel accounts for an Indigenous person's circumstances in their submissions on sentence this could support their position as being fair, balanced, reasonable, and persuasive.211 Detailed case-specific information also helps justify joint submissions on sentence.212 Likewise, when the Crown is pursuing an adult sentence for an Indigenous young person, or a dangerous offender or long-term offender designation, they may wish to present evidence of any culturally relevant programming in particular institutions or the community in furtherance of the evidentiary burdens placed on them in these specific sentencing contexts.213 While an Indigenous accused often has an interest in submitting similar evidence, the Crown has its own independent responsibility to ensure a complete evidentiary record in each sentencing proceeding.214 207 See for example: R 2015 at R v Ahmed, 2015 ONCA 751 at para 39. 208 R v Sohi, 2005 CanLII 16599 para 209 R v Kravchenko, 2020 MBCA 30 at para 39. 210 See for example R v Lewis, 2012 ONSC 5085 at paras 85-95. 211 See for 2017 877 at para 9; R v Huskins, 2018 ABPC 227 at paras 8, 23. 212 See for example McInnis, supra note 102 at paras 58-62, 79, 92-93.

See also the detailed discussions of these topics in Chapters 14 and 15 of this book. 214 R v Montgrand, 2014 SKCA 31 at para 17.265 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 There are practical limits on the Crown's ability to investigate an Indigenous person's individual circumstances. Most notably, they will not have access to the accused in the same way that defence counsel is in a position to directly elicit case-specific information from their client and others within their support network. Yet, as the Alberta Court of Appeal has pointed out in Crazyboy, the Gladue analysis requires both an inquiry into the individual's circumstances and an inquiry into the circumstances of their community, and this case-specific information can be relevant in many ways rather than being solely of interest to defence counsel.215 As the Crown has obligations to victims and the broader public, they will be well-suited to assist with an inquiry into community circumstances. As one example, the circumstances of Indigenous victims can have some relevance to the Gladue analysis.216 Several cases have suggested that victim and community impact statements contribute to the court's understanding of Indigenous community perspectives, giving the Crown impetus to seek out this form of case-specific information in support of s 718.2(e).217 The Crown can also canvass culturally relevant programming available in custody so the court is fully apprised of all available sentencing options.218 While Gladue information can often support Crown counsel's role as advocate, their duty to facilitate a complete record of case-specific information is often treated as an overriding obligation more in line with their role as a minister of justice.219 As noted earlier in this chapter, one of the earliest interpretations of s 718.2(e)'s procedural implications was provided by Judge Reilly of the Alberta Provincial Court (as he then was) in Hunter, where he relied on this provision to order Crown counsel to investigate and report back on the social conditions of the Stoney reserve at Morley, Alberta.220 In Kakekagamick, Justice Laforme of the Ontario 215 Crazyboy, supra note 121 at para 32, citing R v Gladue, 2012 ABCA 118 at para 6. 216 See for example: R v Ledesma, 2012 ABPC 10 at para 39; YKTC supra Chanalquay, 2015 SKCA 141 at para 43. 217 See for example: R v Flett, 2005 MBCA 61 at para BCSC Paul, supra note 36 at R v Alec, 2016 BCCA 347 at para R v Fisher, 2017 at paras R v Hawk, 2012 at para QCCS 5938 at paras 212. 219 Blanchard, supra note 24 at para 25; Sand, supra note 49 at paras 2, 32-33. 220 R v Hunter (1997), supra note 131, aff 'd 1998 ABCA 141. See further discussion in Chapter 6 of how this precedent came to be indirectly addressed in the Wells decision.266 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Court of Appeal concluded that \"[c]ounsel and perhaps especially the Crown\" could and should have addressed the inadequacy of the pre- sentence report before the court with respect to Gladue information in that matter.221 Similarly, when the Ontario Court of Appeal has found the need to obtain supplementary Gladue reports on appeal, their orders have been directed to the Crown rather than defence counsel.222 Furthermore, in FL, Judge Ray of the Ontario Superior Court flatly rejected the argument that Gladue reports are solely the responsibility of the defence as they pertain to mitigating factors.223 Instead, he held that \"[t]he Crown, as the representative of the state, has a vested interest in not only ensuring that a defendant is treated fairly, but also in ensuring that Gladue Reports are available to sentencing judges when appropriate\".224 Some appellate courts have gone a step further by characterizing the adequacy of Gladue information before the sentencing judge as an issue that speaks to trial fairness in and of itself.225 More generally, if Crown prosecutors are obliged to assist the court in avoiding errors, they will have a readily apparent interest in ensuring sentencing judges are aware of all their obligations under s 718.2(e), as summarized earlier in this chapter. This could mean letting the court know that the individual being sentenced self-identifies as Indigenous, pointing out gaps or deficiencies within the information before the court regarding their unique circumstances, and ensuring that waiver of any rights pursuant to s 718.2(e) is properly addressed on the record rather than assumed. The public interest is not likely to be served by otherwise avoidable appeals on such bases. The Crown can also test and clarify the facts that are set out in Gladue reports and pre-sentence reports before the court so the sentencing judge knows what can be relied upon in crafting a sentence.226 Where the Crown fails to facilitate an adequate record for the Gladue analysis, this could lead to remedies being issued in favour of the accused. In Carratt, for instance, Justice Klebuc of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench (as he then was) suggested a stay of proceedings could be an effective remedy if the Crown elects not to adduce evidence with 221 Kakekagamick, supra para 223 R v FL, 2014 ONSC 38 at para 3, aff 'd 2018 ONCA 83 [FL]. 224 Ibid.

Defence counsel Defence counsel plays a more intuitive and straightforward role in ensuring adequate Gladue information is before the court whenever an Indigenous person is sentenced. In the adversarial process it is expected that defence counsel will advance their client's best interests. The Gladue analysis requires attention to an Indigenous person's circumstances to determine if their moral blameworthiness is diminished, whether incarceration is a less appropriate or effective sanction for them, and whether restorative sentencing principles might deserve primacy, among other things. It should be self-evident that providing the court with the individualized information it needs to make these inquiries will generally advance the best interests of defence counsel's Indigenous clients. As Justice Danyliuk of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench highlights in Gamble, \"[f ]rom the outset, the role of counsel in providing Gladue information about their clients to the court was seen as an active and 227 R v Carratt, 1999 SKQB 116 at paras 30-32. 228 Ibid 32. 229 Perley, supra 175 at 21. 230 Parent, supra note 42.268 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C robust role\".231 Among other things, they can request a Gladue report or a pre-sentence report that canvasses the unique circumstances of their client, they can provide informal information to the court and address these same circumstances by way of submissions, and they can fill gaps in the reports that are made available by \"furnishing the court with the missing pieces\".232 They can also assist by identifying any gaps within a report before the court so the sentencing judge can assess whether a supplemental report is needed.233 Within the adversarial system defence counsel is expected to vigorously advance their client's interest in having their circumstances explored at first instance rather than leaving this for an appeal.234 In contrast to the Crown or the sentencing judge, defence counsel have direct access to their client and may be in a position to develop a rapport that facilitates full and candid disclosure of their background and personal history. They can also advise their client why it might be in their best interests to thoroughly discuss sensitive personal history with pre-sentence and Gladue report writers in advance of these interviews.235 Particularly when sentencing follows a full trial, defence counsel will have spent considerable time with their client when they can be eliciting and collating relevant Gladue information.236 In some cases, counsel may even feel comfortable presenting this information without a pre-sentence report or Gladue report on this basis, and they may advise their client to waive their right to a report to avoid spending further time in remand.237 That said, defence counsel may also need to advise their client that this type of tactical decision can limit their ability to argue s 718.2(e) has been given inadequate consideration should the matter go on appeal.238 When it comes to addressing whether any waiver is informed, defence counsel again play a self-evident role. In sum, defence counsel can help ensure adequate Gladue information is before the court both by contributing to the record with thorough evidence and submissions and by properly advising their client about their own role. 231 Gamble, supra note 26 at paras 55-56, citing Ipeelee, supra note at para 59. at para 58. 233 See for 38 paras 15-18. 234 Heiney, supra note 122 at paras 48.

See also Bonnetrouge, supra note 122 para 24.269 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 The obligations of the state Several judgments highlight that the Gladue analysis requires more than just sustained attention from Crown counsel, defence counsel, and sentencing judges to their respective obligations under s 718.2(e)\u2014it also implicates the resources of provincial and territorial governments and agencies.239 In LLDG, for instance, Justice Monnin of the Manitoba Court of Appeal stated that judges will be unable to discharge their statutory obligations under s 718.2(e) without \"the provincial resources to provide the required information to both counsel and the courts\".240 In Quock, Chief Judge Cozens of the Yukon Territorial Court (as he then was) described Gladue reports as the most efficient means by which case- specific information can be presented to the courts while cautioning that they require sufficient resourcing to make them available as necessary.241 Similarly, Justice Danyliuk of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench pointed out in Sand that if the Government of Saskatchewan maintains their position that probation officers can provide sufficient and timely Gladue information through modified pre-sentence reports, it \"must provide adequate funding and resources to ensure this can be done on an ongoing basis, as the system demands\".242 While these comments all appear to have been made in obiter, they nevertheless provide valuable context for the remedies and procedural protections that have been made available when the state's obligations go unmet. If the state fails to ensure adequate case-specific information is available, one legitimate response could be requesting a court order for a Gladue report prepared at state expense. This is the specific context in which Justice Danyliuk emphasized provincial obligations in Sand. He ultimately dismissed the application for a state-funded Gladue report, finding adequate information was available in the pre-sentence report before the court. However, in doing so, he confirmed that the Court of Queen's Bench has the jurisdiction to order a state-funded, stand-alone Gladue report, either as a necessarily incidental power flowing from s 718.2(e) or based on its inherent jurisdiction as a superior court.243 Sentencing judges in Saskatchewan have since emphasized that this 239 See for example: Corbiere, supra note 21 at supra note 57 at para 35.

In Lewis and Lewis, Judge Challenger of the Provincial Court of British Columbia adopted this approach to avoid prejudice to the interests of the accused from the state's failure to adequately resource the effective and sensitive gathering of case-specific information.246 She highlighted that the pre-sentence reports prepared in that province would gloss over an Indigenous nation or band's post-contact history, provide very little insight into the personal impacts of assimilation policies and the residential school system on the person being sentenced and their family, make only passing reference to community resources, and rarely reflect community views or specific culturally sensitive justice practices.247 Judge Challenger observed that this paucity of information makes the sentencing judge's task more difficult.248 In order to avoid prejudice to the accused, she emphasized the need to assess the limited information before her to draw inferences with respect to moral culpability.249 She also stressed the role of judicial notice in the sense that she would have to draw on her own knowledge of resources in addition to whatever is suggested by counsel in order to craft appropriate restorative, reparative, and rehabilitative terms.250 In some cases the state's failure to make adequate Gladue information available through specialized pre-sentence reports or Gladue reports has led to sentencing judges ordering remedies in favour of the accused. While the decisions to date have contemplated a wider variety of 244 Peepeetch, supra note 38 at para 28; Gamble, supra note 26 at para 59. 245 See Peepeetch, supra note 38 at paras 51-58. 246 Lewis and Lewis, supra note 38 at para 21.

In Knockwood, for example, Justice Hill of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that Quebec's failure to provide for adequate and timely Gladue information rose to the level of state misconduct and entitled Ms. Knockwood to a reduction of her sentence to address the delays she faced as a result.251 After Justice Hill issued an order for a Gladue report to be prepared prior to sentencing Ms. Knockwood, a Mohawk woman from Kahnawake in Quebec, Quebec's probation services advised they did not complete Gladue reports.252 When Justice Hill insisted, the court was provided a four-and-a-half page pre-sentence report written entirely in French for the Anglophone accused, and once translated into English, counsel for both parties agreed it was entirely inadequate and non-compliant.253 After further adjournments a Gladue report was finally prepared by Aboriginal Legal Services.254 In concluding that Quebec's probation services engaged in state misconduct, Justice Hill noted that the Gladue decision was decided over a dozen years prior and Ms. Knockwood suffered stress and upset as a result of these delays.255 In Noble, Judge Joy of the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador suggested the authorities who operate Labrador probation services were \"likely in contempt of a court order\" for providing a form of pre-sentence report entitled \"Pre-Sentence Report (Gladue Perspective)\" in response to a court order for a Gladue report.256 Citing Knockwood, he held that this rose to the level of state misconduct since the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador failed to train probation officers or anyone else to prepare Gladue reports in the wake of Ipeelee, and instead instructed probation officers to change the title of their reports without advising the court of their inadequate training.257 While this systemic issue did not impact the sentencing of Mr. Noble in particular, Judge 251 R v Knockwood, 2012 ONSC 2238 at paras Ibid at paras 50-53.272 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Joy warned that a wide range of remedies would be available to address such state misconduct in the future, \"including significant reduction of sentence, and contempt of court proceedings\".258 In Perley , the New Brunswick Court of Appeal addressed the state's role in context to an application for a stay of proceedings after provincial probation services repeatedly failed to provide adequate case-specific information regarding Ms. Perley, an Indigenous woman. The Court summarized the government's role as follows: In the criminal law context, it is the state that seeks to take away an offender's liberty, whether through imprisonment or by other constraints. It is also the state that has the resources to ensure that information relevant to sentencing is brought before the courts, usually in the form of a pre-sentence report. It is common knowledge that most offenders are represented by legal aid lawyers who do not have resources of the kind available to the state. It would seem to us reasonable to expect that the practice of the state providing resources for the preparation of proper reports to address the Gladue factors, which has evolved in other provinces, should be universally implemented.259 In this case, the sentencing judge had ordered a pre-sentence report for Ms. Perley but it failed to adequately address her unique circumstances as an Indigenous woman.260 When a more fulsome report was subsequently provided, defence counsel argued that it was still insufficient and sought a stay on this basis.261 After hearing expert evidence regarding the preparation of Gladue reports, the sentencing judge was satisfied that Ms. Perley's right to life, liberty, and security of the person under s 7 of the Charter was breached by the Crown's failure to provide the necessary information.262 Ms. Perley's request for a stay was denied but the court eliminated imprisonment from the available options when sentencing her for aggravated assault, suspended the passing of sentence, and imposed a probation order.263 The Court of Appeal held that this was \"the proper outcome in the circumstances\" since the sentencing judge would have erred had he proceeded without \"the detailed requisite information\", and 258 Ibid at para 108. 259 Perley, supra note 175 at para 18. 260 Ibid at para 9. 261 Ibid at para 10. 262 Ibid at para 12. 263 Ibid.273 Chapter 11: The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 he would have also violated the principle of fundamental justice that sentences must be proportionate.264 In Parent, Judge Wakefield of the Ontario Court of Justice stayed various charges against an Indigenous man, including assault and mischief, based on issues faced in obtaining a Gladue report prior to sentencing. Mr. Parent was initially self-represented and when the court first ordered a Gladue report neither he nor the Crown formally requested the report so a second order had to be made at a subsequent appearance.265 After this second order, a letter from a caseworker at Aboriginal Legal Services was brought to the attention of the court advising that a full Gladue report would not be prepared as the Crown was only seeking 30 days' incarceration and full reports are restricted to cases where the Crown's position exceeds 90 days.266 Based on additional charges against Mr. Parent the Crown's position was revised to 120 days and the matter was again adjourned for the preparation of a Gladue report.267 Aboriginal Legal Services then advised that a Gladue report would not be prepared as the specific nature of Mr. Parent's Indigenous ancestry could not be determined.268 At this point, counsel for Mr. Parent brought a successful application for a stay of proceedings. While Aboriginal Legal Services is not an agency within the state, Judge Wakefield held that the procedural failings in this case nevertheless amounted to state misconduct as \"it is the state which funds, is responsible for, and arranges for the Report\".269 A stay was ordered as proceeding with sentencing would have resulted in \"overholding\" Mr. Parent well past any period of custody that the Crown would have requested, among other reasons.270 The state's failure to make sufficient provision for access to Gladue information can also have an impact on an Indigenous person's right to be tried within a reasonable time under s 11(b) of the Charter. In Hartling, the Ontario Court of Appeal addressed this Charter right in context to the province's failure to provide adequate institutional resources for Gladue reports in the Algoma district of Ontario.271 The 264 Ibid at para 20. 265 Parent, supra note 42 at para 4. 266 Ibid at para 267 at para 270 at 167. v Hartling, 2020 ONCA 243 [Hartling].274 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART C Court of Appeal had previously concluded that a delay of five months between verdict and sentence is presumptively unreasonable under the Charter and must be justified by the Crown.272 In this case, the Crown sought to justify a fourteen-month post-verdict delay\u2014almost three times what is considered to be presumptively unreasonable\u2014based on a set of allegedly extraordinary circumstances that included the time it took to secure a Gladue report.273 At the time of his sentencing Mr. Hartling was denied funding for a Gladue report by court administration services on the basis that Aboriginal Legal Services had no Gladue report writers in the Algoma district where the matter was heard.274 He therefore ended up paying for a Gladue report \"privately out of pocket\".275 The Court of Appeal flatly rejected the Crown's submission that this was an exceptional circumstance and it reduced Mr. Hartling's custodial sentence by five months to account for the delay.276 In doing so, the Court emphasized the need for reliable and timely access to Gladue reports: I do not agree that the circumstances are exceptional. It cannot be said that it is exceptional to require a Gladue report in the Algoma district where there is a large Indigenous population. Gladue reports were created in order to address systemic injustice that uniquely affects Indigenous offenders, and which leads to overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. A long delay undermines the purpose of the Gladue report by creating another level of unfairness. Moreover, to submit that the preparation of such a report is exceptional is untenable. The appellant was entitled to a Gladue report, the trial judge ordered it, and subsequently relied on it.277 While the analysis required by s 11(b) of the Charter is distinct from how courts address state misconduct in sentencing, it is similarly focused on either the actions or the inaction of the state in the administration of justice. In essence, it addresses \"whether the state has failed to provide an accused with a trial within a reasonable time as guaranteed by the 272 R v Charley, 2019 ONCA 726 at paras 86-87. 273 Hartling, 275 277 The Need for Case-specific InformationCHAPTER 11 Charter\" and any remedies associated with this right are therefore \"a rebuke to state action\".278 In the words of Justice Cromwell (as he then was) in Jordan, s 11(b) requires the judiciary to set clear limits around \"the point at which the state's plea of inadequate resources must give way to the constitutionally guaranteed right to be tried within a reasonable time\".279 This has an obvious resonance with cases like Knockwood, Perley , and Parent where the state's failure to adequately resource the preparation of Gladue reports has led to prejudicial delays for the accused. Hartling indicates that s 11(b) can provide yet another mechanism by which the state's failure to meet these responsibilities may be rebuked by the courts at the same time that prejudice to the accused is addressed. Conclusion The Gladue analysis obliges sentencing judges to explore an Indigenous person's unique circumstances in every proceeding unless this statutory right has been waived. While it is clear that pre-sentence reports, Gladue reports, submissions from counsel for both parties, and witness testimony can all help in fulfilling this task, most of these procedural details have been left up to lower courts to develop. In doing so, the cases summarized in this chapter indicate that sentencing judges play the lead role in ensuring the requirements of s 718.2(e) are met in any given proceeding, and this requires careful assessment of the adequacy of the record before them. The court may need to solicit further information from counsel for both parties to supplement the record or they may wish to order supplementary reports if the information before them appears to be insufficient. Whenever an Indigenous person is sentenced in the absence of an adequate record\u2014including both categories of unique circumstances\u2014 the decision will be vulnerable to appellate intervention. The need for adequate case-specific information has implications for Crown counsel as well as the defence bar. Moreover, it can also have implications for state resources, at times leading to remedies being issued in favour of the accused if they have been prejudiced by institutional delays. In sum, the Gladue analysis places considerable demands on all those involved in sentencing to interrogate the unique circumstances of Indigenous individuals and collectives in a meaningful way. 278 R v Balogh, 2020 BCCA 96 at para 37 [emphasis added]. 279 R v Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, Cromwell J at para 262, dissenting.ABORIGINAL PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR OWN CULTURES...

THE RELATIONSHIP OF COLONIALISM PROVIDES ELABORATION AND EXTENSION OF THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES BY LOWER COURTS278 PART D: ELABORATION AND EXTENSION OF THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES BY LOWER COURTS As the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out in Barton, there is still much-needed work to be done before we see truth and reconciliation within the criminal justice system. The Supreme Court has demonstrated how the Gladue principles integrate with considerations arising under other provisions of the Criminal Code, first in context to the conditional sentencing provisions in Wells, and later for breaches of long-term supervision orders in Ipeelee. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged that systemic discrimination and Indigenous alienation in the justice system have implications beyond s 718.2(e) in Ewert, Barton, and Friesen. These developments indicate broad relevancy to the systemic and background factors and distinct legal perspectives of Indigenous peoples, but they are only three examples among many others emerging from lower courts across the country. Subsequent chapters address several further applications and elaborations of the Gladue principles that have emerged to date. While not all of these jurisprudential trends have been uniformly accepted by lower courts thus far, those selected for inclusion in this publication have all benefitted from thorough and thoughtful consideration. 279 When the Gladue principles are construed broadly as the need for an Indigenous person's unique circumstances to be recognized and accommodated throughout the justice system, their implications are not easily captured in one publication. An Indigenous person's systemic and background factors might conceivably show why they deserve leniency in bringing a civil suit outside a short limitation period.1 These factors can contextualize the probative value and prejudicial effects of placing an Indigenous person's criminal record before a jury as well.2 Likewise, these factors may be relevant when assessing if an Indigenous person's confession was truly voluntary or determining why they might have pleaded guilty.3 There are innumerable instances in which courts exercise discretion with regard to all the circumstances before them. There is no obvious a priori limit on the relevancy of the unique circumstances of an Indigenous person in the sense contemplated in the Gladue decision and its successors. The remaining chapters cannot canvass each and every existing example of the Gladue principles extending into new legal contexts, nor can they possibly highlight every single logical possibility for future developments. There are simply too many one-offs and what-ifs to consider. They do, however, synthesize some of the most consistently explored and thoroughly analyzed extensions to date. While the Supreme Court of Canada and other appellate courts have yet to thoroughly develop all these topics, the remaining chapters reflect the current state of the law and may assist in principled applications and development of the existing law. 1 See for example O'Shea v City of Vancouver, 2015 BCPC 398 at paras 89-101. 2 See for example R v King, 2019 ONSC 6851 at paras 27-47, 62. 3 See for example: v Camille, 2018 BCSC 301 at paras 78-80, 87; R v Wabason, SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE To suggest the Gladue principles are relevant to joint submissions on sentence is a rather modest addition to the jurisprudence, especially given the role these principles play in the fundamental principle of proportionality. Still, this topic has received limited discussion at the appellate level to date so the existing case law is explored in detail in this chapter. In the Anthony-Cook decision in 2016 the Supreme Court of Canada did clarify the role of joint submissions in sentencing more generally, as well as the appropriate legal test to determine whether sentencing judges are entitled to depart from these joint positions.1 Among other things, the Court emphasized that joint submissions must be thoroughly justified by counsel and an offender's circumstances must be fully accounted for. Prior to the release of Anthony- Cook there were already precedents in which it was insisted that counsel must explore an Indigenous person's unique circumstances during the resolution discussions leading up to a joint submission.2 In light of the significant clarification of the law in Anthony-Cook, this chapter focuses on subsequent decisions where the Gladue principles are merged with those set out in Anthony-Cook with respect to the justification of joint submissions and the standard that must be met before courts depart from them. A clarification of the law in Anthony-Cook In Anthony-Cook, the Supreme Court determined the legal test that trial judges should apply when deciding whether it is appropriate in a particular case to depart from a joint sentence\u2014\"that is, when Crown and defence counsel agree to recommend a particular sentence to the 1 R v Anthony-Cook, 2016 SCC 43 [Anthony-Cook]. 2 See for example: R 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 judge, in exchange for the accused entering a plea of guilty\".3 This appeal arose from the sentencing of Mr. Anthony-Cook for manslaughter. He entered a guilty plea on the basis of a joint submission as to sentence. However, the trial judge rejected the joint submission, imposing both a longer custodial sentence than what had been proposed by counsel and a three-year probation order not contemplated by their joint submission. The Court unanimously held that the trial judge erred in principle by imposing a less stringent test than he should have in choosing to depart from the joint submission. The Court clarified the more stringent test that ought to have been followed by the sentencing judge and then applied it to the joint submission for Mr. Anthony-Cook in order to conclude that departure from it was unwarranted. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Moldaver described resolution discussions between Crown and defence counsel as \"not only commonplace in the criminal justice system\" but \"essential\".4 When \"[p]roperly conducted, they permit the system to function smoothly and efficiently\".5 He pointed out that joint submissions are a subset of resolution discussions that \"are both an accepted and acceptable means of plea resolution\", and are \"vital to the efficient operation of the criminal justice system\".6 He noted that in most cases joint submissions are \"unexceptional\" and \"readily approved by trial judges without any difficulty\".7 At the same time, Justice Moldaver stated that \"joint submissions are not sacrosanct\" and \"[t]rial judges may depart from them\".8 He noted that occasionally \"a joint submission may appear to be unduly lenient, or perhaps unduly harsh, and trial judges are not obliged to go along with them\".9 Prior to this appeal, however, the appropriate test against which to measure the acceptability of a joint submission was contentious among appellate courts across the country. Justice Moldaver resolved this competing jurisprudence in favour of the most stringent test\u2014the public interest test\u2014on the basis that it \"best reflects the many benefits that joint submissions bring to the criminal justice system and the 3 Anthony-Cook, supra note 1 at para 2. 4 Ibid at para 1. 5 Ibid. 6 Ibid at para 7 Ibid at para 8 Ibid at para 3. 9 Ibid at para 25, citing s 606(1.1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46.282 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D corresponding need for a high degree of certainty in them\".10 It also \"helps keep trial judges focused on the unique considerations that apply when assessing the acceptability of a joint sentence\".11 The public interest test Justice Moldaver clarified the public interest test as meaning that \"a trial judge should not depart from a joint submission on sentence unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest\".12 A joint submission will meet this standard if, \"despite the public interest considerations that support imposing it, it is so 'markedly out of line with the expectations of reasonable persons aware of the circumstances of the case that they would view it as a break down in the proper functioning of the criminal justice system'\".13 He also cautioned that \"when assessing a joint submission, trial judges should 'avoid rendering a decision that causes an informed and reasonable public to lose confidence in the institution of the courts'\".14 Justice Moldaver further clarified the \"undeniably high threshold\" for rejecting a joint submission as follows: Rejection denotes a submission so unhinged from the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance would lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant circumstances, including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to believe that the proper functioning of the justice system has broken down.15 10 Ibid at para 31. 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid at para 32. 13 Ibid at para 33, citing R v Druken, 2006 NCLA 67 at para 29. 14 Ibid at para 33, citing R v BO2, 2010 NLCA 19 at para 56. 15 34.283 Chapter 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 The need for joint submissions to be thoroughly justified Justice Moldaver also provided guidance for trial judges on the approach they should follow if \"troubled by a joint submission on sentence\".16 While most of his guidance falls outside the scope of this publication, Justice Moldaver did point to the need for Crown and defence counsel to thoroughly justify joint submissions, which has been expanded upon by lower courts as a basis for the relevance of Gladue information. According to Justice Moldaver, Crown and defence counsel should \"provide the court with a full account of the circumstances of the offender, the offence, and the joint submission\" so the trial judge has a proper basis upon which to determine whether it should be accepted.17 They need to inform the trial judge why the proposed sentence meets the public interest test or \"they run the risk that the trial judge will reject the joint submission\".18 They also need to communicate their considerations to ensure that \"a proper record is created for appeal purposes\".19 In addition, thoroughly justifying a joint submission \"has an important public perception component\".20 For similar reasons, Justice Moldaver urged trial judges who remain unsatisfied to \"provide clear and cogent reasons for departing from the joint submission\".21 Reasons will help explain to the parties why the proposed sentence was unacceptable, may assist them in the resolution of future cases, and will also facilitate appellate review. Counsel must account for Gladue principles when justifying joint submissions Several sentencing decisions have since directly addressed the role of the Gladue principles in the sentencing judge's determination of whether they have a proper basis upon which to determine if a joint submission should be accepted in keeping with the guidance in Anthony-Cook. To date this 16 Ibid at para 49. 17 Ibid at para 54. 18 Ibid at para 55. 19 Ibid at para 56. at para 60.284 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D has occurred where counsel has not considered the Gladue principles in arriving at their joint submission, where detailed case-specific information was not available when the joint submission was prepared, or where the joint submission otherwise contributes to systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system. As a result, sentencing judges have decided not to accept the joint submission in question and they justified their departure in reference to Justice Moldaver's directions in Anthony-Cook. These cases indicate that the unique circumstances addressed in Gladue are among the circumstances that must be fully accounted for by counsel in order to thoroughly justify their joint submission on sentence for any Indigenous person. In Adam, Judge Harradence of the Saskatchewan Provincial Court was presented with a joint submission of an 18-month conditional sentence order with \"lengthy and restrictive conditions\" after Ms. Adam pleaded guilty to charges of possession of cocaine and wilfully attempting to obstruct justice, as well as three charges relating to breach of her release document.22 This was a joint submission that Crown counsel candidly admitted \"was hefty for an offender with no criminal record\".23 Judge Harradence expressed concern with the joint submission due in large part to counsel's failure to make any reference to the Gladue principles in spite of Ms. Adam appearing to be First Nations.24 Sentencing was adjourned and a pre-sentence report was ordered so as to provide information on Ms. Adam's history and background. Judge Harradence ultimately applied the directions set out in Anthony-Cook to reject the joint submission as \"contrary to the public interest\".25 The pre-sentence report for Ms. Adam confirmed that she was from a remote First Nation in northern Saskatchewan and she had experienced family breakdown, family abuse, and economic disadvantage, but she was nevertheless making significant progress in her life and she hoped to attend university.26 Judge Harradence noted that in light of this background he needed to pay careful attention to s 718.2(e) and consider it in context to other sentencing principles. He found no evidence that counsel had \"considered Gladue factors in arriving at the joint sentence\" and held that he therefore did not have 22 R v Adam, 2017 SKPC 7 at paras 13-14. 23 Ibid Ibid Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 \"a proper basis on which to determine whether the joint submission should be accepted\".27 In support of his conclusion that Gladue factors were not considered, he noted that Ms. Adam's Indigenous heritage was not confirmed by counsel until a pre-sentence report was ordered.28 He also considered the significant power imbalance between Ms. Adam and Crown counsel in light of her background, her youth, and her \"bottom line\" of not wanting to go to jail.29 A suspended sentence with 12 months of probation was imposed in place of the conditional sentence jointly presented to the court. In Gordon, Judge Bazin of the Saskatchewan Provincial Court rejected a joint submission of 16 months' imprisonment for trafficking in hydromorphone and imposed a suspended sentence in its place.30 Crown and defence counsel were both senior respected members of the criminal bar and they jointly submitted that 16 months of imprisonment was \"the proper sentence, being lower than the bottom of the range\".31 Judge Bazin asked Ms. Gordon whether she had Indigenous ancestry when the joint submission was presented and she indicated that she did and in fact had attended residential school. Counsel \"candidly admitted Gladue factors were not considered in arriving at the joint submission\".32 Judge Bazin ordered a pre-sentence report canvassing Ms. Gordon's unique circumstances, as well as her cognitive status, learning disabilities, and the correctional system's ability to address her multiple medical conditions.33 Upon receipt of that pre-sentence report, Judge Bazin advised counsel that he had concerns with the joint submission and heard further submissions in support of it. Judge Bazin ultimately concluded that the joint submission could not stand in light of counsel's candid admission that they had not considered Ms. Gordon's Gladue factors in arriving at the joint position on sentence. This was described as \"a fundamental error that is fatal to a joint submission\".34 Judge Bazin further found that: 27 Ibid at para 28 Ibid at para 27. 29 Ibid at para 28. 30 R v Gordon, 2019 SKPC 58 at para 1. 31 Ibid at para 5. 32 Ibid at para 8. at para 19.286 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D A reasonable person, aware of the requirement of s. 718.2(e) and the law as developed in [Gladue] and Ipeelee would believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had broken down. Equally, I find that an informed and reasonable public would lose confidence in the institution of the courts where, after years of jurisprudence, counsel simply do not consider Gladue factors, particularly given the high threshold required to reject a joint submission.35 Judge Bazin went on to consider various factors including the effect of Ms. Gordon's attendance at residential school, her lower cognitive capacity, and her significant health issues in order to conclude that a jail term was not required.36 An 18-month suspended sentence was imposed with 12 months to be served under a 24-hour curfew, but with a 12-month credit granted for the 13 months of house arrest she had already served.37 In Little, Judge Corrin of the Manitoba Provincial Court rejected a joint submission of 54 months' imprisonment as a global sentence for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, possession of a prohibited firearm without a licence, and possession of a prohibited weapon, instead imposing a global sentence of 48 months' with three years of supervised probation. Judge Corrin initially expressed concern over the impact of the proposed lengthy sentence of incarceration on a 22-year-old offender and heard further submissions in support of the sentence. Upon learning that Mr. Little had \"Indigenous roots\", Judge Corrin adjourned sentencing in order to obtain further Gladue information as an appendix to an existing pre-sentence report.38 Judge Corrin was satisfied that the sentence jointly proposed by counsel was within the appropriate range in reference to the circumstances of the offence, but was concerned as to whether it reflected \"the influences of the offender's individual circumstances having regard for his age, immaturity, peculiar vulnerabilities and rehabilitative potential\".39 Judge Corrin went on to consider Mr. Little's personal circumstances in detail, including his unique circumstances as an Indigenous person and ultimately rejected the proposed sentence in light of \"his youth, his 35 Ibid. 36 Ibid at para 66. 37 Ibid at para 67. 38 R v Little, 2019 MBPC 60 at para 3. 39 Ibid at para 10.287 Chapter 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 vulnerability, and his Gladue factors and s. 718.2(e) factors (which apply to all offenders)\".40 In TLC , Judge Wolf of the British Columbia Provincial Court rejected a joint submission of an 18 month suspended sentence for an Indigenous woman who pleaded guilty to two assaults on her boyfriend and a breach of bail. Instead, he sentenced her to a conditional discharge with 18 months of probation, in part to spare her from the consequences of a criminal record.41 After hearing initial submissions from counsel, Judge Wolf requested further information and a Gladue report was obtained. While counsel conceded they did not have the benefit of much of the information contained in the Gladue report when the joint submission was negotiated, they nevertheless stood by their position even with the benefit of that report.42 Judge Wolf accepted that many factors generally weigh in favour of completing sentencing rather than delaying it when presented with a joint submission for a suspended sentence in a case such as this one.43 Nevertheless, he found that he needed more information on this particular accused and relied on what was set out in the Gladue report to justify his departure from the joint submission. Judge Wolf also provided guidance on how the general need for Gladue information in sentencing an Indigenous person fits into the overall approach to departures from joint submissions in Anthony-Cook: I believe that another step is necessary. After notifying counsel of my concerns and inviting further submissions, in the case of an Indigenous offender, I must ask myself, do I have enough information to impose a fit sentence that properly considers the Indigenous circumstances of that particular Indigenous accused? I expect a 'reasonable and informed person', who is familiar with the social context of Indigenous Peoples and the Canadian Justice System would expect that this question be considered.44 In Laforge, Justice Marchand of the British Columbia Supreme Court rejected a joint submission for an effective custodial sentence of 27 months time-served followed by three years of probation for a M\u00e9tis man with schizophrenia who pleaded guilty to one count of mischief by 40 Ibid at para 45. 41 R v TLC, 19.288 THE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D wilfully damaging vehicles and one count of intentionally or recklessly causing damage by fire.45 Mr. Laforge had driven his vehicle through the front window of a 7-Eleven convenience store, poured gasoline into the cab, and lit it on fire to bring attention to his struggles, including the delusional belief that he was being interfered with by intrusive brain and perception-altering technologies.46 He had already spent 548 days in custody by the date of his sentencing hearing.47 The Court concluded that the jointly proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest and ordered an effective time-served custodial sentence of 18 months followed by three years of probation in its place.48 While there was no Gladue report prepared for Mr. Laforge, Justice Marchand found his circumstances set out in detailed and thoughtful pre-sentence and psychiatric reports.49 His father is M\u00e9tis but knew little about his heritage as a result of being adopted by a non-Indigenous family as an infant.50 Mr. Laforge was born to a teenaged mother, raised by his maternal grandmother, and verbally, physically, and sexually abused by the grandmother's former partner.51 Among other Gladue factors, he was bullied in high school due to his Indigenous appearance, began using drugs, and dropped out.52 In spite of this case-specific information, Justice Marchand was concerned that Crown counsel had made no mention of Gladue, Ipeelee, or s 718.2(e)'s relevance to the appropriateness of the joint submission.53 While defence counsel identified a number of Gladue factors, there was no meaningful submission as to how these may have played a part in bringing Mr. Laforge before the court, nor were any culturally appropriate supports, programs, or other alternative procedures and sanctions identified.54 The joint submission failed to recognize Mr. Laforge's highly reduced moral blameworthiness in light of his traumatic upbringing, community disconnection, addictions, and mental health issues.55 45 R v Laforge, 2020 51 Ibid at para 21. 52 Ibid at para 24. 53 Chapter 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 Justice Marchand raised the concern that the joint submission was too harsh at an early stage, as well as the concern it \"might contribute to, rather than alleviate, the systemic over-incarceration of Indigenous offenders that s. 718.2(e) of the Code was designed to address\".56 He pointed out that Gladue factors feed into disproportionate rates of pre- trial detention faced by Indigenous people, which in turn incentivizes guilty pleas and joint proposals for sentences of time-served that might exceed what would otherwise be appropriate.57 He concluded that this could contribute to Indigenous over-incarceration in two ways: (i) by establishing precedents of unduly long sentences for other Indigenous people finding themselves in similar circumstances in the future; and (ii) by signalling to the judge in any future sentencing proceeding for Mr. Laforge the seriousness of his criminal history, which could be relied on to impose a longer period of incarceration.58 Justice Marchand was satisfied that a reasonable and informed member of the community would view the joint submission as representing the breakdown of the criminal justice system due to various factors, including: the lack of authority in support of its length given Mr. Laforge's reduced culpability; the substantial incentive for Mr. Laforge to agree to any time-served sentence after a lengthy period of pre-trial detention; counsel's failure to meaningfully address the Gladue principles in justifying the position; and the joint submission's contribution to systemic discrimination against Indigenous people in the criminal justice system.59 Justice Marchand also reduced the length of a jointly proposed three-year curfew on the basis that its length was excessive and unnecessary, it would risk criminalizing non-criminal behaviour, and it could contribute to Indigenous over-incarceration in a manner analogous to overly restrictive bail conditions.60 In Awashish, Judge Ladouceur of the Court of Quebec rejected a joint submission of 34.7 months in prison and 24 months of probation for a Cree man who pleaded guilty to theft of a purse and its contents, aggravated assault against his sister, breach of probation for failing to perform community work, and two breaches of recognizance.61 He informed the parties that he was questioning whether the joint submission complied with the public interest test established in Anthony- 56 Ibid at para 65. 57 Ibid 60 at paras 92-98, citing R v Zora, 2020 SCC 14 at para 79. 61 R c Awashish, 2020 QCCQ 3614.290 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D Cook, especially in light of the principles set out in Gladue, Ipeelee, and subsequent jurisprudence from the Quebec Court of Appeal, and he requested additional submissions on the justification and circumstances underlying it.62 While both a Gladue report and a pre-sentence report were ordered, only a pre-sentence report was ever prepared due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, among other circumstances, and Mr. Awashish waived his right to the Gladue report's preparation.63 Judge Ladouceur noted that in two prior unrelated sentencing matters for Mr. Awashish no Gladue report had been prepared, no Gladue- specific submissions had been made, and there was no referral to a justice committee in the probation conditions.64 He also highlighted the distinct purpose, source, and process for pre-sentence reports, finding that to the extent they touch on Gladue information, \"in most cases, it is but the tip of the iceberg\".65 Nevertheless, Judge Ladouceur was able to determine that Mr. Awashish's childhood was marred by familial alcohol abuse, almost daily domestic violence, and physical abuse that left him hospitalized on at least one occasion.66 Mr. Awashish began committing thefts, missing school, and smoking cannabis by age 10, around the time his mother left home and his sister became his maternal figure.67 He dropped out of school by age 17, abused alcohol and drugs, attempted suicide twice, and ended up being heavily medicated for depression and panic attacks.68 Mr. Awashish acknowledged he needed help to resolve his problems and he was willing to undergo to therapy at the Waseskun Center, a provincially and federally accredited healing centre.69 Crown and defence counsel had jointly proposed a sentence of exactly two years so as to ensure that a probation order could be rendered after Mr. Awashish served this sentence in a federal penitentiary.70 Defence counsel argued that he was more likely to receive care for his mental health issues if given a penitentiary sentence.71 Judge Ladouceur found little 62 Ibid at para Ibid para at 21-23. at 2, para 35.291 Chapter 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 support for the joint submission in the precedents provided by counsel.72 He cited Laforge and found that \"the proposed sentence would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as representing a breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system\".73 He held that the Gladue principles must not only be considered during the negotiation of a joint submission, but \"[t]his consideration must be reflected concretely in the result submitted to the Court\".74 The Crown erred by measuring the proposal against an appropriate sentence for a hypothetical non- Aboriginal person.75 The Court also held that the joint submission failed to reflect either Mr. Awashish's diminished moral culpability or the available alternatives to incarceration in a concrete manner.76 Citing Laforge, Judge Ladouceur held that the joint submission presented in Awashish \"perpetuate[d] the problem of the overrepresentation of Aboriginal persons in prison, with respect to both the accused and the precedent it sets\" and \"would mean opening the doors of the prisons and penitentiaries even wider to incarcerate Aboriginal persons in them\".77 In its place, the Court ordered 18 months' imprisonment less pre-sentence custody for the aggravated assault, 6 months of conditional sentences for the remaining convictions, and thirty months of probation that would include therapy at the Waseskun Center, the involvement of a justice committee, and 150 hours of community service. In Head , Judge Cochard of the Alberta Provincial Court raised concerns with a joint submission of 30 months of incarceration followed by three years of probation for a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who pleaded guilty to 12 separate charges involving assaults, shoplifting, and robbery of a convenience store.78 According to the Court, \"Gladue factors were read in superficially\" in support of this joint position.79 Counsel advised that Mr. Head wished to waive the preparation of a Gladue report and that there were no existing reports on him, but Judge Cochard found a Gladue report from a prior sentencing hearing involving Mr. Head after making 72 Ibid at paras 42-43. 73 Ibid at para 35, 45 at para 53. Ibid Laforge, supra note 45 at para 65. 78 R v Head, 2020 ABPC 211. 79 Ibid at para 5.292 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D her own independent inquiries.80 The Gladue report from a previous proceeding indicated that Mr. Head might have been diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) so Judge Cochard made some additional inquiries, found a psychiatric assessment prepared for him in a Youth Justice matter that raised the possibility of FASD, and brought all this to the attention of counsel.81 Counsel abandoned their original joint submission and defence counsel instead sought a sentence of time-served plus probation, providing extensive written submissions on the Gladue factors and the possible FASD diagnosis.82 However, Judge Cochard noted that this reflected research that was only done once she indicated she was unwilling to accept the joint submission. In the Court's view, \"[t]his should have been done prior to the negotiations to resolve matters and prior to presenting a joint submission\".83 Judge Cochard went on to confirm that the originally proposed sentence was contrary to the interests of the public and would have brought the administration of justice into disrepute for the same reasons that Judge Ladouceur set out in Awashish.84 She held that joint submissions should not be accepted where they fail to properly account for Gladue factors including FASD, and that \"[c]ounsel must be prepared to come to court with the proper information\".85 Mr. Head had served 252 days in pretrial custody and Judge Cochard sentenced him to time-served followed by three years of probation that include conditions for attendance at the Mental Health Court and an FASD Program. At the time of writing there appears to be a consensus among sentencing courts that have issued written decisions on this question that the Gladue principles must be meaningfully addressed in any joint submissions on sentence for Indigenous accused. There may be differing degrees to which counsel fails to address these principles in their submissions, ranging from a failure to even confirm the Indigeneity of the accused to a more nuanced failure to consider the joint position in the broader context of systemic discrimination against Indigenous peoples, including its impact on sentencing ranges. It is at least clear that more than a perfunctory reference to Gladue factors will be expected. 80 Ibid paras Ibid Chapter 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 In another decision issued by Judge Ladouceur of the Court of Quebec, Neeposh, he emphasized that joint submissions are a mechanism through which both the Crown and defence counsel can exert a positive impact on the rate at which Indigenous people are being incarcerated in Canada.86 He stated that joint submissions are particularly vital to the efficient operation of the justice system in northern courts, but \"we should question ourselves regarding the high frequency of joint submission proposing [a] term of imprisonment \".87 In order for the Gladue principles to have an impact on incarceration rates\u2014whether in context to joint submissions or otherwise\u2014the unique circumstances of Indigenous people will need to be thoroughly and meaningfully explored by counsel. Courts must consider Gladue principles in how they approach joint submissions There are also a number of decisions where appellate courts have overturned sentencing decisions departing from joint submissions on sentence without adequately considering the relevance of the Gladue principles. These appellate decisions further emphasize the importance of assessing an Indigenous person's unique circumstances in this context. Just as counsel's failure to consider the Gladue principles has been relied on by sentencing judges as a reason for departing from joint submissions that are too harsh, appellate courts have relied on the failure of sentencing judges to consider the Gladue principles in their approach to joint submissions as an error justifying appellate review. In other words, both counsel and the sentencing court have been obliged to ensure the Gladue principles are respected in context to joint submissions for the sentencing of Indigenous people. In Boyer , the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench allowed an appeal from sentence for a conviction of impaired driving and varied the sentence to bring it into conformity with a joint submission of 34 days' imprisonment, served at the Saskatchewan Impaired Driver Treatment Program, followed by six months' probation, and a three-year driving prohibition.88 The sentencing judge initially expressed concern with the joint proposal based on Mr. Boyer's two prior drinking-and-driving related convictions, his very high blood-alcohol readings, and his driving 86 R c Neeposh, 2020 QCCQ 1235 at paras 57-58. 87 Ibid v Boyer, 2016 SKQB 352.294 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D on the wrong side of the road, and he invited further submissions and case law in support of it.89 Defence counsel pointed to Mr. Boyer's early guilty plea, prior alcohol treatment, and M\u00e9tis ancestry, among other things.90 The sentencing judge invited defence counsel to provide further information regarding Mr. Boyer's Indigenous heritage and counsel made oral submissions regarding how Mr. Boyer's family had endured prejudice and how Mr. Boyer witnessed substance abuse and violence in his home when he was growing up.91 The joint submission was nevertheless rejected as \"unfit and contrary to the public interest\" for failing to address the primary sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation.92 On appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench acknowledged the jointly proposed sentence was \"undoubtedly lenient, in light of Mr. Boyer's criminal record and the circumstances\".93 However, it was the product of negotiations between experienced counsel and Mr. Boyer's early guilt plea, rehabilitative steps, and suitability for a treatment program were all relevant factors in support of the Crown's agreement.94 The Court noted that defence counsel had raised \"Mr. Boyer's difficult upbringing and personal circumstances, which required the sentencing judge to consider s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code\", as well as the Supreme Court's decisions in Gladue and Ipeelee.95 The Court found that these circumstances \"clearly suggested that rehabilitation and restraint were factors that should have been given prominence in sentencing\".96 Instead, the sentencing judge focused \"entirely on denunciation and deterrence\", failed to give adequate consideration to the principles of rehabilitation and restraint, and failed to give adequate consideration to the public interest considerations that supported the joint submission.97 In McInnis, the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal similarly allowed an appeal from a sentencing judge's departure from a joint submission on sentence on the basis that the Gladue principles were 89 Ibid at para 9. 90 Ibid at para 10. 91 Ibid at para 11. 92 Ibid at para 16. 93 at para 30. 94 95 Chapter 12: Joint Submissions SentenceCHAPTER 12 not properly considered and applied.98 Mr. McInnis was charged with unlawfully possessing cannabis for the purposes of trafficking at a high school where he was a student. A Gladue report was prepared for his sentencing. Upon the report's finalization, Crown and defence counsel made a joint sentencing submission in support of a lengthy rehabilitative probation order which included conditions set out in the Gladue report. The sentencing judge cautioned that she was concerned with the joint sentence and she adjourned sentencing on at least three occasions in order to obtain further documentation and submissions, in part to explain \"how and why Gladue should apply and why the sentencing judge should accept the joint recommendation\".99 She ultimately rejected the joint sentencing submission in a 31-page oral decision. The Court of Appeal overturned this decision on the basis that the sentencing judge applied the wrong test in departing from the joint submission and failed to consider how the Gladue principles supported the joint submission in question. In the Court of Appeal's view, the sentencing judge concluded that the Gladue principles should not be applied in this case essentially due to the fact that Mr. McInnis \"had been adopted at a very young age\u2014basically at birth\".100 In doing so, in spite of having adequate information before her in the Gladue report, the sentencing judge erred by refusing to accept that systemic factors applied, holding the appellant to a strict standard of proving causation, and not according any weight to these factors in her decision.101 The Court of Appeal found that the sentencing judge's rejection of the joint submission was largely a result of this misapplication of the Gladue principles.102 The Court of Appeal was of the view that the joint submission's focus on rehabilitation and restorative justice was in keeping with the principles outlined in ss 718.2(d), (e), and (f ) of the Criminal Code and the unique historic and systemic factors that a sentencing judge must consider when sentencing an Indigenous person.103 It accepted that the Crown's support of the joint submission was premised on the circumstances of 98 R v McInnis, 2019 PECA 3. 99 Ibid, Murphy JA at paras 10-13. 100 Ibid, Murphy JA at para 46. 101 Ibid, Murphy JA at paras 50-55. 102 Ibid, Murphy JA at para 55, Jenkins CJ at para 88. 103 Ibid, Murphy JA at paras 57, Jenkins at paras 74-75, 79, 93. 296 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D Mr. McInnis as an Indigenous person.104 It also held that the sentencing judge erred by focusing on deterrence and denunciation in assessing the sentence's fitness in place of applying the public interest test.105 Among other things, the Court of Appeal added that \"pursuit of parity needs to accommodate the inherently individualized nature of sentencing, such that there is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime\".106 For all these reasons, the joint submission ought to have been accepted. In Whitstone, Justice Zuk of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench heard an appeal where neither the Crown nor defence counsel had made the initial sentencing judge aware the accused was Indigenous.107 Sentencing had proceeded \"effectively\" as a joint submission.108 Defence counsel consented to the Crown's application to terminate Ms. Whitstone's existing conditional sentence order due to new charges, as well as the Crown's recommendation of a six-month jail sentence on the two new charges, which related to fraudulently obtaining food.109 There was no direct reference to Ms. Whitstone's Indigeneity in the transcript from the initial sentencing proceeding, although there were references to her place of residence being the Thunderchild First Nation.110 Justice Zuk noted that references to Ms. Whitstone residing in that community \"ought to have drawn the sentencing judge's attention to enquiring if Ms. Whitstone was of aboriginal ancestry\".111 The Court cautioned that a failure to inquire if an offender is Indigenous, a failure to obtain adequate information on their circumstances as an Indigenous person, or a failure to provide reasons as to how the Gladue principles were applied could each place a sentencing decision at risk of appellate review.112 The fact that this proceeding involved a joint position on sentence would not eliminate these obligations on the sentencing judge. 104 Ibid, Murphy JA at para 59, Jenkins CJ at paras 79, 92. 105 Ibid, Murphy JA at para 59. 106 Ibid, Jenkins CJ at para 88, 688, CanLII 2018 SKQB 83. 108 Ibid at para 43. Counsel's joint position on sentence in Whitstone may be best characterized as a joint recommendation rather than a joint submission on sentence if it was not the product of resolution discussions between counsel (see for example: R v Frampton, 2018 NLCA 23 at paras Ibid Ibid 37-42.297 Chapter 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 The Court conceded that the role of the Gladue principles in assessing a joint position on sentence was not specifically raised or argued in this case and Ms. Whitstone was self-represented.113 Nevertheless, it provided the following guidance as to the importance of considering Gladue information in this context: ...it is my view that any sentencing judge who accepts a joint sentence respecting an aboriginal offender runs a risk of the sentencing decision being open to appellate review where the court fails to address Gladue factors in the course of accepting the joint submission. Where there is a joint submission respecting an aboriginal offender and the joint submission fails to provide evidence of Gladue factors that enable the sentencing judge to consider the appropriateness of the sentence in light of the offender's aboriginal circumstances, it may render the sentence open to appellate review on the basis that the sentencing judge failed in his or her statutory duty to conduct the inquiry and analysis required by s. 718.2(e).114 Conclusion There is little suggestion in the case law to date that extending the Gladue principles to the justification and assessment of joint submissions has been controversial in terms of the development of the law by the judiciary. However, the above-noted cases suggest that the sentencing practices of counsel may have been slow to adapt. Still, there are far more published judgments in which courts have expressly considered an Indigenous person's unique circumstances and the Gladue principles when accepting a joint submission without interference.115 In fact, the relevance of the Gladue principles to the justification of joint submissions on sentence has received only passing comment in some cases, suggesting this may be a relatively self-evident proposition.116 113 Ibid at para 43. 114 example: NWTTC 20; R 2018 YKSC 42; R v Wells, 2018 BCSC 738; R c Stevens, 2018 QCCS 4285; R v 2018 BCSC 2528; R v 2018 NSPC 83; R NLSC PESC ABPC Gunanoot, 2020 Gunanoot]; R v CG, 2020 YKTC 21 [CG R NWTSC BCPC 219 [Racette]; R v Heimbecker, 2020 SKQB 304. 116 See R v Mantla, 2020 NWTCA 6 at para 32.298 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D On the other hand, while the doctrinal reasons for a merger of the sentencing guidance in Anthony-Cook and the Gladue jurisprudence may be straightforward, there are practical details still being worked out by lower courts. As resolution discussions fall outside the direct supervision from the courts, some decisions emphasize the need for counsel to change their practices and some judges may be using the requirement for justification as leverage to bring about these changes. The thorough review of an Indigenous person's unique circumstances may facilitate a \"meeting of minds\" between Crown and defence counsel in resolution discussions.117 If so, this would presumably be a welcome result. However, court-ordered reports that canvass these circumstances in great detail may not always be feasible, in which case judicial notice and submissions from counsel will need to shoulder the informational requirements.118 And while Anthony-Cook speaks to the importance of justification and transparency for joint submissions, counsel should not be routinely sent away to revise their positions since doing risks reintroducing the same inefficiencies and delays that the stricter public interest test was meant to mitigate.119 The power imbalance between the Crown and the accused in resolution discussions may be worth considering through a Gladue lens as well. In Anthony-Cook, Justice Moldaver urged an asymmetrical approach to this power differential, stating that it may temper the public interest in certainty so as to justify \"undercutting\" sentences in some limited circumstances, especially where the accused is self-represented or already in custody.120 As summarized elsewhere in this publication, the reports and commissions of inquiry that preceded the Gladue decision identified a higher rate of guilty pleas among Indigenous people.121 The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized higher rates of pre-trial custody for Indigenous people as well.122 These systemic considerations may reinforce the need to bear in mind the power imbalance leading to joint submissions for Indigenous accused. 117 See for example R v Kreyger, 2020 ONCJ 424 at paras 27-29. 118 R v Kuliktana, 2020 NUCA 7 at 29-47; R c MP, 2020 QCCQ 7445 at para 78. 119 R v Kippomee, 2019 NUCA 3 at para 50. 120 Anthony-Cook, supra note 1 at para 52. 121 See also R v Ceballo, 2019 ONCJ 612 at para 10, citing Angela Bressan & Kyle Coady, Guilty pleas among Indigenous people in Canada (Ottawa: Department of Justice, 2017). 122 R v Myers, 2019 SCC 18 at para 26.299 Chapter 12: Joint Submissions on SentenceCHAPTER 12 There are a few cases where sentencing judges have considered the Gladue principles and the circumstances of an Indigenous person before departing from joint submissions and imposing a harsher penalty.123 The Gladue principles and the unique circumstances of an Indigenous person are not the sole considerations before the court in any given matter and they are unlikely to be determinative in every case. Joint submissions need to account for various other factors as well, such as the heightened vulnerability of Indigenous female victims, which now has explicit statutory recognition in the Criminal Code.124 While judges must be alive to the important systemic benefits of joint submissions, this does not mean these negotiated positions are exempt from the general principles of sentencing, including those developed with attention to the circumstances of Indigenous people. 123 R v IC, 2017 BCPC 2; R v Whitefish, 2019 SKPC at supra 115 at para Taylor, 2020 NWTTC 10 at paras 16-17; R v Lucas, 2020 NWTTC 45-76, 92.300 CHAPTER 13: BAIL HEARINGS A more complex and controversial evolution in the lower court jurisprudence has been the application of the Gladue principles to decisions with respect to bail\u2014also known as judicial interim release. The Supreme Court of Canada has yet to provide any guidance on how the Gladue principles ought to impact bail decisions. However, the Supreme Court has consistently acknowledged that the bail system has disproportionate adverse impacts on Indigenous people, laying bare several systemic factors of particular relevance to the crisis of Indigenous over-incarceration. First, in Gladue and Ipeelee the Supreme Court recognized Indigenous people are more likely to be refused bail and that this contributes to Indigenous over-incarceration.1 In Summers, the Court took note of Indigenous over-representation in remand custody and described Canada's bail system as \"result[ing] in consistently longer, harsher sentences for vulnerable members of society, not based on the wrongfulness of their conduct but because of their isolation and inability to pay\".2 This issue was acknowledged again in Myers where the Court also took into account the \"often dire\" conditions individuals face during pre-trial detention, including lockdowns, overcrowding, and limited access to recreation, health care, and other basic programming.3 Likewise, the Court recognized that pre-trial custody has detrimental impacts on an individual's ability to raise a defence, on their mental and physical 1 R v Gladue, [1999] 1 SCR 688, 2012 SCC 13 at para 61 [Ipeelee]. 2 R v Summers, 2014 SCC 26 at para 67 [Summers], citing Avani Babooram, \"The profile 2006/2007\" (2008), 28:10 Juristat 1 (online): <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/85-002-X200801010732>; Canada, Senate, Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, No 14, 2nd Sess, 40th Parl., September 30, 2009, at 27-30. 3 R v Myers, 2019 SCC 18 at para 26 [Myers], citing: Summers, supra note 2 at paras 2, 28; Abigail Deshman & Nicole Myers, Set Up to Fail: Bail and the Revolving Door of Pre-trial Detention (Canadian Civil Liberties Association and Education Trust, 2014).301 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 well being, and on their families, in addition to other costs such as loss of liberty and loss of livelihood.4 Moreover, prolonged pre-trial detention was found to increase the risk of \"induced guilty pleas\".5 In Zora , the Supreme Court acknowledged Indigenous people are \"disproportionately affected by unnecessary and unreasonable bail conditions and resulting breach charges\" as well.6 Many lower courts have sought to respond to these systemic concerns by applying the Gladue principles to bail hearings, albeit in modified forms. Most jurisprudence already supported the consideration of Indigenous people's unique circumstances in context to bail decisions long before Parliament explicitly directed courts to do so.7 That said, a few judges had openly questioned this earlier jurisprudence and doubted the relevance of the Gladue principles to bail decisions in the absence of clear legislative guidance.8 The Criminal Code has now been amended to explicitly mandate that particular attention be paid to the circumstances of \"Aboriginal accused\", as well as \"accused who belong to a vulnerable population that is overrepresented in the criminal justice system and that is disadvantages in obtaining release\".9 Nevertheless, this 4 Myers, supra note 3, citing: R v Hall, 2002 SCC 64 at para 59 [Hall]; Ell v Alberta, 2003 35 v Antic, [Antic] 66. 5 Myers, supra note 3 at paras 22, 51. 6 R v Zora, 2020 SCC 14 at para 79 [Zora ], citing, inter alia, Jillian Rogin, \"Gladue and Bail: The Pre-Trial Sentencing of Aboriginal People in Canada\" (2017) 95:2 Can Bar Rev 325 [Rogin]. 7 See for example: R v Wesley, 2002 R v Robinson, 2009 ONCA 205 [Robinson]; R v Rich, 2009 NLTD 69 [Rich]; R v Pierce, 2010 ONSC 6154 [Pierce]; R v Mason, 2011 MBPC 48; R v TJ( J), 2011 BCPC 155 [TJ( J)]; R v Daniels, 2012 SKPC 189 [Daniels]; R v Cyr, 2012 SKQB 534 [Cyr]; v 2012 [DD(P)]; v Trodd, 2014 R v Duncan, 2015 BCSC 2688; R v Chocolate, 2015 NWTSC 28 [Chocolate]; R v Oakes, 2015 ABCA 178; R v Spence, ONSC 1692 R Sacobie, R v Jaypoody, 2018 NUCJ 36 [Jaypoody]. 493.2 [Criminal Code].302 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D amendment still leaves it up to the judiciary to clarify how these unique circumstances relate to the statutory grounds for pre-trial detention set out in the Criminal Code, which has resulted in a continuing role for the earlier jurisprudence on this topic.10 General legal and constitutional principles governing bail decisions A review of the broader principles governing bail may be a helpful frame of reference. When someone is charged with an offence, Part XVI of the Criminal Code provides \"a ladder of increasingly coercive measures\" in order to compel their appearance before a court, starting from a summons or an appearance notice issued by a peace officer and increasing in coerciveness up to detention and release on bail.11 The default position in Canadian law is for an accused person to be released from detention before trial on bail\u2014referred to as \"judicial interim release\" in the Criminal Code.12 And the default form of bail is to release accused persons \"based on an undertaking to attend trial, without any conditions restricting their activities or actions\".13 This default position is codified in s 515(1) of the Criminal Code. According to the Supreme Court of Canada, this permissive approach to bail decisions \"rests on the cornerstone of Canadian criminal law, namely the presumption of innocence that is guaranteed by s 11(d) of the Charter\".14 Moreover, section 11(e) of the Charter protects an accused person's right \"not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause\", which the Supreme Court has described as \"a basic entitlement to be granted reasonable bail unless there is just cause to do otherwise\".15 As described in Hall by Justice Iacobucci of the Supreme Court (as he then was), section 11(e) of the Charter calls on the judiciary \"to ensure that pre-trial release remains the norm rather than the exception to the norm, 10 See for example: R v Gibbs, 2019 BCPC 335 at para 7985 31 ]; Duncan, BCSC 590 para [Duncan]; R c Quannaaluk, 4383 at paras 32, 39, 43 [EB ]. 11 R v Penunsi, 2019 SCC 39 at para 64, citing R v Nowazek, 2018 YKCA 12 at para 58. 12 Antic, supra note 4 at para 21.

The tertiary ground requires consideration of the apparent strength of the prosecution's case, the gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, including the aggravating and mitigating factors that are considered in sentencing, and the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment, among other things.22 Still, as the default is unconditional release on an undertaking, any more restrictive form of release must be demonstrated to be necessary having regard to the statutory criteria for detention, and courts are obliged to impose the least restrictive form of release that is appropriate.23 This means judicial officials \"must consider release with fewer and less onerous conditions before release on more onerous ones\", and any conditions imposed \"must be minimal, necessary, reasonable, the least onerous in the 16 Hall, supra note 4, Iacobucci J at para 49, dissenting. 17 St-Cloud, supra note 12 at para 27. 18 Antic, supra note 4 at para 41. 19 Antic, supra note 4 at para 40. 20 Ibid at para 21. 21 Criminal Code, s 515(10); Antic, supra note 4 at para 34. 22 Criminal Code, s 515(10)(c); St-Cloud, supra note 12 at para 61. 23 See the summary of principles and guidelines in Antic, supra note 4 at para 67.304 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D circumstances, and sufficiently connected to a risk listed in s. 515(10)\" of the Criminal Code.24 The Court has also insisted that \"[a]ll those involved in the bail system\" must be guided by the principle of restraint.25 Caveats to the application of the Gladue principles to bail decisions While there is some overlap in terms of their emphasis on restraint, the legal principles governing bail are not conducive to an unmodified application of the Gladue principles. As pointed out by Judge Agnew of the Saskatchewan Provincial Court in Heathen, the presumption of innocence is the first principle to be applied to bail, making it problematic to rely on sentencing objectives designed for those found guilty, such as rehabilitation.26 According to Justice Bychok of the Nunavut Court of Justice in Jaypoody, rather than being concerned with moral culpability, the statutory grounds for justifying pre-trial detention are all primarily aimed at the assessment of risk, whether this is the accused person's flight risk, the substantial likelihood they will reoffend, the substantial likelihood they will interfere with the administration of justice, or the risk of a loss of public confidence in the justice system.27 Furthermore, as pointed out by Judge Galiatsatos of the Court of Quebec in Penosway, there is no role for general sentencing principles like deterrence, denunciation, and retribution, nor their attenuation in light of the Gladue principles at the bail stage.28 All these caveats are likely to have continuing relevance regardless of the subsequent amendments to the Criminal Code.29 Judge Doulis of the British Columbia Provincial Court has provided his own succinct description of the potential disconnect between the Gladue principles applied in sentencing and the relevant statutory considerations for a bail hearing in MLB: Gladue stands for two propositions: Indigenous offenders may have reduced moral culpability for their criminal actions due to historical personal factors, and they may share a different 24 Zora, supra note 6 at para 24. 25 Ibid at para 6. 26 Heathen, supra note 8 at 29. 8 at paras 90-91. 7 at 3975 at para 10 [Gaudet].305 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 worldview such that traditional punitive principles of sentencing are not appropriate[,] requiring the court to consider restorative justice options. Both are principles of sentencing which assume the offender is guilty of the crime. At the bail stage, accused persons are presumptively innocent. The court does not inquire into their moral culpability or the effectiveness of punitive sentences, [but] rather, whether they will come to court, re-offend pending trial, or if their release would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.30 Yet in spite of these concerns\u2014and now bolstered by clear statutory direction\u2014existing case law provides clear guidance on how an Indigenous accused's unique circumstances can play a significant role in bail hearings without losing sight of the presumption of innocence. According to Judge Doulis, even the Supreme Court's more general guidance with respect to bail requires judges to be mindful of the presumption of innocence \"and not detain persons, including Indigenous persons, who would otherwise be releasable but for the fact their personal circumstances (such as poverty, family dysfunction, or mental health) limit their ability to put forth a perfect bail plan, residence, surety, or cash bail to secure their release\".31 As summarized below, a basis for this third proposition can also be identified in Gladue and Ipeelee without regard to either moral blameworthiness or the sentencing objectives specific to individuals who are already determined to be guilty. Assessing bail criteria and release plans in light of systemic discrimination in bail Some courts have applied the Gladue principles to bail in the sense of being attentive to any systemic impacts the criteria for bail might have when applied to an Indigenous accused and their proposed sureties. This is closely linked to the first prong of the Gladue analysis in sentencing, which demands attention to the systemic and background factors that played a role in that individual coming before the court. While the impact of these factors on moral blameworthiness has limited relevance in bail decisions, systemic and background factors are also key to ameliorating systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system more broadly. As the Supreme Court pointed out in both Gladue and Ipeelee, reliance on 30 R v MLB, 2019 BCPC 218 at para 60. 31 Ibid at para 65.306 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D facially neutral socioeconomic factors such as employment status, level of education, and family situation in sentencing has disproportionate impacts on Indigenous people due to the higher rates at which they are socially and economically marginalized.32 In Ipeelee, the Court pointed out that \"[s]entencing judges, as front-line workers in the criminal justice system, are in the best position to re-evaluate these criteria to ensure that they are not contributing to ongoing systemic discrimination\".33 In Magill, Judge Ruddy of the Territorial Court of Yukon pointed out that the same risk of systemic discrimination against Indigenous people in sentencing will also arise in bail decisions whenever facially neutral socioeconomic factors like employment status and family situation are relied upon in support of detention: These socioeconomic factors play an equally, if not more important, role at the bail stage of a criminal charge. An accused with a poor employment record, substance abuse issues and an unstable family and community support network is more likely to be detained, even though these are the very results that flow from the Canadian history of colonialism, dislocation and residential schools. A judge has the obligation to evaluate the application of bail criteria to ensure that the result does not serve to perpetuate systemic racial discrimination.34 In her application of this approach, Judge Ruddy accepted a proposed release plan for Mr. Magill, who was facing charges that included impaired driving causing death, obstruction of justice, and failing to abide by the abstain condition of release orders.35 In spite of Mr. Magill's charge for breaching an abstain condition in the past, she was satisfied that his release plan included \"intensive, culturally appropriate treatment\" that significantly increased the likelihood of compliance.36 Judge Ruddy viewed Mr. Magill's alcoholism and alcohol-related charges in context to his home community, Ross River, where alcohol consumption was \"extremely high\" and where there was a higher rate of offending in comparison to other Yukon communities.37 Judge Ruddy found that culturally appropriate counselling and treatment could address the risks 32 Gladue, supra note 1 at para 67; para 67. note 1 at para 67. 34 Magill, supra note 7 at para 26. 35 Magill, supra note 7 at para 1. Ibid 50. 37 Ibid at paras 30-31.307 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 assessed in the bail hearing, such as flight risk (i.e. the primary ground for pre-trial detention). A broadly similar approach can be seen in cases from other jurisdictions.38 For instance, Justice Lee of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench applied the Gladue principles in a bail decision involving an Indigenous accused with a history of administration of justice offences in DD(P).39 The accused was found to have alcohol and drug addictions that required \"immediate treatment\" and that were related to the \"very tragic circumstances\" of his upbringing, and these unique circumstances were said to \"undoubtedly dovetail\" with many of his past convictions.40 In light of this, Justice Lee accepted a release plan in which the accused would attend a six-week Salvation Army treatment program in spite of a \"horrendous\" criminal record that included numerous administration of justice offences.41 Some of the language in this short decision has received criticism from other members of the bench, particularly its references to rehabilitation.42 However, Justice Lee's approach does demonstrate how systemic and background factors shed light on an accused's criminal record at the bail stage. Rather than uncritically relying on that record to deny release, he accepted a release plan that addressed the addictions he found to have played a part in both the past offences and present charges faced by the accused. In Duncan, Justice Kent of the British Columbia Supreme Court applied a similar lens to a release plan proposed for an Indigenous accused who has a history of personal and intergenerational addictions and poverty linked to broader systemic and background factors.43 The accused also had what Justice Kent described as an \"abysmal record of repeated criminal activity (multiple B&E's), failures to report and other breaches of increasingly stringent bail conditions\".44 Yet he was satisfied that a release plan involving attendance at an isolated residential treatment program and strict mobility restrictions, combined with Mr. Duncan's genuine intention to deal with his addictions, reduced any risk to public 38 See for example: Pitawanakwat, supra note 7; R ABQB 228 at para 90. 39 DD(P), supra note 7. 40 Ibid at at para 7 at para 108. 10. 44 Ibid at para 32.308 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D safety to an acceptable level.45 The residential treatment program would last a minimum of six months, require complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol, and offer a variety of both general and cultural programming, including talking circles, a sweat lodge, and Indigenous arts and crafts.46 The Court was satisfied that participation in this program combined with strict mobility restrictions \"would be a culturally responsive and appropriate application of the Gladue factors in this particular case\".47 Rather than invoking rehabilitation, Justice Kent's approach was framed around the Supreme Court's guidance in Myers that release into treatment with appropriate conditions can provide a less onerous alternative to remand while still addressing the risks posed by the accused and the root causes of their alleged criminal behaviour.48 In Quannaaluk, Judge Galiatsatos of the Court of Quebec considered systemic factors in addressing judicial interim release for an Inuk woman struggling with alcoholism who was charged with various breaches of a supervised probation order, including conditions relating to abstinence. In context to her risk of recidivism, Judge Galiatsatos noted that courts have a \"general (though not absolute) aversion to incarcerating individuals for their mere inability to respect abstinence conditions\" since the accused's addiction may pose \"a real risk of perpetual re- incarceration\".49 In this case, the accused did not have a concrete history of violence when intoxicated, she had acquired an impressive amount of structure in her life in the preceding months (including obtaining housing), she had the support of a dedicated social worker, and she was regularly accessing social and cultural programming.50 Judge Galiatsatos noted that her efforts had been \"imperfect\u2014even outright deficient\u2014in many regards\", but Ms. Quannaaluk had nevertheless made considerable progress in addressing her addiction and developing structure in her life, factors which \"ought not be disregarded\".51 The Court was concerned that preventive incarceration might compromise these efforts in a way that would render Ms. Quannaaluk less structured and therefore more dangerous.52 45 Ibid at para 33. 46 Ibid at para 47 Ibid at para 38. 48 Ibid at para 28, citing Myers, supra note 3 at para 67. 49 Quannaaluk, supra note 10 at para Ibid 51 Ibid at para 114. 52 Ibid.309 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 Judge Galiatsatos noted that \"[t]he battle of alcoholism is not one that is won overnight\" and \"[i]t often comes with setbacks and relapses\", and these evolving and dynamic circumstances must be accounted for in bail.53 He contextualized this substance abuse issue as \"an understandable and foreseeable tragic by-product\" of how Ms. Quannaaluk was \"brutally victimized by countless men for several decades\", stretching back to her childhood.54 Likewise, the available Indigenous-focused programming was relevant to Ms. Quannaaluk's ability to address her risk of recidivism, and her circumstances meant interim detention would have a disproportionate adverse impact, effectively reverting her to a state of homelessness upon release, \"which would inescapable aggravate her addiction problems\" and \"leave society in a no better state\".55 Judge Galiatsatos instead imposed conditions that focused on her risk of violence while intoxicated, prohibiting her from possessing knives and placing restrictions to avoid potentially violent men visiting her apartment since she had been convicted of stabbing and killing an abusive partner.56 Other courts have also accepted that an Indigenous accused's systemic and background factors might shed light on their criminal record in ways that are relevant to the statutory grounds for pre-trial detention.57 For example, a lengthy record of offences involving a failure to comply with court orders may need to be contextualized by the systemic issues identified in Zora , Antic, and Myers, such as widespread issues with how bail conditions are imposed and the incentivizing effect of pre-trial custody on guilty pleas, especially for more minor offences.58 Addictions may be important context for alcohol or drug-related convictions.59 Over-policing could have relevance to their criminal record as well.60 If the accused's circumstances include cognitive deficits, such as those linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, this could also shed light on an existing pattern of breaches that requires some form of accommodation in bail decisions.61 53 Ibid. 54 Ibid at para 115. para 56 at paras 118-126. 57 at paras 37-38, supra note 6 at 355. 58 EB, supra note 10 at paras 48-49. 60 v Le, 2019 SCC at R v King, 2019 ONSC 6851 at paras 61 TJ( at paras 56-58.310 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D Some courts have concluded that high unemployment rates in Indigenous communities require close attention to the impacts of pre- trial detention on an Indigenous accused's own employment prospects.62 At the same time, this factor might also explain why the accused's employment record remains sparse, making this something that should not be over-emphasized when assessing their flight risk.63 Social and economic disadvantages may render the restrictive release condition of a cash deposit inappropriate or provide context for why a smaller cash deposit would be appropriate.64 Similar disadvantages may even reduce flight risk where the accused lacks the means to permanently abscond from the jurisdiction.65 Systemic and background factors could also explain a lack of suitable sureties for an Indigenous accused.66 And if Crown counsel rely on actuarial risk assessment tools in bail hearings for Indigenous accused these could raise the same concerns with respect to their validity, potential cultural bias, and contribution to systemic discrimination that have been canvassed by the courts in other contexts.67 In some cases, the unique circumstances of an Indigenous accused might appear relevant to the statutory grounds for pre-trial detention in ways that invite adverse treatment on the basis of factors closely linked to their Indigeneity. For example, in Hope , the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected the Crown's attempt to rely on the unique circumstances of an Indigenous accused and his sureties as favouring pre-trial detention. First, the Crown argued Mr. Hope was a flight risk as he was allegedly able to travel to the United States without a passport due to his 62 See for example: Silversmith, supra note 7 7 at para 121. 63 Daniels, supra note 7 at paras 37, 39-40. 64 See for Fuller, supra note paras 27-28; Duncan, note 10 at paras 29, 54. 65 Daniels, supra note 7 at para 41. 66 note 10 at paras at paras 100-122, aff 'd 2020 BCCA 23, leave to appeal to SCC ref 'd 39262 (26 November 2020); R v Gracie, 2019 ONCA 658 at para 51; R v Durocher, 2019 v 211 32.311 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 \"aboriginal status\".68 However, the Court of Appeal did not find this to be a significant concern in light of Mr. Hope's social network and community ties in Canada, including a fianc\u00e9e.69 Second, the Crown took issue with Mr. Hope's sureties as they pledged amounts secured by the equity in their homes on reserve, which could be immune to creditors' remedies by virtue of s 89 of the Indian Act.70 The Court of Appeal cautioned that \"the protection afforded to people of aboriginal descent provided under the Indian Act should not interfere with their right, in circumstances that are otherwise warranted, to secure release from detention\".71 It also suggested that the Crown's ability to execute against the properties willingly pledged in support of Mr. Hope was somewhat beside the point. The Court of Appeal appears to have been sensitive to the risk of discriminatory treatment of Indigenous accused and sureties that was inherent in both these arguments. Calibrating bail conditions to avoid contributing to systemic discrimination Some courts have highlighted how inappropriate bail conditions can further contribute to systemic discrimination and Indigenous over- incarceration. For example, Judge Lortie of the Court of Quebec pointed to some of the findings of the commission of inquiry led by retired justice Jacques Viens on this topic in Dub\u00e9 . Among other things, the Viens Commission found that court orders may be impossible to respect in some Indigenous communities due to housing shortages, generalized problems with substance abuse, a lack of therapeutic resources, and the small size of the communities if this means an accused will inevitably be in contact with victims.72 Judge Lortie found that these systemic issues helped put the accused's past record of administration of justice 68 Hope, supra note 7 at para 18.

However, \"[w]here the victim is ambivalent to or repeatedly disregards such a condition, imposing a 'no go / no contact' condition merely serves to perpetuate the overrepresentation of aboriginals in pre-trial detention facilities\".77 In R v A(M), Justice of the Peace Murdoch-Flowers of the Nunavut Court of Justice drew attention to the risk that bail conditions prohibiting alcohol consumption might dissuade Inuit women from reporting acts of violence against them to the police due to the fear of being charged themselves if intoxicated.78 This was a sentencing decision for an Inuk woman charged with breaching a no-alcohol bail condition after she reported a domestic assault against her, and the Justice of the Peace pointed out that he had heard a case with \"near identical\" circumstances one year prior.79 He also noted that the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls raised this very issue in its final report, and other reports specific to Inuit shed light on systemic and background reasons for widespread distrust of police.80 73 Ibid at paras 42, 44. 74 See: R v Omeasoo, ABPC 328 [Omeasoo]; R 75 Omeasoo, supra note 74 at paras 37, 42, 44. 76 Rowan, supra note 74 at para 43. 77 Ibid at para 45. 78 R v A(M), 2020 NUCJ 4.

In Ugyuk, Justice Cooper of the Nunavut Court of Justice pointed out that a multiplicity of release documents could lead to confusion over bail conditions if an accused accrues additional charges after they are first released and then is released with additional or varied conditions.81 For this reason, she urged that \"the best approach is to vacate the earlier release documents and put all charges and conditions on one document\".82 While this guidance was not explicitly linked to the Indigeneity of the accused in this case or any systemic factors he faced, Justice Cooper noted elsewhere that Mr. Ugyuk had a grade 5 education, was unemployed, suffered from an undisclosed form of disability, addiction issues, and possible mental health issues, and was living homeless in a shack in a remote community due to his estrangement from his family.83 These were listed as disadvantages of particular relevance to the overall assessment of the reasonableness of his bail conditions pursuant to the direction in s. 493.2 of the Code and Zora .84 These cases indicate how both individual and community-level systemic and background factors can be relevant to whether particular bail conditions are reasonable for Indigenous accused. The Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged similar concerns in Zora , citing Omeasoo with approval among other cases and secondary sources on this topic.85 Indigenous Women and Girls, Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (Ottawa: Government of Canada, 2018) at 628-629; Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada, Addressing Gendered Violence against Inuit Women: A review of police policies and practices in Inuit Nunangat (Ottawa: Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada, 2020). 81 R v Ugyuk, 2020 NUCJ 27 at paras 39-40, 44. 82 Ibid para 79.314 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D Attention to an Indigenous accused's culture, beliefs, laws, or community standards Some courts have also taken into consideration an Indigenous accused's culture, beliefs, legal traditions, and community standards in applying the statutory provisions for bail. This appears to be analogous to the consideration of culturally appropriate sanctions and procedures at the second prong of the Gladue analysis. In Jaypoody, for instance, Justice Bychok of the Nunavut Court of Justice accepted that an Inuk's risk of recidivism could feasibly be reduced by releasing them \"into the hands of an elder in a traditional outpost camp\" where they will be \"away from the idleness created by too few jobs, away from the stresses of overcrowding, away from the abuse of legal or bootlegged alcohol, away from the pressures of negative peer groups, and back to a purposeful and traditional way of life\".86 He described this as applying the statutory law of pre-trial bail \"in the context of community standards and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit\" or \"Inuit social governance\".87 This culturally sensitive approach to the statutory provisions governing bail was first explicitly set out in the Brant and Silversmith decisions of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.88 In Brant, Justice Parfett listed three unique considerations as part of a \"broader analysis\" to be undertaken when addressing bail for Indigenous accused: ...the Court must look at whether the sureties offered, in the context of the Aboriginal culture, can control the accused's behaviour. The Court must also look at whether detention of the Aboriginal accused has a disproportionately negative impact on that accused, and whether that impact could be alleviated by strict bail considerations. Finally, the Court must look at whether Aboriginal law and customs provide the assurances of attendance in court and protection of the public that are required for release.89 Justice Parfett had before her a proposal for Mr. Brant to stay with his brother and his mother in the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory in 86 Jaypoody, supra note 8 at para 97. 87 Ibid 98. 88 7 at para 21.315 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 Ontario. Defence counsel proposed that both Mr. Brant's brother and an Elder of the community would act as his sureties, he would be required to take direction from them, and he would be required to abide by a curfew, maintain his current employment, and report to the local police force, among other conditions.90 Justice Parfett accepted evidence to the effect that the Tyendinaga Mohawk community is a matrilineal society where a mother or a female Elder's orders would be complied with, and where a failure to abide by conditions that would place such a woman in legal jeopardy \"would be viewed very negatively by the community and might result in the offender being shunned\".91 She also found that the Tyendinaga Mohawk community as a whole had taken responsibility for Mr. Brant and committed to assist him by raising a deposit of money through community donations.92 Finally, Justice Parfett took into account the \"very negative impact\" of incarceration on Mr. Brant in terms of separating him from his community and his community responsibilities, as well as his loss of a sense of identity, which was \"inextricably bound up with his responsibilities towards the community\".93 In light of all this, Mr. Brant was released into the community on a recognizance with conditions, sureties, and a deposit of money. This same approach was then applied to similar circumstances in Silversmith. In Trudeau, Justice Hennessy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice also adopted a contextual and culturally sensitive approach in assessing an Indigenous accused's mother as a proposed surety. She found the accused's mother to be \"a proper and suitable surety, with deep roots in her community and a strong bond and relationship with her accused daughter and the proposed co-sureties\".94 Justice Hennessy found these characteristics could suffice in the absence of material assets: Let me comment on the Crown's submission that the system is all about the money. Certainly, there are sureties who pledge great sums of money or assets which are worth great sums of money. These are people who have significant assets. And for some of these people, their material assets are their most valuable assets. Shirley Trudeau, however, does not have access to great wealth nor has she accumulated material assets of great 90 Ibid at para 25. 91 Ibid at para 26. 92 Ibid at para 27. 93 Ibid at para 28. 94 supra note 7 at para 53.316 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D value. In this way she is not much different than many people who live in Wikwemikong. But her promise and her standing in the community of her family and her ancestors are also assets. Perhaps they are her greatest assets, and these are the assets she will put at risk should she not fulfill her duties as a surety.95 Paying closer attention to Indigenous community standards and perspectives may also raise concerns for release. In Trodd , members of the Magnetewan First Nation expressed their apprehension over Mr. Trodd being released without adequate safeguards.96 The Chief of the Magnetewan First Nation gave evidence at the bail hearing that \"made it clear that he was looking to the judicial system to protect the community\" and \"he did not propose that the community had the means to do so\".97 Many of Mr. Trodd's prior victims were community members and Justice Koke held that community support was therefore \"imperative\" for his release plan to succeed, though \"sadly\" there was no evidence of it.98 Mr. Trodd's mother was proposed as a surety with high status and important roles in the community but she was in denial of her son's criminal conduct and viewed him as a victim.99 While Justice Koke accepted that this was clearly \"the type of case which the Supreme Court attempted to address in the Gladue decision\", the lack of any community support for Mr. Trodd's plan and the denials of his sureties resulted in continued pre-trial custody.100 In Magill, Judge Ruddy also considered the Brant factors when assessing Mr. Magill's connections to the small, close-knit Indigenous community of Ross River and how these connections favoured release in this case. She took note of his many ties with Ross River, including community members who attended the court proceedings in support of either him or the victim in Whitehorse a four-hour drive away. Judge Ruddy found this to be relevant to whether his proposed surety could control his behaviour in context to his culture and community since \"in a very real sense, the eyes of Ross River are on him\".101 95 Ibid at para 52. 96 Trodd, supra note at para 21. 97 Ibid. 98 at para 53. at para 41.317 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 Public confidence in the administration of justice must account for Gladue principles The Gladue principles might also have particular relevance to the tertiary ground for pre-trial detention. This requires courts to consider confidence in the administration of justice from the perspective of a reasonable member of the public who is \"familiar with the basics of the rule of law in our country and with the fundamental values of our criminal law, including those that are protected by the Charter\".102 Several courts have accepted that a reasonable member of the public should be presumed to be cognizant of the systemic and background factors that impact Indigenous people in the criminal justice system when applying this standard.103 As Judge Galiatsatos stated in Penosway, \"[t]oday, Canadian society is sensitive to and fully aware of the problem of the over-representation of Aboriginal persons in the prison system\".104 Case-specific information may be necessary but full reports are not always feasible Several courts have accepted that the Gladue principles apply to bail decisions only to find themselves unable to employ them meaningfully without adequate case-specific information.105 In Takakenew, for example, Judge Wolf of the British Columbia Provincial Court was advised that the two accused before him were Indigenous and he was alive to the potential relevance of the Gladue principles. Yet he had no information regarding the nation they were from, if they were members of a band with community supports, or whether any other alternatives were available.106 This makes it challenging to meaningfully apply the Gladue principles 102 St-Cloud, supra note 12 at para 79. 103 See supra note note note 7 at para 186. 105 See for example: Rich, supra note 7 at paras 7 at para 80; R v McGrath, 2020 ONCJ 192 at para R v BMD, 2020 at v at at paras 41-42.318 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D in bail beyond more generalized attention to systemic issues or judicial notice of local conditions and broader background factors.107 On the other hand, ordering the preparation of lengthy, comprehensive Gladue reports or pre-sentence reports for bail hearings may be inappropriate given the likelihood of this leading to delay, inconvenience, and additional expense in proceedings that are by their very nature meant to be summary and short notice.108 In light of this, the need for case-specific information with respect to the unique circumstances of an Indigenous accused has been described as \"necessarily relaxed in the bail hearing context\".109 In some cases there may already be a Gladue report available prior to the bail hearing based on past interactions of the accused with the criminal justice system, in which case this could be directly placed before the court or updated for bail purposes.110 A prior sentencing decision might adequately summarize these circumstances as well.111 In Louie, the British Columbia Court of Appeal expected to find similar information in the release plan for an Indigenous accused by way of reliable if not sworn statements from family and community members addressing the circumstances of their supports, proposed residence, and employment opportunities.112 As addressed in Chapter 11, while a Gladue report may be the preferable tool for obtaining this type of information in the sentencing context, it is not the exclusive means. Emphasizing the substance of Gladue information before the court over its form, taking judicial notice of generalizable circumstances, and making reasonable inferences may be particularly appropriate in context to the pre-trial detention of an Indigenous person who remains legally innocent and entitled to full recognition of that status. 107 See for example R v MM, 2020 ONSC 3990 at para 12. 108 Magill, supra note para 28. 109 Ibid. See also EB, supra note 10 at paras at para note 105 10 at 7 at para 36.319 Chapter 13: Bail Hearings CHAPTER 13 Conclusion While the Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on the relevancy of the Gladue principles to bail and some courts have expressed concerns with this approach in the past, s 493.2(a) of the Criminal Code now explicitly requires particular attention to the circumstances of an Indigenous accused. This extension of the Gladue principles therefore seems unlikely to excite further controversy to the extent that these principles are understood more broadly than just an inquiry into moral blameworthiness and sentencing objectives. The Supreme Court's decisions in Gladue, Wells, and Ipeelee also address the systemic discrimination Indigenous people face throughout the justice system, the potential for prison to impact them more adversely, and how a failure to accommodate their cultural differences and distinct legal perspectives can reinforce both alienation and disparity in outcomes. These principles are more easily imported into the bail context and have been taken into account by courts in ways that respect the significant differences between sentencing proceedings and bail hearings. In doing so, this emerging jurisprudence may also bring the meaning of some of these principles into starker relief for sentencing proceedings as well.320 CHAPTER 14: DANGEROUS OFFENDERS The Supreme Court of Canada briefly touched on the role that the Gladue principles play in dangerous offender applications under the Criminal Code in Boutilier.1 Yet this case did not involve an application to designate an Indigenous person as a dangerous offender. Instead, the Gladue principles were considered in context to a broader Charter analysis of the provisions setting out the dangerous offender regime. More detailed consideration of the role of the Gladue principles in dangerous offender applications has been provided by lower courts in cases where they directly address the unique circumstances of Indigenous people. However, the focus of this chapter will be on cases that have been decided since 2017 as the Supreme Court's decision in Boutilier clarified how courts need to approach dangerous offender applications in order to remain Charter-compliant and in doing so it overturned or clarified several aspects of the lower court jurisprudence that preceded it. A clarification of the law in Boutilier The Supreme Court of Canada took the Boutilier appeal as an opportunity to address how the dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code must be interpreted in order to remain within the constitutional bounds of the Charter, which it turn required attention to s 718.2(e) and other principles and objectives of sentencing. While the matter was before the sentencing judge, Mr. Boutilier pleaded guilty to six charges related to a pharmacy robbery and car chase, the Crown applied to have him designated a dangerous offender subject to an indeterminate sentence, and Mr. Boutilier initiated a constitutional challenge in response. The sentencing judge concluded that one of two provisions challenged by Mr. Boutilier was unconstitutionally overbroad\u2014namely s 753(1), which sets out the criteria to designate someone a dangerous offender. Yet Mr. Boutilier was nonetheless designated a dangerous offender 1 R v Boutilier, 2017 SCC 64 [Boutilier].321 Chapter 14: Dangerous OffendersCHAPTER 14 and an indeterminate sentence was imposed. Both parties appealed. The Court of Appeal concluded both provisions were constitutionally sound and upheld both the designation and the sentence. Mr. Boutilier's further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was also dismissed, with the majority confirming the constitutionality of the impugned provisions and the designation and indeterminate sentence imposed on him. However, Justice Karakatsanis partially dissented on the basis that the dangerous offender regime's emphasis on public safety risks the imposition of grossly disproportionate (and thus unconstitutional) sentences, especially for Indigenous persons. In contrast, the majority's approach focused on providing an interpretation of this statutory regime that ensures constitutional boundaries are respected. The dangerous offender regime involves a \"two stage\" process.2 First, there is the \"designation stage\" in which the statutory requirements set out at s 753(1) must be met before a court is able to designate someone as dangerous.3 This stage involves four criteria: (1) whether the predicate offence is a \"serious personal injury offence\", as listed at s 752 of the Criminal Code; (2) whether the offence is part of a broader pattern of violence; (3) whether there is a high likelihood of harmful recidivism; and (4) whether the violent conduct is intractable.4 The third and fourth criteria are future-oriented and thus require a prospective assessment of someone's dangerousness.5 Second, there is the sentencing or \"penalty stage\" in which a court determines whether to sentence someone found to be a dangerous offender to: (a) an indeterminate period of detention in a penitentiary; (b) a sentence for the offence for which they have been convicted followed by a long-term supervision order; or (c) solely a sentence for the offence for which they have been convicted.6 These three possibilities are set out at s 753(4) of the Criminal Code. Section 753(4.1) further states that the court must impose an indeterminate sentence unless satisfied that there is \"a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure [...] will adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of murder or a serious personal injury offence\". Sections 753(1) & (4.1) were challenged under sections 7 and 12 of the Charter. 2 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J at para 13. 3 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 para 15.322 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D The two provisions challenged by Mr. Boutilier were impacted by amendments to the Criminal Code in 2008 that removed discretionary language from the designation stage of the dangerous offender regime. As a result of these changes, \"[i]f a sentencing judge is satisfied that the statutory criteria have been met, the designation must follow\".7 Yet the Supreme Court noted that some discretion has been retained at the penalty stage. The sentencing judge \"must impose an indeterminate sentence on a designated individual unless he or she is satisfied that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure will adequately protect the public\".8 The finer details of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Criminal Code and its clarification of the dangerous offender regime go beyond the scope of this publication and its focus on the Gladue principles. In summary, however, the majority clarified that\u2014contrary to some of the prior lower court jurisprudence\u2014sentencing judges must continue to consider an individual's future treatment prospects at the designation stage as part of their assessment of the future risk they pose to public safety in spite of the 2008 amendments. It also clarified that the regime does not impose any presumption of an indeterminate detention for individuals designated as dangerous offenders \"[n]or does it prevent a sentencing judge from considering sentencing objectives and principles\".9 The majority held that its interpretation ensures that s 753(4.1) \"will not result in grossly disproportionate sentences or the imposition of a detention of indeterminate duration in cases where such a sentence is unfit\".10 It held that when properly interpreted, the availability of indeterminate detention is limited to \"a narrow group of offenders that are dangerous per se\".11 Moreover, a long-term supervision order \"remains available for dangerous offenders who can be controlled in the community in a manner that adequately protects the public from murder or a serious personal injury offence\".12 Finally, the majority upheld the sentencing judge's initial decision to sentence Mr. Boutilier to an indeterminate period of detention as consistent with its clarification of the process for designating dangerous offenders. 7 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J at para 20. 8 Ibid. 9 at 10 para 76.323 Chapter 14: Dangerous OffendersCHAPTER 14 Future treatment prospects must be considered at both stages While some prior lower court case law had suggested otherwise, the majority judgment in Boutilier is unequivocal that evidence of future treatment prospects must be considered at both the designation stage and the penalty stage. The Court held that \"an offender cannot be designated as dangerous unless the judge concludes that he or she is a future 'threat' after a prospective assessment of risk\" and \"future risk assessment has always required consideration of future treatment prospects\".13 In other words, the designation stage will not capture those \"who, though currently a threat to others, may cease to be in the future, notably after successful treatment\".14 This future-oriented assessment requires Crown counsel to establish that someone's pattern of violent conduct \" is very likely to continue and to result in the kind of suffering against which the section seeks to protect, namely, conduct endangering the life, safety or physical well-being of others or, in the case of sexual offences, conduct causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons\".15 The sentencing judge must be satisfied that their pattern of conduct is \" substantially or pathologically intractable \".16 The majority interpreted \"intractable\" as meaning \"behaviour that the offender is unable to surmount\".17 It also overturned a line of cases that had erroneously concluded that there was no longer a need to prove intractability in light of the 2008 amendments to the Criminal Code.18 Dangerous offender applications are typically conducted in one hearing and the evidence presented to a sentencing judge with respect to someone's future treatment prospects will be relevant to both stages, albeit in different ways. In the words of the majority, \"[a]ll of the evidence adduced during a dangerous offender hearing must be considered at both stages of the sentencing judge's analysis, though for the purpose of making different findings related to different legal criteria\".19 For example, clinical evaluations provide evidence regarding personality traits or disorders, substance use disorders, and patterns of behaviour that are relevant to both an assessment of future risk and the sentence that will be necessary to 13 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J at para 23. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid, quoting from R v Lyons, [1987] 2 SCR 309 at 338, 1987 CanLII 25. 16 Ibid. 17 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J 44.324 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D manage that risk.20 Someone will not be designated as dangerous \"if their treatment prospects are so compelling that the sentencing judge cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they present a high likelihood of harmful recidivism or that their violent pattern is intractable\".21 Where these future treatment prospects are not sufficiently compelling to affect the designation decision, \"they will still be relevant in choosing the sentence required to adequately protect the public\".22 Proportionality and the Gladue principles must be applied at the penalty stage Of particular importance to the Gladue principles, both the majority and the dissent in Boutilier interpreted the sentencing judge's role at the penalty stage as requiring the application of \"the sentencing principles and mandatory guidelines outlined in ss. 718 to 718.2\".23 This includes \"the fundamental principle of proportionality\" among other mandatory sentencing principles.24 The majority cautioned that \"[a]n error in the application of these principles is reviewable by an appellate court\".25 While public protection is an enhanced sentencing objective for those who have been designated as dangerous, this does not mean this objective \"operates to the exclusion of others\".26 The majority stated that the Criminal Code's sentencing principles\u2014 including the Gladue principles\u2014\"apply to every sentencing decision, whether made under the regular sentencing regime, the dangerous offender regime or the long-term offender regime\".27 It emphasized that \"an offender's moral culpability, the seriousness of the offence, mitigating factors, and principles developed for Indigenous offenders are each part of the sentencing process under the dangerous offender scheme\" and each \"is relevant to deciding whether or not a lesser sentence would sufficiently protect the public\".28 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J at J at para Karakatsanis J para dissenting. 24 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J at para 53, Karakatsanis J at para 107, dissenting. 25 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J at para 53, citing R v Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64. 26 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J at para C\u00f4t\u00e9 para 63.325 Chapter 14: Dangerous OffendersCHAPTER 14 In the partially dissenting reasons of Justice Karakatsanis she also affirmed the relevance of the Gladue principles in this context. She noted that Indigenous people are not only overrepresented in Canadian prisons in general, they are \"especially [overrepresented] in the dangerous offender population\".29 She highlighted the Supreme Court's past recognition that \"racism, colonialism, and intergenerational trauma inform this disturbing statistic\".30 Justice Karakatsanis also reiterated that \"the systemic disadvantages and marginalization faced by Indigenous people inform moral blameworthiness and therefore the proportionality of sentences for Indigenous offenders\".31 Furthermore, she recited the two categories of unique circumstances that must be considered under the Gladue analysis, as explored in detail earlier in this book. The principle of restraint guides the penalty stage The majority and dissent also agreed that the principle of restraint applies to the penalty stage of the dangerous offender scheme.32 This principle \"dictate[s] that a judge ought to impose an indeterminate sentence only in those instances in which there does not exist a less restrictive means by which to protect the public adequately from the threat of harm\".33 If public protection can be achieved without indeterminate detention then it would overshoot this goal to impose such a penalty.34 Justice Karakatsanis dissents on risk of grossly disproportionate sentences Justice Karakatsanis agreed with the majority's view that the designation of an individual as a dangerous offender \"calls for consideration of their future treatment prospects, and thus is not unconstitutionally overbroad on that basis\".35 However, she did dissent with respect to the 29 Ibid, at Karakatsanis J at para 107, citing Canada, Public Safety Canada Portfolio Corrections Statistics Committee, Corrections and Conditional Release Statistical Overview (2015 Annual Report). 30 Ibid. 31 Ibid, citing R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 at para 32 Ibid, at 109. 33 Ibid, Karakatsanis J at para 109, citing R v Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 at para 29. 34 Ibid, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J para 91.326 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D constitutionality of the penalty stage's \"singular focus\" on public safety, concluding that this would impose indeterminate detention in cases where doing so would be grossly disproportionate to the sentence mandated by the principles in the Criminal Code, thus violating s 12 of the Charter in a way that cannot be saved by s 1.36 In her view, the overriding emphasis placed on the level of risk and the nature of future harm likely to be caused by the individual designated a dangerous offender at the penalty stage requires indeterminate detention without adequate discretion for the consideration of their moral blameworthiness, \"even if this sentence is inconsistent with Gladue principles\".37 While Justice Karakatsanis did not differ from the majority in her view that s 718.2(e) and other sentencing principles must be considered at the penalty stage, she differed in her view of the constitutionality of constraints on their relevance to the sentence in the current statutory regime. She pointed out that regardless of questions of proportionality, if there is no evidence of community supervision programs or it is unknown whether the individual will be amenable to treatment, indeterminate detention will be imposed.38 She emphasized the potential for this to result in grossly disproportionate sentences that fail to consider factors impacting moral blameworthiness such as addiction and its links to poverty and childhood abuse or the roots of someone's criminality in intergenerational trauma.39 Justice Karakatsanis found it \"particularly distressing\" that the penalty stage constrains the application of the Gladue principles in light of the fact that \"Indigenous offenders are significantly overrepresented in the dangerous offender population\".40 The application of the Gladue principles at the designation stage One question the Supreme Court did not address in Boutilier was whether (and how) the Gladue principles might inform the designation stage of the dangerous offender regime. There is some precedent for doing so under an earlier version of the regime, albeit dated. In George, the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that childhood aggression and adult 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid, Karakatsanis J at para 117. 124.327 Chapter 14: Dangerous OffendersCHAPTER 14 criminality must be differentiated when assessing whether a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour has been established, particularly for an Indigenous person given the direction in s 718.2(e).41 The Court of Appeal made this distinction to ensure the provisions do not \"fall more heavily on the poor and disadvantaged members of our society\"\u2014in that case, an Indigenous foster child with significant cognitive deficits who was raised in a non-Indigenous culture.42 Yet most pre-Boutilier case law suggests the Gladue principles are not relevant when assessing whether an Indigenous person meets the statutory criteria for designation as a dangerous offender set out in s 753(1).43 On the other hand, the pre-Boutilier case law does suggest the Gladue principles will be relevant to whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventually controlling someone's risk of recidivism in the community, in which case a long-term offender designation may be more appropriate.44 According to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, this assessment requires the sentencing judge to turn their mind to whether there are any \"alternative Aboriginal-focused means aimed at addressing the environmental, psychological or other circumstances which aggravate the risk of reoffending posed by the Aboriginal offender in question\".45 Where alternative means are suitable and available they may \"enhance the cogency of the possibility of eventual control of the risk that the Aboriginal offender will reoffend in the community\".46 This means the sentencing judge must assess \"the existence or non- existence\" of alternative means, as well as their \"availability, nature, suitability, and efficacy\".47 One measure of this might be evidence of past involvement in culturally relevant programming and whether this had a positive impact.48 41 R v George, [1998] BCJ 43 See R v Osborne, 2014 MBCA 73 at paras v Peekeekoot, 2014 SKCA 97 at paras 60-62, leave to appeal to SCC ref 'd 36186 (26 March 2015) [Peekeekoot]; R v Mattson, 2014 ABCA at para R Ibid. 45 Peekeekoot, supra note 43 at para 62, citing R v Standingwater, 2013 SKCA 78 at para 51 [Standingwater]. 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid. 48 See for example R v Monias, 2014 ABQB 147 at paras 56-61, 65, 68-70.328 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal further explained this approach in Moise where it held that it would be an error in principle for a sentencing judge to fail to take Gladue considerations into account when deciding whether someone ought to be designated as a dangerous offender or a long-term offender.49 While moral blameworthiness has a limited impact on the need for incarceration to protect the public, \"culturally sensitive programming and supports may make a difference to the offender's rehabilitation and management, within the community, of his or her risk to reoffend\".50 The Court of Appeal stated that \"[t]here must be a meaningful evaluation of any alternatives to incarceration including culturally sensitive programming, supports and safeguards available within and outside the Aboriginal community which may assist in rehabilitating the offender, reducing his or her risk to reoffend violently and managing his or her behaviour within the community\".51 As detailed above, the majority judgment in Boutilier clarified that an individual's future treatment prospects and the intractability of their behaviour must be considered at both stages of the dangerous offender analysis, with the result that all evidence adduced in these proceedings must be considered at both stages as well. Given this clarification, suitable and available Indigenous-focused options for treatment and rehabilitation will presumably have relevance to both the designation stage and the penalty stage of this statutory regime. Consistent with this view, the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal has insisted that thorough Gladue information is needed with respect to any available culturally sensitive programming so that a sentencing judge is in a position to analyze someone's \"future prospects for treatment, intractability, and appropriate sentence\".52 Moreover, several courts have either stated or implied that the Gladue principles are relevant at both stages of the dangerous offender regime since Boutilier was released.53 On the other hand, earlier case law suggesting the Gladue principles are 49 R v Moise, 2015 SKCA 39 at para 27. 50 Ibid 31 at paras 16-17. 51 Ibid at para 26. 52 R v Zoe, 2020 NWTCA 1 at para 58 [Zoe ]. 53 See for example: R v Wolfleg, 2018 ABCA 222 at paras 113, 126, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38542 (13 June 2019) [Wolfleg]; R v Broadfoot, 2018 ONCJ at at v Hunter, ABPC at paras 184, 221; R v Piche, 2019 54 at ABQB at para 59.329 Chapter 14: Dangerous OffendersCHAPTER 14 only relevant at the penalty phase still resurfaces in some cases.54 Yet the individualized, case-specific information contained in a Gladue report may nevertheless have relevance.55 The need for detailed case-specific information Another important topic not touched upon in Boutilier is the need for case-specific information when an Indigenous person is subject to dangerous offender proceedings. Several appellate courts have heard arguments to the effect that a sentencing judge erred by proceeding with a dangerous offender application in the absence of a Gladue report. In some cases, appellate courts have been satisfied by the level of case- specific information presented to the sentencing judge through other means such as expert evidence.56 While many appellate courts have referred to a formal Gladue report as a \"preferable\" source of Gladue information in this context, they have stopped short of suggesting that a Gladue report must be made available in all cases.57 In Shanoss, the British Columbia Court of Appeal also emphasized that it would be inappropriate for an appellate court to simply \"speculate that if a stand- alone Gladue report had been prepared then some material information might possibly have come forward that could affect or have affected the sentence\".58 On the other hand, there are also appellate decisions where it has been found that the depth and scope of case-specific information available to the sentencing judge was inadequate in the absence of a full Gladue report.59 Regardless of its source, it will constitute an error in principle for a sentencing judge to determine a dangerous offender application without adequate Gladue information before them.60 54 See for example R v Pelletier, 2019 BCPC 211 at para 217, citing Mattson, supra note 43. 55 See for example R v Anderson, 2018 BCSC 2528 at para 55. 56 See BCCA 1 at para [Fontaine]; R v 249 at para 52. 58 note 56 at para 33. See also Peekeekoot, supra note 43 at paras 119-120. 59 at para 127.330 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D The application of actuarial risk assessment tools to Indigenous people Another Gladue-related consideration in dangerous offender proceedings arises from a concern that certain actuarial tools may have discriminatory impacts when applied to Indigenous people. As noted earlier in this publication, this persistent issue has also been raised in context to the use of these tools in the correctional system and bail decisions, as well their incorporation into pre-sentence reports. Two inter-related issues appear to be the overlap between actuarial risk factors and Gladue factors\u2014often referred to as a form of cultural bias\u2014and the lack of adequate data and research validating certain tools for application to Indigenous people. In Ewert, the Supreme Court acknowledged \"credible concerns\" that the information derived from certain actuarial risk assessment tools may be \"of questionable validity with respect to Indigenous inmates because the tools fail to account for cultural differences\".61 It also noted the \"long- standing\" and \"credible\" concern that evaluating Indigenous inmates with certain actuarial tools \"perpetuates discrimination and contributes to the disparity in correctional outcomes between Indigenous and non- Indigenous offenders\".62 As actuarial risk assessment tools are often used when assessing individuals in dangerous offender applications, similar arguments have often been raised in this context. Questions with regards to a particular instrument's validity and its potential bias against Indigenous people may warrant careful exploration during the hearing of expert evidence, especially as practices change in the wake of the Ewert decision.63 For example, experts may need to adjust their scores to accommodate for cultural bias due to systemic and background factors, such as how an individual's traumatic upbringing can impact how they \"present\" or how higher rates of truancy on reserve may contextualize an individual's personal history of truancy in school.64 Sentencing judges may wish to also explore whether the particular actuarial tools relied upon by experts have been validated for Indigenous people.65 The cultural differences 61 Ewert v Canada, 2018 SCC 30 at para 66. 62 Ibid at para 53. 63 See for example: R v Teneycke, 2018 BCPC 60 at v Keewasin, at para 147.331 Chapter 14: Dangerous OffendersCHAPTER 14 that distinguish Inuit from other Indigenous peoples have been raised as a further consideration to potentially explore in this context.66 These concerns with actuarial risk assessment tools link back to the concerns first expressed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in George that seemingly neutral considerations in the assessment of an individual's risk and dangerousness could disproportionately impact some Indigenous individuals due to systemic and background factors.67 In other words, courts may need to be alive to the risk of systemic discrimination in this context as well. Conclusion The Supreme Court of Canada made it clear in Boutilier that the Gladue principles must be applied at the penalty stage of a dangerous offender application. What is less clear in the case law to date is whether and how they might also be relevant at the designation stage of this statutory regime. Appellate jurisprudence exists to the effect that sentencing judges should be attentive to systemic discrimination in how the designation criteria is applied, both in considering someone's childhood behaviour and assessing whether risk assessment tools have been validated for Indigenous people. Other cases from appellate courts mandate close attention to culturally relevant programming when assessing an Indigenous person's future prospects for treatment and the intractability of their conduct as well. Yet there are also cases that suggest the Gladue principles will only be relevant at the penalty stage. Similar to the bail jurisprudence, these divergent positions could simply reflect different perspectives regarding the overall ambit of the Gladue principles. The impacts of systemic and background factors on someone's moral blameworthiness have attenuated relevance in this context. But there may still be other reasons to pay attention to cultural differences and systemic factors in making factual determinations within these proceedings, regardless of how they are characterized in relation to the Gladue decision. 66 Kritik, supra note 63 at paras 33-35. George, supra note 41 at para 18.332 CHAPTER 15: YOUNG PERSONS The Gladue principles are also applied in the criminal justice system's dealings with Indigenous youth. There is clear legislative direction for an Indigenous young person's unique circumstances to be taken into account during sentencing so this is by no means a controversial statement to make. Likewise, bail decisions for Indigenous young persons will require attention to the interim release provisions under the Criminal Code, thereby incorporating its statutory basis and jurisprudence for the consideration of their unique circumstances in this context as well.1 Nevertheless, complex questions arise during Crown applications for an Indigenous young person to be sentenced as an adult in terms of how the Gladue principles might inform these decisions. The Supreme Court of Canada has yet to weigh in with specific guidance on the relevance of the Gladue principles to the criminal justice system's dealings with Indigenous young persons so existing lower court jurisprudence will be carefully summarized in this chapter. The sentencing of an Indigenous young person ordinarily takes place under a distinct statutory scheme: the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA).2 Canada's youth criminal justice system \"stands separate from the adult criminal justice system\".3 This separate system applies to \"all persons between the ages of 12 and 17, as well as persons charged with having committed an offence while they were a young person\".4 While the 1 As noted by Agnew J in R v KRT, 2019 SKPC 37 at para 10: \"By virtue of s. 28 of the YCJA, the interim release provisions of the Criminal Code apply to interim release under the YCJA, except where they are overridden by the YCJA. In my view, this means that the case law which has developed regarding adult judicial interim release is also applicable under the YCJA, except where incompatible with the YCJA\". Consistent with this interpretation, jurisprudence regarding the application of the Gladue principles to bail decisions for Indigenous adults has been applied in context to bail decisions for Indigenous youth. See for example: R v TK, 2020 SKQB 262. 2 Youth Criminal Justice Act, SC 2002, c 1 [YCJA]. 3 R v KJM, 2019 SCC 55, Moldaver J at para 49. 4 Ibid.333 Chapter 15: Young PersonsCHAPTER 15 YCJA only came into effect in 2003, youth accused of criminal offences have received distinct treatment in Canadian law for over a century.5 The reason for distinct treatment is the \"recognition of the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness of young persons and [...] their heightened vulnerability in dealing with the justice system\".6 This has been affirmed as a principle of fundamental justice under s 7 of the Charter.7 It also finds expression in Canada's international commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.8 The presumptively diminished moral blameworthiness and greater vulnerability of young persons may be amplified by the Gladue principles when sentencing Indigenous youth. This is because an Indigenous youth's systemic and background factors may reduce their moral culpability as variables independent from their age. The Gladue decision also speaks to the vulnerability of Indigenous people to systemic discrimination in the justice system more generally, with this potentially making prison a less appropriate or effective sanction. The potential for this type of overlap and amplification is a recurring theme in the existing jurisprudence on the sentencing of Indigenous young persons. The general application of Gladue principles to the sentencing of young persons It is clear that the Gladue principles apply in an analogous manner whenever Indigenous youth are sentenced under the YCJA, which \"very clearly and repeatedly calls for the consideration of Gladue factors and alternatives in the sentencing process\".9 Section 50(1) of the YCJA ensures that s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code applies to the sentencing of young persons \"with any modifications that the circumstances require\". Section 3(1)(c)(iv) sets out the broad principle that \"within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences should [...] respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal 5 Ibid, Brown & Abella JJ at para 132, dissenting. 6 Ibid, Brown & Abella JJ at para 133, dissenting, citing R v SJL, 2009 SCC 14 at para 62. 7 Ibid, Brown & Abella JJ at para 134, dissenting, citing R v DB, 2008 SCC 25 [DB]. 8 DB, supra note 7, Abella J at para 60. 9 R v TDP, 2004 SKPC 57 at para 23.334 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D young persons and of young persons with special requirements\". Section 38(2)(d) sets out the sentencing principle that \"all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young persons\". The YCJA also encourages sentencing judges to consult with the young person, their family, and the community, and provides for conferences and pre-sentence reports in order to accomplish this, thus facilitating access to relevant Gladue information for an Indigenous youth.10 The jurisprudence on the application of the Gladue principles to young persons under the YCJA reflects many parallel practices and considerations to the sentencing of adults. For example, the unique circumstances of an Indigenous young person may have a mitigating effect on the sentence imposed.11 Likewise, the Gladue principles can be actualized in a sentencing circle, they can result in restorative and community-oriented sanctions, and they can contemplate engaging with Elders and participating in cultural and land-based activities.12 Sentencing judges under the YCJA may wish to obtain a Gladue report in addition to other pre-sentence reports in order to better assess the unique circumstances of an Indigenous youth.13 Furthermore, it will constitute an error justifying an appeal if an Indigenous young person is sentenced without adequate consideration of the Gladue principles.14 Many of the principles are general enough to apply without modification. On the other hand, the Gladue jurisprudence governing the sentencing of adults has at times required further modification or accommodation to the distinct vulnerabilities and needs of youth. For example, an Indigenous youth may have less capacity to identify and articulate their own unique circumstances and needs in support of the Gladue analysis, especially when their immaturity is compounded by other factors like a mental disability.15 Some youth may be \"inarticulate, fearful and [...] possess very weak verbal skills\", in which case it will be 10 Ibid at paras 28-29.

The Gladue principles in Crown applications to sentence youths as adults While an Indigenous youth will ordinarily be sentenced under the YCJA, there is also a legislated process for the Crown to seek an adult sentence for a young person. Pursuant to s 64(1) of the YCJA, the Attorney General can apply for \"an order that a young person is liable to an adult sentence if the young person is or has been found guilty of an offence for which an adult is liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and that was committed after the young person attained the age of 14 years\". In these applications the intersection between the Gladue 16 Ibid at para 76. 17 See YCJA, v ONCJ at para 58. 18 See CP and JA, supra note 14 at para 25.

Section 72 of the YCJA sets out the two-part test that governs whether a young person should receive an adult sentence. The sentencing judge must be satisfied that: \"(a) the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability of the young person is rebutted; and (b) a youth sentence imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles [of the YCJA] would not be of sufficient length to hold the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour\".21 If either prong is not satisfied the young person must be sentenced as a youth.22 While each prong requires consideration of similar factors, they must be analyzed separately to ensure both are satisfied.23 The onus rests on the Crown to satisfy the sentencing judge that both prongs have been met.24 If the s 72 test is satisfied and the youth receives an adult sentence, they will be subject to the sentencing principles under the Criminal Code, including its provisions governing dangerous and long-term offenders.25 It is worth noting that the distinct considerations underlying the YCJA may still have relevance to an adult sentence for a young person, whether directly or indirectly.26 While there is still some apparent debate over whether the s 3 principles of the YCJA directly apply to a young person who is sentenced as an adult, it is at least accepted \"that the objective of rehabilitation should generally be enhanced and moderate the penalty to be imposed\".27 Nevertheless, a successful Crown application under s 72 has obvious punitive implications in that it brings more retributive sentencing principles into play and it even exposes a young person to the possibility of being designated a long-term offender or dangerous offender who could then be subject to an indeterminate sentence. 21 YCJA, s 72(1). 22 YCJA, s 72(1.1).

However, the fact that these applications place a young person at risk of far longer periods of incarceration than would otherwise be available under the YCJA raises the question of whether Gladue principles should be considered as part of the s 72 analysis as well. Regardless of whether this is viewed as an application of the Gladue principles per se, the systemic and background factors of an Indigenous youth can be relevant to their level of maturity, moral blameworthiness, and accountability.28 Additionally, there is ample jurisprudence to support the position that the Gladue principles should be applied at both prongs of the s 72 analysis.29 In fact, at least one appellate court has concluded that it would be an error in principle for a sentencing judge to fail to apply the Gladue principles to both prongs.30 In R v Anderson, Justice Mainella of the Manitoba Court of Appeal has provided the most detailed rationale for concluding that the Gladue principles must be applied at each stage of the s 72 test under the YCJA: Section 72(1)(a) of the YCJA must be read in light of section 50(1) of the YCJA. That provision states that eight aspects of the Criminal Code relating to adult sentencing, including section 718.2(e), also apply to proceedings under the YCJA \"with any modifications that the circumstances require.\" The leading decision on the meaning of section 50(1) of the YCJA is R v BWP; R v BVN, 2006 SCC 27. In that case, Charron J explained that Parliament made a \"deliberate\" (at para 23) choice as to which aspects of adult sentencing would apply to the YCJA. As explained in Okemow, the underlying purpose of the YCJA is \"to restrict the use of custody in sentencing a young person\" (at para 42). Custody, and particularly an adult sentence, is reserved for a very narrow set of offences and offenders. 28 R v KM (A Young Person), 2017 NWTSC 26 at para 28. 29 See for example: R v JF, 2012 BCSC 780 at paras 63-64; 2014 199 at R v DR, 2015 SKQB 157 at paras 62-75, 96, 121; TM, supra 13 at para 2018 159 ]; 83, note 23, Tholl JA at paras 37, 84, Jackson JA at paras 218, 224, dissenting. 30 R v Anderson, 2018 MBCA 42 at para 91 [Anderson]. See also AWB, supra note 29 at paras 32-33.338 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D One of the key aspects of deciding whether the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability has been rebutted is the circumstances of the offender (see DB at para 77). Given the importance of the principle of restraint under the YCJA and related principles, such as the prospects for rehabilitation and safe reintegration into society, in my view, Parliament's intention for deliberately choosing to incorporate section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code into the YCJA was so that it would be mandatory that Gladue factors that may have played a part in bringing the Indigenous young person before the courts, as well as sentencing procedures and sanctions that may be appropriate because of the offender's Indigenous background, would have to be considered in any sentencing proceeding under the YCJA, including both requirements for an adult sentence under section 72(1) of the YCJA. Such an approach is consistent with Parliament's general desire to ameliorate the problems of overrepresentation of, and discrimination against, Indigenous people in the criminal justice system (see Sherri Davis-Barron, Youth and the Criminal Law in Canada, 2nd ed (LexisNexis, 2015) at 357-65).31 In applying the Gladue principles to the first prong of s 72, several sentencing judges have found an Indigenous youth's systemic and background factors will reinforce the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness to the degree they indicate reduced moral culpability for reasons other than age.32 As addressed earlier in this publication, Gladue factors can also be linked with mental health issues or disabilities like FASD that might further diminish a young person's moral blameworthiness.33 Gladue factors could indicate lower maturity if they suggest a lack of structure, adult guidance, or life skills in an Indigenous young person's upbringing.34 They might also shed light on their other individual circumstances, such as a gang association, which may relate back to systemic and background factors such as family dysfunction, a lack of community structure, or cognitive deficits.35 A young person's background experiences of crime, poverty, and racism might also help 31 Anderson, supra note 30 at paras 60-62. See also AWB, supra note 29 at paras 32-33. 32 See for example: R v SA, 2014 MBPC 17 at paras 62-64, KTD, supra note 32 at para 25. 34 R v Henderson, 2018 SKPC 27 at para 47 [Henderson]. 35 HJR, at para 20339 Chapter 15: Young PersonsCHAPTER 15 explain any anti-social views, the normalization of violence, or a \"warped concept of what it is to be 'a man'\", for example.36 When various overlapping personal circumstances such as systemic and background factors and cognitive impairments reinforce a young person's low level of maturity, moral sophistication, and capacity for the independent judgment of an adult, the Crown's onus to rebut the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness will be challenging to meet.37 At the same time, the first prong of the s 72(1) analysis is \"founded on reduced moral culpability as a result of youthfulness\" and therefore \"cognitive limitations and emotional and mental health, while relevant to this prong, should not overwhelm the analysis\".38 Presumably the same could be said of systemic and background factors. One reported decision goes so far as to suggest that the Crown can rebut the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness \"by advancing evidence that the young person's lack of adult maturity, moral sophistication, and capacity for independent judgment, which are implicated in the offending behaviour, are largely due to factors other than age\", including the systemic and background factors of an Indigenous youth.39 Yet the Court conceded that this will be difficult to achieve in practice.40 Rather than viewing Gladue factors and age-related factors as mutually reinforcing evidence of an Indigenous youth's diminished moral culpability, this would mean relying on their systemic and background factors to justify a potentially much harsher penalty, raising the spectre of systemic discrimination. In most cases the consequences of systemic and background factors for moral culpability appear to be more likely to support a youth sentence rather than an adult one, thereby avoiding this risk. The consideration of the Gladue principles at the second prong of the s 72 test\u2014the assessment of whether a youth sentence will be of sufficient length to hold the young person accountable\u2014requires attention to the principle of restraint, the availability of culturally appropriate supports, and the moral blameworthiness of the young person.41 36 NW , supra note 23 at paras 185-186. Note that this case involved the sentencing of an African Nova Scotian young person rather than an Indigenous young person but the sentencing judge nevertheless applied analogous principles (see paras 28-35). 37 Henderson, supra note 34 at para 47. 38 Chol, supra note 23 at para 61. 39 Henderson, supra note 34 at para 48. 40 Ibid at paras 56-57. 41 See paras 106-107.340 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D Justice Jackson of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has provided a clear explanation of the continuing relevance of moral blameworthiness at this second step: The Crown must overcome both aspects of s. 72(1) and each aspect must be kept separate, but s. 72(1)(b) is assessed on the premise of the findings of s. 72(1)(a). This means that if a judge finds that the Crown has not rebutted the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability under s. 72(1)(a), accountability under s. 72(1)(b), if the clause were to be considered, would be assessed for a person of diminished culpability. The focus remains on this young offender with this level of culpability. Holding a young offender with diminished responsibility accountable is a far different matter than holding a young person with high culpability accountable. Culpability cannot be assessed having regard for the seriousness of the crime alone.42 Finally, the Gladue principles may have further relevance to a decision as to where an Indigenous young person ought to serve a prison sentence. For example, an Indigenous youth's systemic and background factors might indicate that they should be placed in a youth custody facility rather than an adult facility even after reaching the age of 20 if these factors are linked with other vulnerabilities that adult criminals prey upon.43 Conclusion The application of the Gladue principles in the sentencing of Indigenous young persons has many parallels with the dangerous offender context. In crafting a fit and proportionate sentence for an Indigenous person the sentencing judge must take into account whether any systemic and background factors diminish their moral blameworthiness regardless of whether this is in context to sentencing an Indigenous young person, adult, or dangerous offender. While the dominant sentencing principles shift from one context to the next, the fundamental principle of proportionality remains a constant in sentencing. But there are still other questions to be explored in terms of the potential for systemic discrimination in how facially neutral rules are applied to the unique circumstances of an Indigenous young person, requiring sensitivity to both the evaluation of the evidence and how it is obtained. 42 RDF , supra note 23, Jackson JA at para 224, dissenting. 43 R v Flett, 2015 MBCA 59 at paras 24-26.341 CHAPTER 16: COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES Several sentencing decisions have also addressed how the Gladue principles can intersect with the consideration of collateral consequences when sentencing an Indigenous person. These are the consequences of an offence, conviction, or sentence that are particular to the individual being sentenced as a result of their individual circumstances. While this particular extension of the Gladue principles has yet to receive significant discussion in appellate-level decisions, there are a number of precedents for taking into account the harsher consequences of prison sentences and firearms prohibitions for some Indigenous people that pre-date the Gladue decision, as addressed in detail in Chapter 1 of this book. Several sentencing decisions since then have continued to account for an Indigenous person's unique individual circumstances by assessing whether they are likely to be impacted more adversely by a conviction or a particular sentence even if these are not always explicitly identified as collateral consequences. The Supreme Court of Canada has yet to weigh in on how the Gladue principles might overlap with the consideration of collateral consequences in sentencing. In its more general guidance in Suter, however, the Supreme Court has stated that courts may need to look at \"any consequence arising from the commission of an offence, the conviction for an offence, or the sentence imposed for an offence, that impacts the offender\" in order to achieve a proportionate sentence that accounts for all relevant circumstances related to the particular offence and offender.1 In other words, there is a broad scope to consider the incidental impacts of an offence, conviction, or sentence based on someone's unique situation. As summarized in this chapter, the unique circumstances of Indigenous people have been found to amplify the impact of particular penalties in some cases. Likewise, some courts have identified collateral impacts that arise from the unique circumstances of Indigenous people. Accounting for unique circumstances in this context is functionally distinct from 1 R v Suter, 2018 SCC 34 at para 47 [Suter].CHAPTER 16342 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D assessing an Indigenous person's moral blameworthiness in light of their systemic and background factors, but it may be linked to other aspects of the Gladue principles, such as the need to be attentive to sources of systemic discrimination General principles governing the consideration of collateral consequences The collateral consequences of a specific offence, conviction, or sentence on an offender are often accounted for by reducing or modifying the sentence that is imposed to avoid, mitigate, or otherwise compensate for these consequences. However, these are not true mitigating factors in the sense that they are relevant to sentencing for reasons unrelated to the gravity of the offence and the level of responsibility of the offender. Instead they are relevant in that they reflect whether \"a particular sentence would have a more significant impact on the offender because of his or her circumstances\", which must be accounted for in light of the sentencing principles of individualization and parity.2 Collateral consequences can also be relevant to the sentencing objective of assisting in rehabilitating offenders.3 Although a sentence can be adjusted to address collateral consequences, it must remain proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender, however.4 In other words, accounting for collateral consequences both contributes to and is bound by the fundamental sentencing principle of proportionality. A wide variety of circumstances and statutory provisions have been found to be relevant to sentencing as collateral consequences of a particular offence, conviction, or sentence. Sentencing judges can consider any violent actions an individual has suffered from fellow inmates or a vigilante group for their role in the commission of an offence.5 The impact of a particular conviction or sentence on an individual's immigration status, either within Canada or elsewhere, and their risk of deportation might warrant consideration.6 Loss of property to civil forfeiture could 2 Ibid at para 48. 3 R v Pham, 2013 SCC 15 at para 11 [Pham]. 4 Suter, note 1 at para 56. 5 at 53. 6 See for Pham, 3; v 343 Chapter 16: Collateral ConsequencesCHAPTER 16 be relevant.7 Health risks associated with a term of imprisonment during a pandemic may need to be considered.8 If a particular sentence is likely to lead to a youth sentence being converted into an adult sentence, this too may need to be addressed.9 A sentencing judge must also be alive to the consequences of a conviction on someone's eligibility for income and disability assistance.10 That said, the Supreme Court has insisted that sentencing judges are not to impose inappropriate or artificial sentences to avoid collateral consequences that inevitably flow from statutes if doing so will circumvent legislative intent.11 In more ordinary circumstances, a particular offence, conviction, or sentence can have relevant collateral consequences for someone's employment prospects, professional credentials, and business interests.12 It might have relevant consequences for their family and their ability to care and provide for their children, in some cases leading to the involvement of a child protection agency.13 It could lead to reputation loss, public disgrace, social stigma, or ostracism.14 It might result in loss of housing.15 It could impact education plans as well.16 And it might otherwise affect someone's prospects for rehabilitation in terms of access to a family support network or services within the community, such as counselling.17 In some cases, the collateral consequences of the 7 R v Knudsen, 2019 BCPC 198 at para 36. 8 R v Lemmen, 2020 BCPC 67 at at v Morgan, 2020 ONCA 279 at paras 8-11. 9 R v Fisher, 2019 MBCA 82. 10 R v Dennis, 2013 BCCA 153. 11 Pham, supra note 3 at para 15. 12 See for example: R v Hewson, 2016 ONCJ 784 at para 106; v Hillier, 2018 ONCJ 397 at para 166 [Hillier]; R v Macintosh, 2018 NSPC 45 at para 58; R v Murray, 2018 ONCJ 393 at para 166 [Murray]; R v Eastwood, 2018 ONCJ 469 at para 79; v Carroll, ONCJ at paras [Carroll]; R v JM, 2019 BCPC 235 at para 113. 13 See for R c Stanberry, 2015 1097 at BCPC at para 82 [Tattersall]; R 2016 NUCA 4 41-44; 61 at para 21; R v Vicente, 2018 ONCJ 716 at paras 74, 76 [Vicente]; R v Drakes, 2018 NWTSC 63 [Drakes]; R v KST, 2019 BCPC 112 at paras 114, 118. 14 See for example: Vicente, supra note 13 at para 73; Carroll, supra note 12 at para 96; Murray, supra note 12 at para 165. 15 See for example: Drakes, supra note 13; R v para 17 See for example: R v PMM, 2019 BCPC 276 at para 79; R v ONCJ 69 at para 56.344 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D commission of an offence can even assist in determining whether the objectives of deterrence and denunciation are met.18 On the other hand, when certain consequences are almost inevitable given the nature of a particular offence, conviction, or sentence, this will reduce any mitigating impact they might otherwise have on the sentence imposed.19 Unique circumstances can translate into unique collateral consequences Some collateral consequences can be unique to Indigenous people or impact them more adversely than others due to unique circumstances like their cultural values or geographic realities. For example, firearms prohibitions can be particularly impactful for Indigenous people when they interfere with hunting, trapping, and fishing for subsistence or cultural purposes.20 Similarly, a driving prohibition can impact an Indigenous person living in an isolated community more harshly than it would someone living in an urban setting.21 An Indigenous person who lives in a small, tight-knit community might face amplified social stigma and ostracization for an offence, as might their family.22 In some cases a conviction could impact an Indigenous individual's status in their community in a wholly unique way by making them ineligible for a role like a hereditary chieftainship.23 While some of these cases openly link these collateral consequences with the Gladue principles, the consideration of collateral consequences in sentencing is open-ended enough that this may not be necessary to recognize the relevancy of these circumstances to sentencing. 18 See for example: R v Nagashbandi, 2008 ABPC 302 at paras 63-67; R v BCPC 15 at para 45. 19 Suter, supra note 1 at para 49.

That is to say that the collateral consequences for an Indigenous person's employment, education, family, housing, or access to services can be amplified by such systemic factors as higher rates of unemployment and child apprehensions, lower rates of formal education, scarce, overcrowded, or inadequate housing, or a lack of other services in particular Indigenous communities. A common collateral consequence like loss of employment could be more impactful for someone living in a community where employment is disproportionately scarce, for example, or for someone who faces barriers like limited formal education or disabilities.24 At the same time, systemic factors like high rates of unemployment have been found to contribute to higher incidences of crime and incarceration for Indigenous people as well.25 In R v Kanatsiak, Judge Galiatsatos of the Court of Quebec took note of this \"vicious cycle\" in which social disadvantages self-perpetuate when the sentencing process contributes to criminogenic factors for Indigenous people like unemployment.26 Prison sentences may have collateral consequences for some Indigenous people Some sentencing decisions have accounted for harsh conditions during pre-sentence custody as a collateral consequence of general application.27 In some cases, uniquely adverse impacts of incarceration on an Indigenous person have been considered as a collateral consequence as well. The Supreme Court of Canada did state in Gladue that Indigenous people are \"more adversely affected by incarceration and less likely to be 'rehabilitated' thereby, because the internment milieu is often culturally inappropriate and regrettably discrimination towards them is so often 24 R v Auger, 2017 ABCA 304 at 1888 at paras rev'd in part other grounds 2020 QCCS 1523. 27 See for example: R v Cunningham, 2019 R v Turco, 2019 ONCJ 646.346 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D rampant in penal institutions\".28 This has clear relevance to the sentencing judge's duty to consider culturally appropriate procedures and sanctions under s 718.2(e). However, some sentencing judges have gone further by considering the adverse impacts of incarceration on an Indigenous person as a collateral consequence as well, echoing some of the early cases summarized in Chapter 1. In Beardy, Judge Corrin of the Manitoba Provincial Court interpreted the Gladue and Ipeelee decisions as implying that \"the specific impact of incarceration on an offender should be considered\".29 He noted that \"jail sentences that remove Aboriginal offenders far from their community and family support systems must be carefully scrutinized as their impact on the offender may well be potentially counterproductive because of their inherently harsh and cruel personal consequences\".30 Mr. Beardy was described as a \"youthful offender\" displaced from his remote and rural Indigenous community in Lake St. Martin by a forced evacuation that brought him to the foreign environment of a large multi-cultural urban centre, which in turn destabilized his ability to cope with stress.31 The Court also recognized that Mr. Beardy suffered depression and suicidal tendencies that would make prison \"particularly difficult\".32 In these circumstances, Judge Corrin held that \"it would be imprudent to accord too much weight to general deterrence\".33 In Iserhoff, Judge Ladouceur of the Court of Quebec accounted for the collateral consequences that two Cree men from the Eeyou Istchee territory in northern Quebec would face if sentenced to incarceration in southern correctional institutions.34 The Court found that the Cree men would serve custodial sentences \"far away from [their] family and community, making it more difficult to receive visits from [their] loved ones and maintain a connection with [their] culture\".35 This would take place in \"a cultural environment that is fundamentally different from [their] Aboriginal culture\" and where they are a minority, making imprisonment 28 Gladue, supra note 25 at para 68. 29 R v Beardy, 2017 MBPC 32 at para 16, aff 'd 2018 MBCA 52. 30 Ibid. 31 Ibid at para 15. 32 Ibid at para 33 Ibid. 34 R c Iserhoff, 2019 QCCQ 2339. See also c 16: Collateral ConsequencesCHAPTER 16 more challenging for them.36 Furthermore, the Cree men were found to be statistically less likely to be granted temporary absence in preparation for conditional release or to be released on parole than non-Indigenous inmates.37 These prospective collateral consequences were accounted for in determining a proportionate sentence for them independent from the retrospective impact of systemic and background factors on their moral culpability.38 Analogous collateral consequences have been accounted for in other sentencing decisions of the Court of Quebec involving Indigenous people since the Iserhoff decision was issued.39 Similarly, Judge Mackenzie of the Saskatchewan Provincial Court weighed the substance abuse rehabilitation programming available in custody against programming available in the community of Regina when sentencing an Indigenous woman for a drug trafficking offence motivated by addiction in McKenzie.40 Judge Mackenzie found there to be a \"stark distinction\" between the small number of programs available in custody, with uncertainty around availability and wait times, as compared to the comprehensive and readily accessible options available in the community, including culturally relevant programming.41 He also took into account statistics regarding high rates of drug and alcohol use within correctional institutions.42 The Court held that a consequence of any custodial sentence for Ms. McKenzie would be a greater risk of relapse and recidivism given the limited programming and the exposure to negative peer groups and drugs that could be reasonably anticipated in prison.43 Again, these factors appear to have been considered independently from the assessment of the impact of systemic and background factors on her moral culpability.44 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid. 38 Ibid at para 173. example: supra paras 40 R 41 Ibid at paras 53-62. 24-33.348 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D Indigenous community punishments as collateral consequences In Suter, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that the \"non-state\" collateral consequences someone endures as a result of a particular offence\u2014such as vigilante violence\u2014may be considered when determining an appropriate sentence.45 In doing so, the Supreme Court appears to have approved of how sentencing judges in Australia take into account the retribution some Indigenous people face from community members for the same conduct that results in criminal proceedings.46 Australian case law considers this type of \"extra-curial punishment\" to be a material fact relevant to sentencing regardless of its legality or legitimacy in the eyes of the courts.47 This type of non-state punishment is treated as a mitigating factor in sentencing so as to ensure an Indigenous person is not \"punished twice for the same offence\" and \"in practice it appears that some balancing of punishments is done within both systems\".48 In addition, Australian courts have taken into account extra-curial punishment within Indigenous communities even when it has not involved any physical injuries to the person being sentenced.49 In Canada, there has been far less judicial attention to parallel punishments imposed by Indigenous communities when sentencing Indigenous people, even though this topic was addressed in reports before the Supreme Court in Gladue.50 Nevertheless, there is some precedent for recognizing an Indigenous community's decision to banish someone based on an offence, conviction, or sentence as a circumstance worthy of consideration by the courts in sentencing. In S(G), for example, Judge Digiuseppe of the Ontario Court of Justice suggested that the banishment of an Ojibway man with a limited grasp of English 45 Suter, supra note 1 at para 57. 46 52-53, citing R v Mamarika, [1982] Jadurin v The FCA 215 (Australia); R v Minor, [1992] NTCCA at 27 [Minor]; R v Daetz, [2003] NSWCCA 216 (Australia) at para 57. 48 Minor, supra note 47 at 24, citing Recognition of Aboriginal Customary Laws (Australian Law Reform Commission Report, 1986), vol 1 at para 508. 49 R v Miyatatawuy, [1996] NTSC 84 (Australia), citing Munungurr v The Queen (1994) 4 NTLR 63 (Australia). 50 See Chapter 2 for a summary of findings from the commissions of inquiry and task forces that pre-dated the enactment of s 718.2(e) and its interpretation in the Gladue decision. See especially Law Reform Commission of Canada, Report on Aboriginal Peoples and Criminal Justice: Equality, Respect and the Search for Justice (Ottawa: Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1991) at 76.349 Chapter 16: Collateral ConsequencesCHAPTER 16 \"from his community, his family and his way of life\" arguably amounted to \"a virtual prison sentence for him, and just as effective in terms of deterrence and denunciation as any sentence this Court might impose\".51 And where banishment has been imposed by the sentencing judge, this too has been equated with a period of incarceration.52 In R v RRM, Chief Justice Finch of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (as he then was) more directly addressed why an Indigenous nation's decision to banish someone has a mitigating impact on sentence, albeit without terming this a collateral consequence: ...when the appellant is released from custody he will not have support from either community, and will have limited opportunities for access to adult family members until his probation period terminates. He will be thrown on his own resources into the larger community, isolated from his family, and with nowhere to live. Banishment is a significant additional penalty, and clearly one which, as the Crown concedes, should have been considered in mitigation by the sentencing judge.53 Other examples of Indigenous communities addressing wrongdoing through their own parallel processes have also been considered by sentencing judges. For instance, there are several cases from British Columbia's courts that make note of how the Tsimshian, Nisga'a, Gitxsan, Babine, and Wet'suwet'en address wrongdoing through holding feasts or potlatches.54 In William, the British Columbia Supreme Court took note of a \"shame feast\" that would hold an individual accountable to their clan within the Babine Nation by shaming them in front of their community and requiring them to \"pay their debt to society\".55 This appears to have been considered as evidence of community support.56 In other cases, a shame feast has been considered for incorporation into the sentence itself in support of restorative justice, rehabilitation, and 51 R v S(G), 2004 ONCJ 110 at para 39. 52 See for example: R v Griffith, [1998] BCJ No 2008 (QL), 1998 CanLII 5490 (CA) at 51; R v Felix, 2002 NWTSC 63 at para 51. 53 R v RRM, 2009 BCCA 578 at para 39. 54 See for example: R v Morrison, 2012 BCSC 155 at paras 35-36; R v McLean, 2014 at v v EJTM, BCSC at paras 15; R v Casimir, 2016 BCSC 65 at para 15. 55 R v William, 2014 BCSC 1639 at para 30. 56 Ibid at paras 30, 61, 67.350 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D reintegration.57 Notably, these feasts appear to have cultural, financial, and reputational impacts on the Indigenous person for whom they are being held.58 In principle, these extra-curial impacts of an offence, conviction, or sentence could be treated as collateral consequences so as to be accounted for in the sentence imposed by the courts when they occur outside of that process. Conclusion There are several older precedents for sentencing judges to draw upon when considering how an Indigenous person's unique circumstances can make prison a harsher penalty for them. Some of the task forces and commissions that preceded the Gladue appeal had called for Indigenous community punishments to be accounted for in sentencing as well, echoing the Australian jurisprudence and the Australian Law Reform Commission. With this background context in mind it is perhaps more surprising to find these issues have received so little jurisprudential attention to date than it is to see them now emerging in decisions like Iserhoff. As the Supreme Court of Canada has clarified that non-state punishments can be accounted for as collateral consequences\u2014building on the Australian jurisprudence in doing so\u2014these impacts of the unique circumstances of Indigenous peoples may warrant more attention going forward. The existing cases demonstrate how the unique circumstances of Indigenous people shed light on more than just culpability. 57 See for example: R v Loring, 2009 BCCA 166 at paras 21-26; R v DBV, 2011 BCSC 2014 BCSC 2044 at paras 56, 74-77. 58 See for example R v HGR, 2015 BCSC 681 at paras 7-8.351 CHAPTER 17: ABSOLUTE AND CONDITIONAL DISCHARGES Lower courts have also explored the outer boundaries of the Gladue principles in context to discharge applications where prison is not contemplated. As the New Brunswick Court of Appeal points out in Perley , s 718.2(e) not only aims to make prison the penalty of last resort and reduce Indigenous over-incarceration, it also encourages a restorative approach to sentencing more generally.1 In other words, the Gladue principles are still important when crafting non-custodial sentences.2 However, this is a topic that has yet to receive any explicit guidance from the Supreme Court of Canada and some courts and counsel have at least raised the question of whether the Gladue principles remain relevant in the absence of any threat of incarceration. This is a particularly important legal question in context to applications for absolute or conditional discharges, as explored in this chapter. Several sentencing decisions have now addressed the Gladue principles in determining whether to grant a discharge, which means no conviction will be entered in spite of the accused being found guilty of an offence.3 An application for a discharge takes place within a sentencing proceeding but requires attention to a unique set of statutory criteria. Section 730(1) of the Criminal Code empowers a sentencing judge to direct either an absolute discharge or a discharge subject to conditions set out in a probation order. The only offences for which a discharge is categorically unavailable under the Criminal Code are those that carry either a statutory minimum sentence or a maximum sentence of 14 years or more. Section 730(1) also dictates that the sentencing judge must be satisfied that a discharge would be \"in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest\".4 1 Perley v R, 2019 NBCA 88 at para 20. 2 Ibid. See also R v Kuliktana, 2020 NUCA 7 at para 34. 3 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 730(3) [Criminal s 730(1).CHAPTER 17352 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D As summarized in this chapter, several sentencing decisions have found that the Gladue principles apply to an application under s 730(1). Section 718.2(e) must still be applied alongside the other sentencing principles in the Criminal Code when determining a fit sentence in this specific context, providing a straightforward basis for their relevancy. In addition, an Indigenous person's unique circumstances can shed light on both their best interests and the broader public interest in context to the statutory test under s 730(1). The statutory test for granting an absolute or conditional discharge In order to understand how the Gladue principles can intersect with these applications, it is worth first reviewing the general test for an absolute or conditional discharge. The leading case on discharges as a sentencing tool is the 1973 Fallofield decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.5 Little has changed with respect to the statutory provisions since then and the principles remain the same.6 The Court of Appeal held that there are no restrictions on the availability of a discharge beyond those explicitly provided for in the Criminal Code as \"a discretion which is unfettered by law must not be fettered by judicial interpretation of it\".7 The Court also emphasized that nothing in the Criminal Code limits the availability of an absolute or conditional discharge to \"a technical or trivial violation\".8 Instead, this sentencing option is available for any offence falling outside the statutory bounds of a mandatory minimum sentence or a maximum sentence of 14 years or more.9 Nor will a discharge be routinely granted for any particular type of offence, with the appropriateness of this sentence being dependent on the circumstances.10 However, the power to direct a discharge is not one to be exercised as an alternative to probation or a suspended sentence.11 As set out explicitly in s 730, the two conditions precedent for a discharge are that it is: (i) in the best interests of the accused; and (ii) not contrary 5 R v Fallofield, [1973] BCJ No 559 (QL), 1973 CanLII 1412 (CA) 6 R v Jeremiah, 2018 BCCA 89 at para 14. 7 Fallofield, supra note 5 at 452. 8 Ibid at 454. 9 Ibid. 10 Ibid at 455. 11 Ibid.353 Chapter 17: Absolute and Conditional DischargesCHAPTER 17 to the public interest. The first condition presupposes \"that the accused is a person of good character, without previous conviction, that it is not necessary to enter a conviction against [them] in order to deter [them] from future offences or to rehabilitate [them], and that the entry of a conviction against [them] may have significant adverse repercussions\".12 This criterion will often be satisfied as \"in almost every case a discharge would certainly be in the interests of the accused\", although for some individuals a short term of imprisonment or probation might deter them from further criminal activity and remove them \"from the very environment which may have generated such activity\".13 An assessment of the best interests of the accused also requires attention to the collateral consequences of a conviction in light of personal circumstances such as age, current and future employment, education and career plans, familial obligations, ability to travel, mental health and course of treatment.14 The second condition precedent for a discharge is framed in the negative; it requires consideration of whether a discharge might be \"injurious to the public interest\" rather than a determination of whether it will advance the public interest.15 In making this assessment, the sentencing judge must give due weight to general deterrence, but this \"does not preclude the judicious use of the discharge provisions\".16 It requires attention to the gravity of the offence, its incidence in the community, public attitudes towards it, and public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law.17 The more serious the offence, the less likely a discharge should be granted, or the greater the need for mitigating circumstances to counterbalance the gravity of the offence.18 Collateral consequences of a conviction\u2014such as impacts on employment prospects or education\u2014 have relevance to this criterion as well.19 For example, there may be a 12 Ibid at 454-455. 13 R v MacFarlane (1976), 3 Alta LR (2d) 341 at 343, 55 AR 222 (CA). 14 See for example: R v Meneses (1974), 25 CCC (2d) 115 at 116, 1974 CanLII 1659 (Ont CA) [Meneses]; R v Edmunds, 2012 NLCA at paras 20, BCPC 15 at para 31 [Atleo]. 2010 at at paras 25-29. 16 Fallofield, supra note 5 at 455. 17 See: R v Elsharawy, [1997] NJ No 249 (QL), 1997 CanLII 14708 (CA) at para 3; R v 2004 153 at para Foianesi, 2011 MBCA 33 at para 21. 19 Ibid.

In light of this, some counsel and sentencing judges have at least raised the question of whether the Gladue principles are relevant to the determination of an application pursuant to s 730. As Judge Galiatsatos of the Court of Quebec asked rhetorically in Kanatsiak, \"if the issue is merely whether or not an offender will be discharged (as opposed to being formally convicted and sentenced to a non-custodial sanction), does the rationale behind s. 718.2(e) still apply?\"22 To date, courts have all consistently answered this question in the affirmative, including Judge Galiatsatos himself, with some doing so explicitly and others doing so implicitly through their consideration of the unique circumstances that require attention under this distinct sentencing analysis.23 It is also worth noting that prior to its repeal in December of 2018, s 255(5) of the Criminal Code had allowed for discharges under s 730 for impaired driving offences that could be demonstrably linked to the need for curative treatment in relation to alcohol or drugs\u2014commonly known 20 Meneses, supra note 14 at 117. 21 R v Lowe, 2012 ABPC 128 at paras 16-17. 22 R v Kanatsiak, 2019 QCCQ 1888 rev'd on 2020 QCCS 1523 [Kanatsiak]. 23 See for example: R v Stevens, 46 [Stevens]; R c Idlout, 2009 QCCQ 5104 [Idlout]; v Oweetaluktuk, 2011 QCCQ 12725 at QCCQ 2420 at para R v Samson, 2014 YKTC 33 at paras 67-70, aff 'd 2015 YKCA 7 YKTC v Harper, 2020 BCPC 226.355 Chapter 17: Absolute and Conditional DischargesCHAPTER 17 as curative discharges.24 The test applied for a curative discharge under s 255(5) was effectively \"a contextual expression of the test set out in s. 730 as it would be applied to an impaired driving offence; namely, that a discharge should only be granted if the court 'considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest'\".25 Up until its repeal, much of the jurisprudence under s 255(5) supported the conclusion that the Gladue principles should be applied to applications for curative discharges, modified as needed to the considerations that arise in this context.26 In Kanatsiak, Judge Galiatsatos helpfully summarized much of the existing jurisprudence on the application of the Gladue principles to determinations under s 730 and endorsed this development of the law. He held that sentencing judges are obliged to give s 730(1) \"a generous application when sentencing Aboriginal offenders so as to attempt to break the cycle of systemic criminalization\".27 Similarly, in Potvin, Judge Doody of the Ontario Court of Justice pointed out that a discharge may keep an Indigenous accused \"one step away from potential incarceration\" in comparison to other options that make prison more likely in the event of a subsequent offence.28 In Mason, Judge Sandhu of the Manitoba Provincial Court also concluded the Gladue principles oblige sentencing judges to pay attention to how Indigenous people first enter the criminal justice system \"and to give some benefit to aboriginal offenders as they may exit the justice system\".29 As noted already, any determination of an application under s 730(1) needs to respect the general sentencing principles set out in the Code, including the fundamental principle of proportionality. In light of this, the unique circumstances of an Indigenous accused ought to be considered under a standard Gladue analysis in this context.30 In other words, courts should explore how an Indigenous person's systemic and 24 R v Menacho, 2019 NWTTC 15 at paras 13-17; ONCJ 242 at 25 Luke, 2019 ONCJ 514 at para 31 [Luke]. 26 See for example: R v Gambler, 2012 SKPC 60 at para 34; R v Aisaican, 2015 R v 22 at para 87. 28 Potvin, supra note 23 at para 36. 29 Mason, supra note 23. 30 Kanatsiak, supra note 22 at para 81.356 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D background factors impact their moral culpability and the relevance of restorative justice and rehabilitation when assessing an application for a discharge.31 However, some sentencing judges have identified additional considerations that can arise when the specific statutory criteria for a discharge application under s 730 intersect with an Indigenous person's unique systemic and background factors. These will be summarized in the remainder of this chapter. Systemic and background factors can impact an Indigenous person's best interests Some courts have canvassed how systemic factors can amplify a conviction's collateral consequences when determining an Indigenous person's best interests under s 730, as addressed in detail in Chapter 16. This is equally true of the collateral impacts of both a conviction and a sentence. Whenever a sentencing judge assesses an Indigenous person's best interests, the collateral consequences of a criminal record for their employment, education, or career prospects can be amplified by systemic factors like higher rates of unemployment or lower levels of formal education among Indigenous people or within their particular community.32 In other words, the criminal record could impose a disproportionate adverse impact on an Indigenous person's education and employment prospects if they are already facing systemic barriers to education and employment. A criminal record can have a compounding negative impact on someone whose personal circumstances already constrain their employability, such as a person with limited formal education or mental and physical disabilities.33 Depending on the case-specific details, these could be linked to an Indigenous person's systemic and background factors, such as when Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is closely linked with intergenerational trauma. Furthermore, an Indigenous person who lives in a small, remote community may already have to 'wear' their offence every day in that community, facing more shame than they would otherwise experience in 31 See for example: Haggerty, supra note 14 paras 25 ABCA 11-12.357 Chapter 17: Absolute and Conditional DischargesCHAPTER 17 more populous urban centres where they could reasonably expect to have some anonymity.34 The way these circumstances interact can shed light on whether a conviction is likely to support or inhibit that individual's rehabilitation and whether it will contribute to specific deterrence in any meaningful way.35 Likewise, judicial consideration of systemic factors can help guard against the risk of discharges being treated as a privilege exclusive to those with higher social status, such as individuals with professional designations or those who are employed full-time.36 Higher rates of unemployment and lower rates of formal education among Indigenous peoples can have a systemic effect on the probability of a discharge being available if they are statistically less likely to face collateral impacts on either their employment or professional status. Some sentencing judges therefore contextualize the potential impact of a criminal record on an Indigenous person by comparing them to members of their own community rather than broader demographic reference points.37 The Gladue principles impact whether a discharge is contrary to the public interest Several sentencing decisions have also concluded that there are unique considerations engaged when determining if a discharge would be contrary to the public interest for an Indigenous person. In Rodrigue, for example, Judge Cozens of the Territorial Court of Yukon stated that this criterion requires consideration of whether a discharge furthers the public interest in making reparations towards Indigenous peoples in light of the harm done by destructive government policies like the residential school system.38 Judge Cozens also noted that when a sentencing judge decides whether a conviction is required to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice, this must be done from the perspective of an ordinary, fair-minded member of society who is informed about the circumstances of the accused and the offence they committed, including 34 Samson, supra note 23 at paras 66, 71. 35 Idlout, supra note 23 at para 24. 36 See R c Rozon, [1999] RJQ 805, 1999 CanLII cited in Idlout, supra note 23 at para 14.

When assessing whether granting a discharge would be contrary to the public interest, some sentencing judges have also concluded that a discharge is likely to make a positive contribution to the public interest if it helps address the root causes of Indigenous over-incarceration in relation to the personal circumstances of an Indigenous accused. For instance, if the discharge supports someone in serving their community as a professional, advancing their education, and serving as a role model for others, these are \"especially persuasive factors\" in assessing this second criterion.40 The same may be said of a discharge that supports someone's ambitions for a community leadership role.41 On the other hand, if an Indigenous person is facing challenges like addictions or disabilities, but taking positive steps towards rehabilitation by addressing factors that led to their criminal conduct, it would not be contrary to the public interest to give them the opportunity to stabilize their life.42 Once more, a discharge is not meant to be exclusively available to those who benefit from higher social standing like professionals.43 In Idlout, Judge Bigu\u00e9 of the Court of Quebec emphasized the specific public interest of \"all the Inuit communities of Nunavik\" when assessing this second criterion for an Inuk from Inukjuak in the Nunavik region of northern Quebec.44 He stated it would not be contrary to the public interest \"to be able to rely on as many people as possible with no criminal records, whenever possible\", especially in a small Indigenous community like Inukjuak.45 Mirroring the second prong of the Gladue analysis, Judge Bigu\u00e9 also took into account the unique culture, values, needs, and understanding of sentencing of the Inuit of Nunavik, stating that they emphasize restorative justice as part of their cultural heritage and 39 Ibid at para 103. 40 Stevens, supra note 23 at para 40; note 23 at para 78. 41 Samson, supra note 23 at paras 63, 68, 70. 42 Dennis, supra note 23 at para 27; Luke, supra note 36, cited in note 23 at para 14. 44 Idlout, supra note 23 at para 17. 45 Ibid at para 20. See Snowboy, supra note 23 at para 15 with respect to the Cree of James Bay.359 Chapter 17: Absolute and Conditional DischargesCHAPTER 17 as \"a preferred way of settling offences\".46 He held that this favoured an absolute discharge since the accused already paid a donation for the benefit of a non-profit organization in the community without waiting for a decision from the court.47 Conclusion The extension of the Gladue principles to applications for discharges under the Criminal Code further demonstrates the broad scope of their potential relevancy. Systemic and background factors may shed light on the effectiveness of a criminal record as a sanction for an Indigenous person if it appears likely to impede their rehabilitation and reinforce the root causes of their conduct. These factors could impact a conviction's proportionality if they amplify its consequences beyond what would otherwise be justified by culpability and the gravity of the offence alone. Furthermore, sentencing judges have considered the Gladue principles in assessing the public interest in granting a discharge in a manner that closely parallels assessments of the public interest and public confidence with respect to bail decisions and joint submissions, as addressed in earlier chapters in this book. These cases demonstrate how judicial attention to systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system can extend the implications of the Gladue principles beyond s 718.2(e)'s direct reach while remaining in line with the Supreme Court of Canada's broader directions. 46 Ibid at paras 18-22. 47 Ibid at para 23.360 CHAPTER SENTENCING IN CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CONTEXTS The Gladue principles emerged from a purposive interpretation of a specific provision in the Criminal Code. Obviously it is no coincidence that the majority of cases addressed in this publication are criminal sentencing decisions. Yet there are other sentencing contexts in which an Indigenous person may face the risk of incarceration, in which systemic and background factors can impact culpability in legally relevant ways, or in which systemic discrimination and the alienation of Indigenous collectives and individuals in the justice system are relevant background context for viewing case-specific circumstances before the court. While the Supreme Court of Canada has yet to weigh in on the application of the Gladue principles to sentencing proceedings in a civil or administrative law context there are several lower court decisions that have addressed this topic to date. Regulatory prosecutions First of all, there are several examples of the Gladue principles being considered and applied in sentencing proceedings for regulatory offences under federal or provincial public welfare statutes.1 The principles have even been applied\u2014whether directly or by analogy\u2014when imprisonment is neither sought nor statutorily available.2 These cases are noteworthy in 1 See for example: R v Lamouche, 2000 ABQB 461; R v Cardinal, 2009 ABPC 77 & 2010 ABQB 673; R v Joseph, 2013 BCPC 199 [Joseph]; R v Bob, 2015 BCPC 402 [Bob]; R v Seward, 2015 BCPC 71 [Seward]; v Johnnie, 2016 BCPC 96 at para 155 [Johnnie]; R v Henry, 2016 ONCJ 146 [Henry]; R v Sparrow and Grant, 2018 BCPC Grant]; 2019 QCCQ 8243 [Wysote]. 2 See for R Nagano, at note 18: Sentencing in Civil and Administrative Law ContextsCHAPTER 18 light of the Supreme Court of Canada's caution that regulatory offences are \"not criminal in any real sense\" and instead are \"in substance of a civil nature\", stating that offences such as these \"might well be regarded as a branch of administrative law to which traditional principles of criminal law have but limited application\".3 In spite of these important differences, the sentencing jurisprudence for regulatory offences supports either direct reliance on the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code or indirect reliance on the common law principles that they codify. Both provide a basis for reliance on the Gladue principles in this context. Often there will be an explicit statutory basis for importing the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code into the regulatory context, subject to any necessary modifications.4 But even in the absence of such statutory incorporation, these same provisions have been relied upon as reflections of universal principles of general applicability for the purposes of sentencing for regulatory offences.5 Where there is no statutory basis for reliance on the sentencing provisions set out in the Criminal Code, there may be an absence of any other guidance or expression of legislative intent in terms of sentencing principles. As noted by Judge Kukurin of the Ontario Court of Justice, reference to these provisions and the common law positions they have codified ensures that a sentence is not \"just chosen arbitrarily from the pool of sentence options available in any particular case\".6 Regardless of the underlying source of their sentencing principles, many sentencing decisions for regulatory offences have emphasized how public welfare statutes differ from the Criminal Code. For example, it is common for courts to point to deterrence as the primary or paramount sentencing principle for regulatory offences.7 In this context, deterrence has been described as having \"a more positive aspect\" than \"its usual negative connotation of achieving compliance by threat of punishment\".8 3 La Souveraine, Compagnie d'assurance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale v Autorit\u00e9 financiers, 2013 SCC 63, Wagner J at para 89, citing R v City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 SCR 1299 at 1302-3. 4 See for example: Provincial Offences Procedure Act, RSA 2000, c P-34, s 3; Offence Act, RSBC 1996, c 338, s 133; Summary Proceedings Act, RSNS 1989, c 450, s 7. 5 See R v Kirk, 2005 ONCJ 352 at para 16 [Kirk].

There is also an important role for the principle of restraint, \"which can influence not only fines but also the need for and length of incarceration\".15 This principle reflects \"the inherent notion of fairness that although sentencing must at times occur in the public interest, punishment should 9 Ibid, citing R v Roussy, [1977] OJ No 1208 (QL) (CA). See also Bob, supra note 1 at paras 63-66; Johnnie, supra note 1 at para 155; Steer, 2016 BCPC 318 at para 33; Dabaja v Ontario (Ontario Industry ONCJ 834 at para 21; R v Shercom Industries Inc, 2018 SKPC 3 at para 26. 10 Some courts have articulated specific factors to consider when sentencing for a breach of occupational health and safety regulations (see for example R v Allen Services & Contracting Ltd., 2018 NWTTC 3 at para 21). Others have articulated specific principles to be applied when sentencing for environmental offences (see for example R v Terroco Industries Limited, 2005 ABCA 141 at paras 34-64). 11 Alberta (Health Services) v at para at R Services Limited, 2015 ABPC 240 at para 30; Ontario (Labour) v New Mex Canada Inc, 2019 ONCA 30 at paras 66-74 [New Mex Canada]. 13 New Mex Canada, supra note 12 at para 73. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid at para 82.363 Chapter 18: Sentencing in Civil and Administrative Law ContextsCHAPTER 18 not be more aggressive than the public interest requires\".16 This principle may be extended to the sentencing of corporations for regulatory offences, but it applies with greater force in the sentencing of individuals who can lose their liberty through incarceration.17 Typically fines are sufficient to achieve the deterrence required for regulatory offences in light of this general principle of restraint and other sentencing principles.18 In light of the broad scope of judicial notice in Gladue and Ipeelee, which recognizes the harsher impact of imprisonment on Indigenous people and the higher rates of socio-economic disadvantage they face, the principle of restraint may provide a further basis for the application of the Gladue principles in the regulatory sentencing context. In order to implement the Gladue principles in regulatory prosecutions Gladue reports have sometimes been relied upon for case-specific information.19 Some courts have even ordered the preparation of Gladue reports in this context.20 In keeping with the criminal law jurisprudence, however, other sources may be relied upon when a Gladue report is not available, such as testimony from witnesses or the person being sentenced, or ordinary pre-sentence reports with relevant information.21 The application of the Gladue principles within sentencing proceedings for regulatory offences has been almost indistinguishable from their application in criminal sentencing. With the exception of cases where only fines are available, there may be little need to modify these principles to better suit this particular context. In fact, some sentencing proceedings will involve a combination of regulatory and criminal offences that could make it challenging to take inconsistent approaches when applying these principles.22 On the other hand, the distinct sentencing principles and considerations that are engaged by certain types of regulatory offences may require some flexibility with respect to the application of the Gladue principles. For example, the distinct meaning of deterrence in context to regulatory offences, emphasizing community disapproval and education, has been 16 Ibid. 17 Ibid. 18 Ibid at para 86. 19 note 1; R v Karau, 2014 ONCJ 207. 21 See for example Joseph, supra note 1. 22 See for example: R v Lazore, 2015 ONSC 1090; 364 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D found to be amenable to a restorative justice approach to sentencing in at least one reported decision.23 Likewise, the perspectives of Indigenous communities and victims can have greater significance where regulatory offences have impacted their collective and constitutionally protected Aboriginal and treaty rights, irrespective of whether the offender is an Indigenous person or even a natural person as opposed to a corporation.24 Greater attention to contextual differences like these may support a more meaningful application of the Gladue principles in regulatory prosecutions. Professional discipline hearings In another example of the Gladue principles being extended into an administrative law context, several hearing panels of self-governing professions have considered them when determining appropriate penalties for Indigenous professionals who have been found guilty of unprofessional conduct.25 There is even some precedent for the consideration of Indigenous peoples' systemic and background factors, worldviews, and alienation from the justice system on questions of procedural fairness in this context.26 This trend is an interesting one since the discipline decisions of self-governing professions are very clearly governed by administrative law principles rather than any statutory reference to the Criminal Code. Self-regulating professions in Canada are legislatively mandated to determine appropriate sanctions for breaches of their ethical and practice standards, and their determinations in this regard are owed deference from the courts when subject to judicial review.27 These disciplinary penalties can also be guided by principles that have no obvious parallels in the criminal law, such as public confidence in a profession and its effective self-regulation.28 23 Seward, supra note 1 at paras 79-80. 24 See for example: R v Joe, 2000 BCSC 1100 at para 22; R v Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation, 2016 NSPC 29; R v Kirby Offshore Marine Operating LLC, 2019 BCPC 185. 25 See for example: Law Society of Upper Canada v Terence John Robinson, 2013 ONLSHP 12 & 2013 ONSLAP 18 [Robinson]; Law Society of Upper Canada v Batstone, 2015 ONLSTH 214 & 2017 ONLSTH 34. Similar principles have also been applied to other racialized professionals: Law Society of Upper Canada v Selwyn Milan McSween, 2012 ONLSAP 3; Law Society of Upper Canada v Okpala, 2017 ONLSTH 204; Nova Scotia Barristers' Society v Lyle Howe, 2017 NSBS 4, aff 'd 2019 NBCA 81, leave to appeal to SCC ref 'd 39004 (30 April 2020). 26 See Coutlee (Re), 2018 LSBC 33. 27 See for example: Law Society of New Brunswick v Ryan, 2003 SCC 20; Richardson v Law Society of New Brunswick, 2011 NBCA 108; College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario v Peirovy, 2018 ONCA 420 at paras 72-76 [Peirovy]. 28 Faminoff The 2017 BCCA 373 at para 41.365 Chapter 18: Sentencing in Civil and Administrative Law ContextsCHAPTER 18 Nevertheless, courts will still assess the reasonableness of penalties based on consistency with previous decisions (i.e. parity) and proportionality, which require attention to the specific circumstances of the offence and the offender.29 They are also guided by more generalizable sentencing principles such as protection of the public, general and specific deterrence, and rehabilitation.30 These principles provide a very palpable basis for an Indigenous professional's unique circumstances to be considered in penalty decisions, albeit with necessary modifications to suit this context.31 The systemic and background factors of an Indigenous professional could also shed light on the evidence before the hearing panel in various other ways, such as helping contextualize an individual's attitude towards the police or their work for other Indigenous people as a reflection of their good character.32 Addressing the Gladue principles in penalty decisions has the potential to enhance the public's respect for and confidence in Canadian professions and their self-regulation rather than detracting from these considerations.33 It is worth noting that Indigenous over-incarceration has no direct relevance in sentencing Indigenous professionals for findings of unprofessional conduct.34 The harshest penalty available to discipline panels will be revocation of someone's licence to practise their particular profession. On the other hand, the regulatory bodies that govern the professions are typically guided by broad public interest mandates that could mandate attention to diversity within the professions.35 Similarly, they may be required to assist and support their members in meeting their professional obligations, bringing into play the need to accommodate their unique needs and circumstances.36 The principle of substantive equality might therefore justify the extension of the Gladue principles into 29 Matheson v College of Physicians and Surgeons of Prince Edward Island, 2010 PECA 5 at paras 130-131; Nanson v Saskatchewan College of Psychologists, 2013 SKQB 191 at para 38; Reid v College of Chiropractors of Ontario, 2016 ONSC 1041 at para 100; Merchant v Law Society of Saskatchewan, 2014 SKCA 56 at paras 119-122; Ontario (College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario) v Lee, 2019 ONSC 4294 at paras 101-110. 30 Peirovy, supra note 27 64.

In any event, hearing panels are likely to require case-specific information in order for them to meaningfully apply the principles in this context just as they would in any other.37 Contempt of court proceedings The Gladue principles have also been applied when sentencing an Indigenous person for contempt of court.38 Many of the same rationales for extending the Gladue principles into sentencing proceedings for regulatory offences and professional discipline apply in this context as well, especially their relationship to proportionality. Prior to addressing the case law on point, the basic principles that govern sentencing in context to contempt of court will be briefly summarized to place these decisions in context. Contempt of court proceedings are a discretionary power for the courts to enforce their process and maintain their dignity and respect by sanctioning a party for breaching their orders.39 The common law recognizes two different categories of contempt: criminal contempt and civil contempt.40 Criminal contempt addresses breaches of a court order accompanied by an element of \"public defiance\", whereas civil contempt aims to secure compliance with court orders where this element is absent.41 Civil contempt of court is still \"quasi-criminal in nature\" and the court order must be intentionally breached.42 In this context, public defiance means something more than an intentional breach\u2014namely \"conduct calculated to bring the administration of justice by the courts into disrepute\".43 Criminal contempt is a common law offence so the sentencing principles in s 718 of the Criminal Code do not directly apply, \"though they may 37 See for example Law Society of Alberta v Willier, 2018 ABLS 22 at para 35. 38 Frontenac Ventures Corporation v Ardoch Algonquin First Nation, 2008 ONCA 534, leave to appeal to SCC ref 'd 32764 (4 December 2008) [Frontenac]; Canadian National Railway Company v Plain, 2013 ONSC 4806 at paras 33-34; 39 Carey v at 30 [Carey]. 40 Ibid at para 31. 41 Ibid at para 31. 42 Carey, supra note 39 at paras 35, 41-42. 43 United Nurses of Alberta v Alberta (Attorney General), [1992] 1 SCR 901, 1992 CanLII 99.367 Chapter 18: Sentencing in Civil and Administrative Law ContextsCHAPTER 18 provide a useful backdrop\".44 Some criminal law sentencing principles like the separation of offenders from society or the provision of reparation to victims are not generally applicable in this context.45 The principle of rehabilitation is more relevant in civil contempt cases that primarily concern securing compliance with court orders, though deterrence may still have primacy in civil contempt cases.46 Denunciation and deterrence are the principal sentencing objectives for criminal contempt of court, and the fundamental principle of proportionality brings individualization and the parity principle into play as well.47 Prison sentences are not necessarily uncommon for criminal contempt of court as opposed to civil contempt.48 Sentencing for civil contempt is aimed at securing compliance with court orders but it can also be guided by punishment, and courts can craft a sentence to match the gravity of the contempt, deter the contemnor's continuing conduct, and deter others from engaging in similar conduct.49 The Ontario Court of Appeal has set out several factors to consider when sentencing for civil contempt that closely parallel the principles governing criminal sentencing, namely: proportionality; the presence of mitigating and aggravating factors; deterrence and denunciation; similarity to sentences in like circumstances (i.e. parity); and the reasonableness of a fine or incarceration.50 The Supreme Court of Canada has also emphasized that courts must show restraint in the exercise of their discretion in contempt of court proceedings, using these as a \"last rather than first resort\".51 Likewise, the principle of restraint has been applied in this context in the sense of relying on prison as a sanction of last resort.52 In several cases courts have sentenced contemnors to alternatives to incarceration like community service and house arrest as well.53 44 Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC v Mivasair, 2019 BCCA 156 at para 55. 45 321 para 52. 49 Ibid at para 32. 50 Boily v Carleton Condominium Corporation 145, 2014 ONCA 574 at para 90; Business Development Bank Cavalon Inc, 2017 ONCA 663 at para 90. 51 Carey, supra note 39 at para 36. 52 See for example: Free (Estate) v Jones, 2004 ABQB 486 at paras 35-37; Chiang (Re), 2009 ONCA 3 at para 90. 53 See for example: Alberta (Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, Director) v BM, 368 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D As systemic and background factors can affect the proportionality of a sentence for an Indigenous person by shedding light on moral blameworthiness they would presumably apply in this sentencing context just as they would in any other. Questions regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of a prison sentence for an Indigenous person would logically apply in this context as well. Alternatives to incarceration are also available, which suggests that an accommodative approach in line with the Gladue principles is possible. And while contempt of court proceedings emphasize deterrence over restorative principles, the Gladue analysis is regularly applied in long-term and dangerous offender proceedings that emphasize public protection so the primacy of deterrence in this context need not act as a categorical bar to the application of the Gladue principles either. In Frontenac Ventures Corporation the Ontario Court of Appeal indeed concluded that the Gladue principles apply when sentencing Indigenous people for contempt of court. This was a successful appeal from sentence for two leaders of the Ardoch Algonquin First Nation and the First Nation itself. Six-month prison sentences and substantial fines were imposed for civil contempt after the appellants and others peacefully disrupted exploratory uranium drilling within their traditional territory in breach of an injunction. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in focusing exclusively on punishment and deterrence and failing to address reformation and rehabilitation.54 The trial judge also erred by failing to refer to mitigating factors, including the events giving rise to their conduct and their leadership roles within their community.55 Likewise, the Court of Appeal held that the limited purpose of their conduct in preventing uranium exploration on lands subject to land- claim negotiations should have been considered.56 The Court of Appeal equated all of these considerations with the Gladue principles.57 The Court of Appeal in Frontenac noted that this matter engaged many of the broader concerns addressed in Gladue in terms of the justice system's overall engagement with Indigenous peoples.58 In particular 2009 ABCA at Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia v Skylite Building Maintenance Ltd, 2019 BCSC 1862 at paras 29-34. 54 Frontenac, supra note 38 para Ibid at para 51. 56 Ibid at para 53. 54. 58 Ibid at para 57.369 Chapter 18: Sentencing in Civil and Administrative Law ContextsCHAPTER 18 it pointed to the estrangement of Indigenous peoples from the justice system, the impacts from years of dislocation, and whether imprisonment would be meaningful to a particular Indigenous community.59 Enforcing injunctions by imprisonment in this context was held to emphasize the estrangement of this community and Indigenous peoples generally from the justice system.60 The use of prison as a first response \"dramatically marginalize[d] the significance of aboriginal law and aboriginal rights\" as well.61 Systemic and background factors including years of dislocation helped explain why the Indigenous leaders sentenced in this case did not see any meaningful avenue of redress within the justice system itself and resorted to self-help.62 Finally, a prison sentence would be far from meaningful to this First Nation as it would pit them against the justice system and emphasize the gulf between two differing senses of justice.63 The Court of Appeal also found that the conflict between the land claims and asserted constitutional rights of this First Nation and the applicable provincial mining legislation constituted a relevant background factor that should have resulted in \"significant mitigation\" in sentencing.64 Justice Lafreni\u00e8re of the Federal Court has also invoked the Gladue principles when sentencing an Indigenous person for civil contempt in an Indigenous governance context in Bacon St-Onge. In that case a member of the Pessamit Innu Nation sought to enforce a court order from a successful application for judicial review with respect to the First Nation's customary election code and an application that occurred pursuant to that code. Justice Lafreni\u00e8re reviewed the Gladue and Frontenac decisions and concluded that he must \"impose a sentence by resorting to the restorative model of justice in sentencing aboriginal offenders and reducing the imposition of jail sentences where to do so would not sacrifice the traditional goals of sentencing\".65 Justice Lafreni\u00e8re found that a term of imprisonment would create turmoil in the community as the First Nation's members had re- elected five of the seven respondents.66 Very little evidence had been 59 Ibid. 60 Ibid at para 58. 61 Ibid. 62 Ibid. Ibid at para 62. 65 Bacon St-Onge, supra 38 66 Ibid at para 89.370 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence PART D provided with respect to systemic and background factors, but the Court took note of the Canadian government's past interference with the governance of First Nations, the contribution of non-payment of fines to the crisis of Indigenous over-incarceration, and the different worldviews of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people \"with respect to such elemental issues as the substantive content of justice and the process of achieving justice\".67 Fines were imposed and the defendants were ordered to pay these amounts into court to be remitted to non- profit organizations in Pessamit.68 Conclusion The application of the Gladue principles in these sentencing proceedings outside the Criminal Code further demonstrates their contextual malleability and broad implications. While a period of incarceration can be a realistic consequence for contempt of court and certain regulatory offences, several of these cases indicate that the threat of imprisonment is not a necessary prerequisite for the principles to apply. This conclusion finds support in the existing case law on absolute and conditional discharges as well, as addressed in Chapter 17 of this book. The principle of proportionality applies in all these sentencing proceedings and provides a clear basis for the consideration of systemic and background factors when assessing an Indigenous person's moral blameworthiness. What may be more noteworthy is the way the Gladue principles have been adapted to differing contextual considerations, ranging from the good character of an Indigenous lawyer who represents marginalized Indigenous clients to the differing worldviews and perspectives on justice that clash during contested land claims and resource extraction activities. The broad framework and principles first set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gladue provide a contextual lens that seems to be quite amenable to careful repurposing in each of these contexts, among others. 67 Ibid, citing R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 at para 89. 68 Ibid at paras 91, 93.371 CONCLUSION The Supreme Court of Canada's trilogy of sentencing decisions in Gladue, Wells, and Ipeelee has left an indelible mark on Canadian law. The Gladue decision has been cited in over 2,700 subsequent decisions at the time of writing, Wells in over 600, and Ipeelee in almost 2,000. The contextual approach to sentencing in these cases has been linked to the constitutional principles of proportionality and substantive equality. The Supreme Court of Canada has illustrated how this contextual approach can be effectively repurposed in a wide variety of distinct legal contexts, ranging from judicial oversight for correctional decisions to the fashioning of new evidentiary protections for jury trials. Other courts have extended the Gladue principles directly or by analogy to the decisions of parole boards and mental health review boards.1 The principles are applied within criminal sentencing to determine periods of parole ineligibility and exemptions from firearms prohibitions.2 There are many other examples of how they have become entrenched in Canadian law that could not be fully explored within this publication. In the areas of law that are closely scrutinized here, it is clear Parliament's instruction for sentencing judges to pay \"particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders\" has had wide-ranging and often unpredictable legal implications over the subsequent two and a half decades. The interrogation of what makes Indigenous individuals and collectives unique in sentencing has opened up other lines of inquiry that have barely been explored to date. Nevertheless, applying the Supreme Court's broad framework and flexible principles in specific cases has not always been easy for the courts. According to Judge Gorman of the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador it is still difficult to assess s 718.2(e)'s practical effect on sentences more than two decades after it was added to the Criminal 1 See for example: R v Sim (2005), [2006] 2 CNLR 298, 2005 CanLII 37586 (Ont CA); Twins v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 537. 2 See for example: R v Johnny, 2016 ONCJ A Guide to the Jurisprudence Code.3 Chief Justice Richards of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has described the Supreme Court's decisions in Gladue and Ipeelee as challenging to operationalize.4 Contemporary cases from the Ontario Court of Appeal have emphasized that \"more than the bare assertion of an offender's Aboriginal status\" is required before the Gladue principles have any tangible impact on sentencing.5 It is remarkable to think that the Newfoundland Court of Appeal came to effectively this same conclusion back in 1994, prior to either the enactment of s 718.2(e) or the sentencing of Ms. Jamie Gladue.6 Whether these issues are fact-driven or reflect difficulties with the \"inferential approach\" required by the Gladue analysis is not entirely clear.7 The depth and breadth of the jurisprudence that has interpreted and applied the Gladue framework since 1999 may make it particularly unwieldy for the day-to-day functioning of sentencing courts. It is my sincere hope that this book at least modestly assists by synthesizing much of the case law. 3 R v JS, [2018] NJ No 290 (QL), 2018 CanLII para v Chanalquay, 2015 SKCA 141 at para 48. 5 R v 2017 450 at at para 38; R v EC, 2019 ONCA 688. 6 R PGH, [1994] NJ No 16 (QL), 1994 CanLII 9721 (CA). 7 R v Whitehead, 2016 SKCA 165 at para 63.373 TABLE OF CASES AAHN, R v, 2013 BCPC 425 ........ 240 AB v Brant Family and Child Services (CFSA s 144), 2017 CFSRB 26 ...206 Abraham, R v, 2000 ABCA 159 .... 129 Achneepineskum, R v, 2015 ONSC 5700 301 AD, R v , 2019 ABCA 396 ............. 194 Adam, R v, 2014 BCSC 1943 ........ 225 Adam, R v, 2017 SKPC 7 ............... 284 A(DR), R v, 337 AE, R v, 2017 ONCJ 511 .............. 164 AGA, R v, 1998 ABQB 60 ............. 215 Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec c Wysote, 2019 QCCQ 8243 v, ONCA ....... 264 Ahpay, R v, 2018 SKQB 147 ..................................... 174, 177, 238 AJ, R v , 2015 SKQB 156 ................ 174 AJJ, R ............. 299 AL, R v, 2018 NSPC 61 ........ 167, 343 Alaku, R, 2012 QCCA 1999 ...... 203 Alberta (Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, Director) v BM, 2009 ABCA 270 ................ 367-368 Alberta (Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, Director) v CL, 2020 ABPC 23 ........................... 213 Alberta (Health Services) v Bhanji, 2017 ABCA 126 ................................. 362 Alberta Report v Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission), 2002 ABQB 1081 ............................... 188Alec, R v, 2016 BCCA 347 ............. 265 Allen Services & Contracting Ltd., R v, 2018 NWTTC 3 ................ 362 Al-Saedi, R v, 2017 ONCJ 219 Altiman, R v, 2019 ONCA ..... 185 Alton, R v, 2012 ONSC 5500 v, 2014 SCC 41 ..................... 137-141, 151, 247, 362 Anderson, R v, 2016 MBPC 28 ...... 162 Anderson, R v, 2018 BCSC 2528 ..................................... 229, 297, 329 Anderson, R v, 2018 MBCA 42 ............................................ 337-339 Andres, R v, 2002 SKCA R v, 2017 BCSC 2288 ............................................ 161, 297 Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 SCR 143, 1989 CanLII 2 .................................... 143 Angus, R v, 2020 SKQB v, 2018 2 .... 180, 218 Apak, R v, 2018 NUCJ 2010 ABCA 363 ..................................... 202, 204-205374 THE GLADUE PRINCIPLES: A Guide to the Jurisprudence Arcand, R v, 2019 SKQB 131 ........ 174 Arey and Meyook, R v, 2006 YKTC 105 .............................................. 216 Armitage, R v, 2015 ONCJ 64 ............................. 161, 219, 222, 245 AS, R v, 2012 NSPC 104 ............... 335 AS, R v, 2016 ONSC 6965 ............ 149 AS, R v, 2017 Ashoona, v, v, 2017 BCCA 192 Atkinson, R v, 2012 YKTC 62 ... 194, 265 Atleo, R v, 2014 ..................................... v, ......

THE RELATIONSHIP OF COLONIALISM PROVIDES Over the past two decades Canadian courts have repeatedly acknowledged that Indigenous individuals and collectives face systemic discrimination throughout the criminal justice system. The system's disproportionate adverse impacts on Indigenous peoples have also been thoroughly studied and documented for over half a century. Indigenous individuals are over-represented among those charged, convicted, and sentenced to prison, as well as those who are victims of crime. Among other disparities, Indigenous individuals are more likely to be denied parole, spend a disproportionate amount of time in segregation, and are less likely to receive community-based sentences. At the same time, the criminal justice system has often marginalized the legal responses of Indigenous collectives to wrongdoing among their members. These systemic issues require systemic responses. On April 23, 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada provided one such response in its decision in R v Gladue, articulating a broad, open-ended framework to address this crisis of legitimacy and outcomes in the sentencing of Indigenous persons. The Gladue decision's main principles have since been extended to various other facets of the criminal justice system. At the direction of the BC First Nations Justice Council, this book synthesizes the hundreds of cases that expand on these principles to provide readily accessible guidance to all those involved in their practical implementation.
