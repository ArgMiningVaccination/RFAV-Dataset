Pepin,1*Shannon L. Kay,1Ben D. Golas,2 Susan S. Shriner,1Amy Lloyd-Smith,10 Colleen T. Webb2and Michael G. Buhnerkempe10Abstract Our ability to infer unobservable disease-dynamic processes such as force of infection (infection hazard for susceptible hosts) has transformed our understanding of disease transmission mecha- nisms and capacity to predict disease dynamics. Conventional methods for inferring FOI estimate a time-averaged value and are based on population-level processes. Because many pathogens exhi- bit epidemic cycling and FOI is the result of processes acting across the scales of individuals and populations, a flexible framework that extends to epidemic dynamics and links within-host processes to FOI is needed. Specically, within-host antibody kinetics in wildlife hosts can be short-lived and produce patterns that are repeatable across individuals, suggesting individual-level antibody concentrations could be used to infer time since infection and hence FOI. Using simula- tions and case studies (influenza A in lesser snow geese and Yersinia pestis in coyotes), we argue that with careful experimental and surveillance design, the population-level FOI signal can be recovered from individual-level antibody kinetics, despite substantial individual-level variation. In addition to improving inference, the cross-scale quantitative antibody approach we describe can reveal insights into drivers of individual-based variation in disease response, and the role of poorly understood processes such as secondary infections, in population-level dynamics of disease.

Ecology Letters (2017) 20: 275-292 INTRODUCTION Wildlife species are a major source of emerging infectious dis- ease (Jones et al. 2008) yet our understanding of disease dynamics in wildlife host populations is limited (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009). Disease dynamics depend on processes within and between individuals (Handel & Rohani 2015). Individual hosts become infected, then infectious. Depending on contact rates and susceptibility of other hosts, infectious hosts trans- mit pathogens to susceptible hosts. Accordingly, recent work addressing the role of within-host dynamics on between-host transmission has revealed the importance of cross-scale insights for understanding and predicting epidemiological out- comes (Handel & Rohani 2015). Consideration of both scalesin the same framework has elucidated how pathogens can circulate persistently under conditions where a single-scale analysis would predict extinction (Kramer-Schadt et al. 2009). Multiscale analyses have also improved understanding of phenotypic trade-offs across scales and how they ultimately determine the evolutionary ecology of pathogens (Alizon & van Baalen 2005; Mideo et al. 2008; al. 2013); understanding of the spread of drug-resistant (Handel et al. 2007) and viral immune escape mutations (Pepin et al. 2010; Volkov et al. 2010; Park et al. 2013; Schreiber et al. 2016); and prediction of how individual-level control methods (e.g. drug regimens) impact epidemic dynamics (Pepin et al. 2013).

We propose a framework for incorporating indi-vidual-level data into inference of disease dynamics using anti-body data. A key quantity describing disease dynamics is the force of infection (FOI), the rate at which susceptible individualsbecome infected, otherwise described as the infection hazardfor susceptible individuals in a population. Thus, FOI is oneof the most sought after quantities for understanding and pre-dicting disease dynamics (Caley & Hone 2002; Heisey et al. 2006, 2010; Atkinson & Samuel 2010; Mueller et al. 2012; Henaux et al. 2013; Samuel et al. 2015; Avril et al. 2016), determining disease hazard (Gay 1996b; Rodriguez-Barraqueret al. 2015), evaluating and planning interventions (Farrington 1992; Caley & Hone 2004), and calculating other key unob- servable quantities such as the basic reproductive number (Ferguson et al. 1999; Feng et al. 2014), or the critical vacci- nation threshold (Whitaker & Farrington 2004). Correspond-ingly, a long history of estimating FOI from diseasesurveillance data exists (Hens et al. 2010), although most of this work has been in human disease systems and mostmethods have not considered individual-level processes inestimation of FOI. Another major gap is that conventional methods are designed to estimate a time-averaged FOI which is relevant toendemic disease dynamics but not appropriate for epidemic patterns. Many pathogens exhibit seasonal and/or interannual variation in disease transmission (Hosseini et al. 2004; Grassly & Fraser 2006; Tamerius et al. 2011; Stoddard et al. 2014), which result in recurrent epidemic peaks. Estimates showinghow FOI changes over time (Reiner et al. 2014; Pomeroy et al. 2015) would reveal mechanistic insight into ecological drivers of disease transmission, leading to improved diseaseprevention and response strategies. We summarise and criti-cally evaluate existing methods for estimating FOI and pro-pose a general cross-scale framework that transcends many ofthe limitations of other methods. For wildlife systems, our proposed method overcomes the following limitations of conventional methods: ne-scaled age data are not required,time-varying FOI can be inferred from short time series ofserosurveillance data, rapidly decaying antibody levels areacceptable and effects of individual-level processes in diseasedynamics can be examined. We demonstrate using simulationsthat our individual-level approach can capture population-level FOI well from cross-sectional serosurveillance data, evenwhen challenged by substantial individual-level variation anddifferences in process behaviour, such as antibody decay rate.We also demonstrate the value of individual-level inference in advancing disease ecology practice by applying our approach to a case study of influenza A data collected longitudinally incaptive mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ), snow geese ( Chen caerulescens ). Last, we illustrate how our framework can be applied to additionalhost-pathogen systems, with complex ecological processessuch as variation in route of exposure (e.g. Yersinia pestis in coyotes), and multiple exposures of individuals (e.g. influenzaA in mallards). We discuss how these and otherepidemiological complexities (listed in Table 1) could be incorporated into our general framework to better understandtheir contribution to FOI in a variety of host-pathogen sys-tems. Age-seroprevalence methods The conventional approach to inferring based on 'age-seroprevalence age-stratied seroprevalence data (presence or absence ofantibody in the host) and assume lifelong immunity such thatthe cumulative hazard of infection increases with age (Muench1934, 1959; Farrington 1990; Hens et al. 2010) methods are inappropriate in wildlife-host sys- tems where the host is short-lived (not practical to distinguishages), where age data are coarse and imprecise (not enoughinformation to t the age-seroprevalence curve), or whereantibodies decay quickly (no signature of increased seropreva-lence with age). Also, age-seroprevalence methods assume aconstant FOI over time (Fig. 1a) and long temporal datasetswith large sample sizes are typically required to make infer-ence about time-varying FOI (Grenfell & Anderson 1985; butsee Heisey et al. 2010 for an alternative). A flexible method that relaxes these potentially problematic assumptions (i.e. necessity for age data, reasonably long-lived hosts, slow anti- body decay, serial surveillance sampling, or constant FOI overtime) remains to be developed and may improve inference ofdisease dynamics in wildlife systems that often violate one ormore assumptions of conventional methods. Age-seroprevalence methods utilise presence/absence data, but the assays used to detect antibodies (e.g. enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assays, ELISA) typically produce quantita-tive data. Thus, a threshold must be determined to classifythe quantitative antibody measurements as seropositive orseronegative, introducing potential misclassication error (deMelker et al. et al. et al. 2015; Borremans et al. 2016; Pothin et al. 2016) that should be treated explicitly (Gay 1996a; Vyse et al. 2006), and neglecting the potentially valuable informationthat can be gained from considering the quantitative anti-body data (Bollaerts et al. 2012; Pothin et al. 2016). As anti- body levels decay rapidly over time in many wildlife host-pathogen systems (especially in non-mammalian hosts), thereis opportunity to learn about temporal disease dynamics ina population by considering antibody levels in individualhosts. Thus, 'quantitative antibody methods' circumventerror associated with transforming antibody data to binary values. Quantitative antibody methods A new eld has emerged that uses quantitative antibody assays to infer incidence (Teunis et al. 2002, 2012; de Melker et al. et 2010; Borremans et al. 2016; Pothin et al. 2016). By considering the underlying quantitative antibody information, the dependenceon age data and long-term antibody circulation for inferenceof FOI can be relaxed. In effect, the historical perspective pro-vided by age data can be replaced with antibody response \u00a92017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS276 K. M. Pepin et al. Idea and Perspectivecurves because the decay from peak antibody levels becomes a source of information rather than a nuisance. The main con-cept is that pathogen-specic antibody kinetics exhibit robust, reproducible patterns, as long as individual-level hetero- geneities in antibody response are accounted for appropriately(Simonsen et al. 2009; Teunis et al. 2012, 2013), and thus can be used to infer the time since infection (TSI) for individualsand population incidence (Teunis et al. 2002, 2012; de Melker et al. 2006; Simonsen et al. 2009; Kretzschmar et al. 2010;Borremans et al. 2016) or FOI (Fig. 1b). Quantitative approaches to inferring incidence lend themselves naturally toestimating time-varying FOI because historical epidemiologi- cal status of sampled individuals can be determined. Quantita- tive antibody approaches also necessarily consider within-hostimmunity dynamics to infer population-level FOI, whichcould lead to novel insights into wildlife disease ecology. To date, quantitative antibody approaches have focused on incidence (rate of new cases) rather than FOI, which considersTable 1 Epidemiological complexities that present challenges for inference and prospects for addressing them Challenge Experimental data needs Serosurveillance data needs Proposed model renements 1) Disease-associated mortality Time between infection and death for individuals that do notsurvive; proportion that do not surviveSamples from dead animals (record estimated time of death;test sample for target pathogen)Incorporate censoring in within-host model, g(d,h).

Also, these approaches estimate average inci-dence in the population rather than allowing change in inci-dence over time (de Melker et al. 2006; Simonsen et 2010; Teunis et al. 2012; Teunis 2015). A recent advance showed that quantitative longitudinal antibodydata (repeat samples from the same individual over time) couldbe used to estimate time-varying incidence accurately undercomplex endemic dynamics (Borremans et al. 2016). However, because it is rare for wildlife surveillance to collect repeat sam-ples from individuals, an approach that works with cross-sec- tional serosurveillance data is valuable as well. We argue that quantitative antibody methods are a promis- ing avenue for studying the mechanisms underlying epidemicpatterns. These methods inherently account for individual-level processes contributing to FOI and reveal time-varyingFOI. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, variability frommultiple epidemiological processes can be accounted forexplicitly and described by data, which in turn can improveour mechanistic understanding of heterogeneities driving dis-ease dynamics and improve inference. Also, because age dataare not required, quantitative antibody methods have broader application in wildlife populations relative to conventional methods. Similarly, quantitative antibody methods make useof information from waning antibody levels, which can leadto misclassication by conventional methods. For quantitative antibody methods to reach their full poten- tial in revealing underlying drivers of FOI, incorporating amechanistic model of within-host antibody kinetics is valu- able, because it allows for explicit description of individual- level processes with biologically interpretable parameters(Simonsen et al. 2009; Teunis et al. 2012; de Graaf et al. 2014). In what follows, we present a general quantitative anti-body framework based on a mechanistic model of antibodykinetics and explicit representation of individual-level varia-tion, and demonstrate its ability to infer FOI accurately inmany circumstances. We show how quantitative antibody data(i.e. concentration of antibody within individuals) from longi-tudinal studies within hosts (experimental data) can enableestimation of time since infection (TSI) for hosts sampled cross-sectionally in a population (serosurveillance data). From the individual-level TSI, we derive the history of epidemiologi-cal status (newly infected, susceptible or seropositive) for allhosts sampled in a population, and consequently FOI. Theapproach we outline addresses many of the challenges facedby current methods: epidemic dynamics, coarse age data,rapidly waning immunity, cross-sectional serosurveillancedata, complex antibody kinetics, and individual-level variationin antibody responses. We demonstrate how our proposedcross-scale framework can be used in a variety of host-patho-gen systems to infer epidemic dynamics and understand the role of different ecological processes.

In addition, let d=t/C0sbe the time since infec- tion (TSI), where sis the day of infection and tis the sampling day. Furthermore, assume antibody responses for infected indi- viduals are observed with error and are normally distributed around some mean curve, g(d,h) (e.g. eqn 1), with variance r2. The model specication is given above, where yis a xed threshold value indicating whether individual jhas been recently infected, d2jis the TSI for individual j, distributed as a Poisson random variable with global mean TSI, k,for recently infected individuals. The prior for kwas distributed as Gamma with xed shape and scale parameters of 10 and 1, respectively, while the prior for r2 was distributed as inverse-gamma with shape and scale parameters both equal to 2. From each seropositive ( y>y*) individual's estimated TSI and sampling day, we get time of infection which we use to determine the number of newly infected individuals (newE) for each calendar day of interest in the past. For each calendar day, we also record the number of susceptible individuals (S) asthe number that were seronegative ( yy*) on day t. Then, FOI for day tis derived as: new E t/St-1. ASSUMPTIONS OF CURRENT MODEL 1 Individual-level variation in antibody kinetics is the same for experimental and serosurveillance data. 2 Individuals sampled as susceptible ( y<y*) are classied as susceptible for all previous time steps. 3 Ratio of newly exposed to susceptible individuals in samples mirrors true population ratios (unbiased random sampling).4 No disease-induced mortality.5 Homogenously mixing population: all susceptible individuals have equal probability of contacting infectious individuals. Thisonly applies to deriving FOI, not estimating incidence. 6 All newly infected hosts become infectious. This only applies to deriving FOI, not estimating incidence. \u00a92017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRSIdea and Perspective Inferring infection hazard from data across scales 279adapted from (Simonsen et al. 2009; example shape in Fig. 2). The deterministic function gdepends on both a vector of parameters that describes antibody kinetics ( h,unknown) and TSI ( d, known for the laboratory experiment data but unknown for the serosurveillance data). The antibody kinetics parameter vector hincludes six parameters (eqn 1): baseline antibody level prior to exposure ( X1), initial lag between exposure and antibody production ( A), antibody production rate ( r), period of antibody production in response to infec- tion ( B), antibody decay rate ( d) and baseline antibody levels following antibody decay ( X2). We assume that both the kinetic and serosurveillance data are measured with error andsubject to the same amount of individual-level variation ( r 2). To represent antibody quantities we used signal to noise (S:N) ratios -the output of ELISAs, a commonly used antibody detection assay. We transformed the data by taking the inverse followed by the base 10 logarithm [log 10(1/S:N ratio)], prior to analysis. The transformation yielded the characteris-tic rise and fall of antibody levels (raw S/N ratios fall andthen rise) and negative values, which could be modelled witha normal distribution. For an observed antibody quantity y (either y 1ory2) collected the threshold of antibody detection ( y*), the measured antibody quantity can be used to estimate TSI for the jth individual ( d2j) through the gfunction. Using the estimated TSIs for each individual in the serosurveillance data, a disease status his-tory (susceptible, newly exposed or antibody positive) overtime can be determined for each individual. Then, wederived incidence as the number of newly infected individu-als on day t(i.e. transitions from S to E, Fig. 2) divided bythe total sample size on day t. Similarly, we derived FOI for each day tby dividing the number of newly infected individuals on day t(i.e. transitions from S to E, Fig. 2) by the number of susceptible individuals on day t/C01 (Box 1). We estimated TSI using Bayesian methods (Supporting Information 1). To evaluate performance of our quantitative antibody approach, we developed a stochastic population-level diseasetransmission model that could produce known trajectoriesof incidence and FOI while tracking antibody quantitieswithin individuals (Supporting Information 2, Fig. 2). Wesimulated serosurveillance data ( y 2) by sampling the simu- lated population according to a pattern that matched thesampling of snow goose populations, which involved sam-pling 200 individuals without replacement (10% of the sim-ulated population) each day for 1 week. We simulated experimental data ( y 1) using the antibody kinetic model (enq 1) to generate known antibody trajectories for 30hypothetical individuals. ANTIBODY DECAY RATE Intuitively, one might expect that longer decay rates wouldincrease uncertainty in inference of FOI because individual-level variation in antibody concentrations is typically highestduring the decay phase, leading to more uncertainty in TSI.We tested this hypothesis by simulating antibody kinetic andserosurveillance data based on different mean antibodylongevities (time between start of antibody rise and decay tobaseline): 100 days (similar to influenza A in mallards -see below), 300 days and 600 days (Fig. 3a, Supporting Informa- tion 2 and 3). As expected, uncertainty in inferred quantities(seroprevalence, incidence, FOI) increased as antibody longev-ity increased (i.e. with decreased antibody decay rate; Fig. 3b - d). With antibody longevities <600 days, the model captured the magnitude and timing of peak FOI well with low uncer-tainty (Fig. 3d). With an antibody longevity of 600 days (al-most 2 years), the model tended to overestimate FOI but stillcaptured timing of the peak well with a level of uncertaintythat gave a clear epidemic signal (Fig. 3d).

Top plot shows that antibody quantities over time were tracked within individuals once they became infected (transitioned from S to E). Bottom shows that individuals transitioned between different epidemiological states. Note that seropositivity was pos sible when individuals were still in the I state, thus there was also an IP state which was not tracked explicitly. \u00a92017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS280 K. M. Pepin et al. Idea and Perspectiveof rapid antibody decay (100 days), the model tended to produce larger misclassication errors (rising vs. decayingphases), generating a second peak that was not present inthe true (simulated) dynamics (Fig. 3d, left). Misclassica-tion was less of a problem for slower decay rates, becauseindividuals spend proportionately more time in the decay vs.rising phase.TIMING OF SAMPLING RELATIVE TO EPIDEMIC CURVE Our simulations used a cross-sectional sampling design of serosurveillance data where individuals were sampled over a1-week period without replacement to match the snow geesedata.

We used antibody kinetic parametersthat were estimated by tting eqn 1 to the experimental mal-lard data (mean antibody longevity =100 days, low level of individual variation, only 30 individuals; Fig. 4a). When sam-ples were collected immediately following the main epidemicpeak, the model inferred magnitude and timing of the mainFOI curve well (Fig. 4d, middle). However, as the time sincethe epidemic peak increased relative to the time of sampling,the model estimated a later peak FOI relative to the truth and showed increased misclassication of individuals in the rising vs. decaying phase of antibody response (Fig. 4d, right). Simi-lar patterns were observed for incidence (Fig. 4c). In terms ofFOI, the mismatch in timing occurred because the model esti-mated a later onset of susceptible depletion and increasedseroprevalence (Fig. 4b). If there is prior information aboutthe timing of the epidemic peak in question, this could be incorporated into the prior distribution for the TSI parameter,thus improving precision. The timing of sampling relative to the main epidemic curve is important and surveillance sampling design can vary widelyacross systems, thus, we extended the model to accommodatesampling (cross-sectionally) more consistently across time(Fig. 5; 'Systematic Sampling Model' Supporting Information4). The main changes to the model included: 1) using a slidingwindow dening separate sampling periods over which FOI was calculated, and 2) including a temporal smoothing pro- cess on mean TSI to account for temporal autocorrelationdue to the epidemic curve (Supporting Information 4). Theautoregressive process on mean TSI allows the TSI parameterto learn from other samples collected at approximately thesame time, which improves our ability to correctly classifySampling week1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0Proportion Antibody response Incidence FOI 0.0 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.04 0.08 0.12 0.4 0.800100 100 300 200 3000 100 200 300 0 100 200 300 05 15 25 0 10 20 30 40 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 8005 15 25 0 10 20 30 40 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 8005 1 5 25 0 10 20 30 40 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 Calendar dayIndividual-level data Population-level data Seropositive True NS TrueTrue Posterior True Posterior Sampling weekTime since infection(a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 4 Effects of sampling pulse relative to timing of FOI curve.

Idea and Perspectiveantibody quantities into the rising or decaying phase of the antibody response curve, hence improving estimation of TSI.Using the same parameters as Fig. 4, but sampling more con-sistently across time (20 individuals of 2000 per week for1 year), resulted in very good inference of true FOI and nosecondary peak artefacts (Fig. 5). Thus, increasing the lengthof the sampling period and number of sampling occasions canprovide more reliable inference of the timing of an epidemic curve. APPLICATION TO INFLUENZA A IN SNOW GEESE Understanding the ecology of avian influenza A transmission dynamics in wild bird populations is complicated becauseserosurveillance data are often temporally constrained to arelatively brief cross-sectional sampling frame, making it dif- cult to understand drivers of disease dynamics over time.However, as we have demonstrated, by considering the quan-titative antibody information in individuals together with thedynamic nature of immune responses, we can infer transmis-sion dynamics over a longer period in the past, thus providinginsights about mechanisms of transmission in populations atparticular sites. We demonstrate the value of this approach using a case study of influenza A in snow geese sampled cross-sectionally(y 2) during the summer of 1995 at Banks Island, Canada (Fig. 7 top left, see Supporting Information 5 for eld sam-pling details). To inform the individual-level antibody kinetics(y 1), we used experimental antibody kinetic data from six snow geese and 30 mallards (Fig. 6 top right, Supporting0 50 100 150 200 Time since infection (TSI)Antibody response 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 Individuallevel data Populationlevel data P FOI Posterior FOI Sample days Calendar day(a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 5 Serial cross-sectional sampling.

We compared using mallard and geese data together, or the geesedata separately with simulated curves to increase the samplesize from 6 to 36 (Fig. 6, top right; Supporting Information5). We also compared results using two separate distributionsof TSI: Poisson as in Box 1, and negative binomial to allow more flexibility in TSI. The two approaches predicted the same timing of peak FOI, but the geese experimental datapredicted FOI with lower precision and the mallard/geeseexperimental data predicted a slower rise to peak FOI underthe negative binomial distribution of mean TSI (Fig. 6, bot-tom). We estimated peak seroprevalence in the snow goosepopulation to be c. 0.65 (Fig. 6). Peak daily incidence was estimated to be c. 0.05 -0.18 and peak daily FOI c. 0.09 -0.25 (depending on assumptions about the distribution of TSI - Poisson vs. negative binomial, Fig. 6), which is consistent withseroconversion rates estimated with the same dataset (Samuel et al. 2015). The fact that the shape of the epidemic curve dif- fered substantially depending on assumptions about the errorstructure of the TSI distribution (Poisson vs. negative bino-mial), suggests future theoretical work may be helpful forrening the general framework we present here. Nonetheless,regardless of the assumption about the error structureunderlying the TSI distribution, a similar time of peak FOI was estimated. The quantitative antibody approach suggests an initial rise in FOI towards the end of the nesting period, with peakFOI occuring at the end of the hatching period. The pres-ence of a rise in FOI to an epidemic peak most new off- spring are available is consistent with previous studies showing that avian influenza A viruses overwinter on water-fowl breeding grounds in northern latitudes, leading to viraltransmission during the breeding season (Ito et al. 1995; Farnsworth et al. 2012; Hill et al. 2016). Furthermore, snow geese are highly gregarious colony nesting birds, which maypromote the transmission and maintenance of density-depen-dent pathogens (Samuel et al. 2015) such as influenza A viruses and Pasteurella bacteria (Samuel et al. 1999). Rather than providing a single snapshot of seroprevalence, the quan-titative antibody approach infers transmission dynamics throughout the nesting, hatching, and early raising of young phases of the breeding season, demonstrating how quantita-tive antibody approaches can be applied to advance ourunderstanding of breeding-season transmission dynamics.Furthermore, if additional data explaining potential sourcesof individual-level variation are available, this type of0 1 02 03 04 05 06 00.0 0.2 0.4 0.6LowLow 01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 00.0 0.2 0.4 0.6Medium 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6High 80 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 00.0 0.2 0.4FOI 0.6Medium 01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 00.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 80 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 00.0 0.2 0.4 0.6High 01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 00.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 00.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Calendar daySerosurveillance data variationAntibody kinetic data variation True Posterior Figure 7 Model performance as a function of individual-level variation.

INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL VARIATION Individual-level variation in host antibody responses can be dueto intrinsic factors of the pathogen such as genetic variation orimmune evasion tactics (Alcami & Koszinowski 2000; Finlay & McFadden 2006); or due to extrinsic factors such as host physi- ological status, dose (Turmelle et al. 2010), or route of exposure (Baeten et al. 2013). The existence of a multitude of factors affecting individual-level variation presents potential challengesin extracting FOI from quantitative serosurveillance data (Gil-bertet al. 2013). To investigate this potential challenge, we gen- erated antibody kinetic and serosurveillance data underdifferent levels of variation in decay rates (Supporting Informa-tion 2, and 6). We compared cases where antibody kinetic datahad either low, medium or high individual response variationwhile holding individual variation in serosurveillance data con- stant at low, medium or high levels and vice versa to produce all combinations of variation for both data types (SupportingInformation 6). In our analysis, plots along the diagonal matchthe model assumption that individual-level variation is similarin both data streams while plots outside the diagonal do notmatch this assumption. In general, the model performed betterunder equal levels of variation for both data streams (Fig. 7), but this was not consistent (e.g. low variation in antibodykinetic data and medium variation in serosurveillance data per-formed equally well as matching levels of variation; Fig. 7, topmiddle). Violation of the equal variation assumption biasedresults when one of the data streams had high individual-levelvariation (Fig. 7, bottom row and right column). In addition, even when the assumption of equal variation was satised, high individual-level variation underestimated the timing of peakFOI, although the magnitude was still captured well (Fig. 7,bottom right). When individual-level variation in the antibodykinetic data was higher than that in serosurveillance data, themodel overestimated the timing and magnitude of peak FOIsubstantially (Fig. 7 bottom, left and middle). Alternatively,when variation in serosurveillance data was substantially higherthan that of antibody kinetic data, the timing of peak FOI wasunderestimated substantially (Fig. 7, right top and rightmiddle). Overall, our results show that extreme levels of individual- level variation can lead to poor performance of the model asformulated; especially if the assumption of equal variationbetween the data streams is not satised. Nonetheless, themodel performed very well under medium levels of variationthat were similar to those quantied in the mallard data, sug-gesting it is capable of recovering the epidemic signal underrealistic conditions.

M. Pepin et al. Idea and Perspectivevariation in experimental and serosurveillance data is satised, bias from high levels of variation is not as severe. If the modelis re-specied based on improved knowledge of potential dif-ferences in individual-level variation between experimentaland serosurveillance data, bias from unbalanced individual-level variation could be decreased. Given the flexibility of our approach, there is potential for individual-level variation to be further informed by data(Table 1; Borremans et al. 2016). Factors such as age, sex (Borremans et al. 2016), environmental conditions, pathologi- cal signs, additional immunological factors or reproductivestatus can be incorporated as covariates predicting a narrowerrange of responses for individuals with specic characteristics.For example, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may distinguishinherent differences in immune responsiveness among individ-uals (Graham et al. 2010). Thus, experimental data of ANA titres (or other general indices of antibody responsiveness, e.g. total IgG concentration) sampled temporally alongside anti- body responses, could improve inference in systems with highindividual-level variation when combined with serosurveillancedata, where these factors are also collected. By explicit incor-poration of factors determining individual-level variation,inference could be improved and mechanistic knowledge about the role of the additional factors on dynamics of FOI wouldbe revealed, hence improving our understanding of diseaseecology. To demonstrate how data on drivers of individual-level vari- ation could improve inference, we extended our model to examine how high individual-level variation from route of exposure of Yersinia pestis (agent of plague) in coyotes affected inference of FOI. We simulated scenarios where twodifferent antibody kinetic responses were possible in individualhosts depending on route of exposure (Supporting Informa-tion 7). We adapted the systematic surveillance model (Sup-porting Information 4) to incorporate a mixture of antibodykinetic models, each with their own parameters (SupportingInformation 7). We chose parameters for eqn 1 that mimickedantibody kinetics of Yersinia pestis in coyotes, where the oral route of transmission results is a much stronger response than the intradermal route of infection (Baeten et al. 2013). We assumed that there were covariate data such as pathologicalsigns that may help distinguish the route of exposure (i.e.choice of antibody response distribution) and no misclassica-tion of the response due to oral vs. intradermal infection. When we used our original model that did not account for multiple distributions of antibody responses, the timing ofpeak FOI was biased late (Fig. 8, top left). Using the mixturemodel, we captured the timing of peak FOI accurately,although the curve was slightly lower and wider than pre-dicted (Fig. 8, top right). In general, accounting for the sources of individual-level variation greatly improved infer- ence and captured the timing and general behaviour of FOIwell. Of course, our study provides a simplied version ofhow drivers of individual-level variation could be modelledexplicitly. If there are more than two different modes of anti-body kinetics and measurable predictive factors, then covari-ate data can be used to predict individual-level responsecurves with the appropriate level of uncertainty (Table 1).Note that although the framework we propose can beimproved by age data, the age data can be coarse (2 -3 age classes), unlike in conventional age-seroprevalence methodswhich require ne-scaled age data. ANAMNESTIC RESPONSES In many systems, infection history can influence antibodyresponses because secondary exposures activate memory cells leading to sharp increases in antibody titre (Table 1). Influ- enza A in mallards highlights this issue -anamnestic responses produce higher antibody titres and achieve peaklevels earlier relative to primary infections (Supporting Infor-mation 5 and 7). The contribution of anamnestic responses toFOI, or their effect on inference, is not well understood andfew studies have attempted to apply a quantitative antibodymethod while considering anamnestic responses (Pothin et al. 2016). Without explicit consideration, anamnestic responsesmay be confused with primary infections, adding uncertaintyto estimates of TSI and FOI. Currently, FOI for time periods with frequent anamnestic responses may be biased if there is no information for the model to distinguish the two processes. To explore the idea that our framework could capture FOI in systems with anamnestic responses, we simulated diseasetransmission under conditions where hosts were allowed to bere-infected. Re-infection could occur only after immunity hadwaned to twice the baseline level, and it generated ananamnestic response which generally arose faster and decayedfaster than primary infections (Supporting Information 5 and7). Hosts with secondary, etc. infections did not become infec-tious in our example. We t a similar mixture model as with theYersinaia pestis example, where there were two separate functions describing antibody responses for primary infectionsvs. anamnestic responses. We assumed that classication ofserosurveillance data into primary infections or anamnesticresponses was perfect, and that covariate data such as age,sex or time of year could be used to inform classication ofinfection history. This type of model could be further devel-oped to estimate the classication group with informed priordistributions. When we used our original model that did notaccount for multiple distributions of antibody responses, thetiming of peak FOI was biased early (Fig. 8, bottom, left). Using the mixture model, we captured the timing of peak FOI accurately (Fig. 8, bottom right), indicating that appropriatedata for distinguishing primary infections from anamnesticresponses (secondary or more) may allow for accurate infer-ence of FOI. In addition to age, sex and time of the year, datasuch as IgG:IgM ratios could be collected and used in theinference framework to predict antibody response distribu-tions for individuals based on their covariate data (i.e. movingbeyond a two-component mixture model to multiple distribu-tions of antibody response curves). Modelling anamnesticresponses directly will not only improve inference of FOI but will also lead to a better understanding of the contribution of secondary infections in FOI dynamics. DISCUSSION OF ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITIES Our simulation and case study results demonstrate how quan-titative antibody methods can capture the timing, magnitude \u00a92017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRSIdea and Perspective Inferring infection hazard from data across scales 287and width of epidemic curves under multiple sets of condi- tions, showing that quantitative antibody methods can beused to infer time-varying FOI for epidemic dynamics in avariety of host-pathogen systems. However, there are severalother epidemiological factors driving variation in serosurveil-lance data. Each of these factors can increase individual-level variation in antibody responses and bias or increase uncer- tainty in FOI. In Table 1 and below, we list many of thesecomplexities and describe how they could be accounted forexplicitly by adapting our approach for use in other host-pathogen systems. Disease-associated mortality In systems with disease-associated mortality (Table 1), ourcurrent model underestimates the number of newly infectedindividuals (Heisey et al. 2006) because those that die before eliciting an immune response do not provide any antibodyinformation. When disease-associated mortality is relativelyhigh (e.g. rabies), our method can be adapted to accommo-date data from samples of carcasses, which include an esti-mate of host 'day of death,' for improved inference (Table 1).If the distribution of time to death has been measured experi-mentally, the experimental data can be used similarly in our model to infer TSI based on surveillance data of 'time of death.' In cases with less than 100% disease-associated mor-tality, the model can be adjusted to accommodate bothstreams of surveillance data, whereas, if mortality is 100%,the antibody portion of the model can be excluded. Detection In most serosurveillance systems, there are at least two impor-tant sources of detection-based uncertainty that should beconsidered: (1) measurement error when quantifying antibod-ies, and (2) sampling error when choosing a subset of individ-uals from the population to sample (Table 1). Imperfectserological assays can be a major source of measurementerror, especially in wildlife disease systems (Gilbert et al. 2013) or when there is substantial pathogen diversity and/orcross-reactivity in a diagnostic system (Manseld et al. 2011). In these cases, selection of the antigen employed in serologicaltests is not trivial and impacts quantitative results (Troyer et al. 2005), suggesting it may be useful to consider suites of antigenic markers for estimating TSI to reduce uncertainty.For animal systems, experimental infections conducted in thetarget host species are extremely valuable for quantifyingassay sensitivity and specicity (Bean et al. 2013) and develop- ing epidemiological models that inform disease ecology andsurveillance design (e.g. reviewed in Plowright et al. 2016). Previous work has shown that experimental information onassay sensitivity and specicity can be incorporated into mod-els of serosurveillance data, decreasing bias in estimates ofprevalence (McClintock et al. 2010). Likewise, the modelling framework we present is amenable for incorporation of this source of error by modelling it explicitly as a factor affectingthe threshold of detection ( y*) and/or parameters of the anti- body kinetic function, depending on the type of error pro-duced by the assay (Table 1).Epidemiologists studying human diseases have long recog- nised the importance of accounting for sampling error, oftenreferred to as 'underreporting' or variation in reporting rates(CDC 1996). Likewise, mechanistic descriptions of samplingerror have been deemed important for inference of wildlife dis-ease parameters such as prevalence (McClintock et al. 2010; Bailey et al. 2014) or FOI (Conn et al. 2012), which were moti- vated by ecological work accounting for sampling error to pro-vide better inference for unobserved ecological quantities(Williams et Hooten 2015). Recent work also emphasisesthat, in addition to sample size and independence between sam-pled individuals, sampling design should consider underlyingseasonality in demographic and disease dynamics to obtain themost accurate estimates of disease transmission parameters(Vinh & Boni 2015). In systems with seasonality in diseasetransmission, it is useful to collect the surveillance data over a time scale that captures cycling and make inference over sys- tem-specic time intervals (i.e. interval no larger than longevityof antibody response) to decipher temporal heterogeneity in theFOI (Simonsen et al. 2009; Vinh & Boni 2015). Provided that surveillance is conducted at intervals that capture epidemiccycling and at least some individuals with antibody titres arefound, issues from small sample sizes can be attenuated byaggregating data from several sampling events (Blackwoodet al. 2013). In addition, because each sample generates an indi- vidual's epidemiological status (susceptible, newly infected,seropositive for each day of interest in the past), more data can be used for calculating FOI at previous time steps as the sam- pling period increases, which could increase accuracy of the esti-mates (e.g. temporal quantitative antibody model we present inSupporting Information 4). Endemic dynamics We considered the situation where a pathogen invades a com- pletely susceptible population, generating a single epidemic peak. Combined with a brief period of sampling, this led tothe assumption that expected TSI has the same mean for allindividuals, which is inappropriate when there are multipleepidemic peaks or more complicated dynamics occurringwithin the time frame of the analysis. In the systematic sam-pling model (Fig. 5, Supporting Information 4), we relax theequal-mean assumption by allowing mean TSI to vary overtime depending on recent antibody levels, which improvesinference for samples collected over longer time periods and isimportant for adapting this framework for systems with ende- mic dynamics. One important application of our method could be to better understand transmission dynamics in wild-life species, where disease may be inapparent but whereknowledge of FOI could inform spillover hazard to otherhosts (e.g. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus indromedary camels). Using our framework, inference of time-varying FOI can be made using relatively short-term cross-sectional sampling allowing for a more rapid understanding(relative to conventional methods that require long-term sam-pling to infer time-varying FOI) of the link between recentchanges in FOI and spillover hazard. In ongoing work, we are investigating the ability of the model to infer FOI beyond a \u00a92017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS288 K. M. Pepin et al. Idea and Perspectivesingle epidemic curve to further evaluate the breadth of epi- demiological behaviour for which this approach is appropri-ate. Preliminary ndings suggest that allowing more flexibilityin the distribution of TSI and/or incorporating longitudinalserosurveillance data may be important for modelling endemicdynamics (Table 1; Borremans et al. 2016). Multiple strains Several pathogens have complex strain structure and cause multiple infections over longer periods of time. The dynamicsof these systems are necessarily driven by induced cross-immu-nity responses that can elicit signicant antibody responses (Smith et al. 2004; Horton et al. 2010; Manseld et al. 2011). The importance of multiple strains and cross-reaction hasbeen recognised in the study of human influenza A for manyyears as original antigenic sin (Francis 1960), the observationthat after a vaccination or natural infection during later life,an individual's antibody boost against their rst infection maybe as strong or stronger than the boost to the current strain.This concept has been revised as antigenic seniority to indicatethat second and subsequent early infections may also beimportant (Lessler et al. 2012), and incorporated into a life course model of antibody responses to multiple infections in which the number and timing of infections can be inferred (Kucharski et al. 2015). To account for cross-immunity issues in quantitative antibody methods, it will be important toexperimentally measure antibody kinetics for multiple targetstrains in particular host-pathogen systems, which is a sub-stantial investment of time and money. However, if such datawere available, separate antibody kinetic functions for pri-mary and cross-reactive antibody kinetics could be incorpo-rated in our framework for improved inference (Table 1),which would also improve understanding of the impacts ofparticular strains on driving FOI. Contact structure In the derivation of FOI, we assume that the host populationmixes homogenously, such that all susceptible hosts haveequal probability of contact with newly infected hosts. Whilethis may be an appropriate approximation in the case of gre-garious goose populations congregating at breeding sites, most populations involve some degree of heterogeneity in host con- tact structure. In general, heterogeneity decreases population-level FOI because not all susceptible individuals are in contactwith all infectious individuals (as with homogenous mixing).Thus, when applying our framework to populations withheterogeneous contact structure, estimates of FOI could bebiased depending on how the population is sampled relativeto its contact structure. For example, if only high-degreenodes are sampled, our model may have low bias because thissituation is similar to homogenous mixing. Alternatively, ifonly low degree nodes are sampled our model would underes- timate FOI because we would overestimate the number of sus- ceptible individuals that are available for contact with newlyinfected hosts. Note that bias from contact structure wouldnot affect estimates of incidence in our model because inci-dence does not rely on estimates of the number of susceptibleindividuals. Thus, it is safest to infer incidence rather than FOI in highly structured populations where contact structureis unknown. However, if data on contact structure exist, ourcalculation of FOI could be adapted to incorporate an appro-priate relationship between susceptible and newly infectedindividuals (currently assumed to be directly proportional: Newly infecteds/susceptibles; Table 1). Complex antibody responses In our simulated examples, we adapted a fairly complex func- tion for antibody responses, which included both rising anddecaying phases. Our results showed that in some situations, misclassication of these phases could lead to predicting an additional epidemic peak, suggesting that systems with com-plex antibody dynamics may benet from incorporating addi-tional data. For example, differentiating between the risingand declining phases of the antibody response (and possiblybetween primary and anamnestic responses) is possible usingdata from multiple types of antibodies (e.g. Immunoglobulin(Ig) M and G) because of their different kinetics and timingpost-infection (Simonsen et al. 2009; Teunis et al. 2012). Thus, if data distinguishing phases of antibody responses were col-lected by surveillance programmes, it may be possible to improve inference by providing more information for the model to distinguishing phases of antibody response. In general, quantitative antibody methods rely on strong knowledge of the immunology of the focal system for optimalinference. This makes them currently inaccessible for diseaseswith poorly understood or unpredictable immunologicaldynamics (see Table 1 for options), but on the positive side,quantitative antibody approaches provide a framework for bet-ter understanding the role of complex immunology in wildlifedisease dynamics when appropriate experimental studies areconducted. Also, in systems where antibody response is toocomplex to be explained with a mechanistic function, a non- parametric, spline-based model of antibody kinetics (e.g. Borre- mans et al. 2016) can be used to infer FOI if the research ques- tion does not require inference about within-host processes. CONCLUSIONS Serosurveillance data are often summarised as seroprevalence,neglecting information that could help reveal the timing andmagnitude of epidemic peaks. Conventional methods of esti-mating FOI are inappropriate in wildlife disease systemswhere the host is short-lived (not practical to determine ages),where age data are coarse and imprecise (not enough informa-tion to t the age-seroprevalence curve), where long sero- surveillance time series are infeasible, or where antibodies decay quickly (no signature of increased seroprevalence withage). Recent theoretical advances, extended by the frameworkpresented here, highlight that time-varying estimates of diseaseincidence or FOI can be obtained by relaxing these require-ments, thus providing an inferential tool for epidemic dynam-ics and other epidemiological situations where conventionalmethods (i.e. age-seroprevalence methods) are inappropriate.In addition to FOI, quantitative antibody methods can esti-mate other important quantities of interest, such as the \u00a92017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRSIdea and Perspective Inferring infection hazard from data across scales 289proportion of susceptible hosts, proportion of seropositive hosts and incidence. The framework we propose is inherentlyflexible for incorporating a variety of antibody responsecurves and sources of individual-level variation, making itapplicable to a number of host-pathogen systems as well asproviding a platform for investigating the role of individual- level processes in dynamics of FOI. Our ndings indicate that quantitative antibody methods have the potential to be broadly applicable, but additionalexperimental studies will broaden their scope further and high-light additional data that may improve estimation of key met-rics of wildlife disease dynamics. As emphasised above, a keyingredient of quantitative antibody methods is antibody kineticdata. For animal-host systems, challenge studies with experi-mental animals can provide detailed antibody kinetic data foridentifying the appropriate antibody response functions (Tur-melle et al. 2010; Andraud et al. 2012; Baeten et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2015). We found that 30 experimental mallards infected with influenza A captured individual-level heterogeneity ade-quately. Depending on the host response, experimental animalsneed to be monitored regularly for a potentially long duration(3 months or more) to capture the long-term antibodyresponse prole, which can be expensive and difcult forpathogens that require high level biosecurity. However, a sin-gle well-designed experimental study can be used for inferencewith many serosurveillance datasets and thus is a worthwhileinvestment. Such studies are specic to the particular host-pathogen system being modelled, thus, for quantitative anti- body methods to be broadly applicable, experimental datasets need to be available for a range of host-pathogen systems. Aninformal survey of the literature revealed that these datasetshave been collected in some systems, but the data are rarelypresented in a manner that could be used by our model, high-lighting a gap for future research. In addition, measuringcovariate data alongside antibody responses (Table 1), as wellas antibody responses in hosts with different infection histories(i.e. previous infections with the same or different strains/pathogens), will be important for broadening application ofquantitative antibody methods. We predict that using quantitative antibody data to infer FOI will be most successful in situations with epidemicdynamics, where the signal from temporal changes in anti-body levels is strongest, but future research to extend thesemethods to endemic systems would broaden their applicationto additional wildlife disease systems. Future experimentalresearch to quantify antibody kinetics (empirical) and under-stand the behaviour of quantitative antibody methods under arange of serosurveillance designs and epidemiological condi-tions (simulation and eld studies), will reveal the full poten-tial of quantitative antibody methods in understanding and predicting disease dynamics.
