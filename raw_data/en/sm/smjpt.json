While the focus of temperature control is often on overheating, vaccines can be just as susceptible to freezing risks. Learn how to protect your vaccines with this free ebook. | | PHCbi brand refrigerators and freezers are engineered from the inside out to create, maintain and restore precise temperatures that are not commonly found with household or commercial cabinets. Medical Grade Pharmacy, Biomedical and Laboratory Refrigerators and Freezers - Refrigerators incorporate specifically designed refrigeration systems, protecting vaccines from freezing - Forced air systems provide close top-to-bottom uniformity at all shelf and drawer levels - Microprocessor controls assure precise temperature throughout the chamber - Easy to view control panel displays with alarm systems that have access to remote monitoring - Reserve cooling for rapid temperature recovery following door openings - Tolerance for high ambient temperature with high performance refrigeration systems and CFC free insulation Vaccine Storage Recommendations If a vaccine freezes, its efficacy may be diminished or destroyed without visible indication to administering clinicians. Thus, vaccines inadvertently frozen in cold chain distribution or local storage may not offer protection to patients.1 In an effort to assure the quality of vaccines at the end of the distribution cold chain, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published guidelines for best practices in vaccine storage.2 These guidelines, which continue to evolve, are based on studies conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).3 These guidelines, established in 2014, were designed to isolate and identify the conditions that affect vaccine efficacy and storage integrity, including the following areas of focus: - Must offer dedicated storage in a stand-alone refrigerator specifically designed to establish and maintain key performance parameters. - Dormitory-style units should not be used under any circumstances. This type of refrigerator poses a significant risk of freezing a vaccine even when it is used for temporary storage. A NIST report showed that this type of unit demonstrated inconsistent temperature control, regardless of where the vaccine was located in the chamber. Within 2 weeks of use, median temperature of the refrigerator setpoint had drifted approximately 4\u00b0C lower, freezing the vaccines contained inside.4 - Must maintain accurate, uniform and repeatable storage temperature over a range of 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. The PHC Corporation factory setpoint is 5\u00b0C. - Must protect from freezing temperatures anywhere in the refrigerator. This is critical for storage of small vaccine doses that can freeze quickly. - Must be monitored by a NIST calibrated thermometer, documented with a certificate of calibration. The CDC recommended uncertainty is +/- 0.5\u00b0C. PHCbi refrigerators, freezers and combo refrigerators/freezers are available in a range of cabinet sizes and operating temperatures.

These criteria will require that all vaccines be stored in refrigerators that meet performance standards currently offered by PHC. 4 U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. (2009).
