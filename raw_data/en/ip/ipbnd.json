Just one visit and I booked a package that is how effective Natalie's technique is. She is absolutely gentle and sweet, pressure point techniques were effective, release was major I was so comfortable she had me giggling half the time on the table. She is professional and affordable for what she does, I have had hydro colon therapies before but nothing like this. The result from just one session for myself, is more energy, clarity and overall calm factor, I was a stress case when i walked in I walked out so relaxed! Obviously every person is different I went in with the intention to let go of shit (pun intended) lol! Love you Natalie! - Oct 23, 2015 Here's the good and the bad... Initially I was impressed with the fact that Natalie uses \"pressure points\" to help the colon eliminate more efficiently. After around 9 visits to her and plenty of opportunity to see her work ethic and consistency, I am not so impressed. Here are some of the problems I had with Natalie and why I will not be returning to her. She is constantly touching her cell phone during your treatment (gloves on, but still YUK!), she will not stop talking to you and asking you questions. Questions about your poop, what's going through the tube, what you ate? O.K. To a degree this may seem good to some folks. But when you are filling with water and cramping you really don't give a rats rear about her nights out with friends drinking margaritas or what the hell is flowing in the tube from last nights dinner etc., Another problem, she is constantly asking me to share my alternative health knowledge experience and information with her other clients, BTW I do not mind this normally but.... My last visit I showed up with a terrible migraine and really bad ear pain, I was hoping that the treatment could help alleviate my discomfort. I let her know immediately when I got there what was going on. What does she do? She marches me straight back to a room full of ladies to share my experiences with them. Once again, I was happy to be of service but.... I was in PAIN! I was just wandering when was I ever going to get a real treatment where I could relax and just get the service I paid for? Every time I went in there she was either texting, talking on her phone, leaving the room to unlock doors for people ? Or just constantly talking to me during my treatment. Worst of all, her pressure points techniques were so aggressive I started leaving her office with sore ribs. This lady is just way too intense for me. I even bought my friend two visits in the beginning before I knew all of this about Natalie and she was even trying to coax my friend to let her other clients know how great her treatment was! I bought a foot detox that made me feet swell up all red and puffy and break out in itchy hives! A nightmare experience. I now do not believe in foot detoxes at all! As a matter of fact, as fanatical as I can be about alternative health, I am now very skeptical about foot detoxing ! My best advice, buy the book \"TOX-SICK\" by Suzanne Somers! It will change your life! - Jun 11, 2020 Literally one of the BEST decisions I've ever made. Was a little skeptical and scared at first because of the colon cleansing process. But Natalie makes you feel so comfortable. The vibe in her room she has set up is comforting and relaxing. She is very gentle and such a pleasure to talk to she explains everything thoroughly that she's doing. I left feeling relieved and with more energy and 1 1/2 inches smaller from my waist (more than likely from the bloating being gone). I have already scheduled another appointment with her and will be going back soon - Dec 15, 2016 I was extremely nervous to do the hydrotherapy. When I went in, Natalie was very nice and welcoming. I had the session done 2 days ago and I can tell the difference. My complexion is very glowy and looks hydrated. I had a very stubborn pooch below my belly button and it has now shrinken. I feel very focused and relaxed and clean. I've been more picky on what goes into my body now. And I'm using the bathroom more regularly. Great treatment! I will be returning and can't wait to see more results! - Jun 3, 2016 This was my first time doing colon hydrotherapy and I was very skeptical but I had researched and there are soo many benefits.. So I figured why not? Let me tell you.. It was the most amazing treatment ever!! I feel like a brand new person!! I have energy like a kid again! And best of all I lost the pooch that I've had since I had a c-section almost 9 years ago! My stomach is flat again! Now about the procedure. Natalie is very friendly and professional. She walks you through every step and explains the whole process before she gets started. I thought it was going to hurt and be a horrible experience, but it didn't hurt at all. The beginning is a little uncomfortable but once she gets started you relax and everything is easy from there. I couldn't believe what was inside of me! No wonder I was always tired and felt sluggish. Those feelings are all gone and I will be going back for another treatment Monday. I highly recommend to anyone thinking about colon hydrotherapy to go to Natalie. She's great! Do your research and see what all the benefits are and try it for yourself. You don't be disappointed! - Apr 10, 2016 She's amazing!! Her techniques with the use of abdominal pressure points work wonders. I've had four visits thus far, and haven't left disappointed one time. Natalie is very personable and doesn't make anything awkward. The office is clean and relaxing. After the treatment, I can freely run errands without worrying of suddenly needing to find a toilet! The treatment can be both a slow and fast fill; just which ever your body responds better to. I highly recommend Natalie! - Feb 24, 2018 I was nervous prior to my first session but Natalie's soft, kind personality put me at ease. This treatment has helped me in so many ways from helping clear up my acne to bringing back my mental clarity. Natalie is a Godsend and I will continue to go back to her for many years to come. - Jan 23, 2015First to Review I never thought I would be writing a review of colon hydrotherapy, but Natalie deserves a good review. She adds dignity to an otherwise possible embarrassing procedure. She is very discreet and makes you feel comfortable. I appreciate her explanations throughout. Her office environment is also very pleasant. I always leave feeling better!
