Currently, about [80% of Americans](https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/crn-reveals-initial-data-2021-consumer-survey-dietary-supplements) consume vitamins and supplements. And while it's good that Americans are looking out for their health, the increased consumption brings with it an increase in packaging waste. Things like droppers, cotton balls, desiccants, tamper-evident seals, and dosage cups are all difficult or impossible to recycle, which is problematic for the environment. All this single-use plastic packaging often ends up in landfills or [polluting our oceans](https://zerowastememoirs.com/how-does-trash-get-in-the-ocean/). Currently, food packaging like vitamin bottles accounts for about [23% of the materials](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-08/documents/reducing_wasted_food_pkg_tool.pdf) that end up in landfills in the United States. That's almost a quarter of our trash! On top of that, the production of single-use food packages is damaging to the environment. [Each plastic bottle that's produced requires resources](https://foodprint.org/issues/the-environmental-impact-of-food-packaging/#:~:text=Each%20form%20of%20packaging%20uses,or%20sludge%20containing%20toxic%20contaminants.) like water, chemicals, petroleum, minerals, and energy. Using these resources can often generate the emissions of greenhouse gases and toxic waste that ends up in our water. Traditional packaging is often derived from ingredients that are not ethically sourced - for example, new plastic is created instead of recycled. Manufacturers often have little concern over the environmental impacts of the production of these materials. This means that buying multivitamins with traditional packaging can sometimes be an ethical nightmare. On the other hand, [zero-waste packaging](https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/the-problem-with-packaging-waste-how-zero-waste-grocers-are-powering-solutions) is made to be reused, recycled, or composted. This means that there is very little waste generated from the production of these products. Zero-waste packaging is often made from sustainable and ethical materials, like glass or aluminum. And since these materials can be recycled over and over again, they have a much smaller environmental impact than the virgin plastic most conventional vitamins are sold in. This type of packaging has a smaller carbon footprint, produces less pollution, and requires less resources to create. So, if you're looking for a way to be more sustainable, zero waste supplements are a great option! Supplements are a great way to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need, but it's important to keep the planet in mind when you're choosing which ones to take. These brands offer eco-friendly, vegan options that will help you maintain your health without harming the earth. When you choose one of these zero waste supplements, you can be sure that you're getting the most responsible product possible that is good for the earth, and good "}
