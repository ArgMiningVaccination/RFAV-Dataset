D., 1999 Department of Adult Education, Community Developrnent and Counselling Psychology University of Toronto Abstract This study was an attempt to understand Canadian cancer patients' treatment choice with particular regard to what characteristics may be a part of their choice to use unconventional cancer thera pies. People who purchased the Guidebook to Unconventional Cancer Therapies, published by the Ontario Breast Cancer Information Exchange Project (1994) and members of cancer support groups throughout Canada, were solicited by mail to complete questionnaires. Their use of unconventional cancer therapies was measured and non- users were compared with users of varying degrees on several variables. It was found that demographic variables other than education were not critical factors in the use of unconventional therapies by cancer patients. The same was true of their coping style and psychological state. Of more importance in the relationship was their beliefs and attitudes about cancer, about conventional medicine and their physician, and about unconventional medicine. Dedication I would like to dedicate rny thesis to the memory of two important people in my life. My Grandmother, Anna Voros died after a lengthy battle with cancer on April9.1992 and Mn. lrene Thompson who died after her courageous battle with cancer on December 29, 1998. Both these women touched my life in very special ways. Their courage in death was an inspiration to al1 who knew them. Acknowledgements I would like to thank al1 of the members of the Ontario Breast Cancer Information Exchange Partnership for their support of the present study and their continual work in the area. I would also like to thank Dr. Ross Gray and Dr. Lana Stermac for their guidance, support, and encouragement. My sincerest thanks to al1 of the cancer survivors who took the time to be a part of this research. 4.6.1 Procedure 27 .......................................................................................... 5.3.1 Personal Information Survey ............... ....... 28 ......................... 5.3.2 Unconventional Treatment Questionnaire 28 5.3.3 Beliefs and Attitudes Questionnaire .......................m.....e...... 29 5.3.4 Psychological Measures ...................................................... 29 5.4 Ethical Considerations ...............................................e....m................ 32 5.5 Data Analysis ...............................................................e............e... 33 5.5.1 Part A .............m...................................................................... 33 5.5.2 Part 0 ....................................................................e............. 35 ................................................................................................ 6 .

A guidebook released by the Ontario Breast Cancer Information Exchange Project (OBCIEP, 1994) reports on approximately 92 different unconventional therapies, and their list is by no means exhaustive. Terms such as unproven, unorthodox, and alternative have al1 been used interchangeably to describe these therapies and definitions of exactly what encompasses unconventional therapies have varied. Thus, an evaluation of the literature on unconventional therapies is difficult. In a review of unconventional therapies the American Cancer Society (1982) defined unproven methods of cancer management as 'Yhose diagnostic tests or therapeutic modalities which are promoted for cancer prevention, diagnosis, or treatment and which are, on the bases of careful review by scientists andfor clinicians, not deemed proven nor recommended for current use\" (p. 1). Researchers have used slightly varied definitions to determine Unconventional Cancer Therapies 2 what can be classified as unconventional. Cassileth, Lusk, Strouse, and Bodenheimer (1984) in a relatively early study on contemporary unorthodox treatments in cancer medicine defined alternative or unorthodox therapies as \"treatments that are both used specifically to cure cancer, and are not part of anti-cancer therapies used by the medical establishment\" (p. 105). Anderson, O'Connor, MacGregor, and Schwartz (1993) in a more recent study of the use of alternative therapies by people with HIV and AlDS defined alternative therapy as \"treatment not commonly provided or recommended by physicians\" (p. 561). Still others have used slightly different definitions. In a large scale study of the use of unconventional medicine in the United States, Eisenberg et al. (1993) defined unconventional therapies as 'medical interventions not taught widely at US. medical schools or generally available at U.S. hospitals\" (p. 246). In an extensive review of unconventional cancer therapies the Ontario Breast Cancer Information Exchange Project (1994) defined conventional therapies as ?hose which are widely practised in North American cancer centres today: most notably, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.' Unconventional therapies were thereby defined as \" approaches to Unconventional Cancer Thera pies 3 cancer which fall outside this domainyp. 7). This broad definition of unconventional therapies will presently be applied. Appendix A lists the 92 unconventional therapies that will be examined in the present study. This is an extensive list covering most of the popular unconventional therapies that were available in 1994, as well as many obscure ones. However. this list is not exhaustive and many more unconventional therapies do exist. The Use of Unconventional Therapies There have been only a limited number of studies examining the extent of use of unconventional therapies in the general population. One large study in the United States conducted in 1990 found that approxirnately one in three people in the United States used at least one unconventional therapy in that year (Eisenberg et al.. 1993). Murray and Shepherd (1993) reported similar findings in the United Kingdom, finding that 34% of men and 46% of women indicated that they had tried at least one unconventional therapy. It is important to mention that many people surveyed in these studies may not have identified themselves as users of unconventional therapies. However, by using the definitions of unconventional therapy discussed earlier, Unconventional Cancer Therapies 4 they were indeed classified as users. Research on general populations has beg un to examine the people that use unconventional therapies. Eisenberg et al. (1993) found that the most use of unconventional therapies was reported by non-black persons from 25 to 49 years of age who had relatively more education and higher incomes than the general population. They also found that the majority of people who used unconventional therapy did so for chronic. as opposed to life-threatening medical conditions. Studies have begun to further examine why the general population uses unconventional therapies. Murray and Shepherd (1993) discovered through qualitative interviews that the use of unconventional therapies was related to seeking alternative explanations for health problems and e greater sense of autonomy in dealing with them. In addition, they found that negative attitudes toward modern medicine were related to the use of unconventional therapies. In a study of people visiting conventional and unconventional health practitioners. Furnham and Smith (1988) found that those visiting the unconventional practitioners were much more critical and sceptical about the efficacy of traditional medicine; they Unconventional Cancer Thera pies 5 believed that their general health could be improved; and they tended to have higher psychiatric morbidity than those visiting conventional practitioners. In a study of patients at an alternative treatment centre, hatf of the patients surveyed believed that their physician did not understand them and 83% of the patients surveyed stated that failure of conventional medicine was their reason for attending (Moore, Phipps, Marcer, & Lewith, 1985). Cancer and Unconventional Thera~ies Extent of use and demoqra~hics. Literature examining the use of unconventional therapies by people with cancer is even more scarce. Research on the extent of use of unconventional therapies by people with cancer has obtained varied results. Faw, Ballentine, Ballentine and Van Eys (1977) found that nine percent of the paediatric cancer patients they interviewed had tried at least one unconventional therapy. The nurnbers for adult cancer patients have varied from 9 to 86 percent (Arkko, Arkko, Ha, 1997) using unconventional therapies. The variance in numbers could be due to sample size, differences in the populations under study (particularly Unconventional Cancer Therapies 6 cultural dHerences), and the varied definitions of exactly what is an unconventional therapy. These variables make examining the literature on unconventional cancer therapies quite difFicult. Unconventional therapy covers a wide array of treatments and in order to fully understand the extent of its use one must maintain a very broad definition, In terms of the demographics of people with cancer who use unconventional therapies, some researchers have found that variables such as age, education, sex, ethnicity, and income are related to use (Cassileth et al., 1984, Downer et al., 1994, and Eisenberg et al., 1993). It has most often been found, however, that use of unconventional therapies tends to be associated with higher levels of education (Cassileth et al., 1984; Cooper, 1983; Markle, Petersen, b Wagenfeld, 1978). However, others have found no significant differences in education (Barbour, Redding, Beutler, Jones, b Meyskens, 1984). It is important to note that much of this literature does not maintain a very broad definition of what encompasses unconventional therapies and as a result, other demographic differences may not have been identified. Unconventional Cancer Thera pies 7 Research variables attemotina to exolain the use of unconventional thera~ies. There have ben few studies examining why people with cancer use unconventional therapies, however. this research appears to be flawed in terms of limited samples and narrow definitions of unconventional therapies. Cassileth et al. (1984) found that: Major factors associated with the use of unorthodox treatrnents included patients' belief that their cancer could have been prevented and therefore was now reversible by the same means, dissatisfaction with conventional practitioners and health care systems, and preferences for nontoxic regimens and for an active role in treatment. (p. 11 1). In a large study of 600 cancer patients. Downer et al. (1994) found that those patients who used unconventional therapies were more dissatisfied with conventional treatments, were significantly more anxious, and had higher interna1 locus of control scores than those patients who did not use unconventional therapies. In related research, Goldberg (1983) identified four major Unconventional Cancer Therapies 8 classes of variables that may affect a patient's decision not to accept recommended conventional therapy. These four classes of variables were: (1) intrapsychic issues relating to the patient's own interpretations of events and past experiences, (2) interpersonal issues arising from current relationships with formal health care and informal support systems, (3) medical systems issues emerging as a result of a lack of coordination in communication and treatment within the health-care delivery system, and (4) psychiatric issues, including chronic or acute problems that are independent of or secondary to the disease or treatment. Although this research focussed on ieasons for rejecting conventional treatments, it does not seem unreasonable to hypothesize that similar variables are involved in accepting unconventional treatments. Early research into unconventional therapies focussed on fear as the motivation for use (Burkhalter, 1977; Henney, 1985; Schaller & Carroll, 1976). This included fear that one's cancer was incurable, fear Unconventional Cancer Therapies 9 that one's physician had lost hop, and fear that one's illness would have an effect on their family. It has also ben thought that a desire for a miracle (Brown, 1975; Holland, 1982) and the desire to have some control over one's own health (Holland, 1982) may cause people with cancer to turn to unconventional therapies. In addition to these variables which have been identified as ptaying a role in a person's decision to use unconventional therapies for their cancer, there are also nurnerous anecdotal reports from professionals, support persons, and cancer patients themselves. It is cornmonly believed in the cancer care cornrnunity that variables such as feelings of anxiety and distress; a belief in control over one's own health; personal views of both conventional and unconventional therapies; and particular coping styles al1 may play a role in the use of unconventional therapies by people with cancer. However, no evidence has been found to support these anecdotal reports and the relationship between these variables and the use of unconventional therapies by people with cancer is not clearly understood. A thorough understanding of these variables and how they relate to persons with cancer is required in order to further our Unconventional Cancer Therapies 10 understanding of a person's choice to pursue unconventional thera pies. Other Potential Factors Related to The Use and Extent of Use of Unconventional Thera~ies Anxietv. Distress. and Uncertaintv Anxiety has been defined as \"an abnormal and overwhelrning sense of apprehension and fear marked by physiological signs (as sweating, tension, and increased pulse), by doubt concerning the reality over and nature of the threat, and by self-doubt about one's capacity to cope with it' (p.93, Merriam-Webster Inc., 1984). lt has been reported that people with extreme levels of anxiety are continuously unhappy, worrisome, and pessimistic, and that it may also affect their self-esteem, causing feelings of weakness, inferiority, and helplessness (Wolman, 1994). Wolman (1994) also noted that anxiety may cause such physical symptoms as arrhythmia, nausea, loss of appetite, headaches, and sleep disturbance. It is well accepted that health issues, such as coping with a cancer diagnosis, can lead to various psychological responses (Carver, Scheier b Pozo, 1992). It has also been demonstrated that the medical Unconventional Cancer Therapies 11 procedures themselves, which many cancer patients undergo, may lead to feelings of anxiety, tension, worry, apprehension, and general discornfort (Kendall, 1983). It is important to note that cancer patient anxiety has been attributed to both the various factors that are a part of a cancer patient's Me (their environment) and procedures that are associated with conventional medicine and treatments (Kendall, 1983; Walch-McCaffrey, 1985). Since no such research has been uncovered regarding unconventional therapies, it is unclear whether patients find it less anxiety provoking. In order to understand how anxiety may play a role in a person's decision to use unconventional therapies to treat cancer, it is necessary to have a better understanding of anxiety in relation to people with cancer. Soma have gone so far as to described cancer patients as \"rather frig htened individuals whose lives have become ones of anxiety, uncertainty, pain, and withdrawal\" (p. 79) ( Mandell, Hava and Tomlin 1986-87). Researchers have attempted to explain why people with cancer experience such increased anxiety. It has been suggested that since cancer usually follows such an unpredictable course, a person's Unconventional Cancer Therapies 12 anxiety may result from their inability to know the path of their disease (Welch-McCaffrey, 1985). Others have discussed issues around the conventional treatments themselves being a source for a patient's anxiety (Decker. Cline-Elsen, b Gallagher, 1992). Society's lack of acceptance and the stigma that it places on cancer has also been identified as a potential cause for the anxiety experienced by people with this disease (Welch-McCaffrey, 1985; Holland, 1989). The result of this anxiety on the cancer patient has also been examined. Some have argued that low to moderate levels of anxiety may be beneficial for the patient by helping them to learn about their disease, causing them to engage in health-related behaviours, maximizing attention to important information, promoting confidence regarding the availability and skill of their medical team, and warding off feelings of helplessness (Andersen, 6 Tewfik, 1985; Leig h, Percarpio, Opsahl, & Ungerer, 1987; Cull, 1990). However, others have demonstrated that the very high levels of anxiety that some patients experience may have severe consequences. It has been suggested that hig h anxiety may result in decreased psycholog ical well-being, decreased quality of life, work problems, missed appointments. and Unconventional Cancer Therapies 13 noncornpliance in terms of conventional treatment (Coscarelli Schag, b Heinrich, 1989; Masur, 1981; Gill, 1984; Wellisch, 1984). Additionally, severe anxiety has ben shown to interfere with immune functioning and may impact on survival (Herberman & Ortaldo, 1981; Riley, 1981; Locke et al.. 1984). 'dith regard to the use of unconventional therapies, Downer et al. (1994) and Furnham and Smith (1988) have discussed that there are soma indications that those who seek unconventional therapies have higher levels of anxiety. Uncertainty has also been identified as a source of distress for many cancer patients. It has been defined as \"the quality or state of ... not knowing beyond doubt\" (p. 1283, Merriam-Webster Inc., 1984) and has been shown to affect their social relationships, the meaning of their lives. their values, their attitudes, and future expectations (Mishel 6 Braden, 1988; Carpenter, Morrow 6 Schmale, 1989; Corney, Everett, Howells b Crowther, 1992). It has ben suggested that these feelings of uncertainty may be one of the factors leading ?O anxiety in many cancer patients. L may therefore be hypothesized that the use of unconventional Unconventional Cancer Therapies 14 therapies by people with cancer is an attempt to move to a less anxiety provoking atmosphere, or to cope with the high anxiety they may be experiencing . Copinq The person's ability to cope with cancer and their coping strategy have been studied by many researchers. it is generally accepted that the strategies a person uses to deal with serious illness affects how they experience their disease. Many different types of coping have been identified and defined for people dealing with cancer. These include denial, information seeking, avoidance, thinking about past good times, learning illness related procedures, blaming others, and seeking the support of others (Weisrnan b Worden, 1976; Moos b Tsu, 1977; Cohen b Lazarus, 1979). It is unclear where the use of unconventional therapies may fall in terms of a coping strategy. More recently, coping strategies have been categorized by several researchers. Krause (1993) categorized the coping of cancer patients into four types: active-cognitive, active-behavioural, problem- focussed, and emotion-focussed. She described active-cognitive coping as an attempt to manage one's appraisal of a stressful event, Unconventional Cancer Therapies 15 such as considering several alternative ways to handle the situation, and active-behavioural as using behavioural attempts to deal with the illness. Krause (1993) definad problem-focussed coping as any attempt to eliminate the sources of stress in the life of a person with cancer, while attempts to manage ernotional stress and to maintain equilibrium were grouped under emotion-focussed coping. Earlier, Lev (1992) examined the coping strategies of cancer patients undergoing conventional treatment and divided them into three categories: preparers, avoiders, and suppressors. Lev found that preparers tended to use specific strategies, such as breathing techniques, dissociation, prayer, imagery, and yoga to prepare themselves for treatment. Avoiders were those who used more social supports and tended to think about their treatment more than act on it by using any special strategies or techniques to cope. They also used avoidance and denial considerably. Suppressors tended to use strategies to avoid thinking about their treatment and used less social support. Although research has not fully examined which coping strategy is dominant in those patients who use unconventional therapies, Unconventional Cancer Therapies 16 Cassileth et al. (1984) did report that patients who seek unconventional therapies have higher needs for control than people in the general population. It appears that the act of seeking out and using unconventional therapies may be an active form of coping that helps to assist with this need for control. Thus, one may expect that those who use unconventional therapies tend to have this type of active coping style in general. Patient's Treatment Preferences Biley (1992) pointed out that historically \"Patients were once regarded as being incapable of making decisions about their treatment and health care... ... When given the label of patient, the person was expected to assume a passive, dependent role relative to care givers ... ...( however), as part of the consumer movement, consumers became more actively involved in the provision of health care.\" As this recent rnovement of patients taking part in their own treatment decisions increases, research has really only just begun to examine what drives the patient's decision making. England and Evans (1992) captured the current state of affairs in this area when they discussed the fact that since little is known about patients reactions to Unconventional Cancer Therapies 17 finally being given some control with regard to treatment decisions, one is unsure what type of decisions they will make, or what they will base their decisions on. Of the research that does exist in patient decisions with regard to various health related issues, much of it has found that demographic variables do not appear to be predictors of patient treatment choice (Kaplan, Goluboff, Olsson, Deverka, b Chmiel, 1995; and Zug et. al., 1995). What has been found to be significant appears to be related to symptom severity and side effects of treatment. England and Evans (1992) found in a study of patients in a cardiovascular risk management clinic that patient's decisions regardhg treatment were largely predictable from their state of health, the degree of risk posed by their various behaviours, and their motives for coming to the health service. Kaplan et. al. (1995) in a study of patient treatment choice in benign prostatic hyperplasia found that only a rating of the severity of their symptoms and a measure of the extent of illness was predictive of their treatment choice. Similarly, Barry, Fowler, Mulley, Henderson, and Wennberg (1995) found that patient's treatment choice was predictive only on their ratings of Unconventional Cancer Therapies 18 symptom state and on the prospect of complications from their treatrnent choice. In addition, Zug et. al. (1995) found that patient preferences for treatment were predictable not from just symptom severity, but from the value the patients placed on the symptoms. Also, in a study of cancer patients, Kiebert et. al. (1994) found that when a treatment choice had to be made, patients considered six factors to be of importance to consider. These factors were age, having a partner, having children, nature of the side effects of the treatment, disease-related life expectancy and baseline quality of life. Surnmant Broadly defined, unconventional cancer therapies (Appendix A) are those therapies which are not widely practised in North American cancer centres today (OBCIEP, 1994). Although they are seen as being outside the mainstream of western medicine, reports indicate that from 9 to 86 percent of cancer patients may actually use some form of unconventional medicine (Arkko et al., 1980; Brigden, 1995; Cassileth et al., 1984; and Riseberg et al., 1997). The variability regarding the extent of use may be attributed to the methodological differences among the few studies that have ken conducted in this area. Unconventional Cancer Therapies 19 There has been some disagreement regarding the demographics of users of unconventional therapies. However, most researchers have found that the use relates to higher levels of education (Barbour, Redding, Beutler, Jones, b Cooper, 1983; and Markle et al., 1978). Anecdotal reports and some limited research indicates that use of unconventional therapies may be associated anxiety and distress (Dowver et al., 1994); a belief in control over one's own health (Cassitleth et al., 1984; Downer et al., 1994; Holland, 1982); views of conventional and unconventional medicine (Cassileth, 1984; Downer et al., 1994; miracle (Brown, 1975; Holland, 1982); and psychiatric problems (Gold berg, 1983). In order to fully comprehend the factors that may be impacting on a person's decision to use unconventional therapies to treat their cancer, one must pull together the various components of research that have examined this and include factors that have been identified by anecdotal reports which are, as yet, not researched. Unconventional Cancer Therapies 20 Aims of the Present Study The purpose of the present study is to determine what variables may help to predict the choice to use unconventional therapies by cancer patients who have shown some interest in unconventional therapies, and the choice to use unconventional therapies that mainstream medicine has voiced concern over regarding potential serious health risks (these will be identified as cautioned unconventional therapies). It is also the aim of this study to incorporate a broad definition of unconventional therapies in order to help establish a better understanding of the extent of use and to examine demographic differences that may exist. The present study is intended to determine what may be involved in the choice to use unconventional therapies by examining many of the factors that are thought to play a role in one's decision to not use, use one, use many of these therapies, or use cautioned unconventional therapies. This includes combining factors which have previously been studied separately, pairing them with factors which so far have only anecdotal evidence for their effects, and including factors that are believed to play a role in one's decisions regarding choosing a Unconventional Cancer Therapies 21 conventional treatment. The present study is intended to allow a cornparison of these measures between unconventional therapy non- users and users of varying degrees. This will be accomplished by measuring the extent of unconventional therapy use, thereby irnproving Our understanding of what may be involved in people with cancer choosing to use unconventional therapies, and whether these factors differ among those with no use, limited use, extensive use, and use of cautioned unconventional therapies. In addition, the present study is intended to help health care professionals predict who will choose to move outside mainstream medicine and use unconventional therapies. lt is believed that the present research has considerable clinical utility as physicians and other health care providers are expressing great concern over the anecdotal reports of the use of unconventional therapies by cancer patients. A recent qualitative study of physician perspectives on unconventional therapies (Gray, Fitch et al., 1997) found that physicians were interested in having information available about unconventional therapies, but found communication about such therapies with their patients a waste of their time. Interestingly, a Unconventional Cancer Therapies 22 similar study of cancer survivor perspectives (Gray, Greenberg et al., 1997) indicated that survivors were arguing for a willingness to discuss unconventional therapies by their physicians. In a recent article Gray (1998) argued that \"The topic of unconventional therapies can no longer be ignored or rnarginalised because, for better or worse, each seriously il1 person cannot help but be confronted with choices about their possible usage.\" lt is the hope of the researcher that the additional knowledge that may corne from the present study will help to better serve al1 people with cancer by helping to bridge that gap between their needs and those addressed by their physicians. Genera! Ex~ectations Part A It is hypothesized that non-users, low-users, and high-users of unconventional therapies will differ significantly in terms of demographics, beliefs about unconventional therapies, beliefs about their cancer, anxiety, locus of control, coping, and distress. The predictions for Part A of the present study are as follows: 1. It is believed that high-users of unconventional thsrapy will be Unconventional Cancer Therapies 23 younger, better educated, hig her income earners, and be more likely to be female than low-users and non-users of unconventional therapies. In addition, low-users are expected to similarly differ from non-users. 2. High-users of unconventional therapies are expected to have a less positive view of conventional medicine and their physicians than low-users and non-users. In addition, it is expected that low-users will similarly differ from non-users. 3. High-users of unconventional therapies are expected to have more concurrent use of conventional and unconventional therapies, be less likely to follow the advise of their physician, and be more likely to have had prior interest and use of unconventional therapies than low-users and non-users. Low- users are expected to similarly differ from non-users. 4. With regard to their view of their cancer, a more negative view in relation to a belief they can be cured, is expected among high-users than low-users and non-users. Low-users are expected to similarl y differ from non-users. 5. Similarly, high-users of unconventional therapies are expected Unconventional Cancer Therapies 24 to have a more interna1 locus of control with regard to their health than low-users and non-users. Low-users are expected to similarly differ from non-users. It is believed that high-users will have higher levels of anxiety than non-users and low-users. In addition, it is expected that low-users will similarly differ from non-users. With regard to psychological distress it is anticipated that high- users will have more than low-users, who in turn will have more than non-users. High-users are also expected to have a more active coping style than low-users, who in turn have more active coping styles than non-users of unconventional therapies. High-users are expected to have more severe physical illness than low-users. In addition, it is expected ttiat low-users will similarl y differ from non-users. Part B It is also hypothesized that non-users and users of cautioned unconventional the ra pies (earlier defined as unconventional the ra pies that mainstream medicine has voiced concern over regarding potential Unconventional Cancer Therapies 25 serious health risks) *will differ significantly in terms of demographics, beliefs about unconventional therapies. beliefs about their cancer. anxiety. locus of control, coping, and distress. The predictions for Part B of the present study are es follows: It is believed that users of cautioned unconventional therapies will be younger. better educated, higher income earners. and be more likely to be female than non-mers of cautioned unconventional therapies. Usen of cautioned unconventional therapies are expected to have a less positive view of conventional medicine and their physicians than non-users. Users of cautioned unconventional therapies are expected to have more concurrent use of conventional and unconventional therapies, be less likely to not follow the advise of their physician. and be more likely to have had prior interest and use of unconventional therapies than non-users. With regard to their view of their cancer. a more negative view is expected among users than non-users. Similarly. users of cautioned unconventional therapies are expected to have a more interna1 locus of control with regard to their health than non-users. It is believed that users will have higher levels of anxiety than non-users. With regard to psychological distress it is anticipated that users will have more than non-isers. Users are also expected to have a more active coping style than non-users of cautioned unconventional thetapies. Users are expected to have more severe physical illness than non-users. Methods Su biects Subjects for the present study were solicited by mail, using a list of people who had requested a copy of the Guidebook to Unconventional Cancer Therapies, released by the Ontario Breast Cancer Information Exchange Project (1994). and by advertising in cancer support groups throughout Canada. People who were at least 18 years of age and who reported that they had been given a cancer diagnosis within the past 20 years (this diagnosis must have occurred Unconventional Cancer Therapies 27 during adulthood, i.e. after the age of 18). were included in the study. The present study consisted of 145 women and 35 men with an average age of 53 years and an average of 3.62 yean since they received their cancer diagnosis. At least one recurrence of cancer was reported by 26.8 % of the participants. Procedure The Ontario Breast Cancer Information Exchange Project mailed out 241 1 surveys to all the purchasers of the Guidebook to Unconventional Cancer Therapies (OBCIEP, 1994). The surveys included a request for individuals to participate in the present study. 634 (26.3%) people returned the surveys (Gray et al., 1998) and 184 (29%) of those individuals agreed and were eligi ble to participate in the present study. An introductory letter describing the present study (see Appendix 8) along with a questionnaire package was mailed to the 184 individuals. Completed questionnaires were returned by 106 (58%) of them. In addition, 50 cancer support group leaders throughout Canada were contacted (see Appendix F) and sent a total of 216 questionnaire packages. They were asked to enquire with their members whether any of them would be willing to complete the Unconventional Cancer Therapies 28 questionnaires. Of the 2 16 packages sent out to support groups, 74 (34.3%) completed questionnaires were returned. Materials The questionnaire package included a questionnaire designed to illicit information regarding demographics and the use of unconventional therapies, a questionnaire designed to look at attitudes and beliefs regarding conventional and unconventional medicine, as well as four psychological measures looking at anxiety, control, coping, and distress. Personal Information Survey This was an instrument designed for the present study which al1 subjects were asked to complete (see Appendix C). This form was designed to obtain demographic information including age, religiosity, current family income, and education. In addition, it asked the individuals to report on their cancer diagnosis. This survey was included in order to determine if any of the variables which it examines were related to the level of use of unconventional therapies. Unconventional Thera~ies Questionnaire All subjects were asked to complete the Unconventional Unconventional Cancer Therapies 29 Therapies Questionnaire (see Appendix D) which was designed for the present study. This questionnaire was designed to obtain information regarding whether individuals were using specific unconventional therapies. It allowed for measuring the extent of use of unconventional therapies, thereby allowing for groupings of the study participants in terms of the extent of use of unconventional therapies. The total nurnber of therapies currently being used will be known as the Unconventionality Index (UI). This is the measure to which the other variables examined in this study were compared. Beliefs and Attitudes Questionnaire All subjects were asked to complete the Beliefs and Attitudes Questionnaire (see Appendix E) which was developed for the present stud y. This questionnaire was desig ned to evaluate personal views, beliefs, and attitudes with regard to conventional and unconventional therapies, as well as the participants' views and beliefs about their cancer. Psvc holo~ical Measures All subjects were given the following self-report measures to assess various psychological aspects. Unconventional Cancer Therapies 30 (1 ) STATE- TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI; Spielberger, 1983): This well validated setf-report questionnaire assesses \"state\" anxiety (an emotional reaction which varies from one situation to another) and \"traitN anxiety (a personality characteristic of the person and not the situation). It contains norms for the general population as well as a medical population and has been found to have a reliability coefficient of around 0.93. Its validity as a measure of anxiety has been well demonstrated, with correlations of greater than 0.70 with other anxiety measures like the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and the IPAT Anxiety Scale (Spielberger, 1983). Age normative percentile scores will be used in the present study. This measure allowed for evaluating a possible role that anxiety may play in the use of unconventional therapies. (2) HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (HLC) SCALE (Wallston, Wallston, Kaplan b Maides, 1976): This is a well validated, widely used 1 1-item seif-report questionnaire. The HLC has been reported to have a reliability coefficient of 0.72 and its validity has been well documented (Wallston, Wallston, Kaplan b Maides, 1976). It is a Unconventional Cancer Therapies 31 measure which has attempted to operationalize health-related locus of control beliefs. Subjects' locus of control is measured on an \"internalm to \"external* continuum. The more internal, the more likely to take steps to better their environmental condition, according to Social Learning Theory (Rotter, Chance & Phares, 1972; as cited in Wallston et al. 1976). Scores range from 1 1 to 66, with lower scores representing a more internal locus of control. (3) COPING INVENTORY FOR STRESSFUL SITUATIONS (CISS; Endler b Parker, 1990): This is another well validated questionnaire which is designed to measure three major types of coping styles. The CISS has been found to have reliability coefficients as high as 0.91, and its validity has been documented with correlations up to 0.69 with other measures of coping like the Ways of Copping Questionnaire and various personality measures like the MMPI-2 (Endler b Parker, 1990). The three types of coping style are task oriented coping, emotion oriented coping, and avoidance coping. In addition, it allows for Unconventional Cancer Therapies 32 identifying two types of avoidance coping, distraction and social diversion. (4) BRIEF SYMPTOMS INVENTORY (BSI; Derogatis, 1993): This widely used and well validated instrument is a 53- item, self-report questionnaire which is designed to assess psychological symptoms. In addition, it reports measures for three global indices of psychological distress and has been used extensively in research as an effective measure for screening for psychiatric disorders. The BSI has been found to have reliability coefficients rang ing between 0.71 and 0.85, and its validity has been well docurnented with correlations up to 0.72 with the MMPI-2 (Derogatis b Melisaratos, 1983). Ethical Considerations At al1 stages of the research subjects were informed of the nature of the research and any riskdbenefits they may have incurred from participating (see Appendix B). Participants in the present research were made aware that they were volunteers at the onset and throug hout the study. Unconventionai Cancer Therapies 33 All questionnaires mailed to participants contained only a subject number. No names were placed on any of the questionnaires. One master list of participant's names and subject numbers was kept by the researcher. This list was kept separate from the questionnaires, and both will be kept in locked filling cabinets for five years post-study, at which time they will be destroyed. Data Analvsis Part A A total score for therapies currently being used (Unconventionality Index) was determined for each subject. These scores were used to separate the sample into non-users, and a median split was used to separate the remainder of the sample into low-usen and hig h-users of unconventional therapies. Data analyses were conducted on al1 of the information gathered in order to determine the frequencies of use of unconventional therapies and to determine what differences exist between the three groups. Frequencies were calculated for each of the unconventional therapies in order to measure the extent to which each therapy was Unconventional Cancer Therapies 34 currently being used by the present sample. The information gathered from the Personal Information Survey was subjected to an analysis of variance or a chi-square analysis, depending on the nature of each piece of information, in order to determine what differences exist between the three groups. Chi-square analysis was used to examine differences between the groups for coping styles (as measured by the Coping lnventory for Stressful Situations). Analysis of variance was used to examine differences between the groups on each of the three measures of distress that result from the Brief Symptom Inventory. Analysis of variance was also used to examine differences on levels of anxiety rneasured with the State-Trait Anxiety lnventory and on locus of control (as measured by the Health Locus of Control). Results from the Beliefs and Attitudes Questionnaire were subjected to factor analysis in order to determine the factors that the instrument measures. Scores from these factors were then subjected to analysis of variance in order to determine what differences exist between the groups. Results from al1 of the instruments used in the present study Unconventional Cancer Therapies 35 were subjected to a regression analysis in order to determine what are the best predictors of use of unconventional therapies (as measured by the Unconventional Therapies Questionnaire). In addition, cornparisons were made on al1 of the above measures between those participants who were solicited by their purchase of a 'Guide to Unconventional Cancer Therapies' and those solicited by their participation in a support group. Part B Subjects were also re-divided into two additional groups for further analysis. It was determined through a review of the book \"A Guide to Unconventional Cancer Therapies\" (OBCIEP, 1994), which unconventional therapies mainstream medicine had voiced concerns over regarding safety and serious health risk (Appendix A). This allowed for dividing the list of unconventional therapies into two groups, those for which mainstream rnedicine has raised concerns regarding serious risk to health and those for which it has not. The new list of cautioned unconventional therapies (see Appendix A) was then used to re-divide the subjects into users of cautioned unconventional therapies and non-users of cautioned unconventional therapies. The data analysis conducted in Part A was redone using this new grouping of subjects. Results Part A Table 1 indicates the frequency of use of Unconventional Therapies for the total sample. As a large portion of subjects for the present study were solicited from support groups, the support group category was irtf\u00eeated. Due to this fact and since anecdotal reports are finding support groups to be becoming more mainstream, this category was removed in order to allow for a more even split of the sample into three groups of non-users, low-users, and high-users of unconventional therapies. Of the total sample, 19% indicated use of no unconventional therapies. Use of unconventional therapies ranged from using 1 to 32 ditferent unconventional therapies, with an average use of 9.13 therapies and 8.5 therapies being the rnedian. The use of Unconventional Therapies by groups can be found in Table 1. The following therapies were not included in the table as no one reported current use of them: Carnivora, Chaparral, Kampo, Unconventional Cancer Therapies 37 Gerson Canthaxathin, Lysate. Therapies for which only one person reported use were also not included in the table. These were: Coffee Enema, Hoxsey Method, Ondrox, Alkaline/Acid Cleansing Diet, Moerman Diet, Cell Colonic Peroxide, Chelation Therapy, Dimethyl Sulfoxide, Laetrile, and Superoxide Dismutase. For the total sample, the rnost frequently used unconventional therapies were in the Vitamin, Mineral, and Psychological Therapies categories (Table 1). This remained true for both the low and high- user groups. However, the high-user group also appeared to more frequently be users of unconventional therapies in the other categories like Herbal Therapies, From Earth and Sea, and Energy Life Force Therapies (Table 1 ).

The final 2 factors of the rotation had only 1 and 2 items significantly load on them, respectively. These items did not appear to have good face validity and were dropped from the analysis. The remaining 5 factors were titled: Factor 1 - Positive view of unconventional therapies, Factor 2 - Positive view for cure of cancer, Factor 3 - Positive attitude toward physician, Factor 4 - Negative attitude toward Unconventional Cancer Therapies 41 conventional medicine, and Factor 5 - Positive view of conventional medicine. The items of the questionnaire each significantly loaded on only 1 factor. Scores for negative loadings were reversed as they al1 resulted from reversed questions. Scores were obtained for each factor by averaging the responses to the items loading on that factor. Table 2 Factor Loadincls for the Beliefs and Attitudes Questionnaire Note.

The strength of the association was estimated with a Phi = 0.24. Users of unconventional therapy were more likely to report current use of hormone therapy. A regression analysis was performed including al1 of the variables which might be used to predict the use of unconventional therapies. Stepwise linear multiple regression revealed a 4 variable equation that predicted 50.95 % of the variance in the use of unconventional therapies. The variables in the final equation were Factor 1 (Positive view of unconventional therapies), Factor 3 (Positive attitude toward physicians), a recurrence of their cancer, and prior use of unconventional therapies. The factors were analyzed for normality, homogeneity of variance and to ensure that the relationships were linear. As subjects were recruited through two different sources, a chi squared analysis was performed and no significant relationship was found between group and how the subjects were recruited.

The factors were analyzed for normality, homogeneity of variance and to ensure that the relationships were linear. As subjects were recruited through 2 different sources, a chi squared analysis was again perforrned and no significant relationship was found between the two groups of cautioned unconventional therapy use and how the subjects were recruited. Discussion The results of the present study appear to indicate that differences do exist between users and non-users of unconventional therapies. However, although the cunent research supports many previous findings, it does not appear to support much of the anecdotal Unconventional Cancer Therapies 63 reports or many of the extensions from research with conventional medicine. Also, the present study appears to indicate that the definition of unconventional therapies that is employed in a study is an extremely important determinant of the outcome of the research. It is important to mention before embarking on a detailed discussion of the findings of the present study, one important limitation, the current sample. At the time of collection of the data, research in the realrn of unconventional therapies was a controversial issue in many medical centres. As a result, participants for the present sample had to be drawn from outside of the most commonly used setting for cancer research, the hospital. The reader is therefore cautioned to remember that the present sample is drawn from a group of cancer patients with an interest in unconventional therapies and that the findings are not representative of al1 cancer patients. It is the hope of the researcher that these findings may help to further the possibility that research on unconventional therapies will be conducted within cancer treatment centres to allow for a representative sarnple of al1 cancer patients. In addition, it is worth noting that although no statistical Unconventional Cancer Therapies 64 differences were found regarding gender, the sample was skewed with 80.6% being female. Thus, the reader is cautioned regarding the interpretation of the results relative to gender. As one may have expected, the most frequently used unconventional therapies reported were vitamins. Specifically, vitamin C and E with 59.4% and 56.4%, respectively, of the total sample reporting current use. Outside of vitamins. minerals appeared to be the next most popular category of current use with 37.8% of the sample reporting use of calcium and selenium. and 27.8% reporting use of zinc. Psychological therapies was the next most popular category, followed by Herbal Therapies. These findings appear to agree with current beliefs that many of these therapies are becoming more mainstream. In fact, it is probable that many people reporting use of these thera pies may not even consider themselves to be users of unconventional therapies. This is important to remember as research continues into the use of these therapies. It indicates that one must be cateful how they identify 'users'. Simply asking someone if they use unconventional therapies may not be sufficient. Unconventional Cancer Therapies 65 The use of cautioned unconventional therapies is also interesting to examine. The greatest use was of selenium (37.8%), followed by mega-vitemin therapy(l5.0%). ginseng (6.7%), and germanium (5.6%). Also, less than 4 people reported use of tellurium. iscador, hydrogen peroxide, DMSO, and laetrile. The lower level of use of these therapies is one indication of the large difference that exists between the use of unconventional therapies and the use of cautioned unconventional therapies. This will later be discussed in more detail. The present study found that 85% of respondents reported current use of at least one unconventional therapy. This number may however have been inflated by accessing participants through support groups, which is one of the unconventional therapies. Even by removing the use of support groups from the list of unconventional therapies, 80.6% of respondents still reported current use of at least one unconventional therapy. These numbers do fall within the range of previous research wich found that between 9 and 86% (Arkko et Brigden, 1995; Cassileth et al., 1984; and Risberg et al., 1997) of cancer patients used some type of unconventional therapy. Unconventional Cancer Thera pies 66 There may be several explanations for why the present study found results et the upper end of the range. lt is very probable that the extent of use in the present study is inflated due to the method of recruitment. This was not designed to exclusively be a measure of the extent of use by al1 cancer patients, and hence, recruiting participants from support groups and from the purchase of a book on unconventional therapies has undoubtedly skewed the results in how they would compare to al1 cancer patients. In addition, the increased use in the present study is probably also a result of the broad definition of unconventional therapy incorporated. By re-grouping the study participants and looking only at the use of unconventional therapies which have been cautioned by practitioners of conventional medicine, 42.7% reported using at least one cautioned unconventional therapy. This narrower definition of unconventional therapies brings the findings of the present study closer to the middle of the range of other research. However, it too has been affected by the method of sample recruitment. It is interesting to note that although the vast majority of participants in the present study reported use of an unconventional Unconventional Cancer Therapies 67 therapy (85%). only approximately haH of those users reported using more risky therapies. This again leads one to further speculate that the choice to use unconventional therapies and the choice to use cautioned therapies is vastly different. Some previous research on the use of unconventional therapies by cancer patients found that age, ethnicity, and income were related to the use of unconventional therapies (Cassileth et al., 1984, Downer et al., 1994, and Eisenberg, 1993). However, most previous research agreed that education was the distinguishing demographic variable that was related to the use of unconventional therapies (Cassileth et al., 1984; Cooper, 1983; Markle et al., 1978). The present study supports the latter as it found that there were no demographic differences related to unconventional therapy use except for education. This held true even when examining the narrower definition of cautioned unconventional therapies. Why is it then that people with higher levels of education appear more likely to use unconventional therapies? There may be many explanations. As by their very nature, unconventional therapies are not a part of our traditional medical system. Therefore, one would be Unconventional Cancer Therapies 68 required to put extra effort into seeking out information on them and how to obtain them. It would make sense then, that those with higher levels of education may have a better understanding of how to obtain the information and ultimately the treatment. An alternative explanation may lie in the notion that along with higher education often cornes being taught to question and seek alternative explanations for things. Thus, those with higher levels of education may be more likely to question their physicians treatment c hoices and look for alternatives, The fact that rnany conventional practitioners fear that consumers of unconventional therapies are making poor decisions is also called into question by this finding. One must entertain the idea that since higher education level appears so relevant a factor in the use of unconventional therapies, that poor decision making may not hold merit as a possible reason for use. Several previous studies have found relationships between the use of unconventional therapies and patients' views and attitudes toward conventional medicine and conventional therapies (Murray b Shepherd, 1993; Furnham & Smith, 1988; Moore et al., 1985; and Unconventional Cancer Therapies 69 Cassileth et al., 1984). In addition, many anecdotal reports have supported this relationship. The present study found similar results in that patients who did not use unconventional therapies reported a more positive view of conventional medicine and their physician, and a less positive view of unconventional therapies. than did users of unconventional therapies. This finding remained true even when examining the narrower definition of cautioned unconventional therapy, except with respect to their view of their physician. It appean that when looking at users of cautioned unconventional therapies their attitudes regarding conventional and unconventional medicine are as one may easily predict. However, they do not appear to be more likely to have less positive attitudes toward their physicians than non-users. Why rnight this be so? It may relate back to the earlier mentioned idea that it appears that choosing an unconventional therapy and choosing one that rnay be risky are very different choices. When a cancer patient decides to use a therapy which conventional medicine is raising red flags over, it is very probably not just about their attitude or faith in one penon, their physician. It is more likely related more to their view of a system as a whole, conventional Unconventional Cancer Therapies 70 medicine. Differences were also found amongst the users of unconventional therapies. Patients who used less unconventional therapy (low-users) reported a more positive view of conventional medicine and their physician, and a less positive view of unconventional therapies, than did patients who used more unconventional therapies (high-users). It is important to note that this relationship does not imply causality for use. However, it is also important to hig hlight that the present study and previous research appear to be pointing out that patients who have a less positive view about conventional medicine tend to be more likely to use unconventional therapies to a greater degree and be more likely to use cautioned unconventional therapies. It may be that this negative attitude leads them to look for alternatives for treatment in the unconventional realrn. As was predicted, for both users of al1 unconventional therapies and users of cautioned unconventional therapies, use appeared to have relationships with whether patients reported that there had ever been concurrent use of unconventional and conventional therapies, Unconventional Cancer Therapies 71 and with prior use of unconventional therapies. This was a rather clear prediction as one could easily expect that users of unconventional therapies would be more likely to have prior interest and use, and more likely to have concurrent use with conventional therapies than non-users of unconventional therapies. Also, as predicted, unconventional therapy user group had a significant relationship with whether a conventional therapy had ever been stopped before being advised to do so by a physician, and with the refusal of a recommended conventional therapy. Users of unconventional therapies were more likely to have gone against the advice of their physician. However, this was only true when examining a broad definition of unconventional therapies. A significant relationship did not exist when considering only cautioned unconventional therapies. One must be careful to not draw causal relationships from this, but it does appear to be of importance, especially in light of the fact that many anecdotal reports have physicians worrying that the use of unconventional therapies may lead a patient to refuse or stop a conventional treatment. The present study seems to imply that Unconventional Cancer Therapies 72 although there may be some truth to this worty, it may not be as great a concern when considering unconventional therapies that rnay be risky to one's health. Cancer patients with interest in unconventional therapies appear to be more likely to listen to their physicians when it is regarding controversial unconventional therapies. The present study also found that when considering a broad definition of unconventional therapies non-users had a more positive view that their cancer would be cured. This supports our prediction that users of unconventional therapies have a more negative view of their cancer and it supports previous research which found that users of unconventional therapy had a greater fear that their cancer was incurable (Henney, 1985). However, a similar prediction was made with respect to cautioned unconventional therapy use, and the present study did not find this to be true. These findings tend to suggest that the choice to use unconventional therapies may in part be related to reaching out to try other avenues because of a feeling that one's cancer is incurable. However, the choice to use more risky unconventional therapies may differ. The present study did not support the finding of Downer et al. Unconventional Cancer Therapies 73 (1984) that users of unconventional therapy had a more internal locus of control. It was found presently that there were no differences in locus of controt between users and non-users of unconventional therapies or between usen and non-usen of cautioned unconventional therapies. It was hypothesized that since using unconventional therapies is often felt to be an attempt to better one's condition, that patients who used unconventional therapies would have a more internal locus of control, which is a measure of beliefs in one's ability to take steps to control their health. It may be that this tack of a difference indicates that using unconventional therapies is not related to trying to better one's health. However, the present researcher believes this to be unlikely. It is more probable that other factors may be a more powerful part of the choice to use unconventional therapies. Control issues may very well still have relevance. However, more sensitive research may be needed to elucidate them. Also, the reader is cautioned when considering this finding, as the limitation of the sample may have made finding this difference in locus of control quite difficult to interpret as the non-user group may be dissimilar to non-user groups in prior research. Unconventional Cancer Therapies 74 Some research and anecdotal reports led the present researcher to hypothesize that users of unconventional therapy would have greater levels of anxiety (Downer et al., 1994, and Furnham and Smith, 1988) and psychological distress (Goldberg, 1983). and a more active coping style (Cassileth et al., 1984). No differences were found on any of these measures except for phobic anxiety which was found to be higher in low-users than non-users. Since no difference was found with high-users or with users of cautioned unconventional therapies, the interpretation of this finding is difficult. Derogatis (1993) defined phobic anxiety as a persistent fear response - to a specific person, place, object, or situation - that is irrational and leads to avoidance or escape behaviour. The present study would tend to suggest that there is a relationship between phobic anxiety and sorne use of unconventional therapies. However, as no difference was found with patients using more unconventional therapy or with patients using cautioned unconventional therapies, it is possible that this finding ma y be a false positive or an artifact of sample site. It is important to highlight that many of the predictions in the present study focused on personality or psychological differences Unconventional Cancer Therapies 75 between users and non-users of unconventional therapies such as locus of control, anxiety, coping strategies, and psychological distress. The present study found that these differences do not appear to be present. One rnust be cautious with this result as the limitation of sample may have affected this finding. As the present sample was representative of cancer patients with an interest in unconventional therapies, it rnay be that the above factors relate to interest and non- interest, and not just use of unconventional therapies. Research using samples of al1 cancer patients is necessary to determine this factor. In addition, as was mentioned with regard to locus of control, it is still probable that these factors relate to choosing to use unconventional therapies, but that they are not as powerful a factor in the choice as rnany of the other variables examined. Based on an early cornmon belief in the literature a further prediction was made by the researcher that severity of illness would be related to the use of unconventional therapies. The present study did not find this to be true based on using the presence of a recurrence as a roug h measure of severity. This appears to support the finding of Cassileth et al. (1984) that those with chronic illness, as opposed to Unconventional Cancer Therapies 76 terminal illness. represent a larger portion of cancer patients who choose unconventional therapies. With regard to predicting patients' treatment choices. previous research in the area of conventional therapies eppears to conclude that choice is not based on demographic variables (Kaplan et al., 1995; and Zug et al., 1995), but may be partly based on state of health (England b Evans, 1992; and Kaplan et al., 1995). The present study determined that the best variables for predicting a patient's choice to use unconventional therapies are their view of unconventional therapies, their attitude toward their physician, and whether or not they have had a recurrence of their illness. Efforts to try and predict which patients will use and not use conventional therapies remain quite speculative. Even by examining the related variables mentioned above, the prediction is not very accurate. In summary, it appears from the present study that demographic variables other than education are not critical factors in the use of unconventional therapies by cancer patients. The same is true of their coping style and psychological state. With respect to the present sample, it appears that of more importance are their beliefs and Unconventional Cancer Therapies 77 attitudes about cancer, about conventional medicine and their physician, and a bout unconventional medicine. The concern of physicians and other health care providers that patients will stop or refuse a beneficial conventional therapy, may hold some merit. However, much more research is needed to further Our undentanding of these decisions, especially when it comes to unconventional therapies that may be a health risk. For now it appears that it may be beneficial for health care professionals to continue to focus on how patients are feeling about, and interacting with Our conventional medical system. It is apparent in the present study that the definition of unconventional therapy that is used does make a difference, not only in terms of frequencies of use, but with respect to areas of concern to physicians like the refusal or stopping of a conventional treatment that is believed to be beneficial. There appears to be differences between the choice to use unconventional therapies that are not very risky and those that pose some health risk. Further research is needed to clarify this issue, It is important to once again remind the reader that the findings Unconventional Cancer Therapies 78 of the present study may be generalized only to those cancer patients who demonstrate an interest in unconventional therapies. The present study did not include a group of non-users of unconventional therapies who had no interest in unconventional therapies. As research in the area of unconventional therapies is really only in its infancy, it is important that a consensus be reached amongst investigators as to what constitutes an unconventional therapy. The difficulty, however, lies in the fact that the definition will probably be ever-evolving as new therapies arise and others become more mainstream. It is also important that mainstream cancer care centres allow and encourage research with unconventional therapies within their facilities. It is mainly through research in these centres that we will be able to access a truer sample of cancer patients. REFERENCES American Cancer Society (1982). Un~roven methods of cancer manariement.
