These network providers use your membership record to know what services are covered and the cost sharing amounts for you . Because of this, it is very important that you help us keep your information up to date. Let us know about these changes: Changes to your name, your address, or your phone number Changes in any other health insurance coverage you have (such as from your employer, your spouse's employer, workers' compensation, or Medicaid) If you have any liability claims, such as claims from an automobile accident If you have been admitted to a nursing home If your designated responsible party (such as a caregiver) changes If you are participating in a clinical research study ( Note: You are not required to tell your plan about the clinical research studies you intend to participate in but we encourage you to do so) If any of this information changes, please let us know by calling Member Services. It is also important to contact Social Security if you move or change your mailing address. You can find phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in Chapter 2, Section 5. SECTION 6 How other insurance works with our plan Other insurance Medicare requires that we collect information from you about any other medical or drug insurance coverage that you have. That's because we must coordinate any other coverage you have with your benefits under our plan. This is called Coordination of Benefits . Once each year, we will send you a letter that lists any other medical or drug insurance coverage that we know about. Please read over this information carefully. If it is correct, you don't need to do anything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other coverage that is not listed, please call Member Services. You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and on time. When you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), there are rules set by Medicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The insurance that pays first is called the \"primary payer\" and pays up to the limits of its coverage. The one that pays second, called the \"secondary payer,\" only pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs. If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy. These rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage: If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first. If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member's current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of people employed by your employer, and whether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): If you're under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 100 employees.2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 6 Chapter 1 Getting started as a member If you're over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 20 employees. If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 months after you become eligible for Medicare. These types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type: Nofault insurance (including automobile insurance) Liability (including automobile insurance) Black lung benefits Workers' compensation Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare covered services. They only pay after Medicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid.CHAPTER 2: Important phone numbers and resources2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 8 Chapter 2 Important phone numbers and resources SECTION 1Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan contacts (how to contact us, including how to reach Member Services) How to contact our plan's Member Services For assistance with claims, billing, or member card questions, please call or write to Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan Member Services.

It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the medical treatments, services, equipment, prescription drugs, and other medical care that are covered by the plan. For the details on what medical care is covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get this care, use the Schedule of Cost Sharing . It's described in the next chapter, Chapter 4 ( Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay ). Section 1.1 What are \"network providers\" and \"covered services\"? \"Providers \" are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to provide medical services and care. The term \"providers\" also includes hospitals and other health care facilities. \"Network providers \" are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our payment and your cost sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these providers to deliver covered services to members in our plan. The providers in our network bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you pay only your share of the cost for their services. \"Covered services \" include all the medical care, health care services, supplies, and equipment that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care are listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing . Section 1.2 Basic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan As a Medicare health plan, Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan must cover all services covered by Original Medicare and must follow Original Medicare's coverage rules. Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan will generally cover your medical care as long as: The care you receive is included in the plan's Schedule of Cost Sharing (this chart is provided by mail). The care you receive is considered medically necessary. \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supplies, equipment, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. You receive your care from a provider who is eligible to provide services under Original Medicare. As a member of our plan, you can receive your care from either a network provider or an outofnetwork provider (for more about this, see Section 2 in this chapter). The providers in our network are listed in the Provider Directory . Please note: While you can get your care from an out ofnetwork provider, the provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare. Except for emergency care, we cannot pay a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare. If you go to a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare, you will be responsible for the full cost of the services you receive. Check with your provider before receiving services to confirm that they are eligible to participate in Medicare.2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 19 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services SECTION 2 Using network and out ofnetwork providers to get your medical care Section 2.1You may choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and oversee your medical care What is a \"PCP \" and what does the PCP do for you? As a member of our plan, you do not have to choose a network PCP; however, we strongly encourage you to choose a PCP and let us know who you chose. Your PCP can help you stay healthy, treat illnesses and coordinate your care with other health care providers. If you choose a network PCP, they will appear on your member ID card. If your member ID card does not show a PCP (or PCP office) or the one you want to use, please contact us so we can update our files. Depending on where you live, the following types of providers may act as a PCP: General Practitioner Internist Family Practitioner Geriatrician Physician Assistants (Not available in all states) Nurse Practitioners (Not available in all states) Please refer to your Provider Directory or go to our website at CONY.AetnaMedicare.com for a complete listing of PCPs in your area. What is the role of a PCP in coordinating covered services? Your PCP will provide most of your care, and when you need more specialized services, they will coordinate your care with other providers. They will help you find a specialist and will arrange for covered services you get as a member of our plan. Some of the services that the PCP will coordinate include: xrays laboratory tests therapies care from doctors who are specialists hospital admissions \"Coordinating\" your services includes consulting with other plan providers about your care and how it is progressing. Since your PCP will provide and coordinate most of your medical care, we recommend that you have your past medical records sent to your PCP's office. What is the role of the PCP in making decisions about or obtaining prior authorization (PA), if applicable? In some cases, your PCP or other provider, or you as the enrollee (member) of the plan may need to get approval in advance from our Medical Management Department for certain types of services or tests (this is called getting \"prior authorization\"). Obtaining prior authorization is the responsibility of the PCP, 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 20 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services treating provider, or you as the member. Services and items requiring prior authorization are listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing . How do you choose your PCP? You can select your PCP by using the Provider Directory , by accessing our website at CONY.AetnaMedicare.com , or getting help from Member Services. You can change your PCP for any reason, at any time by contacting Member Services. Changing your PCP You may change your PCP for any reason, at any time. Also, it's possible that your PCP might leave our plan's network of providers and you would have to find a new PCP. Contact us immediately if your member ID card does not show the PCP you want to use. We will update your file and send you a new member ID card to reflect the change in PCP. To change your PCP, call Member Services before you set up an appointment with a new PCP. When you call, be sure to tell Member Services if you are seeing specialists or currently getting other covered services that were coordinated by your PCP (such as home health services and durable medical equipment). They will check to see if the PCP you want to switch to is accepting new patients. Member Services will change your membership record to show the name of your new PCP, let you know the effective date of your change request, and answer your questions about the change. They will also send you a new membership card that shows the name and/or phone number of your new PCP. Section 2.2 How to get care from specialists and other network providers A specialist is a doctor who provides health care services for a specific disease or part of the body. There are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples: Oncologists care for patients with cancer. Cardiologists care for patients with heart conditions. Orthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions. What is the role of the PCP in referring members to specialists and other providers? If you choose to select a PCP, your PCP will provide most of your care and will help arrange or coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a plan member. Your PCP may refer you to a specialist, but you can go to any specialists in our network without a referral. Prior authorization process In some cases, your PCP or other provider, or you as an enrollee (member) of the plan, may need to get approval in advance from our Medical Management Department for certain types of services or tests that you receive in network (this is called getting \"prior authorization\"). Obtaining prior authorization is the responsibility of the PCP or the treating provider. Services and items requiring prior authorization are listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing . Prior authorization is not required for covered services received out ofnetwork; however, if we later determine that the services you received were not covered or were not medically necessary, we may deny 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 21 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services coverage and you will be responsible for the entire cost. You or your doctor may ask for a pre visit coverage decision to confirm that the services you are getting are covered and are medically necessary by calling Member Services. What if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan? It is important that you know that we may make changes to the hospitals, doctors and specialists (providers) that are part of your plan during the year. If your doctor or specialist leaves your plan you have certain rights and protections summarized below: You can continue to see the provider out of network if they participate in Medicare and will accept the plan. Even though our network of providers may change during the year, Medicare requires that we furnish you with uninterrupted access to qualified doctors and specialists. We will make a good faith effort to provide you with at least 30 days' notice that your provider is leaving our plan so that you have time to select a new provider. We will assist you in selecting a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care needs. If you are undergoing medical treatment you have the right to request, and we will work with you to ensure, that the medically necessary treatment you are receiving is not interrupted. If our network does not have a qualified specialist for a plan covered service, we must cover that service at in network cost sharing. A prior authorization may be required in this situation. If you find out your doctor or specialist is leaving your plan, please contact us so we can assist you in finding a new provider to manage your care. If you believe we have not furnished you with a qualified provider to replace your previous provider or that your care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file a quality of care complaint to the QIO, a quality of care grievance to the plan, or both. Please see Chapter 7. Section 2.3 How to get care from out ofnetwork providers As a member of our plan, you can choose to receive care from out ofnetwork providers. However, please note providers that do not contract with us are under no obligation to treat you, except in emergency situations. Our plan will cover services from either in network or out ofnetwork providers, as long as the services are covered benefits and are medically necessary. Here are other important things to know about using out ofnetwork providers: You can get your care from an out ofnetwork provider; however, in most cases that provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare. Except for emergency care, we cannot pay a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare. If you receive care from a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare, you will be responsible for the full cost of the services you receive. Check with your provider before receiving services to confirm that they are eligible to participate in Medicare. You don't need to get a referral or prior authorization when you get care from out ofnetwork providers. However, before getting services from out ofnetwork providers you may want to ask for a pre visit coverage decision to confirm that the services you are getting are covered and are medically necessary. (See Chapter 7, Section 4 for information about asking for coverage decisions.) This is important because: Without a pre visit coverage decision, if we later determine that the services are not covered 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 22 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services or were not medically necessary, we may deny coverage and you will be responsible for the entire cost. If we say we will not cover your services, you have the right to appeal our decision not to cover your care. See Chapter 7 ( What to do if you have a problem or complaint ) to learn how to make an appeal. It is best to ask an out ofnetwork provider to bill the plan first. But, if you have already paid for the covered services, we will reimburse you for our share of the cost for covered services. Or if an outofnetwork provider sends you a bill that you think we should pay, you can send it to us for payment. See Chapter 5 ( Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services ) for information about what to do if you receive a bill or if you need to ask for reimbursement. As a member of our plan, you may use network providers or out ofnetwork providers for all covered medical services at the same member cost sharing amount. Our plan will cover services from either innetwork or out ofnetwork providers, as long as the services are covered benefits and medically necessary. If you don't have your copy of the Provider Directory , and you reside in a network service area, you can request a copy from Member Services. A listing of network service areas is available in Addendum B at the back of this booklet. If you do not reside in a network service area, but you will be visiting a network service area in the future, you may still request a directory from us. SECTION 3How to get services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care or during a disaster Section 3.1 Getting care if you have a medical emergency What is a \"medical emergency \" and what should you do if you have one? A \"medical emergency \" is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent your loss of life (and, if you are a pregnant woman, loss of an unborn child), loss of a limb or function of a limb, or loss of or serious impairment to a bodily function. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse. If you have a medical emergency: Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral first from your PCP. You do not need to use a network doctor. You may get covered emergency medical care wherever you need it, anywhere in the United States or its territories, and from any provider with an appropriate state license even if they are not part of our network. Our plan covers worldwide services outside of the United States under the following circumstances: Emergency care Urgently needed care Emergency ambulance transportation from the scene of an emergency to the nearest medical treatment facility Transportation back to the United States from another country is not covered. Pre scheduled and/or 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 23 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services elective procedures are not covered. See the Schedule of Cost Sharing for more information. Be sure to get a copy of all your medical records from your emergency or urgent care provider before you leave; you may need them to file a claim or to help with claims processing. Without these records we may not be able to pay your claim. As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency. We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. Please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on your member ID card). What is covered if you have a medical emergency? Our plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endanger your health. We also cover medical services during the emergency. The doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over. After the emergency is over, you are entitled to follow up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your doctors will continue to treat you until your doctors contact us and make plans for additional care. Your follow up care will be covered by our plan. What if it wasn't a medical emergency? Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in for emergency care - thinking that your health is in serious danger - and the doctor may say that it wasn't a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care. In addition, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, the amount of cost sharing that you pay will be the same whether you get the care from network providers or out ofnetwork providers. Section 3.2 Getting care when you have an urgent need for services What are \"urgently needed services \"? An urgently needed service is a non emergency situation requiring immediate medical care but given your circumstances, it is not possible or not reasonable to obtain these services from a network provider. The plan must cover urgently needed services provided out of network. Some examples of urgently needed services are i) a severe sore throat that occurs over the weekend or ii) an unforeseen flare up of a known condition when you are temporarily outside the service area. If you need to locate an urgent care facility, you can find an in network urgent care center near you by using the Provider Directory , going to our website at CONY.AetnaMedicare.com , or getting help from Member Services. Our plan covers worldwide emergency and urgent care services outside of the United States under the following circumstances: 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 24 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services Emergency care Urgently needed care Emergency ambulance transportation from the scene of an emergency to the nearest medical treatment facility Transportation back to the United States from another country is not covered. Pre scheduled and/or elective procedures are not covered. See the Schedule of Cost Sharing for more information. Be sure to get a copy of all your medical records from your emergency or urgent care provider before you leave; you may need them to file a claim or to help with claims processing. Without these records we may not be able to pay your claim. Section 3.3 Getting care during a disaster If the Governor of your state, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of the United States declares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, you are still entitled to care from your plan. Please visit the following website: CONY.AetnaMedicare.com for information on how to obtain needed care during a disaster . SECTION 4 What if you are billed directly for the full cost of your covered services? Section 4.1 You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services If you have paid more than your plan cost sharing for covered services, or if you have received a bill for the full cost of covered medical services, go to Chapter 5 (Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services ) for information about what to do. Section 4.2 If services are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan covers all medically necessary services as listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing. If you receive services not covered by our plan, you are responsible for paying the full cost of services. For covered services that have a benefit limitation, you also pay the full cost of any services you get after you have used up your benefit for that type of covered service . Any amounts you pay for services after a benefit limit has been reached do not count toward your out ofpocket maximum. You can call Member Services when you want to know how much of your benefit limit you have already used. SECTION 5How are your medical services covered when you are in a \"clinical research study \"? Section 5.1 What is a \"clinical research study\"? A clinical research study (also called a \"clinical trial\") is a way that doctors and scientists test new types of 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 25 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services medical care, like how well a new cancer drug works. Certain clinical research studies are approved by Medicare. Clinical research studies approved by Medicare typically request volunteers to participate in the study. Once Medicare approves the study, and you express interest, someone who works on the study will contact you to explain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the scientists who are running the study. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the requirements for the study and you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved if you participate in the study. If you participate in a Medicare approved study, Original Medicare pays most of the costs for the covered services you receive as part of the study. If you tell us that you are in a qualified clinical trial, then you are only responsible for the in network cost sharing for the services in that trial. If you paid more, for example, if you already paid the Original Medicare cost sharing amount, we will reimburse the difference between what you paid and the in network cost sharing. However, you will need to provide documentation to show us how much you paid. When you are in a clinical research study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the care that is not related to the study) through our plan. If you want to participate in a Medicare approved clinical research study, you do not need to tell us or to get approval from us or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the clinical research study do not need to be part of our plan's network of providers. Although you do not need to get our plan's permission to be in a clinical research study, we encourage you to notify us in advance when you choose to participate in Medicare qualified clinical trials. If you participate in a study that Medicare has not approved, you will be responsible for paying all costs for your participation in the study. Section 5.2 When you participate in a clinical research study, who pays for what? Once you join a Medicare approved clinical research study, Original Medicare covers the routine items and services you receive as part of the study, including: Room and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren't in a study. An operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study. Treatment of side effects and complications of the new care. After Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will pay the difference between the cost sharing in Original Medicare and your in network cost sharing as a member of our plan. This means you will pay the same amount for the services you receive as part of the study as you would if you received these services from our plan. However, you are required to submit documentation showing how much cost sharing you paid. Please see Chapter 5 for more information for submitting requests for payments. Here's an example of how the cost sharing works : Let's say that you have a lab test that costs $100 as part of the research study. Let's also say that your share of the costs for this test is $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our plan's benefits. In this case, Original Medicare would pay $80 for the test and you would pay the $20 copay required under Original Medicare. You would then notify your plan that you received a qualified clinical trial service and submit documentation, such as a provider bill, to the plan. The plan would then directly pay you $10. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 26 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services Therefore, your net payment is $10, the same amount you would pay under our plan's benefits. Please note that in order to receive payment from your plan, you must submit documentation to your plan, such as a provider bill. When you are part of a clinical research study, neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of the following: Generally, Medicare will not pay for the new item or service that the study is testing unless Medicare would cover the item or service even if you were not in a study. Items or services provided only to collect data, and not used in your direct health care. For example, Medicare would not pay for monthly CT scans done as part of the study if your medical condition would normally require only one CT scan. Do you want to know more? You can get more information about joining a clinical research study by visiting the Medicare website to read or download the publication \"Medicare and Clinical Research Studies.\" (The publication is available at www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02226-Medicare-and-Clinical-Research-Studies.pdf .) You can also call 1800 MEDICARE (1 800 6334227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1877486 2048. SECTION 6 Rules for getting care in a \"religious non medical health care institution \" Section 6.1 What is a religious non medical health care institution? A religious non medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that would ordinarily be treated in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against a member's religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for care in a religious non medical health care institution. This benefit is provided only for Part A inpatient services (non medical health care services). Section 6.2 Receiving Care from a Religious Non Medical Health Care Institution To get care from a religious non medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document that says you are conscientiously opposed to getting medical treatment that is \"non excepted.\" \"Non excepted\" medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is voluntary and not required by any federal, state, or local law. \"Excepted\" medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not voluntary or is required under federal, state, or local law. To be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non medical health care institution must meet the following conditions: The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare. Our plan's coverage of services you receive is limited to nonreligious aspects of care. If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following conditions 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 27 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services apply: You must have a medical condition that would allow you to receive covered services for inpatient hospital care or skilled nursing facility care. - and - you must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to the facility or your stay will not be covered. Medicare Inpatient Hospital coverage limits may apply . See the Schedule of Cost Sharing . SECTION 7 Rules for ownership of durable medical equipment Section 7.1Will you own the durable medical equipment after making a certain number of payments under our plan? Durable medical equipment (DME) includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, wheelchairs, walkers, powered mattress systems, crutches, diabetic supplies, speech generating devices, IV infusion pumps, nebulizers, and hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the home. The member always owns certain items, such as prosthetics. In this section, we discuss other types of DME that you must rent. In Original Medicare, people who rent certain types of DME own the equipment after paying copayments for the item for 13 months. As a member of Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan we will transfer ownership of certain DME items . Call Member Services to find out about the requirements you must meet and the documentation you need to provide. What happens to payments you made for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original Medicare? If you did not acquire ownership of the DME item while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new consecutive payments after you switch to Original Medicare in order to own the item. The payments made while enrolled in your plan do not count. Example 1: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then joined our plan. The payments you made in Original Medicare do not count. Example 2: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then joined our plan. You were in our plan but did not obtain ownership while in our plan. You then go back to Original Medicare. You will have to make 13 consecutive new payments to own the item once you join Original Medicare again. All previous payments (whether to our plan or to Original Medicare) do not count. Section 7.2 Rules for oxygen equipment, supplies, and maintenance What oxygen benefits are you entitled to? If you qualify for Medicare oxygen equipment coverage, Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan will cover: Rental of oxygen equipment Delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents Tubing and related oxygen accessories for the delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents Maintenance and repairs of oxygen equipment2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 28 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services If you leave Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan or no longer medically require oxygen equipment, then the oxygen equipment must be returned. What happens if you leave your plan and return to Original Medicare? Original Medicare requires an oxygen supplier to provide you services for five years. During the first 36 months you rent the equipment. The remaining 24 months the supplier provides the equipment and maintenance (you are still responsible for the copayment for oxygen). After five years you may choose to stay with the same company or go to another company. At this point, the five year cycle begins again, even if you remain with the same company, requiring you to pay copayments for the first 36 months. If you join or leave our plan, the five year cycle starts over.CHAPTER 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 30 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) SECTION 1 Understanding your out ofpocket costs for covered services This chapter provides a Medical Benefits Chart ( Schedule of Cost Sharing ) that lists your covered services and shows how much you will pay for each covered service as a member of Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan. Later in this chapter, you can find information about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services. Section 1.1 Types of out ofpocket costs you may pay for your covered services To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of outofpocket costs you may pay for your covered services. The \"deductible \" is the amount you must pay for medical services before our plan begins to pay its share. (Section 1.2 and the Schedule of Cost Sharing tell you more about your plan deductible.) A \"copayment \" is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Schedule of Cost Sharing tells you more about your copayments.) \"Coinsurance \" is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay a coinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The Schedule of Cost Sharing tells you more about your coinsurance.) Most people who qualify for Medicaid or for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program should never pay deductibles, copayments or coinsurance. Be sure to show your proof of Medicaid or QMB eligibility to your provider, if applicable. Section 1.2 What is your plan deductible? Your deductible (if applicable) is shown in the Schedule of Cost Sharing . Until you have paid the deductible amount, you must pay the full cost for most of your covered services. Once you have paid your deductible, we will begin to pay our share of the costs for covered medical services and you will pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount) for the rest of the calendar year. The deductible does not apply to some services, including certain in network preventive services. This means that we will pay our share of the costs for these services even if you haven't paid your deductible yet. Refer to the Schedule of Cost Sharing for a full list of services that are not subject to the plan deductible. Section 1.3 What is the most you will pay for covered medical services? Under our plan, there shown in the Schedule of Cost Sharing. Your combined maximum out ofpocket amount is listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing . This is the most you pay during the calendar year for covered plan services received from both in network and out ofnetwork providers. The amounts you pay for deductibles (if applicable), copayments, and coinsurance for covered services count toward this combined maximum out ofpocket amount. (The amounts you pay for your plan premiums (if applicable) do not count toward your combined maximum out ofpocket amount. In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 31 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) toward your combined maximum out ofpocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Schedule of Cost Sharing .) If you have paid the combined maximum out ofpocket amount listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing for covered services, you will have 100% coverage and will not have any out ofpocket costs for the rest of the year for covered services. However, you must continue to pay your plan premium (if applicable) and the Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party). Section 1.4 Our plan does not allow providers to \"balance bill\" you As a member of Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan , an important protection for you is that after you meet any deductibles (if applicable), you only have to pay your cost sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. Providers may not add additional separate charges, called \"balance billing.\" This protection applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Here is how this protection works. If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider. If your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see: If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan). If you receive the covered services from an out ofnetwork provider who participates with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers. If you receive the covered services from an out ofnetwork provider who does not participate with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non participating providers. If you believe a provider has \"balance billed\" you, call Member Services. SECTION 2Use the Schedule of Cost Sharing to find out what is covered and how much you will pay Section 2.1 Your medical benefits and costs as a member of the plan The Schedule of Cost Sharing lists the services Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan covers and what you pay out ofpocket for each service. The services listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing are covered only when the following coverage requirements are met: Your Medicare covered services must be provided according to the coverage guidelines established by Medicare. Your services (including medical care, services, supplies, equipment, and Part B prescription drugs) must be medically necessary. \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supplies, or drugs are 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 32 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. Some of the services listed in the Schedule of Cost Sharing are covered as in network services only if your doctor or other network provider gets approval in advance (sometimes called \"prior authorization\") from Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan. Covered services that need approval in advance to be covered as in network services are marked by a note in the Schedule of Cost Sharing. You never need approval in advance for out ofnetwork services from out ofnetwork providers. While you don't need approval in advance for out ofnetwork services, you or your doctor can ask us to make a coverage decision in advance. Other important things to know about our coverage: For benefits where your cost sharing is a coinsurance percentage, the amount you pay depends on what type of provider you receive the services from: If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan). If you receive the covered services from an out ofnetwork provider who participates with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers. If you receive the covered services from an out ofnetwork provider who does not participate with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non participating providers. Like all Medicare health plans, we cover everything that Original Medicare covers. For some of these benefits, you may pay more in our plan than you would in Original Medicare. For others, you may pay less . (If you want to know more about the coverage and costs of Original Medicare, look in your Medicare & You 2023 handbook. View it online at www.medicare.gov or ask for a copy by calling 1800 MEDICARE (1 800 6334227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1877486 2048.) For all preventive services that are covered at no cost under Original Medicare, we also cover the service at no cost to you. However, if you also are treated or monitored for an existing medical condition during the visit when you receive the preventive service, a copayment will apply for the care received for the existing medical condition. If Medicare adds coverage for any new services during 2023, either Medicare or our plan will cover those services. SECTION 3 What services are not covered by the plan? Section 3.1 Services we do not cover (exclusions) This section tells you what services are \"excluded\" from Medicare coverage and therefore, are not covered by this plan. The chart below lists services and items that either are not covered under any condition or are covered only under specific conditions. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 33 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) If you get services that are excluded (not covered), you must pay for them yourself except under the specific conditions listed below. Even if you receive the excluded services at an emergency facility, the excluded services are still not covered and our plan will not pay for them. The only exception is if the service is appealed and decided upon appeal to be a medical service that we should have paid for or covered because of your specific situation. (For information about appealing a decision we have made to not cover a medical service, go to Chapter 7 , Section 5.3 in this document.) Services not covered by Medicare Not covered under any conditionCovered only under specific conditions Acupuncture Available for people with chronic low back pain under certain circumstances. Additional coverage may be provided by your former employer/union/trust. See your Schedule of Cost Sharing. Cosmetic surgery or procedures Covered in cases of an accidental injury or for improvement of the functioning of a malformed body member.

Services considered not reasonable and necessary, according to Original Medicare standards CHAPTER 5: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 37 Chapter 5 Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services SECTION 1Situations in which you should ask us to pay our share of the cost of your covered services Sometimes when you get medical care, you may need to pay the full cost. Other times, you may find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage rules of the plan. Or you may receive a bill from a provider. In these cases, you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called \"reimbursing\" you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you've paid more than your share of the cost for medical services that are covered by our plan. There may be deadlines that you must meet to get paid back. Please see Section 2 of this chapter. There may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you have received or possibly for more than your share of cost sharing as discussed in the document. First try to resolve the bill with the provider. If that does not work, send the bill to us instead of paying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. If we decide not to pay it, we will notify the provider. You should never pay more than planallowed costsharing. If this provider is contracted you still have the right to treatment. Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received: 1.When you've received medical care from a provider who is not in our plan's network When you received care from a provider who is not part of our network, you are only responsible for paying your share of the cost, not for the entire cost. Ask the provider to bill the plan for our share of the cost. If you pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any payments you have made. You may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made. If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. If you have already paid more than your share of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost. Please note: While you can get your care from an out ofnetwork provider, the provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare. Except for emergency care, we cannot pay a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare. If the provider is not eligible to participate in Medicare, you will be responsible for the full cost of the services you receive. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 38 Chapter 5 Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services 2.When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay Network providers should always bill the plan directly, and ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes, and ask you to pay more than your share. You only have to pay your cost sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to add additional separate charges, called \"balance billing.\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. If you have already paid a bill to a network provider, but you feel that you paid too much, send us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan. 3.If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan Sometimes a person's enrollment in the plan is retroactive. (This means that the first day of their enrollment has already passed. The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.) If you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out ofpocket for any of your covered services after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the costs. You will need to submit paperwork such as receipts and bills for us to handle the reimbursement. All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 7 of this document has information about how to make an appeal. SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received You may request us to pay you back by sending us a request in writing. If you send a request in writing, send a fully itemized bill and documentation of any payment you have made. It's a good idea to make a copy of your bill and receipts for your records. To make sure you are giving us all the information we need to make a decision, you can fill out our claim form to make your request for payment. You don't have to use the form, but it will help us process the information faster. Either download a copy of the form from our website ( CONY.AetnaMedicare.com ) or call Member Services and ask for the form. For medical claims: Mail your request for payment together with any bills or paid receipts to us at this address: Aetna Medicare PO Box 981106 El Paso, TX 79998 1106 You must submit your medical claims to us within 12 months of the date you received the service, item, or Part B drug. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 39 Chapter 5 Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services SECTION 3 We will consider your request for payment and say yes or no Section 3.1 We check to see whether we should cover the service and how much we owe When we receive your request for payment, we will let you know if we need any additional information from you. Otherwise, we will consider your request and make a coverage decision. If it is determined that the service is a covered benefit and you and/or your provider have provided the necessary documentation, we will pay for our share of the cost. If you have already paid for the service, we will mail your reimbursement of our share of the cost to you. If you have not paid for the service yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider. If we decide that the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not pay for our share of the cost. We will send you a letter explaining the reasons why we are not sending the payment and your rights to appeal that decision. Section 3.2If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the medical care, you can make an appeal If you think we have made a mistake in turning down your request for payment or the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal. If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. The appeals process is a formal process with detailed procedures and important deadlines. For the details on how to make this appeal, go to Chapter 7 of this document.CHAPTER 6: Your rights and responsibilities2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 41 Chapter 6 Your rights and responsibilities SECTION 1Our plan must honor your rights and cultural sensitivities as a member of the plan Section 1.1We must provide information in a way that works for you and consistent with your cultural sensitivities (in languages other than English, in braille, in large print, or other alternate formats, etc.) Your plan is required to ensure that all services, both clinical and non clinical, are provided in a culturally competent manner and are accessible to all enrollees, including those with limited English proficiency, limited reading skills, hearing incapacity, or those with diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

For other types of problems, you need to use the process for making complaints; also called grievances . Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. Each process has a set of rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you. The guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use and what you should do. Section 1.2 What about the legal terms? There are legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines explained in this chapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can be hard to understand. To make things easier, this chapter: Uses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter generally says, \"making a complaint\" rather than \"filing of \"Independent Review Entity.\" It also uses abbreviations as little as possible. However, it can be helpful - and sometimes quite important - for you to know the correct legal terms. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more accurately to get the right help or information for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for handling specific types of situations. SECTION 2 Where to get more information and personalized assistance We are always available to help you. Even if you have a complaint about our treatment of you, we are obligated to honor your right to complain. Therefore, you should always reach out to customer service for help. But in some situations, you may also want help or guidance from someone who is not connected with us. Below are two entities that can assist you. State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) Each state has a government program with trained counselors. The program is not connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. The counselors at this program can help you understand which process you should use to handle a problem you are having. They can also answer your questions, give you more information, and offer guidance on what to do. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 49 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) The services of SHIP counselors are free. You will find phone numbers and website URLs in Addendum A at the back of this document. Medicare You can also contact Medicare to get help. To contact Medicare: You can call 1 800 MEDICARE (1 800 6334227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1 877486 2048. You can also visit the Medicare website ( www.medicare.gov ). SECTION 3 To deal with your problem, which process should you use? If you have a problem or concern, you only need to read the parts of this chapter that apply to your situation. The guide that follows will help. Is your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage? This includes problems about whether medical care or prescription drugs are covered or not, the way they are covered, and problems related to payment for medical care or prescription drugs. Yes. Go on to the next section of this chapter, Section 4, \"A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals. \" No. Skip ahead to Section 9 at the end of this chapter: \"How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service or other concerns. \" COVERAGE DECISIONS AND APPEALS SECTION 4 A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals Section 4.1 Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture Coverage decisions and appeals deal with problems related to your benefits and coverage for medical services, including payment. This is the process you use for issues such as whether something is covered or not and the way in which something is covered. Asking for coverage decisions prior to receiving services A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your medical services. For example, your plan network doctor makes a (favorable) coverage decision for you whenever you receive medical care from him or her or if your network doctor refers you to a medical specialist. You or your doctor can also contact us and ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical service or refuses to provide medical care you think that you need. In 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 50 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) other words, if you want to know if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage decision for you. In limited circumstances a request for a coverage decision will be dismissed, which means we won't review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn't legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a coverage decision, we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal. We are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for you and how much we pay. In some cases, we might decide a service is not covered or is no longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision, you can make an appeal. Making an appeal If we make a coverage decision, whether before or after a service is received, and you are not satisfied, you can \"appeal\" the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review and change a coverage decision we have made. Under certain circumstances, which we discuss later, you can request an expedited or \"fast appeal\" of a coverage decision. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who made the original decision. When you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 appeal. In this appeal, we review the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were properly following the rules. When we have completed the review, we give you our decision. In limited circumstances a request for a Level 1 appeal will be dismissed, which means we won't review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn't legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a Level 1 appeal, we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal. If we do not dismiss your case but say no to all or part of your Level 1 appeal, you can go on to a Level 2 appeal. The Level 2 appeal is conducted by an independent review organization that is not connected to us. (Appeals for medical services and Part B drugs will be automatically sent to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal - you do not need to do anything.). If you are not satisfied with the decision at the Level 2 appeal, you may be able to continue through additional levels of appeal (Section 8 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals processes). Section 4.2 How to get help when you are asking for a coverage decision or making an appeal Here are resources if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision: You can call us at Member Services You can get free help from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program. Your doctor can make a request for you. If your doctor helps with an appeal past Level 2, they will need to be appointed as your representative. Please call Member Services and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form. (The form is also available on Medicare's website at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf . For medical care or Part B prescription drugs, your doctor can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be automatically forwarded to Level 2.2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 51 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) You can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name another person to act for you as your \"representative\" to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal. If you want a friend, relative, your doctor or other provider, or other person to be your representative, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on your member ID card) and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form. (The form is also available on Medicare's website at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS- Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf .) The form gives that person permission to act on your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the person who you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the signed form. While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot begin or complete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the form within 44 calendar days after receiving your appeal request (our deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal request will be dismissed. If this happens, we will send you a written notice explaining your right to ask the independent review organization to review our decision to dismiss your appeal. You also have the right to hire a lawyer. You may contact your own lawyer, or get the name of a lawyer from your local bar association or other referral service. There are also groups that will give you free legal services if you qualify. However, you are not required to hire a lawyer to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision. Section 4.3 Which section of this chapter gives the details for your situation? There are three different types of situations that involve coverage decisions and appeals. Since each situation has different rules and deadlines, we give the details for each one in a separate section: Section 5 of this chapter: \"Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" Section 6 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon\" Section 7 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon\" ( Applies only to these services : home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services) If you're not sure which section you should be using, please call Member Services. You can also get help or information from government organizations such as your SHIP. SECTION 5Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal of a coverage decision Section 5.1This section tells what to do if you have problems getting coverage for medical care or if you want us to pay you back for our share of the cost of your care This section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in the Medical Benefits Chart ( Schedule of Cost Sharing ). To keep things simple, we generally refer to \"medical 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 52 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) care coverage\" or \"medical care\" which includes medical items and services as well as Medicare Part B prescription drugs. In some cases, different rules apply to a request for a Part B prescription drug. In those cases, we will explain how the rules for Part B prescription drugs are different from the rules for medical items and services. This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations: You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered by our plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2 .1. Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give you, and you believe that this care is covered by the plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2 .2. You have received medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have said we will not pay for this care. Make an appeal. Section 5.3 .3. You have received and paid for medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, and you want to ask our plan to reimburse you for this care. Send us the bill. Section 5.5 .4. You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we previously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this care could harm your health. Make an appeal. Section 5.3 .5. Note: If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services , you need to read Sections 6 and 7 of this chapter. Special rules apply to these types of care. Section 5.2 Step bystep: How to ask for a coverage decision Step 1: Decide if you need a \"standard coverage decision \" or a \"fast coverage decision. \" A \"standard coverage decision \" is usually made within 14 days or 72 hours for Part B drugs. A \"fast coverage decision \" is generally made within 72 hours, for medical services, or 24 hours for Part B drugs. In order to get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements: You may only ask for coverage for medical care you have not yet received . You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function . If the doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision, \" we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor's support, we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we do not approve a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that: Explains that we will use the standard deadlines. Explains that if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give you a Legal Terms When a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an \"organization determination. \" A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited determination.\"2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 53 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) fast coverage decision. Explains that you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. Step 2: Ask our plan to make a coverage decision or fast coverage decision. Start by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide coverage for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative can do this. Chapter 2 has contact information. Step 3: We consider your request for medical care coverage and give you our answer. For standard coverage decisions we use the standard deadlines. This means we will give you an answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your request for a medical item or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your request. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you we can take up to 14 more days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you believe that we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint.\" We will give you an answer to your complaint as soon as we make the decision. (The process for making a complaint is different than the process for coverage decisions and appeals. See Section 9 of this chapter for information on complaints.) For Fast Coverage decisions we use an expedited timeframe A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 72 hours if your request is for a medical item or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will answer within 24 hours. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more that may benefit you we can take up to 14 more days. If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint.\" (See Section 9 of this chapter for information on complaints.) We will call you as soon as we make the decision. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no. Step 4: If we say no to your request for coverage for medical care, you can appeal. If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider this decision by making an appeal. This means asking again to get the medical care coverage you want. If you make an appeal, it means you 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 54 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process. Section 5.3 Step bystep: How to make a Level 1 appeal Step 1: Decide if you need a \"standard appeal \" or a \"fast appeal. \" A \"standard appeal \" is usually made within 30 days. A \"fast appeal \" is generally made within 72 hours. If you are appealing a decision we made about coverage for care that you have not yet received, you and/or your doctor will need to decide if you need a \"fast appeal.\" If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast appeal,\" we will give you a fast appeal. The requirements for getting a \"fast appeal\" are the same as those for getting a \"fast coverage decision\" in Section 5.2 of this chapter. Step 2: Ask our plan for an Appeal or a Fast Appeal If you are asking for a standard appeal, submit your standard appeal in writing. Chapter 2 has contact information. If you are asking for a fast appeal, make your appeal in writing or call us. Chapter 2 has contact information. You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer on the coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and have a good reason for missing it, explain the reason your appeal is late when you make your appeal. We may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause may include if you had a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with incorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting an appeal. You can ask for a copy of the information regarding your medical decision. You and your doctor may add more information to support your appeal. Step 3: We consider your appeal and we give you our answer. When our plan is reviewing your appeal, we take a careful look at all of the information. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request. We will gather more information if needed, possibly contacting you or your doctor. Deadlines for a \"fast appeal\" Legal Terms An appeal to the plan about a medical care coverage decision is called a plan \"reconsideration. \" A fast appeal is also called an \"expedited reconsideration. \"2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 55 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) For fast appeals, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your appeal . We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires us to. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours (or by the end of the extended time period if we took extra days), we are required to automatically send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an independent review organization. Section 5.4 explains the Level 2 appeals process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested , we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive your appeal. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you our decision in writing and automatically forward your appeal to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal. The independent review organization will notify you in writing when it receives your appeal. Deadlines for a \"standard appeal\" For standard appeals, we must give you our answer within 30 calendar days after we receive your appeal. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug you have not yet received, we will give you our answer within 7 calendar days after we receive your appeal. We will give you our decision sooner if your health condition requires us to. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint.\" When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (See Section 9 of this chapter for information on complaints.) If we do not give you an answer by the deadline (or by the end of the extended time period), we will send your request to a Level 2 appeal, where an independent review organization will review the appeal. Section 5.4 explains the Level 2 appeal process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage within 30 calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service, or within 7 calendar days if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If our plan says no to part or all of your appeal, we will automatically send your appeal to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal. Section 5.4 Step bystep: How a Level 2 appeal is done Legal Term The formal name for the \"independent review organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity. \" It is sometimes called the \"IRE. \"2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 56 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) The independent review organization is an independent organization hired by Medicare. It is not connected with us and is not a government agency. This organization decides whether the decision we made is correct or if it should be changed. Medicare oversees its work. Step 1: The independent review organization reviews your appeal . We will send the information about your appeal to this organization. This information is called your \"case file.\" You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file . You have a right to give the independent review organization additional information to support your appeal. Reviewers at the independent review organization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. If you had a \"fast appeal\" at Level 1, you will also have a \"fast appeal\" at Level 2 For the \"fast appeal\" the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 72 hours of when it receives your appeal. However, if your request is for a medical item or service and the independent review organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . The independent review organization can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you had a \"standard appeal\" at Level 1, you will also have a \"standard appeal\" at Level 2 For the \"standard appeal\" if your request is for a medical item or service, the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 30 calendar days of when it receives your appeal. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 7 calendar days of when it receives your appeal. However, if your request is for a medical item or service and the independent review organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . The independent review organization can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. Step 2: The independent review organization gives you their answer. The independent review organization will tell you its decision in writing and explain the reasons for it. If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a medical item or service , we must authorize the medical care coverage within 72 hours or provide the service within 14 calendar days after we receive the decision from the review organization for standard requests. For expedited requests, we have 72 hours from the date we receive the decision from the review organization. If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a Medicare Part B prescription drug , we must authorize or provide the Part B prescription drug within 72 hours after we receive the 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 57 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) decision from the review organization for standard requests. For expedited requests we have 24 hours from the date we receive the decision from the review organization. If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal , it means they agree with us that your request (or part of your request) for coverage for medical care should not be approved. (This is called \"upholding the decision\" or \"turning down your appeal.\") In this case, the independent review organization will send you a letter: Explaining its decision. Notifying you of the right to a Level 3 appeal if the dollar value of the medical care coverage meets a certain minimum. The written notice you get from the independent review organization will tell you the dollar amount you must meet to continue the appeals process. Telling you how to file a Level 3 appeal. Step 3: If your case meets the requirements, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If you want to go to a Level 3 appeal the details on how to do this are in the written notice you get after your Level 2 appeal. The Level 3 appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Section 8 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals processes. Section 5.5What if you are asking us to pay you for our share of a bill you have received for medical care? Chapter 5 describes when you may need to ask for reimbursement or to pay a bill you have received from a provider. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us for payment. Asking for reimbursement is asking for a coverage decision from us If you send us the paperwork asking for reimbursement, you are asking for a coverage decision. To make this decision, we will check to see if the medical care you paid for is a covered service. We will also check to see if you followed plan guidelines for using your coverage for medical care. If we say yes to your request: If the medical care is covered and you followed all the rules, we will send you the payment for our share of the cost within 60 calendar days after we receive your request. If you haven't paid for the services, we will send the payment directly to the provider. If we say no to your request: If the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not send payment. Instead, we will send you a letter that says we will not pay for the services and the reasons why. If you do not agree with our decision to turn you down, you can make an appeal. If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the coverage decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. To make this appeal, follow the process for appeals that we describe in Section 5.3. For appeals 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 58 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) concerning reimbursement, please note: We must give you our answer within 60 calendar days after we receive your appeal. If you are asking us to pay you back for medical care you have already received and paid for yourself, you are not allowed to ask for a fast appeal. If the independent review organization decides we should pay, we must send you or the provider the payment within 30 calendar days. If the answer to your appeal is yes at any stage of the appeals process after Level 2, we must send the payment you requested to you or to the provider within 60 calendar days. SECTION 6How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon When you are admitted to a hospital, you have the right to get all of your covered hospital services that are necessary to diagnose and treat your illness or injury. During your covered hospital stay, your doctor and the hospital staff will be working with you to prepare for the day when you will leave the hospital. They will also help arrange for care you may need after you leave. The day you leave the hospital is called your \"discharge date. \" When your discharge date is decided, your doctor or the hospital staff will tell you. If you think you are being asked to leave the hospital too soon, you can ask for a longer hospital stay and your request will be considered. Section 6.1During your inpatient hospital stay, you will get a written notice from Medicare that tells about your rights Within two days of being admitted to the hospital, you will be given a written notice called An Important Message from Medicare about Your Rights . Everyone with Medicare gets a copy of this notice. If you do not get the notice from someone at the hospital (for example, a caseworker or nurse), ask any hospital employee for it. If you need help, please call Member Services or 1 800 MEDICARE (1 800 6334227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (TTY 1 877486 2048). 1.Read this notice carefully and ask questions if you don't understand it. It tells you about: Your right to receive Medicare covered services during and after your hospital stay, as ordered by your doctor. This includes the right to know what these services are, who will pay for them, and where you can get them. Your right to be involved in any decisions about your hospital stay. Where to report any concerns you have about the quality of your hospital care. Your right to request an immediate review of the decision to discharge you if you think you are being discharged from the hospital too soon. This is a formal, legal way to ask for a delay in your discharge date so that we will cover your hospital care for a longer time.2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 59 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 2.You will be asked to sign the written notice to show that you received it and understand your rights. You or someone who is acting on your behalf will be asked to sign the notice. Signing the notice shows only that you have received the information about your rights. The notice does not give your discharge date. Signing the notice does not mean you are agreeing on a discharge date. 3.Keep your copy of the notice handy so you will have the information about making an appeal (or reporting a concern about quality of care) if you need it. If you sign the notice more than two days before your discharge date, you will get another copy before you are scheduled to be discharged. To look at a copy of this notice in advance, you can call Member Services or 1 800 MEDICARE (1800 6334227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1 877486 2048. You can also see the notice online at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General- Information/BNI/HospitalDischargeAppealNotices . Section 6.2 Step bystep: How to make a Level 1 appeal to change your hospital discharge date If you want to ask for your inpatient hospital services to be covered by us for a longer time, you will need to use the appeals process to make this request. Before you start, understand what you need to do and what the deadlines are. Follow the process. Meet the deadlines. Ask for help if you need it. If you have questions or need help at any time, please call Member Services. Or call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP), a government organization that provides personalized assistance. During a Level 1 appeal, the Quality Improvement Organization reviews your appeal . It checks to see if your planned discharge date is medically appropriate for you. The Quality Improvement Organization is a group of doctors and other health care professionals paid by the Federal government to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with Medicare. This includes reviewing hospital discharge dates for people with Medicare. These experts are not part of our plan. Step 1: Contact the Quality Improvement Organization for your state and ask for an immediate review of your hospital discharge date. You must act quickly. How can you contact this organization? The written notice you received ( An Important Message from Medicare About Your Rights ) tells you how to reach this organization. Or find the name, address, and phone number of the Quality 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 60 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Improvement Organization for your state in Addendum A . Act quickly: To make your appeal, you must contact the Quality Improvement Organization before you leave the hospital and no later than midnight the day of your discharge. If you meet this deadline, you may stay in the hospital after your discharge date without paying for it while you wait to get the decision from the Quality Improvement Organization. If you do not meet this deadline, and you decide to stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, you may have to pay all of the costs for hospital care you receive after your planned discharge date. If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization, and you still wish to appeal, you must make an appeal directly to our plan instead. For details about this other way to make your appeal, see Section 6.4. Once you request an immediate review of your hospital discharge the Quality Improvement Organization will contact us. By noon of the day after we are contacted we will give you a Detailed Notice of Discharge . This notice gives your planned discharge date and explains in detail the reasons why your doctor, the hospital, and we think it is right (medically appropriate) for you to be discharged on that date. You can get a sample of the Detailed Notice of Discharge by calling Member Services or 1800 MEDICARE (1 800 6334227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. (TTY users should call 1877486 2048.) Or you can see a sample notice online at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General- Information/BNI/HospitalDischargeAppealNotices . Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization conducts an independent review of your case. Health professionals at the Quality Improvement Organization (\"the reviewers\") will ask you (or your representative) why you believe coverage for the services should continue. You don't have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish. The reviewers will also look at your medical information, talk with your doctor, and review information that the hospital and we have given to them. By noon of the day after the reviewers told us of your appeal, you will also get a written notice from us that gives your planned discharge date. This notice also explains in detail the reasons why your doctor, the hospital, and we think it is right (medically appropriate) for you to be discharged on that date. Step 3: Within one full day after it has all the needed information, the Quality Improvement Organization will give you its answer to your appeal. What happens if the answer is yes? If the review organization says yes, we must keep providing your covered inpatient hospital 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 61 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) services for as long as these services are medically necessary. You will have to keep paying your share of the costs (such as deductibles or copayments, if these apply). In addition, there may be limitations on your covered hospital services. What happens if the answer is no? If the review organization says no, they are saying that your planned discharge date is medically appropriate. If this happens, our coverage for your inpatient hospital services will end at noon on the day after the Quality Improvement Organization gives you its answer to your appeal. If the review organization says no to your appeal and you decide to stay in the hospital, then you may have to pay the full cost of hospital care you receive after noon on the day after the Quality Improvement Organization gives you its answer to your appeal. Step 4: If the answer to your Level 1 appeal is no, you decide if you want to make another appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization has said no to your appeal, and you stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you can make another appeal. Making another appeal means you are going on to \"Level 2\" of the appeals process. Section 6.3 Step bystep: How to make a Level 2 appeal to change your hospital discharge date During a Level 2 appeal, you ask the Quality Improvement Organization to take another look at their decision on your first appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization turns down your Level 2 appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your stay after your planned discharge date. Step 1: Contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review. You must ask for this review within 60 calendar days after the day the Quality Improvement Organization said no to your Level 1 appeal. You can ask for this review only if you stay in the hospital after the date that your coverage for the care ended. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization does a second review of your situation. Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will take another careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. Step 3: Within 14 calendar days of receipt of your request for Level 2 appeal, the reviewers will decide on your appeal and tell you their decision. If the review organization says yes: 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 62 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) We must reimburse you for our share of the costs of hospital care you have received since noon on the day after the date your first appeal was turned down by the Quality Improvement Organization. We must continue providing coverage for your inpatient hospital care for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs and coverage limitations may apply. If the review organization says no: It means they agree with the decision they made on your Level 1 appeal. The notice you get will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. Step 4: If the answer is no, you will need to decide whether you want to take your appeal further by going on to Level 3. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If you want to go to a Level 3 appeal, the details on how to do this are in the written notice you get after your Level 2 appeal decision. The Level 3 appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Section 8 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. Section 6.4 What if you miss the deadline for making your Level 1 appeal? You can appeal to us instead As explained above, you must act quickly to start your Level 1 appeal of your hospital discharge. If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization, there is another way to make your appeal. If you use this other way of making your appeal, the first two levels of appeal are different. Step byStep: How to make a Level 1 Alternate Appeal Step 1: Contact us and ask for a \"fast review. \" Ask for a \"fast review. \" This means you are asking us to give you an answer using the \"fast\" deadlines rather than the \"standard\" deadlines. Chapter 2 has contact information. Step 2: We do a \"fast review \" of your planned discharge date, checking to see if it was medically appropriate. Legal Term A \"fast review\" (or \"fast appeal\") is also called an \"expedited appeal. \"2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 63 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) During this review, we take a look at all of the information about your hospital stay. We check to see if your planned discharge date was medically appropriate. We see if the decision about when you should leave the hospital was fair and followed all the rules. Step 3: We give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a \"fast review. \" If we say yes to your appeal , it means we have agreed with you that you still need to be in the hospital after the discharge date. We will keep providing your covered inpatient hospital services for as long they are medically necessary. It also means that we have agreed to reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. (You must pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply.) If we say no to your appeal, we are saying that your planned discharge date was medically appropriate. Our coverage for your inpatient hospital services ends as of the day we said coverage would end. If you stayed in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you may have to pay the full cost of hospital care you received after the planned discharge date. Step 4: If we say no to your appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. Step byStep: Level 2 Alternate Appeal Process The independent review organization is an independent organization hired by Medicare. It is not connected with our plan and is not a government agency. This organization decides whether the decision we made is correct or if it should be changed. Medicare oversees its work. Step 1: We automatically forward your case to the independent review organization. We are required to send the information for your Level 2 appeal to the independent review organization within 24 hours of when we tell you that we are saying no to your first appeal. (If you think we are not meeting this deadline or other deadlines, you can make a complaint. Section 9 of this chapter tells how to make a complaint.) Step 2: The independent review organization does a \"fast review \" of your appeal. The reviewers give you an answer within 72 hours. Reviewers at the independent review organization will take a careful look at all of the information Legal Term The formal name for the \"independent review organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity. \" It is sometimes called the \"IRE. \"2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 64 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) related to your appeal of your hospital discharge. If this organization says yes to your appeal , then we must pay you back for our share of the costs of hospital care you have received since the date of your planned discharge. We must also continue the plan's coverage of your inpatient hospital services for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs. If there are coverage limitations, these could limit how much we would reimburse or how long we would continue to cover your services. If this organization says no to your appeal , it means they agree that your planned hospital discharge date was medically appropriate. The written notice you get from the independent review organization will tell how to start a Level 3 appeal with the review process, which is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Step 3: If the independent review organization turns down your appeal, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If reviewers say no to your Level 2 appeal, you decide whether to accept their decision or go on to Level 3 appeal. Section 8 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. SECTION 7How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon Section 7.1This section is only about three services: Home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services When you are getting home health services, s killed nursing care, or rehabilitation care (Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility) , you have the right to keep getting your covered services for that type of care for as long as the care is needed to diagnose and treat your illness or injury. When benefits are exhausted or no longer meet medical criteria, we are required to tell you in advance. When your coverage for that care ends, we will stop paying our share of the cost for your care. If you think we are ending the coverage of your care too soon, you can appeal our decision . This section tells you how to ask for an appeal. Section 7.2 We will tell you in advance when your coverage will be ending Legal Term \"Notice of Medicare Non Coverage. \" It tells you how you can request a \"fast track appeal. \" Requesting a fast track appeal is a formal, legal way to request a change to our coverage decision about when to stop your care.2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 65 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 1.You receive a notice in writing at least two days before our plan is going to stop covering your care. The notice tells you: The date when we will stop covering the care for you. How to request a \"fast track appeal\" to request us to keep covering your care for a longer period of time. 2.You, or someone who is acting on your behalf, will be asked to sign the written notice to show that you received it. Signing the notice shows only that you have received the information about when your coverage will stop. Signing it does not mean you agree with the plan's decision to stop care. Section 7.3Step bystep: How to make a Level 1 appeal to have our plan cover your care for a longer time If you want to ask us to cover your care for a longer period of time, you will need to use the appeals process to make this request. Before you start, understand what you need to do and what the deadlines are. Follow the process. Meet the deadlines. Ask for help if you need it. If you have questions or need help at any time, please call Member Services. Or call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP), a government organization that provides personalized assistance. During a Level 1 appeal, the Quality Improvement Organization reviews your appeal. It decides if the end date for your care is medically appropriate. The Quality Improvement Organization is a group of doctors and other health care experts paid by the Federal government to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with Medicare. This includes reviewing plan decisions about when it's time to stop covering certain kinds of medical care. These experts are not part of our plan. Step 1: Make your Level 1 appeal: contact the Quality Improvement Organization and ask for a fast track appeal . You must act quickly. How can you contact this organization? The written notice you received (Notice of Medicare Non Coverage) tells you how to reach this organization. Or find the name, address, and phone number of the Quality Improvement Organization for your state in Addendum A at the back of this document. Act quickly: 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 66 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) You must contact the Quality Improvement Organization to start your appeal by noon of the day before the effective date on the Notice of Medicare Non Coverage. Your deadline for contacting this organization. If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization, and you still wish to file an appeal, you must make an appeal directly to us instead. For details about this other way to make your appeal, see Section 7.5. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization conducts an independent review of your case. What happens during this review? Health professionals at the Quality Improvement Organization (\"the reviewers\") will ask you, or your representative, why you believe coverage for the services should continue. You don't have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish. The review organization will also look at your medical information, talk with your doctor, and review information that our plan has given to them. By the end of the day the reviewers tell us of your appeal, you will get the Detailed Explanation of Non Coverage from us that explains in detail our reasons for ending our coverage for your services. Step 3: Within one full day after they have all the information they need, the reviewers will tell you their decision. What happens if the reviewers say yes? If the reviewers say yes to your appeal, then we must keep providing your covered services for as long as it is medically necessary. You will have to keep paying your share of the costs (such as deductibles or copayments, if these apply). There may be limitations on your covered services. What happens if the reviewers say no? If the reviewers say no, then your coverage will end on the date we have told you . If you decide to keep getting the home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after this date when your coverage ends, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care yourself.Legal Term \"Detailed Explanation of Non Coverage. \" Notice that provides details on reasons for ending coverage.2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 67 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 4: If the answer to your Level 1 appeal is no, you decide if you want to make another appeal. If reviewers say no to your Level 1 appeal - and you choose to continue getting care after your coverage for the care has ended - then you can make a Level 2 appeal. Section 7.4Step bystep: How to make a Level 2 appeal to have our plan cover your care for a longer time During a Level 2 appeal, you ask the Quality Improvement Organization to take another look at the decision on your first appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization turns down your Level 2 appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end. Step 1: Contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review. You must ask for this review within 60 days after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said no to your Level 1 appeal. You can ask for this review only if you continued getting care after the date that your coverage for the care ended. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization does a second review of your situation. Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will take another careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. Step 3: Within 14 days of receipt of your appeal request, reviewers will decide on your appeal and tell you their decision. What happens if the review organization says yes? We must reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. We must continue providing coverage for the care for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply. What happens if the review organization says no? It means they agree with the decision made to your Level 1 appeal. The notice you get will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Step 4: If the answer is no, you will need to decide whether you want to take your appeal further. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 68 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) There are three additional levels of appeal after Level 2, for a total of five levels of appeal. If you want to go on to a Level 3 appeal, the details on how to do this are in the written notice you get after our Level 2 appeal decision. The Level 3 appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Section 8 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. Section 7.5 What if you miss the deadline for making your Level 1 appeal? You can appeal to us instead As explained above, you must act quickly to contact the Quality Improvement Organization to start your first appeal (within a day or two, at the most). If you miss the deadline for contacting this organization, there is another way to make your appeal. If you use this other way of making your appeal, the first two levels of appeal are different. Step byStep: How to make a Level 1 Alternate Appeal Step 1: Contact us and ask for a \"fast review. \" Ask for a \"fast review. \" This means you are asking us to give you an answer using the \"fast\" deadlines rather than the \"standard\" deadlines. Chapter 2 has contact information. Step 2: We do a \"fast review \" of the decision we made about when to end coverage for your services. During this review, we take another look at all of the information about your case. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we set the date for ending the plan's coverage for services you were receiving. Step 3: We give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a \"fast review. \" If we say yes to your appeal , it means we have agreed with you that you need services longer, and will keep providing your covered services for as long as it is medically necessary. It also means that we have agreed to reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. (You must pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply.) If we say no to your appeal , then your coverage will end on the date we told you and we will not pay any share of the costs after this date. If you continued to get home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care.Legal Term A \"fast review\" (or \"fast appeal\") is also called an \"expedited appeal. \"2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 69 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 4: If we say no to your fast appeal, your case will automatically go on to the next level of the appeals process. Step byStep: Level 2 Alternate Appeal Process During the Level 2 appeal, the independent review organization reviews the decision we made to your \"fast appeal.\" This organization decides whether the decision we made should be changed. The independent review organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare. This organization is not connected with our plan and it is not a government agency. This organization is a company chosen by Medicare to handle the job of being the independent review organization. Medicare oversees its work. Step 1: We will automatically forward your case to the independent review organization. We are required to send the information for your Level 2 appeal to the independent review organization within 24 hours of when we tell you that we are saying no to your first appeal. (If you think we are not meeting this deadline or other deadlines, you can make a complaint. Section 9 of this chapter tells how to make a complaint.) Step 2: The independent review organization does a \"fast review \" of your appeal. The reviewers give you an answer within 72 hours. Reviewers at the independent review organization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. If this organization says yes to your appeal , then we must pay you back for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. We must also continue to cover the care for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs. If there are coverage limitations, these could limit how much we would reimburse or how long we would continue to cover your services. If this organization says no to your appeal , it means they agree with the decision our plan made to your first appeal and will not change it. The notice you get from the independent review organization will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to go on to a Level 3 appeal. Step 3: If the independent review organization says no to your appeal, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels of appeal after Level 2, for a total of five levels of appeal. If you want to go on to a Level 3 appeal, the details on how to do this are in the written notice you get after your Level 2 appeal decision.Legal Term The formal name for the \"independent review organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity. \" It is sometimes called the \"IRE. \"2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 70 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) A Level 3 appeal is reviewed by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Section 8 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. SECTION 8 Taking your appeal to Level 3 and beyond Section 8.1 Appeal Levels 3, 4, and 5 for Medical Service Requests This section may be appropriate for you if you have made a Level 1 appeal and a Level 2 appeal, and both of your appeals have been turned down. If the dollar value of the item or medical service you have appealed meets certain minimum levels, you may be able to go on to additional levels of appeal. If the dollar value is less than the minimum level, you cannot appeal any further. The written response you receive to your Level 2 appeal will explain how to make a Level 3 appeal. For most situations that involve appeals, the last three levels of appeal work in much the same way. Here is who handles the review of your appeal at each of these levels. Level 3 appeal An Administrative Law Judge or an attorney adjudicator who works for the Federal government will review your appeal and give you an answer. If the Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator says yes to your appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over. Unlike a decision at a Level 2 appeal, we have the right to appeal a Level 3 decision that is favorable to you. If we decide to appeal, it will go to a Level 4 appeal. If we decide not to appeal, we must authorize or provide you with the service within 60 calendar days after receiving the Administrative Law Judge's or attorney adjudicator's decision. If we decide to appeal the decision, we will send you a copy of the Level 4 appeal request with any accompanying documents. We may wait for the Level 4 appeal decision before authorizing or providing the service in dispute. If the Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator says no to your appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over. If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the appeals process is over. If you do not want to accept the decision, you can continue to the next level of the review process. The notice you get will tell you what to do for a Level 4 appeal. Level 4 appeal The Medicare Appeals Council (Council) will review your appeal and give you an answer. The Council is part of the Federal government. If the answer is yes, or if the Council denies our request to review a favorable Level 3 appeal decision, the appeals process may or may not be over. Unlike a decision at Level 2, we have the right to appeal a Level 4 decision that is favorable to you. We will decide whether to appeal this decision to Level 5.2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 71 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) If we decide not to appeal the decision, we must authorize or provide you with the service within 60 calendar days after receiving the Council's decision. If we decide to appeal the decision, we will let you know in writing. If the answer is no or if the Council denies the review request, the appeals process may or may not be over. If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the appeals process is over. If you do not want to accept the decision, you might be able to continue to the next level of the review process. If the Council says no to your appeal, the notice you get will tell you whether the rules allow you to go on to a Level 5 appeal and how to continue with a Level 5 appeal. Level 5 appeal A judge at the Federal District Court will review your appeal. A judge will review all of the information and decide yes or no to your request. This is a final answer. There are no more appeal levels after the Federal District Court.

Your Medicare Advantage plan coverage is always secondary to any payment made or reasonably expected to be made under:2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 81 Chapter 9 Legal notices A workers' compensation law or plan of the United States or a State, Any non fault based insurance, including automobile and non automobile no fault and medical payments insurance, Any liability insurance policy or plan (including a self insured plan) issued under an automobile or other type of policy or coverage, and Any automobile insurance policy or plan (including a self insured plan), including, but not limited to, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages. Since your Medicare Advantage plan is always secondary to any automobile no fault (Personal Injury Protection) or medical payments coverage, you should review your automobile insurance policies to ensure that appropriate policy provisions have been selected to make your automobile coverage primary for your medical treatment arising from an automobile accident. As outlined herein, in these situations, your Medicare Advantage plan may make payments on your behalf for this medical care, subject to the conditions set forth in this provision for the plan to recover these payments from you or from other parties. Immediately upon making any conditional payment, your Medicare Advantage plan shall be subrogated to stand in the place of all rights of recovery you have against any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or against any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above. In addition, if you receive payment from any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or you receive payment from any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above, your Medicare Advantage plan has the right to recover from, and be reimbursed by you for all conditional payments the plan has made or will make as a result of that injury, illness or condition. Your Medicare Advantage plan will automatically have a lien, to the extent of benefits it paid for the treatment of the injury, illness or condition, upon any recovery whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise. The lien may be enforced against any party who possesses funds or proceeds representing the amount of benefits paid by the Plan including, but not limited to, you, your representatives or agents, any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above. By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to you or made on your behalf to any health care provider) from your Medicare Advantage plan, you acknowledge that the plan's recovery rights are a first priority claim and are to be paid to the plan before any other claim for your damages. The plan shall be entitled to full reimbursement on a first dollar basis from any payments, even if such payment to the plan will result in a recovery to you which is insufficient to make you whole or to compensate you in part or in whole for the damages you sustained. Your Medicare Advantage plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or attorney fees to any attorney hired by you to pursue your damage claims. Your Medicare Advantage plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted by any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or by any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above. The plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether the settlement or judgment received by you identifies the medical benefits the plan provided or purports to allocate any portion of such settlement or judgment to payment of expenses other than medical expenses. The Medicare Advantage plan is entitled to recover from any and all settlements or judgments, even those designated as for pain and suffering, non economic damages and/or general 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 82 Chapter 9 Legal notices damages only. You, and your legal representatives, shall fully cooperate with the plan's efforts to recover its benefits paid. It is your duty to notify the plan within 30 days of the date when notice is given to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of your intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to your injury, illness or condition. You and your agents or representatives shall provide all information requested by the plan or its representatives. You shall do nothing to prejudice your Medicare Advantage plan's subrogation or recovery interest or to prejudice the plan's ability to enforce the terms of this provision. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the plan. Failure to provide requested information or failure to assist your Medicare Advantage plan in pursuit of its subrogation or recovery rights may result in you being personally responsible for reimbursing the plan for benefits paid relating to the injury, illness or condition as well as for the plan's reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in obtaining reimbursement from you. For more information, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A)(ii) and the Medicare statutes. SECTION 4 Notice about recovery of overpayments If the benefits paid by this Evidence of Coverage , plus the benefits paid by other plans, exceeds the total amount of expenses, Aetna has the right to recover the amount of that excess payment from among one or more of the following: (1) any person to or for whom such payments were made; (2) other Plans; or (3) any other entity to which such payments were made. This right of recovery will be exercised at Aetna's discretion. You shall execute any documents and cooperate with Aetna to secure its right to recover such overpayments, upon request by Aetna. SECTION 5 National Coverage Determinations Sometimes, Medicare adds coverage under Original Medicare for new services during the year. If Medicare adds coverage for any services during 2023, either Medicare or our plan will cover those services. When we receive coverage updates from Medicare, called National Coverage Determinations, we'll post the coverage updates on our website at CONY.AetnaMedicare.com . You can also call Member Services to obtain the coverage updates that have been posted for the benefit year. SECTION 6 Independent Contractors Participating physicians, hospitals and other health care providers are independent contractors and are neither agents nor employees of Aetna. The availability of any particular provider cannot be guaranteed, and provider network composition is subject to change.CHAPTER 10: Definitions of important words2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 84 Chapter 10 Definitions of important words Ambulatory Surgical Center - An Ambulatory Surgical Center is an entity that operates exclusively for the purpose of furnishing outpatient surgical services to patients not requiring hospitalization and whose expected stay in the center does not exceed 24 hours. Appeal - An appeal is something you do if you disagree with our decision to deny a request for coverage of health care services or payment for services you already received. You may also make an appeal if you disagree with our decision to stop services that you are receiving. Balance Billing - When a provider (such as a doctor or hospital) bills a patient more than the plan's allowed cost sharing amount. As a member of Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan, you only have to pay our plan's cost sharing amounts when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to \"balance bill\" or otherwise charge you more than the amount of cost sharing your plan says you must pay. Benefit Period - The way that both our plan and Original Medicare measures your use of skilled nursing facility (SNF) services. A benefit period begins the day you go into a hospital or skilled nursing facility. The benefit period ends when you have not received any inpatient hospital care (or skilled care in a SNF) for 60 days in a row. If you go into a hospital or a skilled nursing facility after one benefit period has ended, a new benefit period begins. There is no limit to the number of benefit periods. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - The Federal agency that administers Medicare. Coinsurance - An amount you may be required to pay, expressed as a percentage (for example 20%) as your share of the cost for services after you pay any deductibles. Combined Maximum Out ofPocket Amount - This is the most you will pay in a year for all services from both network (preferred) providers and out ofnetwork (non preferred) providers. Complaint - The formal name for \"making a complaint\" is \"filing a grievance.\" The complaint process is used only for certain types of problems.

Copayment (or \"copay \") - An amount you may be required to pay as your share of the cost for a medical service or supply, like a doctor's visit, hospital outpatient visit, or a prescription. A copayment is a set amount (for example $10), rather than a percentage. Cost Sharing - Cost sharing refers to amounts that a member has to pay when services are received. (This is in addition to the plan's monthly premium, if applicable.) Cost sharing includes any combination of the following three types of payments: (1) any deductible amount a plan may impose before services are covered; (2) any fixed \"copayment\" amount that a plan requires when a specific service is received; or (3) any \"coinsurance\" amount, a percentage of the total amount paid for a service that a plan requires when a specific service is received. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 85 Chapter 10 Definitions of important words Covered Services - The term we use to mean all of the health care services and supplies that are covered by our plan. Creditable Prescription Drug Coverage - Prescription drug coverage (for example, from an employer or union) that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage. People who have this kind of coverage when they become eligible for Medicare can generally keep that coverage without paying a penalty, if they decide to enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage later. Custodial Care - Custodial care is personal care provided in a nursing home, hospice, or other facility setting when you do not need skilled medical care or skilled nursing care. Custodial care, provided by people who don't have professional skills or training, includes help with activities of daily living like bathing, dressing, eating, getting in or out of a bed or chair, moving around, and using the bathroom. It may also include the kind of health related care that most people do themselves, like using eye drops. Medicare doesn't pay for custodial care.

Emergency - A medical emergency is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of life (and, if you are a pregnant woman, loss of an unborn child), loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb, or loss of or serious impairment to a bodily function. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse. Emergency Care - Covered services that are: (1) provided by a provider qualified to furnish emergency services; and (2) needed to treat, evaluate, or stabilize an emergency medical condition. Evidence of Coverage (EOC) and Disclosure Information - This document, along with your enrollment form and any other attachments, riders, or other optional coverage selected, which explains your coverage, what we must do, your rights, and what you have to do as a member of our plan. Extra Help - A Medicare or a State program to help people with limited income and resources pay Medicare prescription drug program costs, such as premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance. Grievance - A type of complaint you make about our plan or providers, including a complaint concerning the quality of your care. This type of complaint does not involve coverage or payment disputes. Home Health Aide - A person who provides services that do not need the skills of a licensed nurse or therapist, such as help with personal care (e.g., bathing, using the toilet, dressing, or carrying out the prescribed exercises). 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 86 Chapter 10 Definitions of important words Hospice - A benefit that provides special treatment for a member who has been medically certified as terminally ill, meaning having a life expectancy of 6 months or less. We, your plan, must provide you with a list of hospices in your geographic area. If you elect hospice and continue to pay premiums you are still a member of our plan. You can still obtain all medically necessary services as well as the supplemental benefits we offer. Hospital Inpatient Stay - An acute hospital stay when you have been formally admitted to the hospital for skilled medical services. Even if you stay in the hospital overnight, you might still be considered an \"outpatient.\" Independent Practice Associations (IPA) - Negotiate with insurers to provide services for insureds on a flat fee or retainer basis. They allow physicians to remain independent while still collaborating with other doctors to achieve best practices and negotiate with insurers as a group. Initial Enrollment Period - When you are first eligible for Medicare, the period of time when you can sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. If you're eligible for Medicare when you turn 65, your Initial Enrollment Period is the 7 month period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65. InNetwork Maximum Out ofPocket Amount - The most you will pay for covered services received from network (preferred) providers. After you have reached this limit, you will not have to pay anything when you get covered services from network providers for the rest of the contract year. However, until you reach your combined out ofpocket amount, you must continue to pay your share of the costs when you seek care from an out ofnetwork (non preferred) provider. Low Income Subsidy (LIS) - See \"Extra Help.\" Medicaid (or Medical Assistance) - A joint Federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with low incomes and limited resources. State Medicaid programs vary, but most health care costs are covered if you qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. Medically Necessary - Services, supplies, or drugs that are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. Medicare - The Federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age or older, some people under age 65 with certain disabilities, and people with End Stage Renal Disease (generally those with permanent kidney failure who need dialysis or a kidney transplant).

A Medicare Advantage Plan can be an i) HMO, ii) PPO, a iii) Private Fee forService (PFFS) plan, or a iv) Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plan. Besides choosing from these types of plans, a Medicare Advantage HMO or PPO plan can also be a Special Needs Plan (SNP). In most cases, Medicare Advantage Plans also offer Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage). These plans are called Medicare Advantage Plans with Prescription Drug Coverage . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 87 Chapter 10 Definitions of important words Medicare Cost Plan - A Medicare Cost Plan is a plan operated by a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or Competitive Medical Plan (CMP) in accordance with a cost reimbursed contract under section 1876(h) of the Act. Medicare Covered Services - Services covered by Medicare Part A and Part B. All Medicare health plans, must cover all of the services that are covered by Medicare Part A and B. The term Medicare Covered Services does not include the extra benefits, such as vision, dental or hearing, that a Medicare Advantage plan may offer. Medicare Health Plan - A Medicare health plan is offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide Part A and Part B benefits to people with Medicare who enroll in the plan. This term includes all Medicare Advantage Plans, Medicare Cost Plans, Special Needs Plans, Demonstration/Pilot Programs, and Programs of All inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).

Member Services - A department within our plan responsible for answering your questions about your membership, benefits, grievances, and appeals. Network - A group of doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care experts contracted by our plan to provide covered services to its members (see Chapter 1, Section 3.2). Network providers are independent contractors and not agents of our plan. Network Provider - \"Provider\" is the general term for doctors, other health care professionals, hospitals, and other health care facilities that are licensed or certified by Medicare and by the State to provide health care services. \"Network providers \" have an agreement with our plan to accept our payment as payment in full, and in some cases to coordinate as well as provide covered services to members of our plan. Network providers are also called \"plan providers.\" Non Medicare Covered Services - Services that are not normally covered when you have Original Medicare. These are usually extra benefits you may receive as a member of a Medicare Advantage plan. Organization Determination - A decision our plan makes about whether items or services are covered or how much you have to pay for covered items or services. Organization determinations are called \"coverage decisions\" in this document. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 88 Chapter 10 Definitions of important words Original Medicare (\"Traditional Medicare\" or \"Fee forservice\" Medicare) - Original Medicare is offered by the government, and not a private health plan such as Medicare Advantage Plans and prescription drug plans. Under Original Medicare, Medicare services are covered by paying doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers payment amounts established by Congress. You can see any doctor, hospital, or other health care provider that accepts Medicare. You must pay the deductible. Medicare pays its share of the Medicare approved amount, and you pay your share. Original Medicare has two parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance) and is available everywhere in the United States.

Out ofnetwork providers are providers that are not employed, owned, or operated by our plan. Out ofPocket Costs - See the definition for \"cost sharing\" above.

Part C - see \"Medicare Advantage (MA) Plan.\" Part D - The voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program. Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan - A Preferred Provider Organization plan is a Medicare Advantage Plan that has a network of contracted providers that have agreed to treat plan members for a specified payment amount. A PPO plan must cover all plan benefits whether they are received from network or out ofnetwork providers. Your PPO plan has an annual limit on your total combined outofpocket costs for services from both network (preferred) and out ofnetwork (non preferred) providers. Premium - The periodic payment to Medicare, an insurance company, or a health care plan for health coverage. Primary Care Provider (PCP) - The doctor or other provider you see first for most health problems. In many Medicare health plans, you must see your primary care provider before you see any other health care provider. Prior Authorization - Approval in advance to get services. In the network portion of a PPO, some innetwork medical services are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets \"prior authorization\" from our plan. In a PPO, you do not need prior authorization to obtain out ofnetwork services. However, you may want to check with the plan before obtaining services from out ofnetwork providers to confirm that the service is covered by your plan and what your cost sharing responsibility is. Covered services that need prior authorization are marked in the Medical Benefits Chart ( Schedule of Cost Sharing ). 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Aetna Medicare Advantage PPO Plan 89 Prosthetics and Orthotics - Medical devices including, but are not limited to, arm, back and neck braces; artificial limbs; artificial eyes; and devices needed to replace an internal body part or function, including ostomy supplies and enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy.

Rehabilitation Services - These services include physical therapy, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy.

The plan must disenroll you if you permanently move out of the plan's service area. Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Care - Skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services provided on a continuous, daily basis, in a skilled nursing facility. Examples of care include physical therapy or intravenous injections that can only be given by a registered nurse or doctor. Special Enrollment Period - A set time when members can change their health or drug plans or return to Original Medicare. Situations in which you may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period include: if you move outside the service area, if you move into a nursing home, or if we violate our contract with you, or if you are a member of our plan through your former employer/union/trust group retiree plan. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) - A monthly benefit paid by Social Security to people with limited income and resources who are disabled, blind, or age 65 and older. SSI benefits are not the same as Social Security benefits. Urgently Needed Services - Covered services that are not emergency services, provided when the network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible or when the enrollee is out of the service area. For example, you may need immediate care during the weekend.
