Ayurvedic medicine began in India and combines the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge), which literally means \"the science of life.\" Many Ayurvedic therapies predate written records and were handed down by word of mouth. Practiced throughout Asia for thousands of years, Ayurveda has recently become more popular in Western culture. The basic principle of Ayurvedic medicine is to prevent and treat illness\u2014rather than respond to indicators of disease\u2014by maintaining balance in and harmony between your body, mind and environment. This is done through a personally tailored combination of healthy nutrition, daily movement, aromatherapy and herbal remedies. Ayurveda supports the revitalizing and empowering idea that we have the ability to heal ourselves. Once you realize your own potential imbalances, you can take control of your own health and start incorporating Ayurvedic therapies to feel healthier, improve your fitness and become happier and rejuvenated. Today, integrative medicine is evolving as practitioners of the many healing approaches around the world are seeking to collaborate. There are growing opportunities to blend and complement more mainstream health approaches with Ayurveda and other healing therapies. You can integrate Ayurveda into your wellness routine by seeing a doctor who practices its techniques or by visiting a spa that offers such services.

In Ayurvedic terms, every person is made up of one predominant life force, or dosha, and consists of a unique combination of all three forces: vata, pitta and kapha. Determining your dosha is a complex process that explores your personal imbalances and takes many things into consideration to help you achieve optimum health. The mission of the practice over a lifetime is to balance all three: Vata (Ether and Air) Frame: thin and lanky Skin: dry, cool, maybe rough Sleep: has a hard time falling and/or staying asleep Temperament: enthusiastic, nervous and/or jumpy Pitta (Fire and Water) Frame: average build, apple shape Skin: warm, smooth and/or oily Sleep: prefers coolness; is a deep sleeper Temperament: assertive, outgoing and/or bossy Kapha (Water and Earth) Frame: stocky; is either very tall or very short Skin: pale, moist and/or cold Sleep: pleasant, but has difficulty waking up Temperament: accommodating, pleasant but cautious "}
