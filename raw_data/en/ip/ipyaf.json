Why balancing hormones naturally is a safe, more effective solution to addressing menopausal symptoms and [achieving weight loss](https://bebalancedcenters.com/weight-loss/). Female hormone therapy, whether synthetic or bioidentical, does indeed help relieve some symptoms associated with [menopause](https://bebalancedcenters.com/blog/understanding-the-difference-between-perimenopause-and-menopause/)\u2014like hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. If it didn't, doctors wouldn't prescribe them to women who are suffering. The problem is, these methods not only come with a list of adverse side effects that range from unpleasant to life-threatening, but they also do not address the core causes of imbalanced hormones. Moreover, they fail to address symptoms that negatively impact a person's sleep, mood, energy, mental clarity, and weight. In fact, they can exacerbate many of these symptoms and are associated with serious health risks. Simply put, these methods are a band-aid solution that can cause more harm than good when balancing hormones. At BeBalanced, we use a holistic approach to solve all menopausal and PMS symptoms. Instead of replacing hormones, your body doesn't need, such as testosterone and estrogen, we work with you to ensure you are balancing hormones naturally and there are no harmful side effects. Our approach ties together nutrition, stress management, and all-natural supplementation through one-on-one guided support by our dedicated, compassionate specialists. Our method of naturally balancing hormones is revolutionary. We are changing the way women view their health, their weight, and their overall mental and physical well-being, regardless of age. How does balancing hormones naturally compare with hormonal replacement? Understanding the differences between Synthetic Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), Bio-Identical HRT, and Balancing Hormones Naturally. Synthetic Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): In the not-so-distant past, female hormone therapy was routinely used to treat menopausal symptoms and aid in weight loss. However, a major controversy arose surrounding this method of treatment after the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial ended in 2002, showing severe health risks associated with HRT. Despite a high number of medical studies and this substantial, clinical evidence showing the potential health risks associated with synthetic hormones, many doctors still prescribe them today. The risks of hormone therapy (according to the largest clinical trial to date) are: - Stroke - Blood clots - Heart attack - Breast cancer - Gallbladder disease - Vaginal bleeding - Urinary incontinence - Dementia - Breast tenderness The global index of major chronic diseases and death showed that overall harm exceeded the benefits, and yet the medical community still offers this dangerous treatment. Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): Bio-identical hormones are man-made hormones that mimic those naturally produced by the body. Most forms are compounded, or custom-made by a pharmacist based on a doctor's order. The use of compounded bioidentical female hormones is widespread in the U.S. for women going through menopause and looking for a weight loss supplement. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) reports that about 1.4 million women are using this form of treatment. That accounts for 40% of all prescriptions given to women who are in menopause. Bio-identical hormones are often advertised as being a safer, more effective, \"natural\" alternative to conventional hormone therapy. However, these claims remain unsupported by any large-scale, well-designed studies. Additionally, the ingredients are typically significantly altered in a lab, so they are no longer \"natural\" when done with processing. Moreover, bio-identical hormone therapy uses unnecessary or an excess of hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, that can contribute to a more significant imbalance for both women and men. Some common side effects include: - Weight gain - Blurred vision - Tiredness - Acne - Increased facial hair (women) - Headaches - Breast tenderness - Spotting - Cramping - Bloating - Mood swings - Indigestion Balancing Hormones Naturally - The BeBalanced Approach To explain why the BeBalanced approach is a safe, more effective, natural solution to help anyone with a hormone-related issue, we must first identify the causes that contribute to imbalanced hormone levels to have a clear understanding of [how hormones work](/blog/what-are-hormones/). What are female hormones and why do they matter? Female hormones are part of what is known as the endocrine system, a set of hormone-secreting glands within your body that deliver messages that tell your body what to do and how to function. These functions range from simple basic needs like hunger, digestion, and immune function to complex systems like reproduction, metabolism, blood sugar, and even your emotions and mood. Not only do your hormones individually deliver important messages, but they also work as a unit or a team. So, when one of them isn't delivering their specific important message, it affects everything in your body, and the results can be disastrous. How do female hormones become imbalanced in the first place? Your hormones can become imbalanced by a [variety of factors](/blog/understanding-hormone-balance-disruptors/), and although it's normal for hormone levels to decline with age, aging is not the main culprit. Unless you address the root causes of imbalanced female hormones, the symptoms will simply get more severe with age. So, if your doctor tells you that symptoms such as weight gain, mood swings, hot flashes, etc. are a side effect of getting older, we are here to provide an alternative opinion. Raising children, having a demanding career, over-exercising, not getting enough sleep, eating junk on the run, or not getting the nutrients your body needs all place a heavy toll on your body both mentally and physically and causes chaos on your hormones. Your body treats these daily stressors as a threat. When a stressful situation arises, your brain prompts your adrenal glands to produce cortisol to protect you. However, if you are under constant stress, your body will not be able to keep up with the high demand for cortisol. Your body will begin to steal the hormone progesterone and convert it to cortisol, which will set you back on your weight loss goals. Although your body is trying to protect you, this defense mechanism leaves you with an imbalance between your progesterone and estrogen levels, resulting in a condition called [estrogen dominance](/blog/estrogen-dominance-can-effect/). Balancing hormones naturally The BeBalanced approach is a much safer, more comprehensive, and more effective option for women who are dealing with symptoms of menopause or PMS or anyone who has a hormone imbalance and is dealing with issues related to their weight, mood, sleep, energy, and more. Our program involves the combination of lifestyle and dietary changes along with our proprietary, all-natural, estrogen, and testosterone-free supplementation for weight loss and alignment of female hormones. Instead of replacing hormones that have potentially dangerous side effects, we offer supplementation options that contain only the highest quality, natural ingredients to support the production of hormones and help your body achieve balance on its own. These ingredients go directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system, so they are quickly absorbed by the body. There is no chance of build-up as any excess is passed out of the body within 24 hours, like vitamins B and C. We use a proprietary blend of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) plant-based progesterone, the only hormone that has been proven safe for long-term use. Pregnenolone and DHEA are used to help your body combat stress and increase cortisol production so that your body doesn't need to steal its progesterone. Along with our specially designed relaxation program, whole-food blood sugar balancing diet, and personalized ongoing support, these ingredients make it possible for estrogen and testosterone levels to balance themselves the way your body intended. As a result, you will now be able to burn fat efficiently, your mood will stabilize, your sleep will deepen, your energy will increase, and your hot flashes, night sweats, and sexual health will improve dramatically.
