In keeping with the Medical Center's philosophy of diversity of service offerings and of commitment to community development, a School of Nursing was conceived under the auspices of the Ladies' Aid Society in 1891. Growth in enrollment from the first year's admission of six students to a student body of close to 600 students in the nursing courses in 2020 attests to the community's recognition of the maintenance of high -quality standards of education over the past century. Since 1947, the School has enjoyed an educationally advantageous association with Union College. The association has enhanced the School's ability to keep abreast of educational and scientific advancements and has strengthened the students' base of knowledge and intellectual skills. This articulation stems from a philosophy that the school must prepare a nursing p rof ession al who can meet the demand for quality nursing care of clients and their families. On January 1, 2022, Trinitas Regional Medical Center was integrated into RWJ Barnabas Health, the largest academic healthcare system in New Jersey. Trinitas School of Nursing/RWJBarnabas Health is now part of this system. 8 Mission Trinitas School of Nursing /RWJBarnabas Health is committed to providing and sustaining an excellen t nursing education program for a diverse student population representative of the community we serve. Philosophy of the School of Nursing The faculty of the Trinitas School of Nursing is committed to providing a high -quality nursing education program to a diverse population representative of the community it serves. The school is a part of this community, and the faculty believes that it has a responsibility to be aware of and responsive to the health needs of its members. The faculty and students interact with members of the community to assist them in meeting identified health needs. Recognizing the challenges that result from continual changes in the structure and delivery of healthcare; the varying complexities of health conditio ns; the variety of healthcare settings; and the explosion of health information and technology , the School is fortified by a culture of integrity and excellence in its commitment to educate students who will be prepared to face these challenges with a spirit of fairness, justice, community service, social responsibility for others, and the courage to be innovative. The faculty believes that human beings are complex, rational, spiritual beings. Inherent in the human condition is one's right to dignity an d value in every stage and condition of life. Human beings have created complex social systems in which they interact with each other to protect, nurture, and educate their members. Human beings exist, with varying degrees of independence, in many contexts as members of families, communities and society. Individuals are capable of using their intellects to take deliberate actions directed toward maintaining life, health and wellbeing of self, society and their environment. Human beings are accountable for t heir actions. Health is a dynamic state that is influenced by an individual's reciprocal interaction with the environment. Individuals possess their own personal cultural definition of health that may differ from the beliefs of the people with whom they come in contact. Further, it is the faculty's belief that access to health care is a basic right of all individuals. Nursing is an art and a science characterized by interpersonal, therapeutic, and evaluative processes. It is based on a body of nursing knowledge and research which m akes use of natural and behavioral sciences. An essential element of nursing practice is caring. Nursing's goal is to collaborate with the client and family, assisting them in the acquisition of knowledge and abilities necessary to achieve the highest possible level of health. Using critical thinking and clinical judgment , the nurse assesses, analyzes, diagnoses, and treat s commonly occurring human responses to actual and potential health problems, providing a holistic response to the complex health needs of human beings. The nurse engages in collaborative relationships with members of the healthcare team to provide the range of professional nursing services that the client, family , and groups may require. The nurse res pects and interacts with a diverse 9 population in a variety of settings within the community. Teaching/learning is an interactional lifelong process. During the learning process, students integrate new and previously held knowledge and beliefs to form ins ights and ideas that empower them to think critically and make clinical decisions that are appropriate to the situation. Reflecting the belief that students learn differently, the faculty guides the student to utilize a variety of learning strategies and r esources to facilitate the student's learning. Learning is a self -directed activity with faculty members functioning as facilitators joining with the students in the reciprocal learning process. Students come to the School of Nursing with diverse backgr ounds and differing strengths and experiences. The school recognizes this diversity and therefore, provides opportunities to the qualified student to navigate the educational environment to maximize their individual potential well beyond their entry -level program. It is the responsibility of the school to provide an environment in which the student may successfully acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to practice as a safe and effective entry level registered nurse. The graduate of the school is prepared to assume the role of a safe, caring, ethical beginning graduate nurse with varying amounts of supervision. The graduate is capable of practicing within a variety of setti ngs. It is the responsibility of the graduate to continue the learning process to maintain competency or to advance to another level of practice. Graduates are responsible for being aware of and responsive to population -focused health care as well as makin g meaningful contributions to the profession of nursing and society. Trinitas School of Nursing Goals The school will: 1. Provide educational access to a diverse, qualified student population that is representative of the community. 2. Graduate an entry level nurse who can practice in a variety of health care settings. 3. Produce a graduate who is successful in passing the NCLEX -RN examination on the first attempt. 4.

It is important for students who plan to study nursing know the licensure requirements which include the following: There are three elements that are required for licensure as a registered nurse in New Jersey: 1. Graduations from an approved school of professional nursing 2. Criminal history background check clearance 3. Pass the NCLEX -RN licensing examination In addition, the official application for professional nurse licensure by examination requires that applicants provide information or answer the following questions. The graduate will be required to submit : 1. Completed application 2. Color headshot photo 3. Birth Certificate or Passport 22 4. Valid NJ Driver's License 5. Marriage Certificate or Divorce decree if applicable 6. Letter of Completion from NJ School 7. Degree Awarded Transcript if the school is out of state 8. Complete the fingerprint process/ background check if they already hold a license with the Division 9. If an applicant has a criminal history or have been arrested, the applicant must upload all documents pertaining to that case. Thus, before beginning a nursing education program, applicants must consider whether there is any legal reason why they might not be qualified for licensure. A criminal background check is required for all new licenses . The state Board of Nursing has the authority to deny licensure if the applicant has a criminal record. The Board of Nursing for each state decides on an individual case basis at the time of application for licensure. Applicants should consider their current lifestyle and personal history before embarking on a course of study to ensure that, even though successful in completing the nursing program, they may be ineligible for licensure. Questions and concerns regarding these requirements may be discussed in confidence with the NJ Board of Nu rsing Executive Director . Applicants may, if they prefer, call anonymously to discuss their situation with the Executive Director. The full application and detailed information can be found at https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/nur/Pages/applications.aspx Licensure Exam (NCLEX -RN) Requirement To receive licensure as a Registered Professional Nurse (RN), all graduates of a nursing education program must successfully pass the National Council Licensure Exam (NCLEX -RN). The NCLEX is developed to measure the minimum knowledge, skills, and abilities required to deliver safe, effective nursing care at the entry level. The exam is written and administered by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) . NCSBN is a not -for-profit organization whose members include the boards of nursing in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. territories. NCSBN is the vehicle through which boards of nursing act and counsel together to provide regulatory excellence for public health, safety, and welfare. The goal is to test within 2 -3 months of nursing program completion and pass the NCLEX -RN on the first attempt of taking the exam. To prepare for the exam, each new professional phase student will have access to a copy of the 20 23 NCLEX -RN Test Plan\u00ae on the school website and the Learni ng 23 Management System, CANVAS . The test plan, which will be effective on April 1, 2023, is available on the school website. Students should keep track of concepts learned in each nursing course throughout the curriculum, as they are congruent with the NCLEX -RN Test Plan. The NCLEX -RN Test Plan\u00ae provides a concise summary of the content and scope of the licensing examination. It serves as a guide for examination development, as well as candidate preparation. Each NCLEX -RN\u00ae examination is based on t he test plan. The NCLEX examination assesses the knowledge, skills and abilities that are essential for the nurse to use to meet the needs of patients requiring the promotion, maintenance, or restoration of health. The NCLEX -RN Test Plan\u00ae outlines beliefs about people and nursing that are integral to the examination . Further information on the NCLEX -RN and licensure can be found at www.ncsbn.org .

A minimum grade of C is required to obtain transfer credit to Union College . 4. Students' academic standing at Union College is based upon their performance in all courses expressed in terms o f the \"academic average\" they achieve. In computing this average, the following numerical values are assigned to each letter grade. 5. Instructors enter final grades online. Students must go to webservices.ucc.edu to view or print their final course grades. Instructors are not permitted to post grades by social security numbers. No information regarding grades will be offered over the phone. How to calculate Grade Point Average (GPA) and Quality Points Source: Union College, Catalog Average Computation of the cumulative grade po int average of a student's performance in all cou rses is accomplished by multiplying the assigned numerical value of each letter grade by the number of credit hours that the course requires Quality Points Numerical quality points are then determined by multiplying the above values by the number of credit hours which the course carries. For example, a three -credit hour course in which the student receives a B represents 9 quality points earned. Academic average is determined by dividin g the total number of quality points earned by the total number of credits taken, whether passed or failed. The following table is an illustration of this computation: 28 Grade & Quality Numerical Points Course Credits Value Quality Points Per Course HIS 101 3 C (2) 6 PSY 101 3 B (3) 9 BIO 111 4 D (1) 4 FRE 101 3 A (4) 12 ENG 101 3 B+ (3.5) 10.5 CST 101 3 F (0) 0 19 41.5 Total credits taken = 19 Total quality points earned 41.5; 41.5 divided by 19 = 2.18 GPA Graduation Requirements Eligibility for the Diploma in Nursing and the Associate in Science Degree rests upon the successful completion of the specific nursing program track , a cumulative average of 2.5 or higher and satisfactory completion of all required general education and science courses per the curriculum track.
