Still, it's one of those things we take for granted until it's no longer effective. As more people are seeking chiropractic care not only for pain in the spine and neck, they're discovering one of its big benefits - a robust immune system. Here's how chiropractic helps the immune system. The Immune System Connection The immune system's role in to protect the body against infectious organisms - it's our main line of defense. To stay strong and healthy, the immune system is heavily dependent on lifestyle. Things like quality and quantity of sleep, nutrition, exercise, posture, and an aligned spine can all play a role on our immune systems. The spine is strongly connected to the nervous system, which works with the immune system so the the body can successfully adapt to a variety of conditions and heal as needed. When the spine is out of alignment, the result can be neural dysfunctions that are stressful to the body. They also have an impact to the immune system. Restoring proper alignment and mobility to the body doesn't just make us feel better, it creates optimal communication within the body. Picture the spine as a stack of Legos. A healthy, aligned spine would have the blocks lightly stacked. The blocks representing an unhealthy spine would be stacked together as tightly and stiffly as possible. It's this inflexibility and rigid alignment that can make the body susceptible to illness. We know that inflammatory-based disease is affected by different systems in the body, with nerve stimulation directly influencing the growth and function of inflammatory cells. The nervous system coordinates and controls every system in the body. When it can't function properly, neither can anything else. It's a ripple effect that ultimately makes us susceptible to bacteria, viruses, and the kinds of illnesses we could normally be able to avoid. That's why preventative chiropractic is so beneficial. By keeping the spine functioning at its best, the body's various systems are able to to their jobs properly. And that includes the immune system. Studies show that white blood cells increase significantly within minutes of a chiropractic adjustment. Staying Healthy In addition to regular chiropractic care, there are other ways to help maintain a strong immune system. Vitamin D, or the sunshine vitamin, plays a big role in healthy immunity. Here in Reno and Sparks, we've been enjoying beautiful fall weather with plenty of sunshine. But as days continue to shorten, it gets harder to receive the daily minimum of 15 minutes on 40 percent of the body. D3 supplements can be a good alternative. Vitamin C is another important supplement. Citrus fruits are a good choice, but be sure to balance acidity with alkaline vegetables. A minimum of seven hours of sleep nightly is another way to stay healthy. Our bodies heal when we sleep, and there is no substitute. Make sure your body is getting the rest it needs to stay strong and healthy. Dr. Lynelle McSweeney offers holistic chiropractic care to patients here in Reno.
