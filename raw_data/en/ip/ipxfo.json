If you come away from this book with only one message, I hope you come to understand that you can be gentle with yourself as you move through the complex stages of grieving. With better understanding of the grief process, and learning the tools and skills you will learn in this WHEE BOOK, you will find you are able to markedly lessen your pain and suffering, or those of people under your care, as you move through the grief process. WHEE: Whole Health - Easily and Effectively AKA Wholistic Hybrid derived from EMDR and EFT WHEE is a self-treatment method that is extremely simple to learn and to use, yet very rapidly and deeply effective. Within minutes it can reduce physical and psychological pains, even when these have been present for decades. WHEE is completely individualized to the preferences and needs of those who use it. No part of WHEE is a requirement. Every aspect of WHEE is but a suggestion - for people to explore and use, as and if it feels right and comfortable to do so. WHEE addresses spirit, relationships (with other people and the rest of the world), mind, emotions and body (as matter and energy).
