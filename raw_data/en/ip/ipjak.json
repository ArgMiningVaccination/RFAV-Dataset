She and her husband are at their wits' end. Laura has struggled with obesity and gallbladder issues, leaving gaps in her diet that make it hard, as she sees it, to get the right nutritional balance her body needs. One day, she was discussing her health and infertility issues with her friend Marcy. Marcy, while holding her third newborn son in her arms, suggested trying herbal supplements to help clear her body. Marcy then elaborated how she has been using blessed thistle to help increase her breast milk supply for her new son. Marcy suggests Laura should try the supplement as well. According to the World Health Organization, traditional medicine is ''the sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures... used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.'' From the origins of traditional medicine come herbal medicines. Herbal medicines contain active plants or plant parts in order to make medicines that have been widely used for centuries. Many cultures still believe in their uses and may use herbal medicines instead of Western medications or as a supplement to Western medications. Herbal supplements have gained much notoriety over the last few decades despite being around for many, many years. Their widespread use to provide therapy for both common and uncommon ailments has created a lot of controversies here in the United States. Since these types of remedies are not monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the dosage, side effects, and other important information is not tested. When mixed with other medications, herbal and Western, the combinations can be potentially dangerous. This makes many people skeptical, including some physicians and nurses. However, the use of herbal supplements incorporated into diet and exercise are thought to be a more organic and holistic approach to health, and many people see that as a plus in today's world of overprocessed food. Let's take a look at two major herbal supplements: milk thistle and blessed thistle. Milk Thistle Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is an herb that is used for a variety of liver ailments and gallbladder disorders, including: - Liver cirrhosis - Type 2 diabetes - Diabetic neuropathy - Chronic liver diseases Some research has also linked milk thistle to help with infertility issues, cancer, and nasal allergies and even help improve the flow of breast milk in nursing mothers. Milk thistle is believed to exert a special chemical that helps protect the liver, preventing damage. It also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Blessed Thistle Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus) works to stimulate gastric juices, saliva, and bile flow, which aid in increasing digestion. Many people take blessed thistle in the form of a tea in order to improve appetite, reduce diarrhea, and eliminate indigestion. It is also commonly used to promote breast milk secretion for newly lactating mothers. However, there is limited research that supports that it actually stimulates lactation. It is believed to also have anti-inflammatory properties similar to milk thistle. Lesson Summary In summary, blessed thistle and milk thistle, although similar sounding, have different herbal properties targeted at helping different areas of the body. Herbal medicines contain active plants or plant parts in order to make medicines that have been widely used for centuries. Milk thistle is believed to help with liver, kidney, and gallbladder issues by reducing inflammation. It has also been linked to improving breast milk flow in new mothers. Meanwhile, blessed thistle targets gastric issues such as diarrhea, indigestion, and decreased appetite. It works by stimulating gastric juice production in the stomach and saliva glands located in the mouth as well as aiding in bile flow. It has also been used to stimulate breast milk flow; however, little research exists to support these claims.
