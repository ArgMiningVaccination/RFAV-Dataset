Acupuncture Acupuncture is where thin needles are placed in strategic points on the body to balance the energy (or qi) of the body. Acupuncture alleviates pain, decreases stress, increases energy, balances digestion, aids sleep, and much more. Herbs Herbs are used to prevent, treat, and reverse illness. Taking herbs 1 to 3 times daily will extend your acupuncture treatment and act as multiple treatments over a longer period of time. Chinese herbal medicine is a major part of Traditional Chinese Medicine. It has been used for centuries in China, where herbs are considered fundamental therapy for many acute and chronic conditions. _________________________________________________________________ Reiki Sessions Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing that reduces stress, anxiety, and so much more. Many people have referred to Reiki as a \"laying on of hands\", though touch is actually unnecessary. Reiki can be done over long distances as well since it does not require physical touch (though light touch is commonly incorporated). Reiki is comprised of two Japanese words, \"Rei\" and \"Ki\". While an exact translation is difficult, many describe \"Rei\" as divine wisdom, divine guidance, divine direction, divine knowing and \"Ki\" as the universal life force energy, the loving, unseen energy that surrounds and permeates everything living and non-living. Together they form the foundation of a healing practice which taps into this higher wisdom to channel energy through the practitioner to release blockages and heal dis-eases. This healing takes place on a mental, physical or spiritual level (often all three). However, the best way to understand Reiki is simply to experience it for yourself!

These points contain all the thoughts, ideas, beliefs, emotions, and considerations that you have stored in any lifetime. This is an opportunity for you to let go of everything! Each Access Bars\u00ae session can release 5-10 thousand years of limitations in the area of your life that corresponds with the specific Bar being touched. This is an incredibly nurturing and relaxing process, undoing limitation in all aspects of your life that you are willing to change. How much of your life do you spend doing rather than receiving? Have you noticed that your life is not yet what you would like it to be? You could have everything you desire (and even greater!) if you are willing to receive lots more and maybe do a little less! Receiving The Bars\u00ae will allow this to begin to show up for you. Access Bars\u00ae has assisted thousands of people to change many aspects of their body and their life including sleep, health and weight, money, sex and relationships, anxiety, stress and so much more. At worst you will feel like you have just had a phenomenal massage. At best your whole life can change into something greater with total ease _________________________________________________________________________ Distance Reiki Sessions Reiki also works at a distance!
