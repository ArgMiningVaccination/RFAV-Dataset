THEINDONESIAN PAPERS III.A.Introduction Owing tolate made to theSurvey Team from abroad byIndonesian specialists in standardization andmeasurement services. These papers served asan excellent base point ofdeparture fortheSurvey members. Theywere ideal foracquainting teammembers with and they started ameeting some ofwhich were voiced before they hadthe more detailed knowledge oftheIndonesian situation developed during theitineraries activities inIndonesia have actually been conducted since before World War II. During that period soine regulations concerning standardization were enacted. Itwasduetothegrowth of development thatpeople paid more attention tomatters relating to standardization. In1960 itwasfelt that regulations on standardization enacted before World V7arIIwere nolonger fitting since conditions hadchanged. Efforts have been made toissue new regulations onstandardization. Since REPELITA II(the Second Five Year Plan) standardization activities have received more emphasis and efforts havebeenmade todevelop anational system on standardization. Activities conducted include especially andproblems, this paper will give abrief explanation ofthe andprojects inrelation tothe andothers vrhich were fitting. This hasstimulated ActNo,10,1961, only beenacted, inaccord with advice given bytheCommittee on Goods, Asamatter offact this Committee hasnever been established, noregulations enacted under theaforesaid Actwith theexception ofoneregulation, i.e.. Government Regulation No. 9,1964, Regulation Gazette 1935, No,161). This 1961 Actstipulates among other things that allregulations implemented under thePackaging Ordinance will still bevalid under this provision, regulations originating frombefore theproclamation of independence arestill valid. Although nobasic lawexists regulating standardization, standardization activities arestill conducted byseveral departments tomeet their specific needs. Standardization efforts gained anew horizon with theenactment ofPresidential Decree No.45,1973. According lawasthelegal basis fornational standardization. c.STANDARDIZATION ACTIVITIES During thepast five years, standardization activities have taken considerable strides forward, both ingovernment andprivate circles. This islargely attributable totherapid growth oftechnology and Itisnowrecognized that theapplication of standardization principles leads tobenefits tobegained from their implementation. These benefits arenotonly limited allbranches ofman's socio-economic activities, encompassing also agriculture, management, etc. Another factor that hasbeen responsible forthegrowth ofstandardization activities inIndonesia departments andagencies arenowsetting their own standards tomeet their specific needs. Arecent study identified some 104bodies involved instandardization activities. However, the majority ofthese areonly ofminor importance duetothefact that there isafragmented approach with Standards Body to foundation without adequate funds andsince ithas practically noauthority. isconfused bya anddefinitions, andby conflicting regulations and aremore andmore becoming an indispensable instrument ofgovernment forwhich theywere intended. Even though most standards areformulated after prior consultation with allparties concerned, this does notnecessarily mean their full implementation. There isaneed foradeliberate effort toensure their proper all- round implementation inthevarious relevant sectors oftheeconomy. Thegovernment plays animportant role insecuring implementation standards, as well asanorganized consumer andcontroller ofanappreciable proportion oftheindustrial production capacity. Since the government ofIndonesia controls certain basic industries, such as petroleum, steel, andmining, andcertain public utility services such asrailways, land, seaandairtransnortation, post andtele- communications, electric power, water supply, medical services, and supply ofthe'main food items, therole ofthegovernment asa standards implementing authority important. Thenotion ofgovernment inthecontext ofstandards implementation includes allgovernmental i.e., and municipalities, which areorganized inonesystem. 'Thepolicy, particularly theinterests general public canbeproperly taken into consideration, and 28 interwoven with thegovernment's interest. Standardization activities asasystem aredirectly interrelated with andinfluenced byother systems: i.e., science andtechnology, educational, political, national andthelegal system, allofwhich are sub-systems when looked atfrom thenational standpoint. asshown infigure 1. Thecharacter ofthelegal system asindicated amply istobe outeffectively. where national aremandatory, thepublic manner asanyother isavoluntary instrument, attention should bepaid tothelegal aspects oftheimplementation of standards. Ithasbeen recognized that even inthese countries ithas become necessary inthepublic interest legally toenforce some of 29 these standards incertain sectors oftheeconomy. Thedecision to enforce certain standards under control inthis context include thefollowing: accidents. control ofquality, andpreshipment inspection ofexport goods. Thelegal problems that arise this should betaken into consideration.

(4) Thebasic law, however, should beflexible enough sothat itcan still accommodate future changes needed instandards orinthe mechanism itself. (5)Existing regulations andexisting infrastructure cannot betotally ignored. Therefore, itisadvisable that this basic lawbe formulated asaconcerted standardization. TEAM Thevisiting teammembers were most grateful forthis paper which contributed much totheir understanding. They concurred with the conclusions (seeSection dabove) andwere impressed bythepersuasive emphasis onthedifficulties that to appoint theCommittee onGoods under theprovisions oftheActon Goods, 1961, This paper wasfurther discussed between teammembers throughout the Survey andalimited consensus Abasic lawwas that theestablishment andthat standards must adaptable tochange than thebasic law. Contrary totheimpression given bytheauthors, some teammembers felt that standards developing organizations in Indonesia wasnotnecessarily anexcessive number. Theexperience of other countries showed thatregulation buyers andsellers, importers and exporters. Theself-interests ofallaresoclearly served bysome standards that regulatory control issometimes aminor issue. Technical advice inconjunction with standardization because ofthe scarcity ofthediverse specialist knowledge involved does have tobe centralized inarapidly developing economy. Linking that technical service intheeyes ofmanufacturers andother governmental departments with legal enforcement isliable operated byanational toemphasize thetechnical service for standards, nottheir regulatory enforcement which other departments regard astheir prerogative. 33 III.B.l.

Although consumer groups andmanufacturers' associations areconsulted during food standards development, they arenotrepresented onthe committee assigned tostandards development. Despite thefact that quality practices, aswell asgoodmanufacturing practices regulations, were notaddressed inthepaper, alater discussion areconsidered. Thediscussion intheconstruction industry have long been needed, because ofthetechnical problems connected with anykind ofplanning orimplementation standards areofforeign origin. Itisdifficult tosayhowmany standards exist andfrom what countries they originate. Every expert, whether architect orconstructor, uses foreign standards which heisacquainted with andwhich areeasily applicable. tousethestandards inthelanguages he masters andthose the information needed isnotavailable andstandards have tobeadapted toavailable building material.

Moreover, individuals whodevelop standards usually lack therequired background; that iswhystandards lack specificity. Also, there is little understanding ofthebuilding process andtheuseofbuilding regiilations. Perhaps iftheorganizational structure, charter, astheAmerican National Standards Institute ortheAmerican Society forTesting and Materials were studied, Indonesia might pattern their standards development process after those. Discussions with officials from these groups aretoberecommended. Theproblem undertakes effort atdeveloping andenforcing comprehensive building standards. Abuilding constructed tominimum accepted standards will last longer andwill besafer, with little if anyextra cost.

Mr.Djaprie recommends aplan fordeveloping construction industry standards forimproving building products andsystems. Heidentifies technical committees onservices, building, Thecommittees would report toaDivision Council. Thepurpose oftheDivision Council is somewhat unclear. TheCouncil should report directly toan organization serving asthenational leader forbuilding regulations. Also, atechnical committee onenvironmental design loads tocover seismic, flood, volcanic, andother natural hazards should beincluded asasixth committee reporting totheDivision Council. This committee should have thegoal ofdeveloping geophysical standards to reduce property damages andloss oflifeduetoextreme environmental conditions. Adiscussion about theresearch aspects associated with developing standards would have been appreciated inMr.Djaprie's paper. Ina related paper, \"Standardization andConsumer Protection inIndonesia,\" EmaWitoelar oftheIndonesian Consumers Organization suggests that existing standards arenotwidely known. Inseveral cases there are many different standards governing thesame product. Lack ofa governmental focal point makes itdifficult tocentralize all standards forreview, analysis, andimplementation, andeventually to into amodel code. public knowledge ofproduct quality. andthehigh oflow-income families contribute toalack ofknowledge about standards. Several oftheother papers also reveal that government agencies are ineffective inenforcing standards andcodes because there istoo little communication between them. 72 i III.D.l.

Unfortunately, during theSecond World War, theabove organizations became inBandung, which wasattended by various representatives from textile producers, consumers, and government institutions.

However, while lawanditsenforcement arenotenough, their necessity iswell established. Theoutdated laws enacted between 1920-19A0 which arenowstill ineffect cannot fully accomplish their important purpose. 40years old, andthey have failed tokeep pacewith conditions. The development ofthefactory system brought with itcomplex and potentially dangerous machinery, nottomention acrowded and frequently unsafe working environment. Theoriginal safety lawswere drawn upinrather broad andgeneral terms. This left ituptotheindividual factory safety inspector to make thefinal determination astowhether it,Awidevariation enforcement ofsafety standards naturally resulted. Moreover, the orders ofsafety inspectors were sometimes sharply challenged by industrial executives onthegrounds that thestatutes didnotcall forsuch action. Very clearly ofathorough overhaul. Thenew lawswhich were also drawn andgeneral terms (e.g.. Act No, 1of1970) needed support byspecific regulations containing details necessary fortheadequate coverage ofthediversity ofthe many industrial undertakings. Ifareviewed safety value, it isjust asnecessary that itsprovisions represent aconsensus from among those interested, asitisthat there beagenerally recognized need forit.Acommittee forasafety standard, therefore, must 95 include abalanced representation ofthose concerned.

Individual andgroups of safety standards suffer obsolescence. Where they arekept beyond their time, confusion, cost, anddanger canresult. Conflicting requirements cause inconvenience andunnecessary loss inthe manufacture, distribution, anduseofsafety apparatus. This in itself demonstrates theneed foruniform national safety standards.

Thevisiting regretted that industries inIndonesia, especially bythose which with foreign companies. Since Indonesia does nothave its ownstandards system yet, industries useforeign standards fortheir which isordering thecommodity. In this way, standards andstandardization systems from foreign countries such astheUnited States (SAE, ASTM, API),theNetherlands (NEN), Germany (DIN), Japan (JIS), andother countries have been introduced into Indonesia. Difficulties mayarise, however, when thecustomer inordering does notspecify anystandard. When standard asfaraspossible. But andequipment donotallow start tomodify theintended standards. This situation isworse forsmall, home industries which producing non-standard products. (2)Government Enforcement onStandards Ashasbeenmentioned above, theworking standards inIndonesia are foreign standards. Many standards concerned with public needs and safety areenforced bythegovernment through government regulations. Since Indonesia does notyethave anational standards system, the basis fortheenforcement isstill aproblem. Many standards which have been tomeetmodern technology.

Unfortunately, there is still alack ofcoordination andinformation among those departmental sections which situation canbe considered asadrawback inthegovernment's attempt atstandardi- zation, which hinders anystandardization activity.

Inthejudgment ofthe NBS/AID team, toreach itsdevelopment goals Indonesia needs instandardization Without this, forexample, theambitions toproduce inIndonesia all sanitary handling offoods, thevitality oftheIndonesian people will beunnecessarily drained. Without effective building codes, shelter forthepeople will remain sources ofunnecessary danger. Without export inspection, many billions ofrupiahs peryear will continue tobelost through Indonesian products being denied entry into thecountries that haddepended upon Indonesia tosupply to aspecification. Without metrological expertise, Indonesia cannot defend itsgoods whose quality hasbeen unreasonably challenged or determine implication oftheProbine Report (seealso section II)that Indonesia nowneeds inmetrology. However, wetake no position onthesuggestion that acentral national standards body should begiven theprincipal responsibility fororganizing and delivering most ofthese services andforassuming associated functions such astesting ofproducts, disseminating technical information, etc. Certainly thiswould beonewayoforganizing the standardization andmetrology systems. Several countries have chosen such systems; very fewareconsidered tobetotally successful. This point forsuch systems. bestrongly onlywith 237 acomparison ofthestandardization the financial system ofacountry. There will probably beacabinet level focal point fornational financial policy, serving public andprivate sectors. Theministry, however, will notgive financial services to every organization.

Iffinancial specialists fail employers, theentire organizations canfail. bemade ofthegovernment's role theenvironment, and other systems. Most ofthese systems have avoice athigh level in Government andother organizations, butnotallgovernments choose to put, say, allaspects ofelectrical power into asingle ministry.

Thequality control (standards) specialist isfamiliar with spectrogranhic reference mechanical, tests. areneglected, loaned from thenational transportation body? Sometimes, perhaps probably no. andmetrology? they Itistrue, however, that allcountries that have done well indevelopment have strong standards organizations. Wefind frequently that inthemost successful companies, thehighest quality control specialist reports only tothehighest executive official of that company. Wealso find thatmany companies have failed forlack ofgood technical control. However, anyorganization could succeed by different management procedures. Theadvantage that astandards specialist andametrologist brings to anorganization lies inthebroad applicability ofstandardization and measurement principles, enabling these fields tobeapplied inmost 238 disciplines. Besides, areasa openly available. Perhaps most important, theprinciple of consensus andcompromise, which isanessential element ofthe standardization process, thecharacteristic outlook ofthe Indonesian people. IfIndonesia decides against anear cabinet level focal point for standardization, andchooses ahighly decentralized system such asis found intheUnited States, good coordination isessential. We improved results. speech, theforeign team included experts in thefield ofstandardization from burden of planning forithadbeen andMetrology). wasmuch appreciated andisgenerously acknowledged byallteammembers. Nevertheless, itisthefeeling of theteam that their work could have been evenmore effective if greater effort hadbeen given todetailed planning andtoexplanations ofthesurvey visits. Serious omissions were attim.es impossible tocorrect inanalready overloaded program, deletions from which would have offended people whohadalready planned toreceive thevisitors. This COMI'IENTARY drugs, and that thehighest establish, authorize, andsupport Their papers should beread carefully by allconcerned. These programs only await thefullauthorization andexperience group, standardization system should bepatterned tobeconsistent with thegovernmental and economic realities ofIndonesia. Although theavailable expert technical personnel appear tobefully capable, they seem seriously insufficient innumber. Abetter coordinated andflexible program with specific assignments will surely render theexpenditures for technological expertise more effective. Wehave observed that present costs result inpart from overlapping andduplicative efforts. Astudy ofthehistory ofstandardization inIndonesia reveals that it isreceiving increasing emphasis through some Presidential, legislative, andministerial support. However, weunderstand that this ofits o^mdomestic industries. Such increase andeconomic well-being ofallitscitizens. V,B,2, Benefits ofStandards accelerate attainment ofthegoals andneeds ofIndonesia, A fragmented program with little coordination, such aswefind in Indonesia now,wherein anumber ofdepartments operate under different actual orassumed legal authorities, canonly delay Indonesia from the assured goal ofproperly serving itscitizens andfrom taking its proper place intheinternational advances therapid ofgovernment policies thenecessary andcosmetics, canbereduced when tool standards foraninterchangeability ofparts capability thereby providing savings inmany ways. Forexample, savings result from reduced annual purchase costs, reduced storage andadministration costs, and reduced costs forthetraining improves, conserving hard currency andimproving places emphasis onstandardization programs. k.Government regulatory efforts become more efficient andare standards forthesame product increases misunderstandings anddisagreements concerning quality andidentity requirements, thereby causing disputes and frustration among producers, users, andgovernment officials. This is especially soinaneconomy containing amixofsophisticated manufacturers andless sophisticated home industries andinthe absence standards system. Further, theabsence ofa clear-cut authority toestablish andimplement standards inhibits and sometimes makes useless inspection program. Onesolution vTith which wewould agree isbased totheGovernment through ofState 1974, particularly initslegal aspects. However, itseems tohave moved more slowly than anticipated andissaid tobemeeting resistance from some quarters. Werecommend that this study beexpedited sothat a basic lawonstandardization with widespread consensus canbe recommended legislative process. Theenactment of such alawwould assume itsrightfully desired place inthecommunity oftrading nations. Anational standardization program centrally coordinated can function farbetter with full legal authorization. Itneed setout onlyvery ofestablishing Theother extreme alternative istoenact a inefficient. tothecoordination andcontrol of anational standardization body, canbest react expeditiously to changing needs andchanging technology. Thelawcould require the national standardization body tomake assignments forstandardization inspecific toministries orinstitutes having andimplement particular standards. Further, itcould require that allwith interest shall be invited toparticipate andfunds tosupport afullstandardization 243 program. Thenecessary provisions would include administrative support totheministry assigned aparticular standards project. Funds andgeneral authorization domestic needs. Thelaw should also contain authority forexchanges ofinformation among number ofbasic industries providing goods, public utilities, andservices, would itself benefit directly from standardization ofsuch goods andservices. Asstated below, astandards program must consider both mandatory and voluntary types. Therefore, theauthority ofgovernment toenforce themandatory ofa!?ational Standards atleast twobasic component beresponsible forproviding administrative, financial, secretarial, andother supporting services. Thecomponent responsible forplanning, programming, coordinating, and adoption ofnational standards must have broad representation. I'ith such representation, Indonesia will beassured that thestandards established would result from anational consensus. Thenational standards body responsible thestandards could specialized knowledge asector oftheeconomy should beassigned totheministry or institute selected foraparticular standard project. Specialist groups could beestablished asnecessary, practical, andinaccordance with priorities established bythenational standards body in consolation with theministry orinstitute concerned. Each specialist group should berepresentative ofthevarious bodies with relevant interests andcould berequired standards body. would also beresponsible forestablishing policy, publicizing maintenance overall functions ofageneral nature. Theadministrative component ofthenational standards body would provide administrative support toeach specialized group aswell asto thecentral planning, andimplementation with theidea ofanational standards body, assigned toaneutral and established bylaw, ispredicated ontheprovision thatvarious ministries orpractices where serious abuses arefound might also be assigned high priorities. Further, priority assignments T-rLthin any grouping should consider cost/benefit analyses. Oneshould byimproving thevalue ofdomestically canbeassigned arelatively high system, all sectors ofIndonesia should become involved andfully participate. Participants should bedrawn frommanufacturers, government (including 245 allministries andconstituent units), the lej\u00bbal community (both government andnongovernment), distributors, technical andscientific associations, consultants (both domestic andforeign), library specialists, retailers ofgoods andservices, consumers, educational institutions, andfrom groups primary responsibility forregulatory product orservice, availability oftechnical personnel, Other ministries orinstitutes, consumer representatives, manufacturer representatives, educational and research bodies, andothers with interest andinaposition toprovide expert advice should responsibility forassuring that thesubordinate unit obtains full and necessary participation from, allsectors willing andcapable. Necessary studies would beperformed atthis lower level. They should consist of,among capabilities; standardization program also requires thesetting ofreliable target dates, milestones, time frames, coordination points, assigned responsibilities, etc. Thecentral body inconsultation with ministerial authorities might study thelevel ofcapability industries, determine their enforcement would bereasonable, helpful, and meaningful. 246 Thecentral body should ensure that thestandards established notonly consider butaredynamic. Itshould ensure areinstruments atboth and levels andthat they protect distributing, retailing, andservicing community. Theimplementation ofstandards, including inspection, testing, sampling, quality assurance, certification, labeling, coding, enforcement, etc., arefunctions which canbest beperformed by separate ministries, certified andlicensed individuals orcompanies. Thecentral planning andprogramming component could directly orin consultation withministries call upon theservices ofothers where to dosowould reduce thecosts, provide foruseofthebest andreduce time requirements. Itisimportant that training andeducation inallaspects of standards development andimplementation should becentrally coordinated Acentral information bank should also beestablished andmaintained bythenational coordination authority with links toother similar centers abroad. Someother countries maintain that aprivate body isunsuitable for coordinating, isimportant forall countries, especially Noncoord inatedStandards have identified some 104bodies inIndonesia involved instandardization activities. Obviously in this situation, oneneeds excellent coordination. However, wefound a number ofinconsistent standards, ofimplementation. Insome instances, forcertain food bytheMinistry ofTrade, theMinistry of andtheMinistry duplicative andsometimes incompatible. instances, theywere significantly different applied toproducts designated forexport, import, ordomestic Further, insome instances, those established forthepurpose develonment ofan industry vary from those designed will be strengthened ifbacked byanational standards body, andthecountry will benefit from auniform standards program espoused byasingle voice. Inanystandardization forum, these benefits lead to significant advantages. Forexample, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand oftheASEAxI countries, byhaving anational standardization system, seem principles ofquality where needed Education and assistance, both technical andfinancial, available more efficiently. With anational coordinating body, thetransfer oftechnology relating tostandardization could bebetter managed. This seems technologists scientists andinaccordance reasonable priorities. V.B.8. Voluntary Versus Standards Through theyears many have debated theadvantages anddisadvantages ofvoluntary versus mandatory standards. Each country must decide for itself what istheproper mixforitsownuse. Ageneral rule to pursue would bethat those toprotect the health andsafety currency isnotwasted because ofthelack ofspecific rules. Also, forthose domestic products wherein major quality defects arenot recognizable until after purchase anduseandwhich result inserious economic loss toconsumers, mandatory standards could beofbenefit. However, each ofthese would beofalower priority forestablishment andenforcement than those affecting health andsafety. Most importantly, mandatory standards must beestablished andenforced by government. Voluntary standards need notbeestablished andimplemented by government. However, government should notbeexcluded from tofunction inthis area. Voluntary standards maybeestablished byassociations ofmanufacturers, academic institutes, etc. Voluntary standards are, forthemost part, applicable tothose products andservices which arenothazards to andsafety. That is,they aregenerally ofaneconomic nature. of theconsumer andnothishealth andsafety. There could anextended shelf-life toattain acceptable quality levels necessary forconsumer health andsafety. Those manufacturers unable tomeet theminimum levels ofacceptability usually lack experience, advice, orequipment aswell as other small industries andcrafts could bedestroyed thereby causing unemployment, social discomfort, andloss ofdomestic production. Moreover, weobserved willingness ofindividuals tocooperate and where necessary compromise with colleagues across organizational lines. This type ofeffort wasnotsoclearly discerned between the organizations themselves. Torecognize this need home industries, wesuggest that during theresearch anddevelopment stage fortheestablishment ofa standard, particular studies should bemade ofthecontribution ofthe small manufacturers ofaparticular industry, their level of technology, their potential ascontrasted with their present practices, their financial needs, andtheir marketing areas. With this information inhand, thecentral coordinating body could, as necessary, provide orrecommend funding fortheimprovement of production capabilities andforanynecessary technological training andassistance. Particular emphasis should beplaced first onthose problems adversely affecting thehealth, safety, andwelfare of consumers. Newly developed national standards should first beidentified as \"tentative.\" Personnel inneed ofrelated training should beprovided ^Tith thetentative howtoimprove thestandard beinvited, persuasive, acted upon. Inspection procedures andlaboratory methodology fordetermining compliance should beevaluated. Necessary 249 andthenecessary training areconducted andnecessary are incorporated, thetentative standard should Ho^^ever, each final standard anditslevel periodic thanrequired bythenation; with production coming frommany small unsophisticated farmers using different seeds, cultivation, and harvesting practices; x^th processing often carried outincottage reasonable enforcement program.

Auniversal educational program consumers should beincluded. Inparticular, theeducational program referred toabove should include assistance tosmall farmers andproducers concerning seed purchase, fertilization, soil conditioning, andhandling ofproducts during andtechnical standards associations should beencouraged even beprovided financial support. They areaready source ofscarce skills; they facilitate mutual development ofknowledge by improving communication among experts; they improve theprofessional After anin-depth study oftheapplicability ofexisting standards, available ofOfficial Analytical Chemists, the American Society forTesting andMaterials, andmany others headquartered inmany parts causing existing orpoor practices areunworthy ofanational standardization program. Anideal standard should, among other things, define the identity andtheminimum quality oftheproduct concerned. Itshould noted thatmuch oftheneeded facilities arealready available inIndonesia. Although wehave interviewed many capable technical scientists, wefind, unfortunately, that inthese specialties, too, they arestill toofewinnumber. The sophisticated laboratory equipment required fortoday's advanced 251 methodology isalso inshort toimprove their expertise. level ofenforcement, andrejection schedules arealready totheneeds andcapabilities ofIndonesia, should beadopted orappropriately modified.

Theexistence ofmandatory also find that itencourages carelessness andresultant waste, unfair competition, and, very importantly, disrespect forlaw. Enforcement should beeven-handed. Asnecessary, specific penalties inanyenforcement mayconsist ofoneormore ofthefollowing: attraining programs, seizure andremoval from themarketplace ofoffending products, injunction, such tothegovernment orrestitution tocustomers, and, insevere cases, incarceration responsible serious repeated anddeliberate violations. V,B.12 .GoodManufacturing Practices Rules Forsuch things beincluded. forfoods, drugs, andcosmetics, manufacturing practices (GMP) should beincluded. These GMP's should that, oneshould study industry operation subject tothe standard. Standards should besetatsuch alevel that some manufacturers must improve toattain compliance. Astandard simply recognizing thelowest level This thestandards thepotential GMP's are 252 notofbenefit only tomandatory standards affecting foods, drugs, and cosmetics. They notapply only forsanitation andhealth. GMP's maybedesigned tobring teams ofexperts study each type offood anddrug manufacturing operation todetermine thecritical control points and anappropriate hazard analysis should beconducted. With these points inmind, meaningful GMP's canbedeveloped tothehome industries producing tempe andoncom (favorite Indonesian fermented foods) were revealing. These items areproduced under unsanitary conditions which lacked themost fundamental controls. Although they nodoubt areproduced andsoldwith consequent health hazards, they appear tocontribute greatly tothe nutritional needs ofthepopulation. Improvements must come gradually. Webelieve that thegovernment should develop good manufacturing practice guidelines forthemanufacturers ofthese products tobring about improvements. Guidelines should drugs, andcosmetics should include provisions concerning; a.Personnel training, qualifications, operational requirements, condition ofhealth, andsanitary practices. b.Plant andgrounds including provisions forventilation, lighting, roads, draining, andstorage space andcondition; necessary separation ofoperations by partition, airflow, space, time, enclosed d.Sanitizing etc. parameters andtechnical operations, rawmaterial earlier fordetermining along with each standard Cost/benefit analyses should beprepared effort should beconsidered andpersonnel should berecruited from economists, statisticians, budget experts, social psychologists, technologists specializing inthestandard being considered, marketing specialists, etc. V.3.14 .Information Inourdiscussions visits, welearned that insome mayhave departments problems ofproducts ofIndonesia. oflimited resources and reduces consumer confidence indomestic production.

Astrong centralized standardization program, asrecommended, significantly reduce these ata fraction implementation, ouractivities during \"field\" visits were primarily concerned with foods. Atthis point, therefore, webelieve itis germane tocomment tobelittle, were drugs. Forageographic area containing approximately 24 million people andnumerous drug andfood factories, this, forwhich the organization hasassigned responsibility. Nottoincrease staff equipment will permit thefacade ofprotection tobeperpetuated. Concerning inspectors andanalysts, they should besubject to improvement. Asnecessary, they should besent toother countries tostudy The inspectors andanalysts should berecognized asanelite corps of government. Their moral character should beofthehighest order. Further, they should theinterests ofIndonesia. V.B.17. Product Quality Assurance Ourvisit toP.T.Ultra Jaya Milk Industry revealed that thequality control effort inproduction, asinother food plants, isprimarily concerned with theexamination oftheend-product. More effort should beexercised tobuild quality assurance into each step ofproduction. Forexample, more effort should bemade toassure cleaner milk coming thefactory from suppliers. This isnottosaythat themilk should berejected, atthis time, butgovernment should provide assistance totherawmilk suppliers toimprove their products. The present practice toplace considerable emphasis quality. InanyOTPthere bein-process assurances built in. Weobserved similar conditions, often toamuch greater degree, inother operations \"quality assurance\" donotrely solely analysis controls. inpractice wewould recommend desiring produce abetter cost istorestructure quality control andquality assurance personnel should beresponsible tothetopechelon ofmanagement. That staff should beinsulated from those whose responsibility itistoproduce a target number ofproducts. Tomake these people responsible to production managers encourages conflict-of-interest situations. One cannot readily serve twomasters having divergent functions. thepractice agencies, isanexcellent practice. Itmakes efficient useoflimited capable personnel analytical facilities. Wecommend theperiodic evaluation and recertification oflaboratories asapractice which should be continued andenlarged upon. Also, establishment ofcollaborative laboratories goes fartostandardize acceptable laboratories and improves professional competence. 256 V.B.18.

These buying habits further contribute to thedesirability ofplanning better quality forbuilding products. Manufacturers generally donotreally trytoproduce uniform (standardized) products. inquality, shape, and cost. Concrete tends tobemixed from inadequate materials atthejob sitewithout adequate control ofproportions. Steel reinforcing bars 261 have been known tobesmaller than their identified size. For example, a25-mm barmayinfactmeasure 20-mm oreven 18-ram. Similar UNIDO forexcessive outthewater more accurately than iscurrently being performed, which would improve thequality ofbuildings.

V.C.5. Building Practices Housing projects inJakarta andSurabaya (cities representative of West andEast Java, respectively) were visited toview building practices. These buildings were found tovary inqxiality since construction practices lack uniformity. This situation is understandable since thenation hasnotgiven much attention to building practices andhasnouniform national building regulatory system. Buildings arebeing built, however, andgenerally years ofnormal provide shelter. Yetlittle isknown about their actual performance under either normal orabnormal (earthquake) conditions. While building practices vary throughout theworld, examples ofsome ofthepoorer practices observed inIndonesia (mostly They included lack ofattention tojoint connections (such aspoorly made bond beams not adequately connecting load-bearing masonry). Mortar joints were of uneven thickness; insome cases, theywere 30mmthick. From jobto ofbrick, with little ornoreinforcement. toextend beyond building performance. Other buildings observed hadadequate reinforcement andhadgood connection details. These buildings will better serve theuser at little ornoextra cost. V.C.S.a. Recommendations ; Basic prefabrication principles should beestablished andimplemented throughout thecountry; Indonesian improve, aswould thequantity ofnewhousing stock. Forexample, useof simple molds uniformly applied Indonesia formaking building components, such aswindow lintels, window anddoor frames, stair treads, columns, joists, beams, andmasonry andpaving blocks, would reduce thecost ofsuch basic building units. Initiating on- site inspections while buildings arebeing constructed would improve thequality control ofhouses andimprove their overall building practice. Further, amanner that inspectors maycheck onmaintenance andalterations ofbuildings without undue difficulty. Such checks should beperformed periodically. Owners and builders should beencouraged tousematerials requiring aminimum of maintenance. V.C.6, inJakarta, Notsurprisingly, most ofthebetter professional practices dealing with commercial and industrial buildings arefound inthis same city. InJakarta, the architect, engineer, andcontractor must becertified todesign and construct specific building types. Little information wasfound to assess theimpact ofthiscertification onthequality ofbuilding 263 construction. Other cities requirement. Theeducation emphasis isstill placed onsocial studies andthearts. Some changes are being proposed level tostrengthen building andengineering industry. Asaresult, good instructors areleaving the university forhigher salary positions oronpart-time jobs, which reduces their teaching effectiveness. Less-qualified instructors then must behired onthestructural clay industry, published anarticle vigorous training anddemonstration andtile-making organizations. V.C.b.a, Recommendations ; AllIndonesians inbuilding crafts andtechnologies should be encouraged toimprove their management skills, their knowledge ofthe building regulatory system, andtheir technical experience. There is aspecial need totrain atthecraftsmen level: contractors, masons, plumbers, general contractors, welders, electricians, general laborers, andlaboratory personnel. Technical training isalso needed innarrow subject areas such astesting andcalibrating equipment, earthquake-resistant designs, andlow-cost housing. Also needed are qualified versatile professionals who, while they arespecialists in onearea, should have abroad working knowledge ofthevarious aspects ofbuilding design, construction, andcontract awards. Communications among Indonesia's designers andcontractors should be encouraged. Dialogue with thebuilding community maybeachieved by holding regular workshops andconferences specifications, standards, andcodes\u2014has caused problems inIndonesia because different groups perceive different meanings forthese words. Another critical area ofcommunications involves thegeneral public. Information should beavailable, forexample, onbuying approved building plans, identifying where togoforordering building andcomponents, andlearning about financing. Anexcellent waytoconvey this isthrough brochures, radio andTVannouncements, posters, andtalks atpublic 264 gatherings. \"How ToManuals\" have been found tobeespecially helpful inImproving building practices inother developing nations. Also, there isaneed toproduce methods toeffectively transfer and usetechnology from developed anddeveloping countries. Technology should beidentified that canbeusedwith theexisting financial and human resources; theresulting output should beimproved product quality andtechnical know-how. Such transfer could beperformed through bilateral exchanges; through joint working arrangements, such astheJapanese ofConstruction which sent ahousing 1977 Survey in Indonesia; andthrough multi-national corporations. Developing countries also could pool their human andfinancial resources fora mutual advancement ofbuilding technology. Inconjunction with thetask ofidentifying needed technology, an appointed task force should review available literature from previous surveys andstudies. Asynthesis ofexisting material properly packaged andtransferred totheappropriate influential building community decision makers could help shape thefuture direction of Indonesia's building technology. Asbuilding specifications, standards, andcodes arebeing rewritten, attention should begiven toproducing them insimple, easy to understand language. Specifications, standards, andcodes are complex, yetbuildings arebuilt bythecommon isaware aretoofewadequate houses to accommodate itsrapidly growing population, thatresources must be made available toreduce thehousing shortages, that thebuilding process requires revisions tomake itmore responsive totheuser, and theGovernment at Bandung\u2014Indonesia's prestigious university which haswell-equipped building research houses insome projects. Thisconstitutes butImportant start, giving justification themselves inIndonesia recognize that standardization andregulation areessential toattain effective housing. 265 V,C.7.a. Reconmendatlons; Certain provisions oftheapproved future building codes could, and should, berelaxed forlow-income housing. Thehigh cost of regulation andofbuilding materials could obstruct theproduction of low-cost houses andsites-and-services assistance. Worse, what may originally beintended ashousing forthepoor could endupas subsidized middle\u2014 their houses. Here, theconcept where theowner contributes his labor during theconstruction orrenovation ofthehouse, should be encouraged. Also, theconcept of\"sites-and-services\" should be considered asitisnowpracticed inmany developing countries such as Jamaica andIndia. Under this concept, thevery poor families are provided with asmall amount oflandwith water anddrainage anda convenient amount ofland area toprovide Estrada, Director General oftheEcuadorian (INEN),wastheonlyvisiting need iseven inthemodem world, where therisks anddangers have become bigger duetogrowing sophistication intechnology. This increase results fromworking in extreme conditions (high temperatures, pressures, speeds, great power, etc.) andespecially because ofthelarge number ofartificial products withwhich new chemical substances become part ofcommerce every year, plus about 30 thousand already inuseinmany fields. Concepts about safety andquality change associety standards, technical criteria from experience andknowledge which advance more andmore rapidly. Such criteria areatpresent greatly influenced bytherelation of cost tobenefit.

International information exchange isalso needed to those documents ofgreat interest about standardization, quality control technology, andmetrology with special emphasis in foods anddrugs, textiles, safety, construction, etc. Agood overall insight ofthesituation inIndonesia wasobtained throughout that inonewayoranother participated in standardization activities, quality control, andmetrology in Indonesia, were accurately analyzed. From theexpositions andfollowing discussion, itwasdeduced that right nowthere areinoperation about theGovernment activities, towork more on regulations andcodes ofpractice than onindividual standards. That situation could beduetodependence ofdeveloping standards between thetechnical Itisdesirable tounify some concepts, through discussion bythecreation ofacentral organization that embraces all theaspects related with standardization, orelse tounify concepts at 271 anational level bymeans ofperiodic help a great deal bytheMinistry ofHealth, forexample, seem tolack technical ForInstance, efforts byadefinition ofastandard ofstandards, incomplete andnotsatisfactory. Inthat standard, ontheonehand, nothing issaid about packing, objections, inspection, ordocumental references andcross references with other standards; whereas ontheother hand, divisions aremade that donot agree with established international concepts. Another example of deficiencies ofthenewstandards isthat itdoes notmention the maximum orminimum percentages permitted with others, etc. interested personnel well prepared andenthusiastic. They lackadequate methods, suitable laboratories, reference standards, andappropriate legal support, andconsequently inspection forvariables, andattributes, etc,). Theeffort accomplished byLIPI anditsassociates topresent bythesurvey team ispraiseworthy. Theywill find itconstructive forinternal debate about these tasks toprovide more documentation, preferably from ISO, NBS, BSI(the British Standards Institution), ISI(the Indian Standards Institute), orother suitable sources. 272 b.Visits Program Theprogram ofvisits wasperformed with complete success, thanks to technical personnel andthe collaboration given confirmed throughout theconversations held inthedifferent institutions andfactories visited. Itwasevident that there was enthusiasm, andcapabilities were devoted tothedevelopment and application ofsafety standards inimportant aspects such as: fire control, electric hazards, industrial hygiene, transportation safety, chemical poisons, etc. However, wealso found alack ofappropriate updated technical documentation, alack ismade ontheapplication ofcodes without the necessary concurrence onthespecific technical standards, transforms thecontrol activities topolice actions, without major impact onthe essence ofthetechnical problem. Acoordinated effort oftechnical standardization will undoubtedly accomplish positive effects that are likely tobemore permanent. Lack ofupdated technical documentation makes themodernization ofthe technical andother those developed countries, \\diich utilize sophisticated technical elements andrequire modern safety standards. Theuseofrecommendations about safety byrecognized institutions in this field such astheAmerican Safety Association, theAmerican Fire Association, andothers would greatly bytechnical personnel specialized in technical standardization, insupport ofacentral specialized body, 273 that performs such tasks andlater theresults topublic Body There isawidespread agreement ontheidea ofcreating acentral with enough authority tocoordinate allthe instandardization, toissue Indonesian ofitsstandards intherequired technical assistance.

This calls for planning onanational scale. Intheindustrial sector, planning presupposes thepossibility standardization isaprereqisite of national planning forindustrial growth.
