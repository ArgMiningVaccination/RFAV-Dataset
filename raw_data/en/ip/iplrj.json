However vaccinated individuals can acquire asymptomatic or mild to moderately symptomatic infection. Robust data, pr ior to the emergence of the delta variant, showed that transmission from vaccinated individuals who test positive is unlikely; however more recent data on the delta variant supports the fact that transmission may be possible among vaccinated individuals. This possibility of transmission requires further investigation. Vaccination remains the most essential pu blic health tool with data clearly showing decreased infections, symptoms, hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated . We are committed to your safety and the safety of everyone in our communities. New York City is seeing increased transmission of S ARS-CoV-2 virus, spurred on by the delta variant. There are members of our collective community who have not yet been approved for vaccination : children under 12 and others, particularly our patients, who may not respond to their vaccination with robust im munologic protection. Thus, we must continue to prioritize our collective health and remain vigilant . In this dynamic situation, with our scientific knowledge constantly expanding, we all need to remain nimble. VACCINATIONS ISMMS requires COVID -19 vaccin ation for all new and continuing students in all programs, for academic year 2021 -2022. Your ID badge will have a sticker to acknowledge your compliance with this important public health measure. This sticker is required to access educational spaces. You c an pick up your sticker at the following locations: Medical Students: Stickers will be available in Annenberg 13 -30, Tuesdays 1 -5 pm and Wednesdays 9 am -1pm. AFTER HOURS: Students can also pick up stickers in Annenberg 13 - 30 between 6pm and 8pm on the following days - August 5th and August 9th -12th. Graduate Students: Stickers are available in the Annenberg Graduate School Offices (5th Floor) on Tuesdays from 10am -4pm and from the Aron Hall 1st Floor Student Affairs Suite on Wednesdays between 10 am -4 pm. MASKING GUIDELINES (NEW) In line with recent CDC recommendations for areas currently identified as having substantial COVID -19 transmission \u2014which includes New York City \u2014the Mount Sinai Health System has reinstated universal masking policies. Everyone must wear masks at all times in educational spaces as well as in laboratories, clinical spaces, and institutional public spaces. Please see the masking and distancing guidelines for the educational spaces. These are consistent with Mount Sinai Institutional policies . Students in clinical arenas must adhere to the clinical policies overseeing those specific spaces. GATHERINGS ( NEW) Student gatherings for interest groups, club meetings, affinity groups and other extracurricular activities should adhere to the updated school gathering policy . STUDENT HEALTH Symptomatic students should stay home and call Student Health or their personal physician. If you have had a known COVID exposure or a positive test, it is imperative to inform Student Health immediately so that we can guide you in best practice and/or help you to coordinate a COVID test as needed.

Due to the increased rates of COVID -19, we have re -instituted the following travel policies: Students who travel (for personal or profess ional reasons) to a destination outside the Northeast (outside NY, NJ, CT, MA, PA, VT, ME, DE, RI, NH, DC, MD) must: Complete the Student Travel Registration Form at least o ne week prior to departure so we can support your safe return to our community with testing and masking . Get a PCR test at Mount Sinai on day 3 -5 after your return. Self -schedule your test through the asymptomatic testing link . We are following the numbers regularly and are particularly concerned about desti nations with a vaccination rate (at least one dose) below 60 percent or a test positivity rate above 5%. These recommendations will likely evolve. Students are discouraged from traveling internationally. Students who do travel internationally must: Comple te the Student Travel Registration Form at least one week prior to departure Follow the re -entry testing and quarantine strategy per the IP team recommendations. These reco mmendations will vary depending upon your travel destination . Please be aware of all CDC requirements for the country you are traveling to and f rom. These IP protocols change on a regular basis as the science and the epidemiology evolves. We thank you for your partnership as we all navigate together and all work to remain well physically and emotionally.
