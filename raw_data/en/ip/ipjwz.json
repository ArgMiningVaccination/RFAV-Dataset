The vaccines developed by [Pfizer/BioNTech](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine) and [Moderna](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy) work by delivering a genetic message into human cells in the form of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), wrapped in a protective coat. mRNA is a type of molecule found in most of our cells, which carries instructions from our DNA to our cells' protein-making machinery. In this case, the mRNA in the vaccine instructs our cells to produce coronavirus proteins, which don't cause illness but do trigger an immune response. If we're infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, our immune system is prepared to fight it off, blunting infection. The [Oxford/Astra Zeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html) vaccine also delivers a genetic message to human cells, but it does so in the form of 'cargo' carried by another type of virus. In this viral piggyback system, the instructions for producing coronavirus proteins are brought into cells by infecting them with a harmless virus called an adenovirus, which is one type of virus that causes the common cold. This system makes the vaccine easier to produce and store, so it's cheaper and more versatile. To work efficiently, the trick is to use an adenovirus from primates, because a form that infects humans is more likely to be recognised and destroyed by our immune system. Bringing the EMBL spirit back to Italy The story that led to the first primate adenovirus-based vaccine began in 1979, when Riccardo Cortese - an Italian medical doctor convinced that fundamental research was the route to improved medicine - was recruited at EMBL Heidelberg. With his rare vision and talent, Riccardo was asked to set up and lead EMBL's Gene Expression Programme, to which he attracted a number of other Italian scientists. \"We were all in the same corridor,\" he said in a [2015 interview](https://www.embl.org/news/alumni/1504-cortese), \"which apparently had the permanent aroma of espresso.\" Among this group were two young scientists: Alfredo Nicosia and Alessandra Vitelli. The time the three of them spent together at EMBL sowed the seeds for a lifelong friendship and a professional partnership that gave rise to their work on chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccines. When the time came to leave EMBL, Riccardo was called back to Italy to found a new institute for molecular biology research, IRBM, near Rome, as the Italian site of Merck Research Laboratories. Alfredo and Alessandra joined Riccardo, and together they began to learn about drug discovery. Around that time, Merck had started a project with the aim of producing a vaccine for HIV based on a viral vector. The idea was to insert a set of HIV genes into an adenovirus carrier, to stimulate an HIV-specific immune response that would protect against infection. The approach piqued the interest of Riccardo and his colleagues, who decided to apply it to the development of a vaccine against the hepatitis C virus. The adenovirus vector looked promising, but in people previously exposed to adenovirus the immune response, and hence the effect of the vaccine, was weakened. This prompted the idea of using the chimpanzee adenovirus as a carrier. This virus would be similar enough to human viruses that it could readily infect human cells, but different enough to avoid being rejected by the immune system. The approach worked, and was [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2005071093A3/en) in 2004. The HIV vaccine project failed to deliver positive results, however, so Merck decided to drop this whole line of vaccine research. Nevertheless, Riccardo was convinced that the approach was promising, and successfully negotiated the licence to further develop chimpanzee adenoviruses at Okairos, a new company he founded in 2007, along with Alfredo and two other colleagues. This pioneering work led to the development and manufacture of the first simian adenovirus vectors to enter clinical trials in humans. These tackled major infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, malaria, HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, and Ebola. In 2013, Okairos was acquired by GSK under an agreement negotiated by Riccardo, in which the intellectual property was sold but the team of researchers was preserved and reborn as the company ReiThera. Towards a COVID vaccine When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Italy in early March 2020, ReiThera moved rapidly to adapt their latest, improved adenovirus vector - based on a gorilla adenovirus - to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. \"After the experience at Okairos, we had acquired the know-how,\" says Alessandra Vitelli, now Chief Scientific Officer at ReiThera. \"We had isolated a new adenovirus from gorillas, showing better delivery features and stronger immunogenicity in mice than the chimp adenovirus. We had just applied to receive a grant from CEPI - the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations - to develop a vaccine platform ready for future epidemic outbreaks. When the current pandemic broke out, we decided to repurpose our new gorilla vector against SARS-CoV-2.\" Riccardo Cortese [passed away](https://www.embl.fr/aboutus/alumni/alumni-directory/obituary/20170427_cortese/) in 2017. Alfredo Nicosia headed ReiThera until 2019, when he took up a teaching post at the University of Naples Federico II. But a new generation of scientists are further developing and improving the original technology. Among them is another EMBL alumnus, Angelo Raggioli, who joined ReiThera in 2019 as Head of Vectorology. \"My current job at ReiThera is very similar to what I did at EMBL Rome,\" says Angelo, who developed the vector that is currently being used in ReiThera's COVID-19 vaccine, called GRAd-COV2. \"The only difference is that here we all work towards a single goal, while at EMBL we collaborated on many different projects. Working for a company, I am more limited in the kind of reagents that I can use, as many are covered by patents. On the other side, I enjoy the excitement that comes from the practical implications of my research.\" Closing the circle Riccardo and his colleagues contributed to EMBL's innovative and dynamic spirit and then brought this back with them to Italy, where they've applied it throughout their careers. \"EMBL gave me the opportunity to measure my skills, and to share my experiences,\" says Alfredo Nicosia. \"It gave me access to tools and knowledge, and to an incredible range of expertise. It ingrained in me an open community culture, which I have used throughout my life to connect people and develop ideas. The challenge is to get things started, as Riccardo used to say.\" Ex Cortese - un visione biologia molecolare - l'IRBM - scelto dai Merck Research Laboratories come loro sede italiana.
