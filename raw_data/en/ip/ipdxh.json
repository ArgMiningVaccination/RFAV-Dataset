A si mple search on parent* yielded two eligible results that were added to the Endnote Library. Additional searching Epidemiology searching Searches were conducted to identify high quality epidemiological evidence about the prevalence and incidence of adult mental health problems in the UK. These searches were designed to identify any adults, rather than limiting to persons specifically identified as parents , in order to enable the team to place the relatively limited number of studies that identify parents with mental health problems into context within the wider, adult, literature.

Stratified or non -stratified. 2. Could include weighting to restore representativeness. Quality assessment questions used for quantitative studies used for review one question two (Petticrew and Roberts , 2006) Sample What is the response rate? Is the denominator reported? Is the sample surveyed representative (of the population to whom results will be generalised)? Analysis Is the study large enough? (for example, sample size justification or discussion of statistical power) Is there ad equate description of the data? (including tables and summary statistics describing the sample, and adequate information on the results of any analyses) Is there evidence of multiple statistical testing, or large numbers of post -hoc analyses? Are the stati stical analyses appropriate? Is there evidence of any other biases? (for example, funding bias). 167 Appendix 6 Reanalysis of published data to generate prevalence figures related to PMHPs Tables A6.1 to A6.4 overleaf. 168 Table A6.1 : Reanalysis based on Meltzer et al (1995) Women Prevalence of MHPs among parents Family unit type With CIS - R score 12+ Without CIS-R score 12+ All % with CIS -R score 12+ % without CIS -R score 12+ no child 188 person only 136 with parents 51 373 424 12.03 87.97 100.00 Adults with % Prevalence of 21.17 28.53 Couple, person 11.30 12.02 2.76 Adults with parents 5.74 9.22 8.60 1.03 Adults with one parent 2.25 2.35 2.33 0.41 Prevelance of parenthood among adults with MHPs All 100.00 100.00 100.00 169 Men Prevalence of MHPs among parents With CIS- R score 12+ Without CIS-R score 12+ All % % % Couple, no child 124 1,113 1,237 10.02 children 13 50 63 20.63 79.37 100.00 One person only 116 608 724 16.02 83.98 100.00 Adults with parents 46 618 664 6.93 93.07 100.00 Adults with one parent 26 172 % Prevalence of person only 21.40 Adults with parents 8.49 14.31 13.66 0.95 Prevalence of parenthood among adults with MHPs Adults with one p arent 4.80 3.98 4.07 0.53 All 100.00 100.00 100.00 170 Table A6.2: Reanalysis based on Singleton et al (2001) Women Prevalence of MHPs among parents Family unit type With neurotic disorder Without neurotic disorder All % with neurotic disor der % without neurotic disorder % Couple, no child 278 1,168 1,446 parent, children 125 301 426 29.34 70.66 One person only 182 565 747 24.36 Adults with parents 10 75 85 11.76 88.24 100.00 Adults with one parent 67 301 368 18.21 81.79 100.00 2000 ONS Survey All 79.54 100.00 % Prevalence of person only 18.78 15.00 15.78 3.84 Adults with parents 1.03 1.99 1.80 0.21 Prevalence of parenthood among adults with MHPs Adults wi th one parent 6.91 7.99 7.77 1.41 All 100.00 100.00 100.00 20.46 171 Men Prevalence of MHPs among parents With neurotic disorder Without neurotic disorder All % % % Couple, no child 148 1,057 1,205 12.28 parent, children 22 33 55 40.00 60.00 One person only 121 528 649 18.64 81.36 100.00 Adults with parents 11 165 176 6.25 93.75 100.00 Adults with one parent 49 429 478 10.25 89.75 100.00 2000 ONS Survey All 554 3,335 3,889 14.25 85.75 100.00 % Prevalence of PMHPs men Couple, Couple, One person only Adults with with one parent 8.84 12.86 12.29 1.26 Prevalence of parenthood among adults with MHPs All 100.00 100.00 100.00 14.25 172 All adults Prevalence of MHPs am ong parents Family unit type With probable psychotic disorder Without probable psychotic disorder All % with probable psychotic disorder % without All Couple, no child 13 2,641 2654 children 4 One person only 26 1,363 1389 1.87 98.13 100.00 Adults with parents 3 256 259 1.16 98.84 100.00 Adults with one parent 4 852 856 0.47 99.53 100.00 2000 ONS Survey All 0.70 99.30 100.00 % Prevalence of PMHPS among all adults Couple, no child 21.67 31.00 30.93 0.15 Couple, children 16.67 35.00 34.87 0.12 Lone parent, children 6.67 One person only 43.33 16.00 16.19 0.30 Prevalence of parenthood among adults with MHPs Adults with parents 5.00 3.00 3.02 0.03 Adults with one parent 6.67 10.00 9.98 0.05 All 100.00 100.00 100.00 0.70 173 Table A6.3: Reanalysis based on Cox et al (1987) Women with children under 16 Prevalence of MHPs among women with children under 16 Family unit type With neurotic disorder Without neurotic disorder All All women with GHQ score % with neurotic disorder % without neurotic disorder % Single, aged 18 -29 30 21 51 58.82 41.18 100.00 30-39 31 among all women 18 -49 Single, aged 18 -29 30 21 51 1.65 30-39 31 35 66 1.71 40-49 16 17 33 0.88 Married/cohab 18 -29 5.95 30-39 167 9.21 Prevelance of with MHPs 40-49 83 186 269 4.58 23.98 Other women 18 18 -49 aged 18 -29 4.07 1.95 based on Paykel et al (2001) All adults with 3 or more children Prevalence of MHPs among adults with 3 or more children Caseness on PSE/PSF Non-case All % case % not case % 1946 birth cohor t study - Paykel Age 36 52 769 821 6.33 93.67 61 92.57 100.00 3+ children 36 52 769 821 172 2,718 2,890 % 30.23 28.29 28.41 3+ children 43 61 760 821 Prevelance of adults with 3 or more children among adults with MHPs All adults at 43 174 2,716 2,890 % 35.06 27.98 28.41 case 36 only case 43 only case both case neither case 36 case 43 3+ children 31 40 21 729 821 52 61 not 91 84 29 1,865 2,069 120 113 all adult cases 122 124 50 2,594 2,890 172 174 Prevalence of adults with 3+ children and MHPs among all adults age 36 1.80 age 43 2.11 177 Appendix 7 References to diagnos tic instruments used in selected studies CIS-R Lewis, G., Pelosi, A.J., Araya, R. and Dunn, G.

Adjusted OR (95% CI) for any neurotic disorder: Couple with children 1.01 (0.86 -1.20); Lone parent 1.74 (1.41 - 2.16). Crude ORs 1.21 (1.04 - 1.40) and 2.88 (2.38 - 3.48) respectivel y. Meltzer et al, 2003* Lone parents made up 6% of the total sample but 10% of all those with common mental disorder and 12% of those with a disabling common mental disorder. Disabling defined as diagnosis of 'neurosis' plus not getting on with things use d to do or would like to do and also reporting difficulty in at least one specific activity of daily living. Multiple regression models generated ORs, controlling for accommodation, tenure, car ownership, age left school, work status and social class. Comparison category of couple no children.

Targosz et al, 2003* Depressive episode: lone mothers 7%, supported mothers 2.5%, other women 1.9%. Mixed anxiety/depression: lone mothers 14.6%, supported mothers 11.2%, other women 8.4%. One neurotic disorder: lone mothers 23.2%, supported mothers 18.0%, other women 15.4%. Two or more disorders: lone mothers 6.5%, supported mothers 1.8%, other women 2.7%. Logistic regressions using depressive episode and then anxiety/depression as response variables, entering motherhood group and demographic and str ess and support variables. Results suggest that 'the excess of depressive conditions in lone mothers is very largely associated with the range and levels of disadvantage they experience' (p.719).

Researchers delibe rately chose the term 'episode onset' in preference to 'incidence' to reflect the fact that the majority of these episodes are likely to be recurrences, rather than first episodes' (p 18). 2. Future prevalence is not same as incidence, as many respondents were also GHQ 'cases' at time t. 187 Addendum Note o f changes to the scope/extent of the reviews discussed between SPRU and SCIE in May 2007 and agreed in J une 2007 1. New limitations to the reviews agreed by SCIE and SPRU a) Parents who are in pr ison Research where the target population is parents i n prison will now be excluded. SCIE is currently doing work on children of prisoners which, it was felt, would overlap to some degree to the research we would have been covering. b) Generic parenting interventions: clarification of SPRU's approach Generic parenting interventions will be being used by parents with mental health problems, and evaluations of such interventions do sometimes include measur es of parental mental health. Two reviews of the e ffectiveness of parenting interventions have recently been published. We will only include evaluations of generic parenting interventions when the intervention has been applied/ targeted at parents with mental health problems and/or parents at risk of ment al health problems c) Interventions initially delivered within the six months of birth Some post -natal interventions continue over a number of months, even years, and are also evaluated over a lengthy period of time. However, if the intervention/service was first delivered within the first six months post delivery they will be excluded from the review. 2. Additional limitations to retrieval agreed between SCIE and SPRU a) Books and book chapters Epidemiology searches Searches carried out and books and bo ok chapters already retrieved. We will not retrieve further books/book chapters referenced in reference lists unless they appear to be a critical text (indicated by authorship, title, and possibly abstract). A note will be made of the rationale for retrieving. Social Care Online We will not retrieve books or book chapters unless appears to be a critical text (indicated by authorship, title, and possibly abstract). A note will be made of the rationale for retrieving. 188 Other sources Sources of evidenc e may be recommended to us by expert sources or we may come across them v ia other miscellaneous routes. We will not retrieve books or book chapters unless appears to be a critical text (indicated by authorship, title, and possibly abstract). A note will be made of the rationale for retrieving. The Australian review This has been quickly reviewed and did not appear to conta in much new/relevant material. This will now be properly checked. In terms of books or book chapters, we will not retrieve unless they a ppear to be a critical text (indicated by authorship, title, and possibly abstract). A note will be made of the rationale for retrieving. Updating of SCIE searches We will not retrieve books or book chapters unless appears to be a critical text (indicated by authorship, title, and possibly abst ract). A note will be made of the rationale for retrieving. Reference lists of included studies See below . b) Reference lists of included studies We will be checking reference lists of included studies. A note w ill be made of all references which appear to be potentially relevant. These will be checked to see if they have already been screened by SCIE or SPRU. Those not already identified by SCIE or SPRU will be rechecked, where possible by also viewing the abstr act, by two members of the research team. The researchers will then make a decision whether or not to retrieve each item. Books or book chapters will not be retrieved unless they appear to be a critical text (indicated by authorship, title, and possibly ab stract). A note will be made of the rationale for retrieving. "}
