At an early point in \"Vaccination Nation\" Wakefield and his colleges started and uproar, when stating they had reasons to believe that autism was related to chemicals in vaccinations. However, throughout the article their claims are later dropped and confirmed false. The author presents factors that vaccinating your children is as important as ever. The overall theme of this article discusses vaccinations and the awareness that they have not, and do not, cause the development of autism in children. The starting point in this article will beginning with the vaccination epidemic\u2014that Wakefeild's discoveries sparked fear of vaccinations. The \"decadelong vaccine-autism saga began in 1998, when British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published evidence inThe Lancet suggesting they had tracked down a shocking cause of autism\" (). This cause correlated with the examination of 12 children who had, what was stated as \"behavioral disorders\". The researchers discovered that these children had intestinal inflammation which was pinned to the MMR or measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. The idea was that such inflamed intestines released toxins into the bloodstream, which then traveled to the brain, untimely causing autism. Later in the U.S. concerns of thimerosal (a 50 percent mercury based preservative found in many vaccinations) and the fact that it could potentially cause autism. The response by America was \"by ordering that thimerosal be removed from all vaccines administered to children under age 6, or reduced to trace amounts\" ().However, there was no proof of harm from thimerosal, however a larger study was underway. In the end \"the court specifically denied any link between the combination of the MMR vaccine and vaccines with thimerosal ...and the spectrum of disorders associated with autism\" (). This leads us to the second point present by Mooney, which is that scientific proof has not subside the accusations that vaccinations cause autism.What is specifically known is scientific research does not calm the masses, instead the author discuses that we see the internet and celebrities like \"Charlie Sheen and Jim Carrey, formerPlayboyplaymate Jenny McCarthy\" (), promote these findings as false. In turn, only stirring the fears of weary parents who decide not to vaccinate their children, as stated by the "}
