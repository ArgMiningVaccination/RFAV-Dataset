The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a health coaching intervention on the stress and burden of caregivers of patients awaiting heart or lung transplant. Hypotheses: Caregivers will have traits and behaviors pre-transplant that will predict caregiver readiness, quality of life, and transplant recipient outcomes. Specifically, thoracic pre-transplant caregivers report stress, symptoms of anxiety or depression, and perceive high caregiver burden. These factors may be amenable to pre-transplant intervention to improve overall patient and caregiver outcomes. Aims, purpose, or objectives: We will conduct a pilot trial to test whether caregivers of heart and lung transplant candidates who receive wellness coaching will experience improvement in caregiver-related distress. We will also explore the relationship between caregiving and factors such as uncertainty, resilience, stress level, and affect. Mindfulness Intervention for Post-Covid Symptoms Rochester, Minn.
