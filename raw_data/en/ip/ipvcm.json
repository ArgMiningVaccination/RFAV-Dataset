Childhood vaccinations are an important part of achieving that goal. Children's vaccines are safe, effective, tested therapies that protect your child from life-threatening diseases. At Advocate Health Care, our pediatricians follow national guidelines and recommendations for children's immunizations. We share your goal: to provide the best protection for your whole family. [Vaccines](/health-services/primary-care/preventive-care/vaccinations/) help protect your child from serious infectious diseases. Before children got vaccines, many of these illnesses led to death or left babies or children with lifelong health problems such as paralysis, deafness or organ damage. The development of vaccines has drastically reduced the effects of these once-common childhood diseases. Vaccinating your child helps build their immunity before they're exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. Many infections are also contagious, passing easily from person to person. Vaccinations help prevent diseases from spreading to protect more people. Most vaccines contain a weakened or inactive (dead) virus or bacteria that cause specific diseases. These inactive germs don't make your child sick or give them the disease. Instead, they help your child's body create immune cells (antibodies) that recognize the specific virus or bacteria. Then, when your child encounters those germs, they have the antibodies to fight it off effectively. Some vaccines, such as the COVID vaccine, don't contain weakened or inactive germs. Instead, they contain molecules that tell your child's body how to create certain proteins found on the virus or bacteria. These proteins trigger an immune response, which makes antibodies. Children should get vaccinated for hepatitis B shortly after birth and again at 1 month old. They should receive their first round of routine immunizations at 2 months and first COVID vaccine at 6 months. Your child needs several vaccinations to protect against disease, including: The pentavalent vaccine is a 5-in-1 vaccine to protect against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b. It's often used to vaccinate children in countries with less access to vaccines. In the U.S., there are two versions of the pentavalent vaccine. One protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib). The other protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio and hepatitis B (DTaP-IPV-HepB). At Advocate, our [pediatric primary care](https://www.advocatechildrenshospital.com/services/pediatric-primary-care/) providers and their teams give your child vaccines during their checkup appointments. We follow the immunization schedule from the CDC. See the CDC's vaccination schedules for: Immunization schedules are designed to help protect your child during the months when they're most likely to get a disease. It's important to follow the schedule recommended by your child's pediatrician or provider to keep your child safe. If your child misses a dose of a necessary vaccine, talk with their pediatrician about an alternate schedule. Your child's provider can offer recommendations to help them catch up. Most children should get vaccinations as recommended by the CDC. In rare cases, your child's pediatrician may recommend against getting certain vaccines if your child has: Depending on the vaccine type, your child may get an: Your child may experience mild side effects, such as fussiness or a low fever, for 24 to 48 hours after getting a vaccine. You can help relieve these side effects with at-home remedies, such as applying a cool washcloth, giving your child plenty of fluids and getting over-the-counter pain relievers, if your child's pediatrician says it's OK to do so.
