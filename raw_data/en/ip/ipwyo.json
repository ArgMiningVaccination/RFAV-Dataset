Many parents also rejected the chickenpox vaccine, the meningococcal conjugate vaccine against bacterial meningitis and, to a lesser extent, the MMR, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Just last month, the British medical journal The Lancet retracted the 1998 study that first linked the MMR vaccine to autism and set off widespread fears about vaccine safety. \"We were sobered to find that one in four parents erroneously believe that vaccines can cause autism in an otherwise healthy child,\" said Dr. Gary L.
