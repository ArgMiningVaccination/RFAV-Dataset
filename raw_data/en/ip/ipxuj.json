Chronic fatigue is a medical condition known as [chronic fatigue syndrome ](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html#:~:text=Myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic%20fatigue%20syndrome%20(ME%2FCFS)%20is,severe%20fatigue%20and%20sleep%20problems.)(CFS). It causes extreme and long-lasting fatigue that doesn't get better with rest or sleep. It's a condition that affects how well someone can do their daily tasks for a long time. People with chronic fatigue often feel extremely tired even when they haven't done much. This fatigue can get worse when you do physical or mental activities. It's called post-exertional malaise. Common symptoms of the condition include problems with thinking and memory, trouble sleeping, muscle and joint pain, headaches, a sore throat, and tender lymph nodes. Chronic fatigue is not fully understood yet, and there is no definitive diagnostic test. It is thought that multiple factors may contribute to the development of this disorder. These include viral infections, immune problems, hormonal imbalances, genetic factors, and psychological stress. What Are The Symptoms Of Chronic Fatigue? Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition that causes extreme and persistent fatigue. It is not improved by resting and is not caused by another medical condition. It is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). The symptoms of chronic fatigue can vary from person to person but commonly include: - Severe fatigue: Severe fatigue is when you always feel tired, even when you rest or sleep. Fatigue can make it hard to do daily tasks and get worse when you use your body or mind too much. - Post-exertional malaise (PEM): People with chronic fatigue may experience worsening symptoms after physical or mental activity. This is called post-exertional malaise (PEM), and it can last for days or even weeks. An exacerbation can make you feel more tired, cause muscle pain, make it hard to think clearly (brain fog), and make you feel worse overall. - Sleep problems: People with chronic fatigue often struggle with sleep problems. These can include insomnia, unrefreshing sleep, or disruptions in sleep patterns. - Cognitive difficulties: Many people with chronic fatigue struggle with thinking, memory, and focus. This can appear as having trouble thinking clearly. It can also cause problems with short-term memory and make it hard to focus on tasks. - Muscle and joint pain: Chronic fatigue can cause muscle and joint pain. This pain is often described as aching, throbbing, or soreness. - Headaches: Frequent headaches, including migraines, can be a sign of chronic fatigue. - Sore throat and tender lymph nodes: Some people may have a persistent sore throat or swollen lymph nodes in the neck or armpits. - Flu-like symptoms: Chronic fatigue can cause flu-like symptoms. These include a mild fever, chills, and overall feeling unwell. - Dizziness and lightheadedness: Feeling dizzy or lightheaded, especially when standing up, could be a sign of chronic fatigue. - Sensitivity to sensory stimuli: Some people with chronic fatigue report being more sensitive to light, noise, certain foods, or chemicals. Note that chronic fatigue symptoms can differ in severity and change over time. If you think you might have chronic fatigue, it's best to see a healthcare professional. They can give you an accurate diagnosis and help you manage it properly. Is Chronic Fatigue Dangerous For Your Health? Chronic fatigue can be linked to health problems. It's important to address fatigue quickly to avoid further issues. Some people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may have other conditions like thyroid disorders, anemia, or heart problems that can worsen their symptoms. Thyroid problems can make you feel tired and have symptoms like chronic fatigue. Anemia is when you have too few red blood cells or hemoglobin, which can make you tired. Heart failure can tire you because the heart isn't pumping blood either. Don't ignore constant tiredness. Get medical help to find out what's causing it. A healthcare expert can check your symptoms, do tests, and find out if there are any underlying issues. Treating the main cause can reduce tiredness and enhance overall health and well-being. If you're always tired, it's recommended to see a doctor as soon as possible. Doctors can evaluate, diagnose, and recommend treatments for any underlying conditions. Taking timely action can lead to better outcomes and an improved quality of life. How Do Naturopaths Treat Fatigue? Understanding how naturopaths treat fatigue is important because this can be an alternative treatment to conventional medicine. The truth is that conventional medicine won't really stop the cause of your fatigue but will only mask the symptoms. If anything, it can be problematic to rely on conventional medicine for fatigue since it can end up introducing various chemicals into your body. This is not going to be helpful because it will slow down your body's detoxification efforts leading to more fatigue. What you want to do is to opt for a naturopathic approach and treatment. The main role of naturopathy is to use natural methods and lifestyle changes that actively help make a difference in your day-to-day life. The reality is that once you implement these solutions, you will feel a lot better and don't have to deal with unwanted chemicals. Naturopaths end up treating fatigue with specialized nutritional building blocks, especially in the case of adrenal fatigue. These help nourish and support your adrenals without overtaxing them. Chronic fatigue ends up being very problematic for your adrenal system, and that's certainly one of the problems that you want to take into consideration very quickly since the issue can get worse with time. Suppose a patient is diagnosed with both chronic fatigue and another chronic issue like fibromyalgia. In that case, it's a very good idea to deal with the underlying deficiencies right away so the body does not become overwhelmed. Naturopaths treat fatigue simply by addressing the root causes and making sure everything is managed appropriately. Naturopaths Treat Fatigue With Sleep Restoration Naturopaths will help you focus on improving your sleep if that is an issue for you. Your body needs proper sleep to heal itself. Sleep is crucial for your body's natural healing process. Naturopaths can help treat fatigue by improving your sleep patterns. They focus on helping your body gain the strength it needs to heal. Once your body is stronger, it can address other issues that may be affecting your energy levels. Naturopaths Treat Fatigue By Correcting Dietary Problems Many of us don't eat the right foods and that can impede our body from healing the way it should. This is why a naturopathic doctor can help you treat fatigue by making adequate changes to your diet and lifestyle to improve your health. A naturopath will always focus on improving your health and making sure you stop eating foods that harm your body and include foods that can help increase your energy reserves. Yes, many foods may not be suitable if you have chronic fatigue and various underlying health issues. Diet, if improper, can prevent your body from healing and may even lower your health status. An improper diet can make you prone to all kinds of issues and lower your innate ability to heal, so you have to tackle it properly with the right systems and ideas. Therefore, in the long run, your diet changes will make a huge impact on your energy levels and also your overall health. So What Specific Changes Will A Naturopath Focus On Here To Treat Chronic Fatigue? For the most part, the main idea is to eat whole foods, which will help with chronic fatigue quite a bit. You may need to cut down on sugar, dairy, and other hard-to-digest foods temporarily. The naturopathic doctor might order specialized tests to identify foods you may be sensitive to. This can help reduce the overall burden on your body. If not treated, this burden can drain your energy and cause fatigue. It may also be necessary to avoid stimulants to protect your adrenal glands and give them a break. Will Naturopaths Recommend Supplements To Help With Chronic Fatigue? Naturopaths treat fatigue by using a lot of different methods. Sometimes, natural supplements might be a good option. It depends on the individual patient, so an individual assessment is necessary. This assessment determines what your body needs to recover from fatigue. For energy production, magnesium is essential. However, the type and amount of magnesium depend on your specific needs, which a naturopathic doctor can assess. Other helpful supplements may include B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc. These can support your adrenal glands, which are involved in energy production. Keep in mind that if you've tried these supplements without any effect, they might not be suitable for your specific issue. That's why seeing a naturopathic doctor is valuable. They can determine the exact nutrients and quantities that your body requires. Naturopaths Treat Fatigue By Helping You Deal With Mental And Chemical Stress Naturopaths will help you find ways to eliminate stress naturally in order to treat your fatigue. One of the major problems that people deal with all the time is stress and it can be either at home or at work. When you are stressed out, this will drain you of energy and can become a major problem. In this case, nutritional and herbal remedies may be a good option. They help facilitate healing while also boosting energy naturally and helping you with the right amount of relief which is incredible and certainly makes a huge difference. That's why dealing with stress can help immensely in the case of chronic fatigue. Detoxifying your body is another way Naturopaths treat chronic fatigue. The constant accumulation of toxins in our body can be extremely problematic and it definitely leads to things like chronic fatigue. This is known as chemical stress which can deplete your energy stores. Toxin buildup is obviously unhealthy and chronic fatigue is a sign that you have way too many toxins in your body. Granted, the human body is built to eliminate toxins naturally but if the levels are too high it needs help and this is where a naturopath comes into play. Naturopaths can prescribe certain health solutions to help your body detox better, such as green tea extract, liver-supporting herbs, castor oil packs, natural drainage remedies, or physical treatments such as [acupuncture](https://metrotownnaturopathic.com/services/burnaby-acupuncture/) and [Bowen therapy](https://metrotownnaturopathic.com/services/bowen-therapy/).
