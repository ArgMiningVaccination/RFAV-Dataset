In ways that could not have been imagined a few decades ago, the field of complementary medicine now commands more attention by the consumer and the medical communities. Our current trillion dollar healthcare system is undergoing a profound change towards a consumer-driven model based upon choice, results, affordability, and service. Integrating conventional and complementary modalities, this emerging era in healthcare emphasizes integration, prevention, wellness, personal empowerment, and quality of life. Maryland University of Integrative Health continues to be on the leading edge of this movement by creating programs that prepare the practitioners, leaders, and advocates of the future, while providing clinical care and consultation to improve health and vitality of individuals and communities. Looking back on more than 40 years of our history is both humbling and inspiring. Here are a few of our milestones: 2022 The University launched a new Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Culinary Health and Healing focused on preparing students with scientifically based principles and practices of whole foods selection and preparation as a foundation for health and wellness. 2021 The University launched a new Post-Master's Certificate in Therapeutic Yoga Practices for health care providers who want to add yoga therapy tools such as yoga and meditation to their scope of practice without becoming a fully certified yoga therapist and to effectively refer and collaborate with yoga therapists. MUIH launched an initiative to provide weekly menus and nutritional information to food banks, food pantries, and other organizations across the country. 2020 The University launched a new Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance which educates students about cannabis-based products with an emphasis on health effects, safety, formulation, and quality assurance. 2019 On March 13, 2019, Maryland University of Integrative Health's (MUIH) board of trustees announced that Marc Levin was appointed as the University's president and chief executive officer.

He earned his Master of Arts in Transformative Leadership and Social Change from MUIH under the teachings of the University's founders and elders. He is a proud alum and continues to be a strong supporter of the University's values and culture which are consistently shown through his leadership and actions.

The panel included several alumni of the Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program who answered questions and offered attendees practical tips for breaking into the acupuncture field, specializations within the field, self-care, and growing as a healer and practitioner. They also provided business advice on various topics such as starting a practice, types of employment arrangements, and whether or not to accept insurance. On June 3, 2018, the University celebrated its largest graduating class of 463 students. The class included 290 master's degree students, 45 doctoral degree students, and 128 post-baccalaureate and post-master's certificate students. This was the first year the University hosted Commencement at its current location, The Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric in Baltimore. The University launched a new Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices, focused on providing a solid foundation in modern Ayurvedic practices and incorporating a progressive scientific perspective while maintaining its roots in traditional practices.

On June 5, 2017 the University celebrated its annual Commencement and conferred its first-ever doctoral degrees in the fields of acupuncture, Oriental medicine, and clinical nutrition. The University launched a new Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Workplace Wellness, focused on providing the knowledge and skills necessary to develop, implement, and evaluate health and wellness programming in the employer setting. The University mourned the passing of James A. \"Jim\" Duke, Ph.D. Jim was a much-loved and valued member of the MUIH community. He had served as a distinguished herbal lecturer with MUIH, and provided rare, enriching, and unforgettable learning experiences for students at his Green Farmacy Garden. 2016 With the growth of our programs, student body, and staff and faculty, institutional infrastructure also grew. In May, the University expanded into its Maple Lawn Campus to accommodate its growing space needs. The 10,070 square foot space includes administrative and academic offices, as well as community and meeting spaces. Read more about the expansion [here](http://muih.edu/blog_or_news/muih-expands-to-new-maple-lawn-campus/).

In August, the first class of the Master of Science in Yoga Therapy completed their rigorous two-year degree and moved into the world as the only graduates of a program in this field from an accredited university. 2014 The New Year began with the announcement of the addition of five new members to MUIH's board of trustees. These new members all share a deep passion and commitment to the field of integrative health and to the future of MUIH. And Adele Wilzack, MUIH board chair noted that \"It was, and still is, astonishing to find such an affinity for the work and efforts of this great institution.\" The new board members will provide strategic guidance and support to the University's ambitious strategic initiatives, which include doubling the number of academic programs over the next five years.

As noted by President and Chief Executive Officer Frank Vitale, \"This designation validates our academic excellence and is a significant milestone. We strongly feel that Maryland University of Integrative Health is on its way to becoming the preeminent institution in this country in the field of integrative health.\" MUIH began offering courses online in September in order to make our unique programs available nationally and internationally.

Students explore science-based topics such as biomedicine and physiology while also learning about the history and philosophy of yoga and how that informs yoga therapy in today's world. Speaking about the future of the yoga therapy program, Mary Lauttamus, the program's academic director, said that she wants MUIH \"to be the place where yoga teachers can realize their full potential as healers and together create a supportive and nurturing yoga community.\" Read on about our Master of Science in Yoga Therapy [here](http://muih.edu/academics/masters-degrees/master-yoga-therapy). 2012 The Institute announced the nation's first [Master of Arts in Health and Wellness Coaching](http://muih.edu/academics/masters-degrees/master-of-arts-in-health-and-wellness-coaching/), with specialty areas in Nutrition, Herbal Studies, and Medical Herbalism.

Tai Sophia purchases its 32,500 square-foot building and strengthens its financial position, a move made possible by the confidence placed in the Institute by the Howard County government (which authorized a bond issue for the purchase) and the Institute's new banking partners, United Bank and Howard Bank. Faculty members give keynote talks and lead seminars, including a gathering for healthcare professionals at Schumacher College in England; the American Herbalist Guild Symposium in Columbia, Maryland; Baltimore Bioneers Conference; Complementary and Alternative Medicine Exposition in New York City; and the 25th anniversary celebration of the founding of national acupuncture organizations in Portland, Oregon. 2006 Tai Sophia Institute adopts a new five-year strategic plan, which includes both a new vision and a new mission statement. The Howard County Chamber of Commerce honors the Institute, naming Tai Sophia the Howard County Large Business of the Year; and the Baltimore Daily Record acknowledges the Institute's work at our Penn North Neighborhood Center (part of our Community Health Initiative) with a Health Care Heroes award. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education grants initial accreditation to Tai Sophia Institute. As well, the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine renews its accreditation of the Institute's Master of Acupuncture degree program for five years, the maximum time period. The Institute honors Jim and Peggy Duke in a ceremony at their \"Green Farmacy Garden\"; in a life estate arrangement, the Dukes agree that Tai Sophia will inherit this national and natural treasure. The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Tai Sophia hold their second annual retreat, continuing their collaborative venture to improve the American healthcare system. 2005 In the 30th anniversary year, Tai Sophia awards degrees to the first graduates of its Applied Healing Arts program (now called Transformative Leadership and Social Change), making this ceremony the first to include graduates of all three master's programs. Other highlights: The Helen M. and Annetta Himmelfarb Foundation awards a $1 million grant to Tai Sophia, the largest donation in Tai Sophia's 30-year history.

Tai Sophia expands its partnerships to include both the Wellness Center at Howard Community College (which it helped establish) and the Chopra Institute, hosting the Chopra Center's First Annual East Coast Mind-Body Conference. The year ends with a formal gala, which concludes the year-long celebration of Tai Sophia's three decades of service. 2004 Tai Sophia graduates its first class of students from the Master of Arts in Herbal Medicine program; furthers its work with the Kennedy Krieger Institute (an internationally recognized facility serving children with special needs); completes an affiliation agreement with the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; secures public policy support to continue its Baltimore inner-city clinic; and, on the passing of Haig Ignatius, M.D., celebrates the life and contributions of a beloved teacher and friend. 2003 At a ceremony in February, the Institute honors ten years of Meridians magazine, subsequently conceiving a new \"family\" of publications to replace it. Tai Sophia holds its first annual healthcare provider workshop day, which brings together almost 200 healthcare providers. The community celebrates the lives of Pere Claude Larre, Ivan Illich, and J. R. Worsley, all of whom passed away in 2003, commemorating the profound impact these individuals had on the work of the Institute. 2002 The first classes of the new master's programs in Herbal Medicine and Applied Healing Arts begin in January. At the end of April, Tai Sophia Institute moves to a new 12-acre campus south of Columbia in the Montpelier Research Park. The campus opens with a 32,500-square-foot building in a beautiful natural setting. In June, Tai Sophia celebrates the grand opening with a Festival of the Healing Arts. 2001 In November, the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools accepts Tai Sophia as a candidate for accreditation. 2000 As the school enters a new era of service, it takes a new name, Tai Sophia Institute, which signals its expanding mission and encompasses its new programs. The name \"Tai Sophia\" links the Chinese word Tai, meaning \"great,\" and the Greek word for wisdom, Sophia. The new name continues to honor the Eastern healing traditions, while the inclusion of Sophia signals the philosophy that underpins every program offered by the Institute. Development of two new master's programs begins. Simon Mills, one of the world's leading herbalists, is chosen to lead the nation's first Master of Science in Herbal Medicine program. John Sullivan, professor of philosophy at Elon University and cofounder of SOPHIA\u00ae (School Of Philosophy and Healing In Action\u00ae), is selected to lead the Applied Healing Arts program. 1999 TAI adopts a new mission: \"to enable all of us to practice the art of living and the art of dying.\" The board of trustees approves a plan to build a new campus for the Master of Acupuncture program and to offer new degree programs. 1998 TAI, with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, presents the first of the \"Building Bridges\" conferences for doctors, nurses, and public health officials. TAI develops a partnership with Howard County Public School System, including a unique program based on SOPHIA principles for teens identified as \"troubled,\" and programs through which public school students and teachers learn about complementary medicine. 1997 The Community Health Initiative (CHI), which began by treating people with addictions at the Baltimore Detention Center, expands to additional CHI sites, including Penn North Neighborhood Center in inner-city Baltimore. 1996 A new student teaching clinic opens at Belvedere Square in Baltimore, Maryland, giving clinical students additional treatment opportunities. 1995 A new student teaching clinic opens in Wheaton, Maryland, giving clinical students in the acupuncture program a space to treat patients in the Washington, D.C., area. 1994 The Master of Acupuncture program moves from one to two intake classes per year (September and January), enabling TAI to double new enrollment from 30 to 70 students annually - more than a 100% increase. SOPHIA is integrated into the core curriculum for all students. TAI expands its library and creates the Meeting Point Bookstore Cafe. 1993 TAI launches a new magazine, Meridians, written for patients and practitioners. Led by faculty member Peter Marinakis, the Community Health Initiative (CHI) establishes a pilot program in Baltimore, where TAI students and faculty provide auricular acupuncture to people with addictions at the Baltimore Detention Center. On PBS, Bill Moyers presents the \"Healing and the Mind\" series featuring acupuncture and other approaches to healing that recognize the interconnection of body, mind, and spirit. After reviewing evidence of the effectiveness of acupuncture, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration reclassifies acupuncture needles as medical devices for \"general use\" by trained professionals rather than \"experimental\" devices. A landmark survey by Harvard professor David Eisenberg, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that one-third of American adults use some form of alternative therapy. 1992 The board of trustees establishes a mission \"to change the experience of personal health in America by the year 2000.\" 1988 The U.S. Department of Education recognizes NACSCAOM, thus allowing our students to apply for federal financial aid. 1987 At the request of patients, TAI begins SOPHIA\u00ae (School Of Philosophy and Healing In Action\u00ae) to teach laypersons the ancient wisdom - rooted in nature - that underpins its master's program in acupuncture. 1986 The Maryland Higher Education Commission empowers TAI to bestow the Master of Acupuncture (M.Ac.) degree. 1985 In May, TAI is the first school accredited by the National Accreditation Commission for Schools and Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NACSCAOM, now known as ACAOM). 1981 On June 6, the first TAI acupuncture class begins with 23 members. In Baltimore, Maryland, TAI hosts the first of five international conferences on acupuncture. This gathering brings together acupuncture leaders from across the U.S. and is the source point for the meetings that birth the three national organizations formed in 1982 - the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, the Accreditation Commission, and the Certification Commission. 1980 TAI receives approval to teach acupuncture in Maryland from the Maryland State Board for Higher Education (now the Maryland Higher Education Commission). 1978 The college amends its charter, and the name is changed to the Traditional Acupuncture Institute (TAI). 1975 One of the first acupuncture clinics in Maryland, the Centre for Traditional Acupuncture, opens on May 1 in the American City Building in Columbia, Maryland, with practitioners J. R. Worsley, Jack Daniel, Haig Ignatius, and Warren Ross joining the founders. 1974 The institution is originally incorporated in Maryland as the College of Chinese Acupuncture, U.S., by cofounders Bob Duggan and Dianne Connelly. It is the outgrowth of a program begun in Kenilworth, England, in which U.S. students studied acupuncture with Dr. J. R. Worsley. 1971 Millions in the U.S. become aware of acupuncture as columnist James Reston describes in The New York Times his successful acupuncture treatment following emergency surgery in China. "}
