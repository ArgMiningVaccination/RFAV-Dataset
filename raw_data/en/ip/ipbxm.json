[What is paclitaxel and carboplatin?] Paclitaxel and treat [lung](/cancer-information-and-support/lung-cancer), [ovarian](/cancer-information-and-support/ovarian-cancer), [womb](/cancer-information-and-support/womb-cancer) and [cervical](/cancer-information-and-support/cervical-cancer) cancer. It may sometimes be used to treat other cancers. It is best to read this information with our general information about [chemotherapy](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy) and the [type of cancer](/cancer-information-and-support/cancer-types) you have. Your doctor will talk to you about this treatment and its possible side effects before you agree ( [consent](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/your-treatment-options/giving-your-consent)) to have treatment. [How paclitaxel and carboplatin is given] You will be given paclitaxel and carboplatin in the chemotherapy day unit. A chemotherapy nurse will give it to you. During treatment you usually see a cancer doctor, a chemotherapy nurse or a specialist nurse, and a specialist pharmacist. This is who we mean when we mention doctor, nurse or pharmacist in this information. Before or on the day of treatment, a nurse or person trained to take blood (phlebotomist) will take a blood sample from you. This is to check that your blood cells are at a safe level to have chemotherapy. You will see a doctor or nurse before you have chemotherapy. They will talk to you about your blood results and ask you how you have been feeling. If your blood results are okay, the pharmacist will prepare your chemotherapy. Your nurse will tell you when your treatment is likely to be ready. Your nurse usually gives you anti-sickness (anti-emetic) drugs before the chemotherapy. The chemotherapy drugs can be given through: - a short thin tube the nurse puts into a vein in your arm or hand ( [cannula](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy/cannulas)) - a fine tube that goes under the skin of your chest and into a vein close by ( [central line](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy/central-lines)) - a fine tube that is put into a vein in your arm and goes up into a vein in your chest ( [PICC line](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy/picc-lines)). You may have [steroids](/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/steroids) as an injection before your treatment. Or you may be given steroids as tablets to take the day before your treatment. It is important to take these exactly as the doctor or nurse has explained to you. You must tell your doctor or nurse if you have not taken them for any reason. Your course of chemotherapy You usually have a course of several cycles of treatment over a few months. Your nurse or doctor will talk to you about how the treatment will be given. Each cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin usually takes 21 days (3 weeks) but this depends on the type of cancer you have. On the first day your nurse will give you paclitaxel as a drip (infusion) over 3 hours. After this, carboplatin is given as a drip over an hour. You then have no treatment for the next 20 days. At the end of the 21 days, you start your second cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin. This will be the same as the first cycle. [About side effects] We explain the most common side effects of this treatment here. We also include some less common side effects. You may get some of the side effects we mention, but you are unlikely to get all of them. You may have some side effects that we have not listed here. Always tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about any side effects you have. Your doctor can give you drugs to help control some side effects. It is important to take them exactly as your nurse or pharmacist explains. This means they will be more likely to work for you. Your nurse will give you advice about managing your side effects. After your treatment is over, most side effects start to improve. Serious and life-threatening side effects Some cancer treatments can cause severe side effects. Rarely, these may be life-threatening. Your cancer doctor or nurse can explain the risk of these side effects to you. Contact the hospital Your nurse will give you telephone numbers for the hospital. If you feel unwell or need advice, you can call them at any time of the day or night. Save these numbers in your phone or keep them somewhere safe. More information We cannot list every side effect for this treatment. There are some rare side effects that are not listed. You can visit the [electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC)](http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/) for more detailed information. [Side effects during treatment] Allergic reaction Some people have an allergic reaction while having this treatment. Before treatment, you will be given medicines to help prevent or reduce any reaction. Signs of a reaction can include: - feeling hot or flushed - shivering - itching - a skin rash - feeling dizzy - a headache - feeling breathless or wheezy - swelling of your face or mouth - pain in your back, tummy or chest. Your nurse will check you for signs of a reaction during your treatment. If you feel unwell or have any of these signs, tell them straight away. If you do have a reaction, it can be treated quickly. Sometimes a reaction happens a few hours after treatment. If you develop any signs or feel unwell after you get home, contact the hospital straight away. The drug leaks outside the vein The drug may leak outside the vein. If this happens it can damage the tissue around the vein. This is called extravasation. Extravasation is not common but if it happens it is important that it is dealt with quickly. Tell your nurse straight away if you have any stinging, pain, redness or swelling around the vein. Pain along the vein [Common side effects] Risk of infection This treatment can reduce the number of white blood cells in your blood. These cells fight infection. If the number of white blood cells is low, you are more likely to get an [infection](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/infection). A low white blood cell count is sometimes called neutropenia. An infection can be very serious when the number of white blood cells is low. It is important to get any infection treated as soon as possible. Contact the hospital straight away on the 24-hour contact number you have been given if: - your temperature goes over 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) - you suddenly feel unwell, even with a normal temperature - you have symptoms of an infection - your temperature goes below 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F). Symptoms of an infection include: - feeling shivery and shaking - a sore throat - a cough - breathlessness - diarrhoea - needing to pass urine (pee) a lot, or discomfort when you pass urine. It is important to follow any specific advice your cancer treatment team gives you. The number of white blood cells will usually return to normal before your next treatment. You will have a blood test before having more treatment. If your white blood cell count is low, your doctor may delay your treatment for a short time, until your cell count increases. Bruising and bleeding This treatment can reduce the number of platelets in your blood. Platelets are cells that help the blood to clot. If the number of platelets is low, you may bruise or bleed easily. You may have: - nosebleeds - bleeding gums - heavy periods - blood in your urine (pee) or stools (poo) - tiny red or purple spots on the skin that may look like a rash. Tell your doctor if you have any unexplained bruising or bleeding. You may need a drip to give you extra platelets. This is called a platelet transfusion. Anaemia (low number of red blood cells) This treatment can reduce the number of red blood cells in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. If the number of red blood cells is low, this is called anaemia. You may have symptoms such as: - pale skin - lack of energy - feeling breathless - feeling dizzy and light-headed. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have these symptoms. If you are very anaemic, you may need a drip to give you extra red blood cells. This is called a blood transfusion. Feeling sick Your doctor will give you anti-sickness drugs to help prevent or control sickness during your treatment. Take the drugs exactly as your nurse or pharmacist tells you. It is easier to prevent sickness than to treat it after it has started.If you [feel sick](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/nausea-and-vomiting), take small sips of fluids often and eat small amounts regularly. It is important to drink enough fluids. If you continue to feel sick, or are sick (vomit) more than once in 24 hours, contact the hospital as soon as possible. They will give you advice. Your doctor or nurse may change the anti-sickness drug to one that works better for you. Hair loss You usually lose all the hair from your head. You may also lose your eyelashes and eyebrows, as well as other body hair. [Hair loss](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/hair-loss) usually starts after your first or second treatment. [Scalp cooling](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/hair-loss/scalp-cooling) is a way of lowering the temperature of your scalp to help reduce hair loss. Your nurse can tell you if this is an option for you. Your nurse can talk to you about ways to cope with hair loss. There are ways to cover up hair loss if you want to. Your scalp may be sensitive. It is important to cover your head to protect your skin when you are out in the sun. Hair loss is usually temporary. Your hair will usually grow back after treatment finishes. Rarely, hair may not grow back. Or it may grow back thinner than before. If you are worried about this, talk to your cancer doctor or nurse. Tummy pain You may get pain or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen). You may feel bloated or have indigestion or wind. Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms as they can prescribe drugs to help. Tell them if the pain gets worse or does not get better. Diarrhoea This treatment may cause [diarrhoea](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/bladder-and-bowel-problems). Diarrhoea means passing more stools (poo) than is usual for you, or having watery or loose stools. If you have a stoma, it will be more active than usual. If you have diarrhoea: - try to drink at least 2 litres (3\u00bd pints) of fluids each day - avoid alcohol, caffeine, milk products, high-fat foods and high-fibre foods - contact the hospital for advice. Constipation This treatment can cause [constipation](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/bladder-and-bowel-problems). Constipation means that you are not able to pass stools (poo) as often as you normally do. It can become difficult or painful. Here are some tips that may help: - Drink at least 2 litres (3\u00bd pints) of fluids each day. - Eat high-fibre foods, such as fruit, vegetables and wholemeal bread. - Do regular gentle exercise, like going for short walks. If you have constipation, contact the hospital for advice. Your doctor can give you drugs called laxatives to help. Sore mouth and throat This treatment may cause a [sore mouth and throat](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/mouth-problems). You may also get mouth ulcers. This can make you more likely to get a mouth or throat infection. Use a soft toothbrush to clean your teeth or dentures in the morning, at night and after meals. If your mouth or throat is sore: - tell your nurse or doctor - they can give you a mouthwash or medicines to help - try to drink plenty of fluids - avoid alcohol, tobacco, and foods that irritate your mouth and throat. Sucking ice chips may sometimes help relieve mouth or throat pain. But if you are having radiotherapy to the head or neck, do not suck on ice. It can cause damage. Changes to your taste You may get a bitter or metal taste in your mouth. Sucking sugar-free sweets may help with this. Some foods may taste different or have no taste. Try different foods to find out what tastes best to you. [Taste changes](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/eating-problems) usually get better after treatment finishes. Your nurse can give you more advice. Numb or tingling hands or feet (peripheral neuropathy) This treatment may affect the nerves, which can cause numb, tingling or painful hands or feet. You may find it hard to fasten buttons or do other fiddly tasks. Tell your doctor if you have these symptoms. They sometimes need to lower the dose of the drug. The symptoms usually improve slowly after treatment finishes. But for some people they may never go away. Talk to your doctor if you are worried about this. Muscle or joint pain You may get pain in your muscles or joints for a few days after treatment. If this happens, tell your doctor so they can give you painkillers. Tell them if the [pain](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/pain) does not get better. Having warm baths and taking regular rests may help. Feeling tired [Feeling tired](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/tiredness) is a common side effect of this treatment. It is often worse towards the end of treatment and for some weeks after it has finished. Try to pace yourself and plan your day so you have time to rest. Gentle exercise, like short walks, can give you more energy. If you feel sleepy, do not drive or use machinery. Effects on the kidneys This treatment can affect how your kidneys work. This is usually mild and goes back to normal after treatment finishes. You will have blood tests to check how well your kidneys are working. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have blood in your urine (pee) or you are passing urine less than usual. It is important to drink at least 2 litres (3\u00bd pints) of non-alcoholic fluid each day to help protect your kidneys. Effects on the lungs This treatment can cause changes to the lungs. Tell your doctor if you develop: - a cough - wheezing - breathlessness. You should also tell them if any existing breathing problems get worse. You may have tests to check your lungs. Blood pressure This treatment may affect your blood pressure. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have ever had any problems with your blood pressure. Your nurse will check it regularly during treatment. Let them know if you feel dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive or operate machinery.

Always tell your doctor or nurse about any skin changes. They can give you advice and may give you creams or medicines to help. Any changes to your skin are usually temporary and improve when treatment finishes. Very rarely, a much more serious skin condition can develop. You may have a skin rash which then blisters, and your skin can peel. Contact the hospital straight away if this happens. Nail changes This treatment can affect [your nails](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/changes-to-your-appearance-and-body-image/skin-and-nail-changes-from-cancer-treatment). They may grow more slowly or break more easily. You might notice ridges or white or dark lines across your nails. Sometimes nails can become loose or fall out. When treatment finishes, any changes usually disappear as the nails grow out. - Moisturise your nails and cuticles regularly. - Keep your nails clipped short. - Wear gloves to protect your nails when you are doing things in the house or garden. - Keep your hands and nails clean to help avoid infection, but avoid bathing in very hot water. - Do not use false nails, gels or other acrylics during this treatment, as they may increase the risk of infection. - It is fine to wear nail varnish, but try to use a water-based polish.

Symptoms of a blood clot include: - throbbing pain, redness or swelling in a leg or arm - suddenly feeling breathless or coughing - sharp chest pain, which may be worse when you cough or take a deep breath. If you have any of these symptoms, contact the hospital straight away on the 24-hour contact number you have been given. If you cannot get through to your doctor, call the NHS urgent advice number on 111. A blood clot is serious, but it can be treated with drugs that thin the blood (anticoagulants). Your doctor or nurse can give you more information. You can help reduce the risk of developing a blood clot by: [staying active](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/preparing-for-treatment/eating-well-and-keeping-active)during treatment - drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. You may be given anticoagulants to help prevent a clot. Alcohol This treatment contains alcohol. If having alcohol is a problem for you, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

You can visit the [electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc) for more detailed information about your treatment. Vaccinations Vaccinations can reduce your risk of getting certain infections. Your doctor or nurse may talk to you about having vaccinations. Doctors usually recommend that people with cancer have a flu vaccination and a [coronavirus (covid) vaccination](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/coronavirus/vaccine). These are both inactivated vaccinations that can help reduce the risk of infection. People with weak immune systems can have these, as they are not live vaccinations. If your immune system is weak, you need to avoid live vaccinations. This is because they can make you unwell. Live vaccines contain a very weak version of the illness they are vaccinating you against. Your cancer doctor or GP can tell you more about live and inactivated vaccinations. Contraception Your doctor will advise you not to get pregnant or make someone pregnant while having this treatment. The drugs may harm a developing baby. It is important to use contraception during your treatment and for a while after treatment finishes. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can tell you more about this. Breastfeeding You are advised not to [breastfeed](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/your-treatment-options/pregnancy/breastfeeding) while having this treatment, or for some time after treatment finishes.
