Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer - Criss II, 303: For the analysis of ligands, protein modifications and interactions, as well as small molecule and metabolomics studies. Sample delivery can be achieved using one of three methods: - Direct Inject - Vanquish UHPLC - Easy-NanoLC 1200 MALDI imaging: UltrafleXtreme - Criss II, 303: - The innovative smartbeam-II laser enables ultra-high data acquisition speed in both MS and MS/MS at full systems performance. The well-established proprietary smartbeam laser provides unprecedented analytical and matrix flexibility in workflows from protein tissue imaging, intact proteins analysis, Glycoproteomics, biologics or oligo QC, to Hz repetition rates. - Bruker's patented smartbeam technology is already widely accepted as the most viable MALDI imaging laser technology. The new ultrafleXtreme now enables low pixel sizes for high spatial resolution imaging. Importantly, outstanding spectral quality and signal intensity are maintained at even the smallest laser beam diameters. - Broadband mass resolving power up to 40,000 enables precision proteomics via Bruker's unique PAN technology for highest mass resolution across a very broad mass range, not just at a selected optimum. - The novel FlashDetector combined with a minimum of 5 GS/s 10 bit digitizer and latest advances in electronics provide unmatched mass resolving power up to 40,000 and 1 ppm mass accuracy for highest confidence. - The novel and unique laser-irradiation self-cleaning Ion Source ensures robust, long-term highest-performance operation. Very long MALDI laser lifetime in combination with automated source cleaning in just minutes leads to high uptime and low maintenance costs. - Latest TOF/TOF technology: The high efficiency and sensitivity of the LID-LIFT process delivers MS/MS spectra with nominal mass resolution for peptides. Typically, full MS/MS data sets can be acquired with up to 1000 Hz laser repetition rate from low fmol levels within seconds. The Bruker bioinformatics software is perfectly adapted to analyze and visualize the match between the raw spectra and annotated peptide and protein structures. - As a result, proteins can be identified with high confidence with unmatched ease. 3. Advion expressionL Compact Mass Spectrometer (CMS) - Beirne Research Tower, Lab 308: - A single quadrupole mass spectrometer designed for the synthetic organic chemist. The instrument has unit resolution optimized for mass determinations of small molecules, peptides and proteins. Samples are introduced by either direct inject, after fractionation on an attached liquid chromatograph or by extraction from a developed thin layer chromatography plate using the Plate Express attachment.
