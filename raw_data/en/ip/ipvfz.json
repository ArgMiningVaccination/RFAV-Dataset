Among the speakers was an archbishop, the chief rabbi of Rome, and a Qatari scholar on Islamic ethics. The speakers presented their faith's perspective on ethics and palliative care. A panel session discussed whether there was any common ground among the Islamic, Christian, and Jewish approaches to palliative care. The answers noted dignity, compassion and humility, a God-centric world view, and the need to adopt a holistic approach to care that was sensitive to the patient's spiritual needs. Such was the warmth created by the answers that it seemed quite ...", "sitename": "The BMJ", "date": "2020-01-13", "cleaned_text": "Religion and spirituality in medicine: friend or foe?BMJ 2020; 368 doi: [https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m106](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m106)(Published 13 January 2020) Cite this as: BMJ 2020;368:m106 All rapid responses Rapid responses are electronic comments to the editor.

Dear Editor The title of Dr Sokol's article does not represent the content, which deals with the treating doctor's attitude to the patients religious convictions with regards to palliative care, or, more accurately, end of life care. End of life care is the last bastion of medical paternalism in Western medicine. The great triad of values we teach students, and which we usually live by - beneficence, non-maleficence and autonomy (ignoring their little brother, justice, for now), get upended in favour of the sacred task of Managing Finite Resources. How often do we hear variations on the theme of 'We won't be forced to give futile treatment' even when the treatment in question is as simple as parenteral hydration, and the futility of extra hours or days of unconscious life (beneficence/non-maleficence?) becomes the judgement of the treating team alone. And that even in the face of the previously expressed will of the patient. Autonomy - wherefore art thou? Dr Sokol expresses this paternalism succinctly if unwittingly - 'A doctor should not provide treatment that confers no benefit or harms the patient, even if the request for treatment is based on religion. Religion may be profoundly important to some patients, but it is not a trump card that can force doctors to violate their own fundamental ethical values.' In other words, benefits and harms are in the eye of the doctor-beholder, and in a conflict between the doctor's 'ethical values' and the patient's 'religious-based requests', the doctor's value system trumps, implying the patients desires are not based on ethical values, but on religion. That's a sneaky way to devalue religion-based ethics. I think we can call that ethical paternalism - my values are superior to yours, and I can impose them on the end of your life. Genuine conflicts of values regarding end of life care are in fact rare. But conflicts between patients and families' wishes and values and currently accepted medical approaches to the last days of life are not. Autonomy, in this context, needs resurrection. Competing interests: No competing interests Patient centred care and spirituality a vital ' friend' in the workplace for all. Adopting person-centred care as 'business as usual' requires fundamental changes to how services are delivered by doctors, pharmacists and others and to roles - not only those of health care professionals, but of patients too - and the relationships between patients, health care professionals and teams. A person-centred approach means doctors, pharmacists, nurses and others focusing on the elements of care, support and treatment that matter most to the patient, their family and carers. Individuals' personal characteristics can affect the extent to which they want or are able to engage in their health and care. These characteristics include their social and cultural background, their health status or condition and their beliefs and preferences. It is important for doctors, pharmacists and other to take into account these factors when designing interventions and approaches. The general thrust of workplace spirituality research has focused on individuals examining concepts such as spiritual wellbeing, spiritual distress and spiritual development; dimensions of inner life; meaningful work; interconnectedness; transcendence and alignment between values. Many empirical studies demonstrate a positive effects of workplace spirituality on job commitment, satisfaction, and performance; demonstrating results in altruism and conscientiousness, selfcareer management, reduced interrole conflict, reduced frustration, organization based selfesteem, involvement, retention, and ethical behaviour . Spirituality is a broad concept applicable to those of all faiths and none, and regardless of our own personal beliefs doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others need to develop ways to support expression of this aspect of our shared humanity in healthcare settings. Harnessing spirituality in the workplace is strongly advocated.

I agree with Daniel Sokol that doctors should not provide treatment that confers no benefit or harms the patient, even if the request for treatment is based on religion (1). In such difficult situations doctors are increasingly able to refer patients to a primary or secondary care chaplain who can help to resolve tension and relieve spiritual distress. Reference 1. Sokol D. Religion and spirituality in medicine: friend or foe? BMJ 2020;368:m106. Competing interests: No competing interests Dear Editor, The nature of this article, starting with its title, is unnecessarily provocative. Daniel Sokol notes, as if it is a surprising revelation, that religious ethicists of the same religion are not entirely in agreement. Millennia-old sacred texts do not hold set-in-stone (10 commandments-esque) rules on 21st-century palliative care, so it would be surprising if all religious ethicists were in accord. Furthermore, however, being religious is not defined by following a set of principles. For Christians it is more a way of life, trying to be in fellowship with God, following Jesus' call \"Come, follow me\". In this world of free-will and individual interpretation, it is a natural result that people with the desired same outcome take varying approaches to modern problems. Secondly, the statement that \"it is naive to believe religion and medicine can always coexist in harmony\" veers towards a paternalistic dismissal of patient autonomy. All decisions should be patient-centred: 'personal choice' would not be disputed, so why is a decision based on 'religious belief' segregated in this manner? Daniel Sokol is correct that no doctor should feel forced to prescribe an inappropriate therapeutic option, however this is the same for all patients, regardless of the reasons for which they are requesting them. Competing interests: No competing interests Dear Editor, I disagree with Daniel Sokol when he says religion is not the trump card in difficult medical decisions. This seems to imply that doctor knows best (or judge) and that medicine is the sole and fundamental arbiter of ethical guidance in conflictual situations involving religion and medicine. Medicine really is the servant of humanity and is not above free will or capacity or individual integrity. Life itself is not the ultimate untouchable, although it certainly is in most cases. For example people forfeit their lives for \"higher goals\" such as country (in war), defence of family, and for beliefs, be they religious or other - martyrs for a cause. People therefore consider health and life itself on a spectrum and religious belief at the pinnacle. Respect for a persons sincerely held religious beliefs acknowledges their right to conscience and to live and die according to their chosen beliefs. This is a diverse area and not all religions or belief systems have the same \"evidence base\" or solid basis, which makes doctors and patients lives very unsure at times like these. The natural law as expounded by St Thomas Aquinas is a good place to start an ethical foundation. Competing interests: No competing interests Dear Editor, The commandments of mercy and forgiveness are constructive in our multicultural world. Of note, there cannot be religious objections against contraception, sterilization and abortion because these methods are not mentioned in sacred texts. The La-Haraj Rule in Islam is good because it provides grounds to avoid undue hardship. According to this rule, an abortion cannot be prohibited if the unwanted pregnancy would inflict hardship to the child and/or the mother. However, certain principles of Islamic ethics are incompatible with modern legislation [1]. The principle of tooth-for-tooth retaliation is not constructive because different acts can be perceived as offenses in different cultures, so that it may perpetuate conflicts. Certain Eastern ideologies are contemplative, regard the good and the evil entitled to exist and do not deem it always necessary to struggle against the evil. Finally, atheism e.g. in the former Soviet Union was conducive in some people to immorality and crime. Ethical principles, based on modesty and mutual trust, aimed at survival of the whole of humankind, preservation of maximum wealth and human rights, should be propagated today. Given the unpredictability and compromise-resistance of criminals driven by religious motives, such motives should be regarded as aggravating circumstances in criminal justice worldwide [1]. 1.
