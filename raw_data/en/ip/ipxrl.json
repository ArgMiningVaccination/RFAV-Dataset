Traditional acupuncture works on the belief that the body is controlled by an energy flow, known as qi (pronounced \"chee\"), that travels through pathways called meridians. Acupuncturists believe that problems or blockages with the flow of energy along these meridians is responsible for many ailments. Toxins, stress, trauma, hormones and even the foods we eat can all contribute to blocking qi. While some practitioners still follow the traditional philosophy of qi, others have also started incorporating a more integrative approach, supported by research and western medicine principles. For example, many of today's acupuncturists view the acupuncture points as places that stimulate nerves, invigorating the body's natural pain fighting and healing processes. Although Dr. Kapetanakos uses traditional methods to treat some conditions, he has worked hard to establish a unique approach to acupuncture that deviates from long, often uncomfortable treatments where the patient has to lie down with multiple needles inserted for extended time periods. Needles are typically administered like an injection; placed in the appropriate area, manipulated quickly and removed. Occasionally they are left in briefly so an electrical current can be applied to increase effect. When needed a numbing agent such as lidocaine spray is used. A state of the art hand held TENS unit/microcurrent is used where the doctor intentionally grounds himself to the patient. Dr. Kapetanakos often provides deep tissue, pressure point massage to increase blood flow in affected area as needed. Powerful ultrasound therapy is also employed in muscular skeletal and joint related issues or injuries. All of these aspect of treatment cause release of deep spasms and adhesions that have been creating congestion in muscles and joints. Once that congestion is eliminated, blood flow is restored to the affected area and begins to return to normal. Normal blood flow soothes inflamed nerve fibers which can cause almost immediate reduction in inflammation. This is what can typically create instant pain relief. This unique approach is multi-functional and can create a visceral neurological change which can in many cases, completely resolve pain conditions. Have a question? We're here to help.

He comes highly recommended from some friends of mine but I was a little nervous about acupuncture. He was professional and soothing and helped me so much with my tendonitis in my shoulder. After the first visit I could fasten my seat belt without shoulder pain.\" David Pickens \"After one session, I saw an immediate relief in pain and increase in mobility due to the muscle/tendon spasm in or around a joint that Dr. Jim was able to release. He took his time to fully understand the issue both in location and in practical application and is very knowledgeable about the muscular and nerve system of the human body. I will continue to keep his visits in rotation in the future.\" Ryan Feltman \"I totally recommend going here! I personally went for thyroid issues and even though he mostly specializes in acupuncture and body pains he still gave me some great advice. We sat and discussed my condition and then he recommended me to someone that could help in more depth with my condition. He seems to be a very down to earth doctor and cares for his patients.\" David Smith Tell us about your experience at Best Massage Kissimmee. We'd love to hear your feedback.
