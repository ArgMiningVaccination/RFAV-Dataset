And copper-infused water is a great choice,\" Ayurvedic scholar Bharti Raghav, based in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, says. Simply store potable water in a copper bottle, jar or mug and drink it at regular intervals throughout the day for optimal benefits, Raghav says. For the leached copper to kill the microorganisms and bacteria, the water must be stored in the vessel at least overnight and for up to 48 hours, Raghav adds.

Copper is a great tool for recovery from wounds and injuries, says Acharya Vivek, a Delhi-based yoga and Ayurvedic scholar. \"Copper bolsters the immune system and aids in the production of new cells. It also helps heal wounds faster, especially in the stomach,\" he says. Vivek has been drinking copper-charged water first thing in the morning for years and hasn't fallen sick in quite a while. \"Copper is an essential trace mineral that is vital to human health. Storing water in copper vessels creates a natural purification process that kills microorganisms, moulds, fungi, algae and bacteria,\" he says.

In a 2012 study, published in the Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition, scientists studied the effects of storage in a copper pot on drinking water contaminated with micro-organisms, including harmful bacteria such as E coli and salmonella. For this, bacteria-contaminated water was stored in copper pots for 16 hours at room temperature. When the water was tested again, no traces of bacteria could be found. The scientists discovered that the water's pH level had also increased, meaning that it had become more alkaline. In a 2014 study titled \"Economical solution to remove microbes from harvested roof water\", researchers discovered that copper vessels had a significant inhibitory effect on bacteria in the water after only a few hours of exposure. The researchers concluded: \"The findings indicate that a vessel or pot made up of copper could be used for antimicrobial treatment for purification of drinking water.\" [kidney function](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3169831/world-kidney-day-how-avoid-problems-yours-diet-plays-key?module=inline&pgtype=article)and helping the optimal absorption of nutrients from food. \"When water is stored in a copper container, the mineral gets leached into it, which (when consumed) helps in breaking down food in our gut and improving our digestion,\" she says.
