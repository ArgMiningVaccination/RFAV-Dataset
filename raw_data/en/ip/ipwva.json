That's exactly why rose water gives us some serious heart eyes. What is Rose Water? Derived from steeping rose petals in distilled water (like you would a made-to-drink tea), rose water has been used for centuries to add a little oomph to beauty and home rituals. Today, we're rounding up three ways to keep rose water in fresh rotation in your own life. Spiritual Uses of Rose Water 1. Meditate On Its Scent Our [Reviving Aura Face Mist Spray](https://www.keyssoulcare.com/reviving-aura-mist/41000.html) \u2014 which features both rose essence and \"resurrection plant\" [rose of Jericho](https://www.keyssoulcare.com/spirit/why-were-living-for-rose-of-jericho.html) is just one way to take in its olfactory perks. But, trust us, it has a lot more to offer than a gorgeous scent. For starters, Alicia counts rose as a go-to for opening her heart and third eye to a clearer sense of self. Plus, studies have found that rose water and rose essence oil generally elevate our mood. 2. Sweeten Your Sipping Game \"Rosewater brings a floral note to food, and enhances the natural sweetness in a dish,\" says food stylist, health coach, and chef Carla Contreras. \"Like a perfume, a little goes a long way.\" She notes to make sure to use food grade rosewater, versus the kind you'd find in the health or beauty aisle. Want to bring a little bloom into your diet? Whip up this easy (and tasty) beverage: Fresh Fruit with Rose Water \u2014 Serves 1 - 1 cup fresh seasonal fruit - 1/8 tsp. rose water - 1/8 tsp. honey or coconut sugar - 1/16 tsp. sea salt - 3-4 mint leaves, chopped finely Mix the fruit, rose water, honey, sea salt, and mint together. Enjoy immediately or store in the fridge and eat within 24 hours. 3. Rose Water for Skin Care Ever notice how lush and supple fresh rose petals feel against your fingertips? That's a hint of what rose and rose water do for skin and pores.
