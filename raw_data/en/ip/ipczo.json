The Kwajalein Hourglass is an authorized publication for military personnel, federal employees, contractor workers and their families assigned to U.S. Army Garrison-Kwajalein Atoll. THE KWAJALEIN HOURGLASS Delivering the thousands of pounds of mail that arrive on U.S. Kwajalein Atoll each month is a team effort. Pictured here, logis - tics personnel assist in cargo offload operations at Bucholz Army Airfield. Hours after the telltale roar of a cargo flight fades from Bucholz Army Airfield, garrison residents line up at the respec - tive post office to claim their mail. Receiving and processing massive quantities of bulk mail requires the co - ordinated efforts of multiple teams and is never an easy task. On the hot tarmac, time evaporates like sweat as crews move to efficiently deliver their freight to its respective warehouses and receiv - ing areas. After leaving the airfield, drivers and heavy equipment operators manning forklifts offload cargo at warehouse sites where it will be processed and de - livered to recipients. Within 20 minutes of receiving their first load, the Kwajalein post office crew, led by Postal Operations Manag - er James Smith, can separate boxed and bagged mail and begin scanning in the contents of an entire pallet. Next, the small but dedicated team works to un - load and sort each piece of mail before delivery. Over the holidays, each delivery is big - ger than the last. Mail pallets delivered via a C-17 are sometimes loaded with freight bailed to a height of more than six feet. In fiscal year 2020, the post of - fice processed and delivered more than 494,617 pounds of incoming mail and 73,762 pounds of outgoing mail. Overall, that is over 284 tons of mail exchanged. MAIL CALL It's tough work, but the post office team cares about the community. The crew logged hours on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day to ensure communi - ty members received packages and mail in time. The garrison community appreciates all of the team's hard work to get the mail to Kwajalein. Thousands of pounds of mail. Bailed pallets of recently arrived mail stretch into the distance. For these logistics personnel, the work has just begun. Next, they will deliver the mail to various island teams that will process and deliver the freight to its destination. In 2020, airfield support crews also began wearing personal protective equipment while handling freight to prevent potential spread of COVID-19.

ONE ARMY FAMILY ONLINE, OFFLINE Army regulation 600-200 describes the harmful practice of bullying. \"Bullying is any conduct whereby a service mem - ber or members, regardless of service, rank or position, intends to exclude or reject another service member through cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning, or harmful behavior, which results in diminishing the other service member's dignity, position or status. Ab - sent outside intervention, bullying will typically continue without any identifi - able end-point. Bullying may include an abuse of au - thority. Bullying tactics include, but are not limited to, making threats, spreading rumors, social isolation, and attacking someone physically, verbally or through the use of electronic media.\" According to the reg, every service member and civilian who lives and works on Kwajalein Atoll deserves the right to work and live in an environment free of hostility. Please, think twice be - fore you post. 4 Saturday, FEBRUARY 6, 2021 / Volume 62 Number 6 The Kwajalein HourglassIn the past three months, the Grace Sher - wood Library has received a lot of love. The facility sports a new air conditioning system, three new air purifiers, a dehu - midifier and a carpet cleaning. A dedicated, fulltime custodian cleans bookshelves twice per week. Booklovers will also be most pleased about the new - est addition. After more than two years as a lending library, GSL has a new, electronic card catalog system. The catalog system will optimize in - ventory and help inform decisions for future book and material resources, according to Amber Bates, MWR equip - ment rentals, library lead and adminis - trative assistant. \"The previous library information system subscription expired, and a de - cision was made not to renew it in favor of implementing the Alexandria Library Management system used by the Kwa - jalein School System,\" wrote Bates in an email to the Kwajalein Hourglass. The lack of a catalog system hasn't slowed down foot traffic at the Library. Each week, the facility hosts young readers for story time. There are quiet spaces for computer use, reading and studying, and games and learning toys available for young visitors to try. Staff are reviewing library texts on hand and checking out available ave - nues to build the collection. Many of the volumes on the GSL shelves are legacy texts and donations by island residents. GSL does not receive funding from the Army, so donations of new and gently used books for adults and children are encouraged. Bates, an avid reader of nonfiction, re - ported the first big donation of library books has arrived through an anony -NEW STORIES AHEAD FOR GRACE SHERWOOD mous donor. Patrons should plan to re - turn their books and register in the sys - tem, said Bates. All Kwajalein residents will need their K-badge and to have their contact information and email ad - dresses recorded in the catalog system by a staff member during a library visit. \"The catalog system will also help ensure that materials borrowed from the library are returned by patrons in a timely manner so that more island resi - dents can enjoy them,\" said Bates. News of the catalog has several com - munity members asking about future opportunities to volunteer at the library. \"If the job of cataloguing the entire li - brary collection becomes too time-con - suming for the current library staff, then yes, we would invite volunteers from the community to assist us,\" add - ed Bates. \"We've had students from the high school volunteer here in the past to earn service hours and it's been very helpful.\" Grace Sherwood Library Celebrates Black History Month February is Black History Month.

On Aug. 28, 1963, more than 200,000 Americans gathered in Washington, D.C., for a political rally known as the March on Washington for Jobs and Free - dom. Organized by civil rights and religious groups, the event was designed to shed light on the political and social chal - lenges African Americans faced across the United States. The march became a key moment in the struggle for civil rights in the U.S., and it culminated in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014which ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u2014is considered one of the greatest legislative achievements of the civil rights movement. First proposed by Kennedy, it sur - vived strong opposition from Southern members of Congress and was signed into law by Lyndon B. Johnson. At the March on Washington, Kenne - dy expressed his thoughts: \"We have witnessed today in Washington tens of thousands of Americans, both Negro and White, exercising their right to as - semble peaceably and direct the widest possible attention to a great national issue. Efforts to secure equal treatment and equal opportunity for all without regard to race, color, creed, or nation - ality are neither novel nor difficult to understand. What is different today is the intensified and widespread public awareness of the need to move forward in achieving these objectives\u2014objec - tives which are older than this nation.\" By the Department of Defense The Department of Defense is commem - orating the 75th Anniversary of World War II by recognizing the contributions and sacrifices made by Service members as well as those who served on the home front. During the anniversary, we pay tribute to those Americans who undauntedly and courageously contributed to the de - fense of our nation. Often overlooked are the valiant efforts of African Americans. African Americans played an immeasurable role in the Unit - ed States' Armed Forces during World War II, serving bravely and with distinc - tion from the initial attack on Pearl Har - bor to the last days of the Pacific cam - paign. Although the United States Armed Forces weren't officially segregated until 1948, WWII laid the foundation for post- war integration of the military. Over 2.5 million African-American men registered for the draft, and Black women volunteered in large numbers. While serving in the Army, Army Air Forces, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and War Department they served with distinction, made valuable contributions to the war effort, and earned well-de - served praise and commendations for their struggles and sacrifices. This month, the DoD pays tribute to the African American men and women who not only forever changed the course of history but also redefined the United States military. \"Our debt to the heroic men and val - iant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will nev - er forget their sacrifices.\" - President Harry S. Truman GREAT MOMENTS FOR CHANGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY In 1948, President Harry Truman en - acted Executive Order Number 9981, which directed equality of treatment and opportunity in all of the United States Armed Forces. This order, in time, led to the end of racial segregation in the mili - tary forces. On March 6, 1960, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, prohib - iting discrimination in federal govern - ment hiring on the basis of race, reli - gion, or national origin and establishing the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, the EEOC.

The information that follows is current as of Jan. 30. A COVID-19 test is not required for any outbound travelers on the ATI. A COVID-19 test is not required if you are flying on United Airlines on official government orders. All other United Airlines pas - sengers must have a negative COVID-19 test 1-3 days before travel. If You Need A Test You must contact the hospital at 5-2223 to schedule a time for your test. The Kwajalein Hospital is closed Sunday and Monday. The cost of the COVID-19 test is $125, due at the time of visit for everyone except for active duty service mem - bers and their family members. Cash, credit card and check are accepted forms of payment. If you have previously tested positive for COVID-19 you must schedule an appointment with a provider 10 days prior to departure. Passengers must bring a copy of their United flight itineraries at the time of their appointment for proof of flight. For Outbound United Airlines Passengers Flying Without Government Orders Passengers will visit the hospi - tal the day before their flight de - parts. Testing hours: 9 - 11 a.m. Results pick-up time is flexible on the day of departure. These CDC requirements do not change or impact the state of Hawaii's testing requirement or quarantine procedure. UNITED AIRLINES POLICIES FOR DEPARTURE All United customers must also comply with the following re - quirements: Presentation of a disclo - sure and attestation form. The form can be found on the CDC website https://www.cdc.gov/ quarantine/pdf/attachment-a-glob - al-passenger-disclosure-and-attes - tation-2021-01-12-p.pdf and will also be available at the departure airport. Customers are encouraged to print and complete the form prior to arriving at the airport. Check-In. All international orig - inating customers will be required to check-in with a Customer Service representative to verify digital or paper documentation. This mirrors the process we've set up within the U.S. for many international destina - tions. Failure to Comply Will Result In Boarding Denied. Custom - ers who do not show proof of a test or refuse to test prior to travel will be denied boarding. Denied board - ing compensation will not be paid. Customers in this situation shall be offered a refund or rebooked for a later date at no additional charge. Customers at Kwajalein's air - port boarding United Airlines flights need to present the items described below: Customers with a negative test result need to present written or electronic documentation which clearly indicates: Customer name.

Results must state \"nega - tive,\" \"SARS-CoV-2 RNA not de - tected\" or \"SARS-CoV-2 antigen not detected.\" A test marked \"invalid\" isnot acceptable Customers who have previously tested positive must present written or elec - tronic documentation, dated within the last 90 days, of recovery from COVID-19 after previous infection. This should be in the form of a posi - tive viral test result and a letter on offi - cial letterhead that contains the name, address and phone number of a licensed healthcare provider or public health offi - cial stating that the passenger has been cleared for travel. NOTE: These documentation requirements do not apply to cus - tomers flying from U.S. territories such as Guam to the mainland. 11 Saturday, FEBRUARY 6, 2021 / Volume 62 Number 6 The Kwajalein Hourglass 1) Question: Can a COVID-19 vaccine make me sick with COVID-19? Answer: No. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines currently in de - velopment in the United States contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. This means that a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19. There are several different types of vaccines in development. All of them teach our immune systems how to rec - ognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. 2) Question: How long does it take before I develop immunity to COVID-19 after immuniza - tion? Answer: It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (pro - tection against the virus that causes COVID-19) after vaccination. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just af - ter vaccination and still get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. 3) Question: After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test? Answer: No. Neither the recently au - thorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID- 19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States can cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a cur - rent infection.4) Question: Will the Vaccine result in positive antibody tests? Answer: If your body develops an immune response\u2014the goal of vaccina - tion\u2014there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a pre - vious infection and that you may have some level of protection against the vi - rus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect anti - body testing results. 5) Question: Will a COVID-19 vaccination protect me from getting sick with COVID-19? Answer: Yes. COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19. Being protected from getting sick is important because even though many people with COVID- 19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness, have long-term health effects, or even die. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you don't have an increased risk of developing severe complications. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work. 6) Question: Will a COVID-19 vaccine alter my DNA? Answer: No. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. Messenger RNA vaccines\u2014also called mRNA vaccines\u2014are the first COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the Unit - ed States. mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. The mRNA from a COVID-19 vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept. This means the mRNA cannot affect or inter - act with our DNA in any way. Instead, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work with the body's natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against fu - ture infection. That immune response and making antibodies is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. Reference for questions and answers 1 - 6: Last Updated Jan. 4, 2021.

Answer: Yes, it is safe. This vaccine does not contain seafood, egg or latex. What are the ingredients in the Pfizer BioN - Tech COVID-19 vaccine? The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 and sucrose. https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download 8) Question: Are there any health issues that prevent the safe administration of this vac - cine? Answer: The COVID vaccine is safe to administer with the exception of the fol - lowing: Who should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine? You should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if you: had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine. https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download Based on CDC recommendations, populations where informed decision making may be provided include: HIV (no data to support, but a potential con - cern), weakened/compromised immune system (based on current diagnosis or certain medications), autoimmune dis - orders (no data to support, but poten - tial concern), personal history of Guil -lain-Barre syndrome (no cases of GBS associated with this vaccine). The independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) best practice guidelines for immunization do not include a history of GBS as a precau - tion to vaccination with other vaccines. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ 2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underly - ing- conditions.html 11) Question: Who should get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine? Answer: FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioN - Tech COVID-19 Vaccine in individuals 16-years of age and older. 12) Question: What are known potential side effects from im - munizations? Answer: Injection site pain, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, feeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopa - thy). 13) Question: What is the pro - cedure for COVID-19 immuniza - tions at Kwajalein Hospital? Answer: Individuals will be orga - nized/scheduled into groups of up to 12/half-hour, to prevent wasting vials of vaccine, (each vial contains 6 vaccine doses). After receiving the vaccine, peo - ple will be observed in our waiting area for at least 15-minutes following vaccine administration to watch for signs of se - vere allergic reaction. During that time individuals can schedule themselves for their 2nd immunization in 3-weeks. 14) Question: Is Kwajalein hos - pital capable of managing se - vere allergic reactions? Answer: Yes. All individuals receiving the COVID vaccine will be observed for at least 15 minutes (the timeline where severe allergic reactions are most likely to occur). If an individual exhibits signs/ symptoms of tongue/throat swelling and difficulty breathing, Kwajalein Hos - pital is equipped to provide emergency airway support and administer allergy medications. 15) Question: If I've already had COVID-19 (confirmed by prior positive PCR or antibody test), is it recommended that I still get the vaccine? Answer: Yes. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, you should be vaccinated re - gardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection. If you were treated for COVID-19 symptoms with monoclo - nal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts do not yet know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. The immunity someone gains from hav - ing an infection, called \"natural immu - nity,\" varies from person to person. It is rare for someone who has had COVID-19 to get infected again. It also is uncommon for people who do get COVID-19 again to get it within 90 days of when they recovered from their first infection. We won't know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we have more data on how well the vaccines work. Both natural immunity and vaccine-in - duced immunity are important aspects of COVID- 19 that experts are working to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence be - comes available. https://www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/2019- ncov/vaccines/faq. html 16) Question: Can you safely deliver COVID-19 and Influenza vaccines simultaneously? Answer: There is no evidence of harm if another immunization is administered simultaneously, but our goal is to ensure optimal safety and immune system re - sponse. As such, Kwajalein Hospital will not be co-administering other vaccines to people receiving the COVID vaccine. The CDC recommends waiting at least 14 days before getting any other vac - cine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. And if you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine. If a COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently given within 14 days of another vaccine, you do not need to restart the COVID-19 vaccine series; you should still complete the series on schedule. When more data are available on the safety and effective - ness of COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines, CDC may update this recommendation. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/ vaccines/faq.htmlwww.cdc.gov/coronavirus/vaccinesU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 12/23/20Facts about COVID-19 vaccines Vaccines (shots) are one of the tools we have to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Different types of COVID-19 vaccines will be available. Most of these vaccines are given in two shots, one at a time and spaced apart. The first shot gets your body ready.

Answer: There is limited data about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for peo - ple who are pregnant. Until findings are available from clin - ical trials and additional studies, only limited data is available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA vac - cines, administered during pregnancy: Limited data is currently available from animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. No safety concerns were demonstrat - ed in rats that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy; studies of the Pfizer-Bi - oNTech vaccine are ongoing. Studies in people who are pregnant are planned. Both vaccine manufacturers are monitoring people in the clinical tri - als who became pregnant. CDC and the Food and Drug Admin - istration have safety monitoring sys - tems in place to capture information about vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor reports. mRNA vaccines do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and, there - fore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not in - teract with a person's DNA because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell. Cells break down the mRNA quickly. Based on how mRNA vaccines work, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are preg - nant. However, the actual risks of mRNA vaccines to the pregnant person and her fetus are unknown because these vac - cines have not been studied in pregnant women. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/ vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html. Last Updated Jan. 7, 2021. 18) Question: What is known about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccination in relation to breast - feeding?Answer: There are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactat - ing women or on the effects of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. mRNA vac - cines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. People who are breastfeeding and are part of a group recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, such as healthcare personnel, may choose to be vaccinated. 19) Question: What dosing in - terval will Kwajalein Hospital employ for the COVID-19 vac - cine? Answer: Consistent with CDC guide - lines and to enable an organized admin - istration of vaccines, Kwajalein Hospital plans to institute a minimum of three weeks between the two doses. Populations at Most Risk from the Disease but not the Immu - nization Reference for Questions 18 and 19 https:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-ex - tra- precautions/people-with-medical-condi - tions.html How Vaccines Work The Immune System: The Body's Defense Against Infection To understand how COVID-19 vaccines work, it helps to first look at how our bodies fight illness. When germs, such as the virus that causes COVID-19, invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This invasion, called an infection, is what causes illness. Our immune system uses several tools to fight infection. Blood contains red cells, which carry oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immune cells, which fight infection. Different types of white blood cells fight infection in differ - ent ways: Macrophages are white blood cells that swallow up and digest germs and dead or dying cells. The mac - rophages leave behind parts of the invading germs called antigens. The body identifies antigens as danger - ous and stimulates antibodies to at - tack them. B-lymphocytes are defensive white blood cells. They produce antibod - ies that attack the pieces of the virus left behind by the macrophages. T-lymphocytes are another type of de - fensive white blood cell. They attack cells in the body that have already been infected. The first time a person is infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After the infection, the person's immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease. The body keeps a few T-lymphocytes, called memory cells, that go into action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again. When the familiar antigens are detected, B-lymphocytes produce antibodies to attack them. Experts are still learning how long these memory cells protect a person against the virus that causes COVID-19. How COVID-19 Vaccines Work COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies de - velop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of \"memory\" T- lympho - cytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination. There - fore, it is possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vacci - nation and then get sick because the vac - cine did not have enough time to provide protection. Sometimes after vaccination, the pro - cess of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symp - toms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. Types of Vaccines Currently, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are or soon will be undergoing large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials in the United States. Be - low is a description of how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognize and protect us from the virus that caus - es COVID-19. None of these vaccines can give you COVID-19. mRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/vaccinesU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 12/23/20Facts about COVID-19 vaccines Vaccines (shots) are one of the tools we have to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

Protein subunit vaccines include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that cause COVID-19 instead of the en - tire germ. Once vaccinated, our immune system recognizes that the proteins don't belong in the body and begins mak - ing T-lymphocytes and antibodies. If we are ever infected in the future, memory cells will recognize and fight the virus. Vector vaccines contain a weakened version of a live virus\u2014a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19\u2014 that has genetic material from the virus that causes COVID-19 inserted in it (this is called a viral vector). Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic ma - terial gives cells instructions to make a protein that is unique to the virus that causes COVID-19. Using these instructions, our cells make copies of the protein. This prompts our bodies to build T- lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future. Most COVID-19 Vaccines Require More Than One Shot All but one of the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States use two shots. The first shot starts building protection. A second shot a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer. One vaccine in Phase 3 clinical tri - als only needs one shot. The Bottom Line Getting vaccinated is one of many steps you can take to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Protection from COVID-19 is critically important because for some people, it can cause severe ill -ness or death. Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are ex - posed. Other steps, like masks and social distancing, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccina - tion and following CDC's recommenda - tions to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19.

You may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. These side effects may feel like flu and may even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Common side effects On the arm where you got the shot: Pain SwellingThroughout the rest of your body: Fever Tiredness Chills Headache Helpful tips If you have pain or discomfort, talk to your doctor about taking an over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. To reduce pain and discomfort where you got the shot: Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area. Use or exercise your arm.To reduce discomfort from fever: Drink plenty of fluids. Dress lightly.Ask your healthcare provider about getting started with v-safe Use your smartphone to tell CDC about any side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. You'll also get reminders if you need a second dose Learn more about v-safe . www.cdc.gov/vsafeWhen to call the doctor In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider: If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days Remember Side effects may feel like flu and even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. With most COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots in order for them to work. Get the second shot even if you have side effects after the first one, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get a second shot. It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines that require 2 shots may not protect you until a week or two after your second shot. It's important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic as we learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions.

Here are a few of the lesser-known benefits of drink - ing water. Water helps the body reduce toxins Water can relieve nausea Water improves the body's overall immunity Water helps dissolve minerals and nutrients in the body Water carries oxygen and nutrients to cells It might sound crazy, but water can assist the body in regulating its own temperature Hydration is just as important for pets as for humans. Bring water or ice for your dog to enjoy on their next walk. Water provides much-needed mois - ture to help maintain delicate tissues in the mouth, eyes and nose HEALTH TIPS What is heartworm disease? Heartworm disease is a life-threatening parasitic infection that can be transmit - ted to all dogs and cats through mosquito bites. Heartworm disease is 100% preventable. Heartworm disease is NOT seasonal, so be sure to keep your pet up-to-date on monthly heartworm prevention.
