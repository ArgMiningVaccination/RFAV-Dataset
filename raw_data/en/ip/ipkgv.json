When the [American College of Nutrition](https://www.americancollegeofnutrition.org/students) offered a scholarship contest for aspiring professionals interested in an aspect of nutrition science, a faculty member had Lucinda Rost in mind. Lucinda Rost\u2014who earned a master's in integrative oncology and is currently working on her [Ph.D. from Saybrook in Mind Body Medicine](https://www.saybrook.edu/areas-of-study/mind-body-medicine/)\u2014jumped at the chance to enter and found out she won in September. She was also a first-time attendee of ACN's 58th Annual Conference from November 8-10 at The Westin Alexandria. \"The conference was reinforcement of the base knowledge that I have had through both experiential and academic learning,\" Rost says. \"I've been to many conferences, and I really have to say the ACN one was the best I've ever attended\u2014extremely educated speakers and vendors, user friendly presentations, well-organized, and top-notch students. I'm kind of an ACN groupie now.\" As the recipient of the Community Outreach and Education Scholarship, Rost was required to create a demonstration showcasing her initiative, leadership, and organizational skills through a community outreach or educational event on the topic of nutrition within the past 12 months. \"I was very fortunate with this option because I had already been presenting different briefings to my community. My demonstration focused on the connection between nutrition and cancer. As a cancer thriver since 2012, nutrition was my very first step in the process of healing. I researched information about how nutrition affects and can better improve my body, and how I could achieve body balance.\" Rost has also done presentations on mind body medicine for communities and focus groups. \"I like to serve those who serve,\" Rost says. \"I highlight various organizations in the community. The Sierra Women's Club was the organization I featured in one of my quarterly newsletters. For that newspaper, the topics are about women's health and overall nutrition. Sierra Women's Club has business and community leaders of diverse interests, talents, and backgrounds all united with a dedication to community improvement through volunteer service. I used my newsletter and community project with the Sierra Women's Club for my ACN scholarship submission.\" Every month, the group members meet to discuss stress, energy, medicine, and balancing their busy lives through prepared presentations. They also spread the word about educational courses in the surrounding areas. Rost's company Unique Body Balance, an alternative and holistic health service organization, also brands her company's motto by using the hashtag #ChangingLivesMatter. \"It's all about helping individuals readjust patterns that are not working for them,\" Rost says. \"From nutritional wellness, they get to learn to eat better and make better choices. I've got a Jin Shin Jyutsu practitioner who also does energy work for my clients that can't walk very well. By the time they're done with her, they're walking and happy. We're changing lives. Not only do we see it in our clients, but I see it in my practitioners as well. It reaffirms the value of what they do.\" Although her clients are usually adults who may or may not be cancer survivors, she is also interested in working with other groups who are interested in mind-body medicine. Next up on her to-do list is sponsoring a Girl Scout troop. \"They get to learn about Nutrition 101,\" Rost says. \"I make it fun for these young girls who are also helping their community. I'm always looking for groups that are already serving those in their communities. If I can drop that little pebble in the pond and let it grow, I can reach out to groups that are already reaching out to their own communities. These efforts will then multiply and hopefully benefit across the world. We continue our hope in knowing that changing "}
