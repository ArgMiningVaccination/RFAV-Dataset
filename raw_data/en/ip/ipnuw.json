Dysfunction can lead to susceptibility to infection and cancer on the one hand, and to allergy and autoimmunity on the other. Immunotherapies are being developed to tip this balance one way or the other - for example to engineer cytokines to create an immune response against mutated self in cancer, or engineer antigen delivery to inverse vaccinate against an autoimmune disease to re-establish immunological tolerance to self. Immunity to tumors is particularly complex. Normal tissues display regulatory biomolecules that attenuate potential immune responses to prevent autoimmunity; cancers exploit these mechanisms to actively resist killing by the immune system once mutated proteins in the tumor have been detected. These regulatory biomolecules, referred to as checkpoints, are promising targets for cancer immunotherapy, to block these inhibitors of anti-cancer immunity, yet in clinic they work in a minority of patients. Moreover, immune regulatory biomolecules, cytokines and chemokines, are also promising candidates to develop anti-cancer immunity. The difficulty with these drugs and potential drugs is their frequently high toxicity, since they tip the delicate balance described above and can causes anti-self responses. We are exploring means by which to target these powerful immunotherapeutics to tumors, to enhance their efficacy and reduce their toxicity. In addition to usual vaccines to induce protection to a pathogen, so-called inverse vaccination to induce antigen-specific tolerance is of high interest. We are exploring biological approaches to deliver protein antigens in a tolerogenic manner, including targeting antigen to particular cell subsets in the liver. We have shown the ability to induce antigen-specific anergy as well as T regulatory responses, working in models of autoimmunity and of immune response to protein drugs. In autoimmunity as in cancer, cytokines can modulate immunity to blunt autoaggressive responses. We are investigating means by which to target these biomolecular to sites of immune recognition in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Jeffrey Hubbell is Eugene Bell Professor in Tissue Engineering at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering of the University of Chicago. His research uses biomaterials and protein engineering approaches to investigate topics in regenerative medicine and immunotherapeutics. In regenerative medicine, Hubbell focuses on biomaterial matrices that mimic the extracellular matrix and on growth factor - extracellular matrix interactions, working in a variety of animal models of regenerative medicine. In immunotherapeutics, he focuses on nanomaterials in vaccines that target lymphoid-resident antigen presenting cells and on protein engineering approaches to deliver antigen to the spleen and liver for inverse vaccines to induce tolerance to protein drugs and in autoimmunity. His interests are both basic and translational, having founded or co-founded six biomedical companies based on his technology, namely Focal, acquired by Genzyme; Kuros Immune (cancer immunotherapy); and HeioThera, (autoimmunity and inflammation). He was previously on the faculty of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne where he served as Director of the Institute of Bioengineering and Dean of the School of Life Sciences, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, University of Zurich, California Institute of Technology, and the University of Texas Austin. Hubbell is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Inventors, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He holds a B.S. from Kansas State University and a Ph.D. from Rice University. "}
