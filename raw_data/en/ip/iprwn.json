To understand pediatric injuries that involve the musculoskeletal system, it's important to be aware of the differences between children and adults in this regard. The main difference is that children's bones are growing; adults' bones have stopped growing. This bone growth happens in two ways - by growing lengthwise and widthwise. The bone grows lengthwise in an area at the ends of the bones called the epiphyseal plate or growth plate, in the region known as the metaphysis. The widthwise growth occurs on the surface of the bone. Growing bone has inherent areas of weakness due to the growth process. In fact, children's tendons and ligaments are relatively stronger than the growth plate; therefore, with severe trauma the growth plate will give way before the ligament. On the other hand, children's bones and muscles are more elastic and heal faster compared to adults. Due to the differences in growing bone, the patterns of injuries are different from mature bone. There are two main types of bone injuries: one is an acute injury in which violent forces are applied at one time; the second is from chronic, recurring stresses applied to the bone over a prolonged period of time. Growth plate injuries can cause cessation (stoppage) of growth of the bone, resulting in limb-length discrepancy, angular deformity or altered joint mechanics; possibly causing permanent disabilities. The chronic recurring stresses are often termed overuse syndromes, but also include stress fractures, which can lead to changes that affect the joints, causing early arthritic changes. Stress fractures, if not managed correctly, can result in complete fracture. Adolescents who are in the peak period of linear growth - often termed a growth spurt - are most vulnerable because of imbalances in strength and flexibility and changes in the biomechanical properties of bone. Sports involving contact and jumping have the greatest injury risk. Most chiropractors who treat pediatric patients are aware of these injuries and the potential causes related to the growing musculoskeletal system. They have been uniquely trained to understand the musculoskeletal system, making them excellent resources for the management of sports-injuries. Why You Need Enzymes You're undoubtedly aware of the role a balanced diet can play in healthy aging and disease prevention, but do you know there is a non-nutritive element that can also exert a profound positive influence on your health? Proper function of the human body is dependent on the continuous activity of thousands of different enzymes. These essential biological molecules are the catalysts in all of the body's biochemical reactions. Here are three important health benefits attributable to enzymes. Talk to your doctor for more information about enzymes and their value in maintaining health and wellness. 1. Digestion: Digestive enzymes, which are secreted in saliva and pancreatic juices, are responsible for the breakdown of food. This process helps facilitate proper nutrient absorption. In patients with pancreatic insufficiency or with food allergies, supplementation with a mild digestive enzyme blend can enhance nutrient uptake as well as gastrointestinal comfort. In addition, anyone who consumes a diet high in processed foods may benefit from enzyme supplementation. 2. Inflammation: Another known benefit of enzyme supplementation is the treatment of inflammatory and immune mediated conditions. Proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain, have the ability to neutralize inflammatory chemicals to aid in the healing of damaged tissues. It is believed that proteolytic enzymes have the ability to promote healing by decreasing capillary permeability, improving circulation, and dissolving fibrin clot deposits. Enzymes have also been shown to have positive effects on natural killer cells and macrophages, thus enhancing the overall immune response and body's defense against infection.: 3. Cancer: The use of enzymes in cancer therapy was first proposed by the embryologist Dr. John Beard in the early 1900s. In his research, The Enzyme Therapy of Cancer, published in 1911, Dr. Beard discussed his theory on injection of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes as a form of cancer therapy. Cancer cells, as well as nearly all pathogens, are often protected by a thick, protein-based, fibrin coating. Proteolytic enzymes have the ability to assist in the breakdown of this fibrin coating, allowing the body's immune functions to take action against proliferating cancer cells. Although the original research was conducted almost a century ago, proteolytic enzymes are being used as a new and innovative way to combat cancer. One of the simplest ways to enhance your enzyme levels is to increase your intake of raw foods. Uncooked, unprocessed foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables contain natural enzymes that support digestion and overall enzymatic activity. However, since many Americans consume inadequate amounts of these foods, supplementation may be necessary to ensure enzyme activity is supported. Increasing your intake of enzymes can help support every mode of cellular activity as well as improve overall body communication. Antibiotics and Childhood IBD Antibiotics are medications that fight bacterial infections. That means if your medical doctor ever prescribes an antibiotic to fight your child's cold, flu, cough (in most cases) sore throat (unless strep) and even bronchitis - all of which are caused by viruses - the antibiotic won't do any good and will be exposing your child to an unnecessary drug with potential side effects. Unfortunately, studies have shown that doctors do prescribe antibiotics for viral infections, and that sometimes, it's to appease the parent, who doesn't want to hear that their child's malaise will improve on its own in a few days or so. Between unnecessary prescribing for viral infections and appropriate prescribing for bacterial infections, children can end up taking several courses of antibiotics in their early years. That can be a problem for several reasons, not the least of which is that, as a recent study suggests, they can end up with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) later in life. While researchers did not find a clear cause-and-effect relationship between antibiotic use in year one and IBD in childhood, they did notice that children diagnosed with the condition were more likely to have taken antibiotics (one or more courses) in their first year compared to children without IBD. Your doctor can tell you more about IBD and the dangers of antibiotic use in infancy, childhood or any age. What About Splenda (Sucralose)? This is from two sources: \"Tired All the Time?\" FIRST, \"A Magazine For Women On The Go\" June 26, 2006, pp 25-26. AND Splenda: Is it Safe or Not? By Janet Starr Hull, Ph.D., Pickle Press, 2005 Sucralose can cause one to suffer from sluggishness, fatigue, make legs feel like lead weights, mood swings, severe cramps (female), intense pain, painful bowel movements, bloating, dizziness, confusion, and more. Seven (7) out of ten (10) American women consume Sucralose daily. \"The artificial sweetener Sucralose (Splenda) is made by binding three chlorine atoms to a molecule of sugar. The problem: Chlorine reacts with organic material to create chlorination by-products (CBPs) that can trigger chronic symptoms like fatigue, headaches and brain fog, as well as reproductive and immune problems.\" \"Sucralose is found in nearly 4,000 food, beverage and health-care products, including diet drinks, ice cream, protein bars, vitamins and toothpaste.\" It is also found in gum, over-the-counter drugs, and salad dressings. Consumer use of Sucralose has grown annually by 10%. 70% of those who consume Sucralose (Splenda) will have a sensitivity to it and develop symptoms. If one is experiencing symptoms from consuming Sucralose (Splenda), the solution is to stop taking it and to \"Flush Your System\" as follows: - \"Supplementing daily [for 2 months] with 600 mg of the amino acid N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) boosts the body's production of glutathione, according to a study in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. This antioxidant (glutathione) flushed CBPs from the body.\" I purchase N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in the product Complete Glutathione From Nutri-West: 800-443-3333. If these symptoms are caused by Sucralose (Splenda) sensitivity, elimination from the diet for a minimum of 2 weeks should start to improve symptoms: - Unexplained Tiredness - Brain Fog - Nausea - Joint Pain - Cramps/Bloating - Diarrhea - Headaches - Dizziness - Mood Swings - Depression The above statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.

Baseball World Series Players Benefit from Chiropractic In a November 3, 2011 release from the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress is a story highlighting chiropractic helping the players of this years World Series. The article starts out by noting that the past two Major League Baseball World Series Champions had team chiropractors assisting their players. The 2010 San Francisco Giants and 2011 St. Louis Cardinals each relied on chiropractic to promote faster recoveries, reduce risk of injury and enhance on-field performance. The release noted that both Ralph Filson, D.C., the chiropractor for the Cardinals, and Michael Gazdar, D.C. the chiropractor for the San Francisco Giants, explained \"that regular chiropractic care provides baseball players with proper spinal function and balance to reduce the risk of spine-related injuries, enhance recovery time and improve overall performance.\" Dr. Filson, who cared for this year's champion St Louis Cardinals began giving chiropractic care to the team in 1990 through his connection with then manager and legend, Joe Torre. Dr. Filson commented, \"Chiropractic care is always available for players of the Cardinals and the visiting team, it is utilized by many. With chiropractic care, players report that they feel better and have better endurance. Body mechanics are significantly improved, enabling better pitching, hitting and throwing.\" Jason Motte, one of the relief pitchers for the St. Louis Cardinals chimed in saying, \"I had issues with my shoulder and arm for a long time. I started seeing Dr. Filson this year. Since then, I have not had any arm problems. The whole team appreciates him and the work he did throughout the season. I know while being under Dr. Filson's care, I was able to feel 100% while on the mound.\" In 2006 the Cardinals won the World series and Dr. Filson was given a World Series ring for his participation in helping the team. He stated, \"I am proud to have provided chiropractic care to the Cardinals for so many years, and gratified that chiropractic has contributed to the players' optimal performance during every game. We are all excited about bringing home the 2011 World Series title.\" The 2010 World Champion Giants also relied on their chiropractor, Dr. Gazdar for their ability to win. Dr. Gazdar explained, \"Chiropractic care was a significant factor in the San Francisco Giants 2010 victory. One of the Giants' pitchers relied upon chiropractic adjustments for all of his pitching starts, and virtually every player benefited from chiropractic services.\" Infants with Acid Reflux and Colic Helped by Chiropractic Research published in the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health on May 9, 2009 documented the cases of 16 infants who were suffering with colic or acid reflux and got complete resolution of their symptoms with chiropractic care. In this study, seven of the infants were diagnosed by a medical physician with colic, while nine had been diagnosed with acid reflux prior to receiving chiropractic care. The infants in this study ranged in age from two weeks to eleven months. Of the 16 infants a history of birth trauma was reported in 10 of the cases. Upon examination, upper cervical (neck) subluxations were determined to be present in all 16 cases. In this study chiropractic care was rendered for 2 to 6 weeks on the various infants with all patients showing a complete resolution of their symptoms in that time frame. Dr. Erin Elster, a chiropractor and the author of the study, explained the relationship between subluxation and colic or acid reflux by saying, \"Research is revealing that injuries to the upper part of the neck may be a factor in a number of disorders. These injuries lead to misalignments in the neck that may compress the spinal cord and other nerve structures in the neck. This compression leads to nerve interference and can result in a host of disorders such as colic and acid reflux.\" Dr. Matthew McCoy a chiropractor, public health researcher and editor of the journal that published the study added, \"It makes a lot of sense when you think about it. \"If you damage or compress the neurological structures in the neck this can have far reaching implications on the functioning of the body. Through research like Dr. Elster's we are finding that correcting the misalignments associated with these injuries reduces the nerve compression and people improve. In this study it was infants suffering from colic and acid reflux.\" In her conclusions the author, Dr. Elster wrote, \"These results suggest a causal link between birth trauma, upper cervical injury, and colic / acid reflux onset. Correcting the injury to the upper cervical spine (with chiropractic adjustments) appears to eliminate colic and acid reflux.\" Children Who Get Flu Vaccine Have Three Times Risk Of Hospitalization For Flu The above headline comes from Science Daily on May 20, 2009. The ensuing article reports on research presented at the International Conference of the American Thoracic Society that stated that children who get the flu vaccine are more at risk for hospitalization than those children who do not. In this study researchers followed 263 children ages 6 months to 18 years, who were evaluated at the Mayo Clinic and had laboratory-confirmed influenza between 1996 to 2006. The researchers determined who received the flu vaccine and who did not. They then looked at their asthma status and who did and did not require hospitalization. The records were reviewed for each child with influenza-related illness to see if they had the flu vaccination preceding the illness and if they required hospitalization during that illness. The researchers found that children who had received the flu vaccine had three times the risk of hospitalization, as compared to children who had not received the vaccine. Avni Joshi, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, responded in the Science Daily article by noting, \"The concerns that vaccination may be associated with asthma exacerbations have been disproved with multiple studies in the past, but the vaccine's effectiveness has not been well-established.\" Dr. Joshi, continued, \"This study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the TIV (vaccine) in children overall, as well as the children with asthma, to prevent influenza-related hospitalization.\" He continued by explaining that this study does not mean that the cause of the hospitalizations was the vaccine, \"While these findings do raise questions about the efficacy of the vaccine, they do not in fact implicate it as a cause of hospitalizations.\" Female Infertility and Chiropractic - A Case Series A case series published in the June 8, 2009 issue of the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health documented the cases of three women who presented themselves for chiropractic care with the primary problem of infertility. In these cases all three women were able to conceive following chiropractic care. In the initial review of literature, the study points out that chiropractic was founded on a vitalistic and holistic philosophy to patient care. The author noted that the care of the chiropractic patient was not dependent on the patient's presenting symptoms or medical diagnosis but rather the detection and elimination of spinal and extraspinal subluxations. The study points out how wide spread the problem of infertility is by noting that data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that there were 7.3 million infertile women in the U.S. in 2002 with 1.2 million women having had an infertility-related medical appointment in that timespan. In all three of the cases reported in this study the women were in their thirties ranging from 33 to 35 years of age. All had attempted medical interventions to become pregnant and all had been unsuccessful for between 7 months and 4 years. In each of these cases chiropractic care was initiated for the correction of subluxations detected in their spines. The study noted that in addition to the specific correction of subluxations with the chiropractic care, nutritional intervention and counseling on stress management was provided to the patients involving goal setting, affirmations, meditation, massage, exercise, alteration of work schedule and overall paradigm shifts in lifestyle modification. The research noted that two of the three women in this study also had complaints of low back pain. The results in these cases showed that between 12 days and 2 months after the initiation of chiropractic care all three women had become pregnant. Women With 'Dowager's Hump' At Higher Risk Of Earlier Death Research published in the May 10, 2009 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that women with an increased curvature in the middle back, known as kyphosis or sometimes known as Dowager's Hump, is associated with a shorter lifespan. Articles in the May 26, 2009 Science Daily and in Medscape on June 2, 2009 also reported on the research and noted that this research was different from previous research in that the researchers factored out such things as compression fractures and other problems typically present with spinal kyphosis. The study looked at 610 women, aged 67 - 93 years, measuring their mid back curvatures (Kyphosis) and then following up over a 13.5 year period to see the correlations between the participants kyphosis curvatures and their mortality. The results showed that an increase in kyphosis carried a 1.14-fold increased risk for death. Dr. Deborah Kado, the study's primary investigator stated, \"We demonstrated that having this age-related postural change is not a good thing. It could mean you're likely to die sooner.\" In this study the researchers write, \"This study demonstrates a possible association between hyperkyphosis and increased risk for earlier death independent of the number and severity of vertebral fractures or osteoporosis in older women.\" Dr. Deborah Kado, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery and medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and the study's primary investigator added, \"Just being bent forward may be an important clinical finding that should serve as a trigger to seek medical evaluation for possible spinal osteoporosis, as vertebral fractures more often than not are a silent disease.\" Dr. Gary Walsemann, a Doctor of Chiropractic for 40 years and president of the International Chiropractors Association commented on the research by explaining the significance from a chiropractic perspective. \"Chiropractors have been saying for years that spinal distortions create health issues because of interference to the nervous system created by spinal distortions that we know as subluxations.\" Dr. Walsemann continued, \"This research serves to further highlight the connections between spinal problems and overall health.\" Nine Year Old Boy Can Walk Again Thanks to Chiropractic A feel good story by Barbara Morse Silva appeared on, June 1, 2009, on the NBC TV news station \" [turnto10.com](http://www.turn10.com)\" serving Rhode Island and Massachusetts. This story followed the case of a young boy who was able to walk again after chiropractic care. In this news story a young boy named Charlie had a rare disease that created tumors in his brain, heart and kidneys. He was also born with fetal alcohol syndrome and has a history of seizures. Five years ago he was adopted by the Rivera family. His adopted mother Michele described young Charlie by noting that he was confined to a wheelchair, was lethargic and on all kinds of medicines. His adopted father Abraham added that Charlie, \"basically sat in a wheelchair slumped over. There was nothing for the child.\" The Riveras took Charlie to a chiropractor Dr. Ross Rutkowski of Somerset, MA. Dr. Rutkowski explained that he performed a specific type of chiropractic that involved posture to help the upper part of Charlie's neck causing a change instantly after the first adjustment. His mother recalled, \"He'd never slept a full night since we had gotten him the first five years.\" Mrs. Rivera then recalled what happened after Charlie's first adjustment, \"When he came here (the chiropractor's office) that night was the first night he slept, and it was 24 hours with no seizure.\" His father noted that now him and Charlie can make eye contact. The story then notes that Charlie is walking a lot, and his seizures have also been \"few and far between.\" The story notes that the Riveras call this nothing short of a miracle and their son now has a good quality of life. The story did point that at first the Riveras would not even consider going to a chiropractor. Mr. Rivera admitted that he, \"Would never even go a chiropractor.\" But now he says, \"Amazing, all my aches are gone too! Yup I'm a patient now too.\" Dr. Rutkowski pointed out, \"To be clear, chiropractic is not a treatment for seizures. It's a way of taking pressure away from that nervous system so that the body always does the healing. We just remove the interference and the body heals.\" Too Many C-Sections? From the June 10, 2009 issue of the Los Angeles Times comes an article with the title, \"Childbirth: Can the U.S. improve?\", by Lisa Girion. This article argues the point that there are too many C-sections performed in the United States. The article noted that cesarean is most common operation in the U.S.. In 1965 only 4.5% of all births were by cesarean. The rate has grown substantially with currently 31% of all births in the US by cesarean. The article quotes Dr. Roger A. Rosenblatt, a University of Washington professor of family medicine who has written in the past that the increase in interventions such as cesarean is linked to declining outcomes. Dr. Rosenblatt said, \"We're going in the wrong direction, (maternity care) \"is a microcosm of the entire medical enterprise.\" The article notes that childbirth is the number one reason for hospital admissions costing $79 billion per year and representing a large part of the $2.4 trillion dollars spent on medical care each year in the US. In 2008 a New York think tank group, Childbirth Connection, issued a report that said, \"The financial toll of maternity care on private [insurers]/employers and Medicaid/taxpayers is especially large. Maternity care thus plays a considerable role in escalating healthcare costs, which increasingly threaten the financial stability of families, employers, and federal and state budgets.\" The LA Times article also noted that in the U.S. the cesarean rate is higher than in most all other developed nations. They also note that even though the government has set goals to reducing such deliveries, the number of cesareans performed has set a new record every year for more than a decade. In spite of the high level of medical intervention in the birth process, the U.S. ranks behind other developed nations on key performance indicators including infant mortality and birth weight. A typical American newborn is delivered at 39 weeks, instead of the full 40 weeks. Additionally, the article reports that starting in 2002 the death rate for mothers in childbirth began to rise. Perhaps the most telling comment as to why there is no major effort to reverse this issue came from Dr. Elliot Main, chief of obstetrics for Sutter Health hospital in Northern California, \"Cesarean birth ends up being a profit center in hospitals, so there's not a lot of incentive to reduce them.\" Chiropractic Care of a Pediatric Patient with Asthma, Allergies, Chronic Colds A case study involving a 7-year-old boy suffering chronic colds, allergies, and asthma since the age of 5 months, who was subsequently helped with chiropractic, was documented in the August 17, 2009 issue of the scientific periodical, the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal and Family Health. In this study the young boy's parents explained that their son had been suffering from his problems since age 5, and was now taking the medications Alavert daily for allergies and Albuterol for asthma as needed. The child also required nebulizer treatments for his asthmatic episodes. Additionally steroid injections were also used \"regularly\". Because of his illnesses he missed 1-2 days of school per month. He also had monthly visits to the medical doctor for all his health issues. Finally his parents brought him to a chiropractor to see if he could be helped. The chiropractic examination revealed multiple postural abnormalities and changes in the boy's ranges of spinal movement. Additionally areas of the spine felt abnormal to the doctor's touch. These findings are all indicative of spinal subluxations. Subluxations are when bones of the spine are positioned incorrectly and create pressure or irritation on nerves. This causes changes in the function of the nervous system and can result in a variety of health issues depending on the severity of the nerve system interference and the areas of the nervous system involved. Specific chiropractic care was initiated on the boy at the initial frequency of 3 visits per week for the first month of care. Within two weeks of the child's first chiropractic adjustment, the patient's mother indicated that her son no longer was dependent on his prescription medication for allergies, so they decided to discontinue them on their own. His parents also reported that his frequency and severity of the asthma attacks had greatly improved, and he no longer required his nebulizer treatments since beginning chiropractic care. According to the study records within 3 months of the initiation of chiropractic care, the boy's mother reported that all the young boy's initial complaints were addressed successfully. The child continued chiropractic wellness care, and after a 16 month follow up, it was noted that the boy experienced only 1-2 minor colds or sinus infections and required the use of his nebulizer on only two occasions. Neither the patient nor his mother reported any adverse reactions to the chiropractic care. Chiropractic is Part of Swine Flu Prevention Program in Children The above headline comes from a September 8, 2009 research update release from the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health. The author of the release Matthew McCoy D.C., is an Associate Professor of Clinical Sciences at Life University, a public health specialist, health researcher and editor of the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health. The release notes that on September 4, 2009, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) issued a report on the H1N1 virus known as the swine flu. The CDC report showed that there had been 36 deaths in children under 18 associated with the swine flu. The CDC report noted that a higher than usual amount of these deaths (67%) involved children with serious \"high-risk medical conditions\". Normally the average death toll in children from the yearly flu shows that only 35% to 55% had previous serious medical conditions. This suggests that children not suffering from serious medical conditions are less likely to die from H1N1 than from previous years flu outbreaks. Additionally, the CDC report noted that most of the previously seriously ill children, (92%), who succumb to the flu were suffering from \"neurodevelopmental conditions\". Because of the nervous system involvement reported by the CDC, Dr. McCoy noted, \"The number of children with neurological, neurodevelopmental and pulmonary disorders who ended up with complications from the H1N1 flu and who ultimately died from these complications point to the need to make sure that children with such disorders, and in fact all children, have as little interference to their nervous systems as possible\". Dr. McCoy added \"It (CDC report) also shows that the majority of children who ended up with complications from H1N1 infection were not normal, healthy children. So, if you have normal, healthy children - rather than panic from these media reports its better to consider the things you can do to make sure that your child's immune system remains functioning at its best.\" The Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health notes that in addition to a healthy diet, exercise and proper sleep, one crucial way to make sure a child's immune system is functioning at its best is to make sure their nervous system is free from interference. The Journal release also noted that the nervous system has a direct effect on the immune system and the spine houses and protects the spinal cord and nerves, a vital portion of the nerve system. They therefore state that it is important to have childrens spines checked for any interference to the nervous system. Dr. Christopher Kent, chiropractic researcher and President of the Foundation for Vertebral Subluxation, advised, \"Nerve interference can result from spinal misalignments or abnormal motion in the spine called vertebral subluxations and because the nervous system affects immune function it is important to reduce or correct any vertebral subluxations if found.\" Dr. Kent added, \"The lesson in all of this is to go back to the basics. The best defense against viral and bacterial diseases, in addition to the recommendations for hand washing and covering your mouth, is a highly functioning immune system. Chiropractic should be part of an effective flu prevention strategy.\" Many British Nurses and Doctors Not Willing to Have Swine Flu Vaccine Several news stories mainly in British publications show that doctors and nurses in the United Kingdom are openly questioning the efficacy and safety of the Swine Flu vaccine. One such story in the August 17, 2009 issue of the Telegraph, reports on a survey done of British nurses showing that only one-third were willing to have the vaccination. This article noted that of the nurses who said they would not get vaccinated, 60 per cent said concern about the safety of the vaccine was the main reason. The results were taken from a poll of 1500 nurses of whom 91% said that they were \"frontline\" healthcare workers who are the people most told they need the vaccine by pro-vaccine efforts. One nurse, echoing what is probably a predominant view, responded to the poll by commenting, \"I would not be willing to put myself at risk of, as yet, unknown long-term effects to facilitate a short-term solution.\" Another respondent added, \"I have yet to be convinced there is a genuine health risk (from swine flu) and it's not just government propaganda.\" In another article on August 26, 2009 also in the Telegraph, it was reported that up to 50% of all general practitioners do not plan to take the vaccine. Similarly they report that another study published online by the British Medical Journal showed that half of 8,500 healthcare workers in Hong Kong said that they would refuse a swine flu vaccine, because of safety concerns and worries that it would not work very well. In response some government officials in the UK are exerting pressure on healthcare workers to fall into line on the issue of vaccinations. On the August 17, 2009 Nursing Times.com, website an article appeared that starts by reporting, \"The (British) Department of Health's director of immunization Professor David Salisbury has said nurses have a responsibility to be vaccinated against swine flu.\" Some of the genuine concern may have come from the safety revelation reported on in several news outlets including the August 16, 2009 American Chronicle which ran a story with the title, \"Letter Leaked Showing New Swine Flu Jab Linked to Guillain Barre Syndrome.\" The US story reports that a UK newspaper has received letters showing a link between the new Swine Flu vaccine and Guillain Barre Syndrome, a serious neurological disease that can cause paralysis and in extreme cases can lead to death. The article reports that on July 29, 2009, \"A member of the JCVI Professor Elizabeth Miller and head of the HPA's Immunisation Department has sent a confidential letter to senior neurologists warning to be on the alert for new cases of GBS (Guillain Barre Syndrome) which she says could be linked to the vaccine.\" With all the confusion, the minimal time for testing and the concern over safety issues many people are planning on passing on the vaccine. Several groups including the National Vaccine information Center, [www.nvic.org](http://www.nvic.org), in the US have urged caution and are against any attempt to mandate this vaccination to any group of US citizens. Statements and a video can be seen on their website. Developmental Delay Syndromes and Chiropractic: A Case Report A case study research article published on August 31, 2009 in the scientific periodical, the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal and Family Health, documented a case of a 2 year old girl with developmental and emotional growth issues, also known as Developmental Delay Syndrome or DDS. In this case study these issues were subsequently resolved with chiropractic care. In this case a 2 year old girl was brought to the chiropractor with an interesting history. It seems that she was the younger of fraternal twins, with her brother being born vaginally, while she required a c-section to be born. From the trauma of her birth it was noted that her head and facial features were asymmetrical. At the age of 28 months the young girl was suffering with Developmental Delay Syndrome or (DDS), and exhibiting frequent rages, furious temper tantrums, and nightmares that caused her to wake up screaming. She was described as a child that was not able to function in pre-school or at home with the family. She was notably slower than her twin brother in both intellectual and emotional development. After a chiropractic evaluation was performed a specific regimen of care was initiated. After only 2 visits the child had noticeably improved posture. The case study also reported that after the 5th visit, the child was very stable within her family and pre-school environments, and she had stopped walking on her toes as she had prior to beginning chiropractic. Long term follow up years later at age 7, showed that she was equal in development to her twin brother and she was doing well in school. In the conclusion to this case study the authors wrote, \"Since there is some question as to the causation of the various developmental delay syndromes, this ultimately leads to some lack of clarity on treatment options, particularly for children sensitive to medication or who do not choose medication as an option. Patients are seeking alternative care, and particularly care that offers low risk and some benefit should be brought to their attention. While the studies are inconclusive, there is an emerging evidence base that does show chiropractic care can be involved in the treatment and care of patients with developmental delay syndromes.\" Dead by Mistake A collaborative effort by a group of journalists from the Hearst newspapers and television stations, spearheaded by Phil Bronstein, Editor-at-Large, Hearst Newspapers and the San Francisco Chronicle, has resulted in a series of articles and a website to expose what they call a, \"critical and neglected health care issue that dramatically affects hundreds of thousands of Americans every year.\" The website and articles are called Dead by Mistake and can be seen at the following address: [http://www.chron.com/deadbymistake/](http://www.chron.com/deadbymistake/) as well as on many Hearst publications. The Dead by Mistake website itself contains several articles with many interesting facts. They report that 200,000 people die each year from medical errors and infections in hospitals. Even with this high toll less than half of all states require adverse medical event reporting. When states do mandate such reporting, consumer access to hospital-specific information is either extremely limited or not available at all. The series of articles started on August 9, 2009 in the San Francisco Chronicle with 2 articles titled, \"Secrecy shields medical mishaps from public view\", and \"DEAD BY MISTAKE - Avoidable errors kept out of view\". These articles and the subsequent ones by the team of investigational reporters not only reported on a series of tragic deaths caused by medical error, but also noted some glaring deficiencies in the system. The authors of the reports note that experts acknowledge that there are some 98,000 deaths per year from known medical errors and an additional 99,000 from infections in hospitals. For some perspective, this means that more Americans die each month of preventable medical injuries than died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The authors admit that these numbers are not absolute, but that part of the problem is that there is no definitive study or system of reporting to track the carnage. Americans Spending More for Non-medical Healthcare Several news stories recently reported on the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine study released on July 30, 2009 titled, \"Costs of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Frequency of Visits to CAM Practitioners: United States, 2007\". Although it was included in this study, many no longer consider chiropractic as an \"Alternative Medicine\" since the profession has become more accepted as a mainstream form of healthcare. The study focuses on the amount of out-of-pocket money spent by consumers on the non-medical forms of care they refer to as \"CAM\" for the year 2007. The study reports that in 2007 Americans spent $33.9 billion of their own money out of pocket on visits to CAM practitioners and purchases of CAM products. The largest portion of that amount, $22 billion, was spent on CAM products classes and materials. Another $11.9 billion was spent on practitioner visits which include all chiropractic care. The study points out that in 2007, 38.1 million adults made an estimated 354.2 million visits to CAM practitioners. Of this number almost half were chiropractors accounting for about $3.9 billion out of pocket expenses. As a comparison the study noted that Americans spent $49.6 billion out of pocket for medical doctor visits. The study results also noted that chiropractic was one of the most affordable types of CAM care as they stated, \"Some of the highest per-person, out-of pocket costs are associated with visits to practitioners of naturopathy and chelation therapy, while one of the lowest per-person, out-of-pocket costs is associated with visits to practitioners of chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation therapy.\" In the total scheme of healthcare CAM is not a large portion of the expenses but is a large part of the number of people receiving care. The study notes that all of the CAM expenditures combined only amounts to 1.5% of the total health-care expenditures in the United States. However, as many people are willing to pay for these services CAM does total 11.2% of all out-of-pocket health-care expenditures in the US. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger Touts Chiropractic as Prevention Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger addressed a group of about 200 chiropractors at the International Chiropractors Association's Symposium on Natural Fitness held in Columbus, Ohio, on March 6, 2010. Each year, the chiropractic profession and the fitness world come together during the Arnold Fitness weekend. Governor Schwarzenegger is a long time proponent of physical fitness, and a long time supporter of chiropractic. The Governor and his family have received chiropractic care for years. This year marks the 18th year that the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) has held their \"Symposium on Natural Fitness\" in conjunction with the \"Arnold Classic\". For each of those 18 years, Arnold has attended the chiropractic event to speak to chiropractors and take pictures with every chiropractor in attendance. He also gives an address in which he speaks about the benefits of chiropractic and other relevant issues in health and fitness. During his address, Governor Schwarzenegger enthusiastically showed his support for chiropractic by saying, \"What I love about chiropractors, is that you say, OK, we can fix you up when you have an injury and we can help you when you're sick, we can help you with all kinds of different things. But what you are really saying is in your profession is, look, why don't you come to us before you get sick, before you have a problem with your back, before you have a problem with your shoulders or elbows.\" He continued, \"Prevention, it's all about prevention.\" As Governor Schwarzenegger continued his remarks, he noted that health care reform must contain prevention. He stated, \"If you don't have prevention as a big-big part of the health care reform, you have nothing, you have absolutely nothing!\" He continued by pointing out that incentives for healthy living and prevention must be included in health care reform, \"\\This is why I say that prevention is the answer.\" As Governor Schwarzenegger was summing up his comments, he once again linked the chiropractic profession to health and prevention when he said, \"We know it (prevention) works. And we know that you (chiropractors) are in the right profession. Because you are really in a profession that saves people money, and it brings the health care costs down. This is what I love about your profession. You are the most incredible profession, you always help people.\" One in Four Parents Link Autism to Vaccines A study released in the March 1, 2010 issue of the American Academy of Pediatrics' official journal, Pediatrics, showed that 1 in 4 parents believe there is a link between vaccines and autism. The study also showed that nearly one in eight parents have refused at least one recommended vaccine in the past. In this study, 2521 online surveys were electronically sent to a nationally representative sample of parents of children who were less than 17 years of age. The responses and opinions of the parents were recorded on the subject of vaccinations. From these surveys, 62% responded and were included in the study. One of the most telling statistics obtained from this study was that 54% of all respondents expressed concerns regarding serious adverse effects from vaccinations. Additionally, 11.5% of the parents in this study had refused at least 1 recommended vaccine for their child. According to the study, the vaccine that parents were most likely to reject was the HPV vaccine, designed for human papillomavirus for cervical cancer. Barbara Loe Fisher, Co-founder of the National Vaccine Information Center, (NVIC), commented on the study by saying, \"I am not surprised by these survey results because, since 1982, most parents contacting the National Vaccine Information Center tell us they want to trust what their doctors tell them about vaccination. Mothers and fathers depend upon their doctors to give them good advice; but when the health of their child or a child they know deteriorates after vaccination, parents logically start to ask questions. And when they are belittled or even threatened for asking those questions, the relationship between doctor and parent is never the same again.\" The NVIC is a consumer organization that disseminates information on vaccinations and gives the parents of vaccine injured children a resource to offer help and guidance. Ms. Loe Fisher added some interesting vaccine facts and summed up the sentiment expressed by the results of the Pediatrics survey by saying, \"More and more Americans are becoming painfully aware that their medical bills, taxes, and health insurance premiums are going up because, today, 1 in 6 highly vaccinated child in America is learning disabled; 1 in 9 has asthma; 1 in 100 develops autism; 1 in 450 becomes diabetic and 7 in 1,000 babies born alive are dying before their first birthday. With 69 doses of 16 vaccines being given to children from birth through age 18, and hundreds of new vaccines being developed to prevent infectious disease while trillions of dollars are being spent to treat chronic disease, is it any wonder more parents are asking more questions about vaccine safety?\" Eight Time Bodybuilding Champion Lee Haney Gives Credit to Chiropractic Lee Haney is one of the greatest bodybuilders in history. He has been bodybuilding for 25 years and has won eight consecutive Mr. Olympia titles, beating Arnold Schwarzenegger's seven-title record. Lee was a featured speaker at the 18th annual Symposium on Natural Fitness, held in Columbus, Ohio, on March 5-6, 2010, hosted by the International Chiropractors Association. During an onstage interview, Haney was asked how and when he first got under chiropractic care, and about his experience in chiropractic. The former Mr. Olympia noted that his first experience with Chiropractic began back in 1980. He recalled, \"I was in the gym training on that particular day doing squats and so forth. I happened to come up the wrong way, and sort of twisted sideways. After doing so, I ended up having pain in my lower back. And the trainer at the facility that I used recommended chiropractic care.\" Prior to this, Mr. Haney had no knowledge of chiropractic. He noted, \"I'd never heard of chiropractic care before.\" Based on the recommendation from the trainer, Haney went to see a chiropractor. \"After my first two adjustments, I was back to doing squats again, no pain in the lower back. So from that point on, I was a believer.\" During his talk, Haney pointed out that he believes in chiropractic for his entire family. He proudly pointed out that his son, a college football star and NFL hopeful, regularly sees a chiropractor near his school. He stated, \"All my kids are under chiropractic, and so is my wife.\" He stated that his kids have been under care since they were 13 or 14 years old. \"They're athletes,\" Haney added when speaking about his kids. \"And not just because they're athletes. I know the importance of chiropractic care. Because you can't be structurally well, or psychologically well, unless you are physiologically well and in balance.\" Hospital Infections Kill Nearly 50,000 a Year The above is a headline from the February 23rd, 2010 issue of the New York Daily News. The article reports on a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine on February 22, 2010. The study and resultant articles point out that approximately 48,000 patients die each year from pneumonia or blood poisoning picked up in hospitals. In this study, hospital discharge records were looked at on 69 million patients who were in hospitals in 40 US states between 1998 and 2006. The records were examined to look for blood infections or pneumonia. Problems of these types that were acquired from outside the hospital were excluded, so that the data only showed problems resulting from a stay at the hospital. The results of this large study brought forth some alarming data. The study revealed that hospital-acquired illnesses were responsible for 2.3 million extra patient days in hospitals. These extra days in a hospital resulted in a cost of $8.1 billion in the year 2006 alone. Overall, 1.7 million healthcare-associated infections are diagnosed every year. Ramanan Laxminarayan, spokesperson for Resources for the Future, the group that sponsored the study, reacted to the high rates of infection by saying, \"In many cases, these conditions could have been avoided with better infection control in hospitals.\" One of the researchers on the study, Anup Malani, from the University of Chicago, added, \"That's the tragedy of such cases. In some cases, relatively healthy people check into the hospital for routine surgery. They develop sepsis because of a lapse in infection control and they can die.\" Study Shows Chiropractic Helps Headaches A study published in the February 2010 issue of The Spine Journal, the official journal of the North American Spine Society, provided additional evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of chiropractic for certain types of headaches known as \"cervicogenic headaches\". A report on the results of this study was also published online on February 26, 2010, on the site \"Modern Medicine\". In this study, 80 patients with chronic cervicogenic headaches were divided into three groups. Two of the groups received various forms of chiropractic adjustments, which the study authors called Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT), and one group received just a light massage so as to be able to compare the results. Results were calculated using standard pain scales. Data from the subjects was collected every 4 weeks for a 24 week period. The researchers found that the groups that received chiropractic showed significantly greater improvement in pain scores as compared to the group that got just light massage. Those receiving the chiropractic care were more likely to have a 50-percent improvement in their pain. The two groups of patients who received chiropractic care were only given either 8 or 16 chiropractic sessions. The study did see a slightly better response for the group receiving more adjustments, but due to the study parameters, no data was available beyond 16 visits. Dr. Mitch Haas and a team of researchers at Western States Chiropractic College, were quoted in their conclusion as saying, \"Our pilot study adds to an emerging picture of spinal manipulative therapy dose for the treatment of headache. It showed that a plateau in intervention effect might be found in the range of eight to 16 treatment sessions, although a dose effect at these treatment levels cannot be ruled out. The study also adds to the support of spinal manipulative therapy in moderate doses as a viable option for the treatment of chronic cervicogenic headaches.\" Few Medical Studies Actually Compare One Treatment to Another A study released in the March 10, 2010 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) noted that most other studies in medical journals do not compare one type of treatment to another. According to the study, and several news articles written about this study, most medical studies are testing a new drug and not looking to see how it compares to drugs already on the market, or to non-drug care. It is the lack of \"comparative effectiveness\" studies that makes it hard for patients and doctors to evaluate which course of treatment or care is best for a patient. A March 10, 2010, article on this study in the Los Angeles Times noted that this is the reason that there is such a large discrepancy between the way medical doctors care for patients with the same ailments. Coauthors of the study and the LA Times article, Drs. Danny McCormick and Michael Hochman, explained how they conducted their study in the Times article by saying, \"In the study, we analyzed 328 medication studies recently published in six top medical journals and found that just 32% were aimed at determining which available treatment is best. The rest were either aimed at bringing a new therapy to market or simply compared a medication with a placebo. Whether the therapy was better or worse than other treatments was simply not addressed.\" In an attempt to explain why very few studies are done to check existing treatments against new drugs, the authors explained, \"So why, then, did only a third of medication studies focus on helping doctors use existing therapies more effectively? The answer lies in the fact that pharmaceutical companies fund nearly half of all medication research, including the lion's share of large clinical trials. For obvious reasons, commercially funded research is primarily geared toward the development of new and marketable medications and technologies. Once these products have won approval for clinical use, companies no longer have incentives to study exactly how and when they should be used.\" Not surprisingly, the research showed that most of the studies done are funded by drug companies trying to get approval for their new drugs. The study also showed that the few studies that actually do \"comparative effectiveness\" and look at one type of care as compared to another, were mostly funded by the government or received other non-drug company related funding. Jerry Rice, Pro Football Hall of Fame Inductee, Gives Credit to His Longevity to Chiropractic A release on Business News Wire on August 3, 2010 carried a title that read, \"The Foundation for Chiropractic Progress Congratulates Jerry Rice on his Pro Football Hall of Fame Induction\". Jerry Rice, a football superstar and longtime user of chiropractic is also a spokesperson for the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress (F4CP). The F4CP release noted that, \"August 7, 2010, Jerry Rice and six other National Football League (NFL) icons will be honored in Canton, Ohio, as they become the latest members to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\" During his career, Rice made 13 trips to the NFL Pro bowl and holds 38 different NFL records. The F4CP release quotes Jerry Rice's support of chiropractic when he stated, \"Chiropractic care helped me stay healthy and succeed in the league for as long as I did.\" The story reports that Rices first experience with chiropractic care took place during Super Bowl XXIII, where he witnessed first-hand how chiropractic care helped his injured 49er teammates perform, resulting in a win over the Cincinnati Bengals. One of these teammates was another long time supporter of chiropractic, Hall of Famer Joe Montana. Jerry Rice continued with chiropractic after he left football. He credits chiropractic with his ability to perform on the TV show Dancing With The Stars. Rice was quoted as saying, \"Dancing with the Stars was every bit as exhausting and challenging though not nearly as brutal as football, says Rice. I had aches and pains that I never had before. Again, chiropractic care made the difference and kept me dancing and in the competition.\" New Hall of Famer, Jerry Rice, remains active and summed up his support for chiropractic by saying, \"I have been blessed with a long and healthy career as a professional athlete, and as I move forward into the next stage of my life, chiropractic care will continue to be an important part of my game plan.\" Woman With Amenorrhea Helped With Chiropractic - Case Study A case study published on July 19, 2010 in the scientific periodical, the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal and Family Health, documents the care of a 25 year old woman who had not yet had her first menstrual cycle without the use of prescription birth control pills. According to the case study authors, amenorrhea is defined as the absence of spontaneous menses in a woman of reproductive age. Primary amenorrhea, as was the case of the woman in this study, is where a woman has not experienced any menstrual periods by the age of 16. Most women have their first menstrual period by the age of 15. In this case, a young woman sought out chiropractic care initially for a primary complaint of headaches. Upon taking her history, the woman revealed that she had never started her menstrual period as a child and that currently she had not experienced a menstrual period in approximately three years. By the age of 18, the woman was put on synthetic progesterone and birth control pills to force a menstrual cycle. She noted that she did not like the side effects and therefore discontinued the medication. Examination revealed the presence of subluxations and a course of specific chiropractic adjustments was initiated. On her third visit, the woman reported that her tension headaches were much improved, but she still had not yet experienced a menstrual period. On her fourth visit, 19 days after her initial chiropractic evaluation, the woman reported she experienced two days of menstruation for the first time in her lifetime without the use of birth control. The authors of the study presented a clear rationale for the reasoning behind why a woman with amenorrhea would respond to chiropractic care by stating, \"Chiropractics role in this condition is based on the principle that there is a neurospinal influence upon the physiology of every organ and system within the body. This would include the reproductive and endocrine systems, which are primarily in control of the menstruation process. The chiropractic profession maintains that spinal misalignments, or vertebral subluxations, cause interference to this neurospinal system and that in turn the interference affects ones state of health. Based on this premise, by correcting subluxations, chiropractic can reduce nervous system interference and improve nerve function thereby allowing the body, including the reproductive and endocrine systems, to function properly. Medical Errors Cost $19.5 Billion Per Year The Wall Street Journal carried an article with the headline, \"Study Puts Cost of Medical Errors At $19.5 Billion\", on August 9, 2010. The article is based on a study commissioned by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and conducted by the actuarial and consulting firm Milliman. Researchers in this study used the data from insurance claims to gather their results. According to the study, medical errors and the problems they create cost the US economy $19.5 billion dollars each year. In the study, the researchers conservatively estimate that they were able to identify 6.3 million measurable medical injuries as reported on insurance claims. Of the 6.3 million injuries, they estimate that 1.5 million were directly associated with a medical error. These errors caused more than 2,500 avoidable deaths and over 10 million lost days of work. The numbers in this study may be significantly underestimated as the researchers note that this study, \"relies upon medical events which have been submitted for payment by medical providers.\" Report co-author Jonathan Shreve noted, \"We used a conservative methodology and still found 1.5 million measurable medical errors occurred in 2008. This number includes only the errors that we could identify through claims data, so the total economic impact of medical errors is in fact greater than what we have reported.\" This study determined the price tag to be $19.5 billion only based on the factors of increased medical costs, costs related to an increased mortality rate, and costs related to lost productivity after the occurrence of an error. They did not count any costs related to pain and suffering, or malpractice. Of the total $19.5 billion, fully $17 billion was the increased cost of medical care rendered to those who were injured. The remainder was calculated as loss of productivity and cost related to increased mortality. Jim Toole, the chairman of the SOAs project oversight group summed up the impact of these numbers by noting, This is so important, and yet its so overlooked, says Toole. We have wonderful information in this country about automobile safety and how in the last 20 years weve reduced highway deaths by 35% but we have no starting point for medical errors or injuries. Another Study Shows Safety of Chiropractic A research article published on August 3, 2010 in the journal, Chiropractic Osteopathy, further shows the safety of chiropractic adjustments. The article itself was a review of numerous other studies done recently that looked at the chances of adverse events from chiropractic care. One of the studies reviewed looked at the effectiveness of chiropractic for neck pain. In this additional study, published on July 9, 2010 in the journal Chiropractic Osteopathy, authors noted that there were no serious adverse events among the subjects and that all minor events were resolved within 1 to 3 days. One of the largest studies reviewed in this research article was one by a Dr. Cassidy and his colleagues in Canada. In this study, the researchers looked at official Canadian health records and reviewed 109,020,875 person-years of cases over a period of nine years. This study was so well constructed that it ruled out other factors so as to leave their conclusions unapproachable. The results of this study showed that the odds of a vascular adverse event occurring within 24 hours of a visit to a primary care physician was virtually the same as the chances of it occurring within 24 hours of a visit to a chiropractor. Detractors of chiropractic have recently mounted a well funded campaign to try to scare the general public into believing that chiropractic carries a serious risk of arterial problems. This study, reporting on several others shows that in fact chiropractic is as safe, or safer than visits to general practitioners. The size and funding of those trying to suggest that the safest health profession is somehow dangerous has led some to question the motives of those backing and funding the campaign of disinformation. A recent release from the International Chiropractors Association stated, This smear campaign has little to do with public safety and everything to do with the old turf war between chiropractic and our old competitors, said Dr. Robert Braile, a chiropractor from Marietta Georgia, and former president of the ICA. Dr. Braile continued, It is of course a tragic event when any patient suffers a serious health issue, whether under chiropractic care or medical care. Braile then asserted, But to take advantage of those events in order to distort truth for a turf war is wrong. Time Spent in Front of TV or Computer Screen Can Cause Problems for Children A new study published in the June 9, 2010 issue of the BMC Public Health Journal warned that, \"time spent on screen-based activity is a contributing factor to physical complaints among young people, and that effects accumulate across different types of screen-based activities.\" Based on this study, an article in the Irish Times on August 10, 2010, reported that the Chiropractic Association of Ireland is warning parents about the effect of children spending too much time in front of computer and TV screens. In the article, the Chiropractic Association of Ireland noted that, \"excessive time in front of computer and television screens could mean an increase in back pain, neck and shoulder pain, and headaches for their children.\" The Chiropractic Association of Ireland noted that the time spent in front of a screen watching television and playing computer games leads to back pain and headaches. The study itself points out that the kind of screen or activity that the child is engaged in is less important than the time spent in these activities. In the Irish Times article, Dr. Attracta Farrell, president of the Chiropractic Association of Ireland said: Not moving for extended periods causes the muscles in the neck, arms and back to stiffen up and become sore. On top of that, slouching increases the compressive force through the spine. Dr. Farrell stressed it wasnt necessary for children or teenagers to give up technology entirely, but she did advise moderation. Its all about moderation. Computers and TV can be a valuable source of entertainment and education for young people and youre never going to convince them to give it up altogether.\" In their conclusion, the researchers again noted that the time spent in these activities was the important factor. They stated, \"The observed associations indicate that time spent on screen-based activity is a contributing factor to physical complaints among young people, and that effects accumulate across different types of screen-based activities.\" Chiropractic Effective and Safe for Neck Pain According to New Study A study published in the journal, Chiropractic Osteopathy, on July 9, 2010 looked at three types of chiropractic adjustments to see how patients with neck pain responded to care. The study also looked at the safety of these procedures by checking to see if there were any adverse reactions among participants in the study. In this study, conducted at Anglo-European College of Chiropractic, in Bournemouth, Dorset, United Kingdom, volunteer subjects who met the criteria were divided into three groups. Each of the groups used a different kind of chiropractic technique for care. All three groups were also given exercise and advice. The researchers looked to see if there was any difference in the outcomes between the various kinds of chiropractic procedures. They also recorded any adverse events to see if there was any difference in that area as well. The results showed that all three groups showed significant improvement over a 12 month period. No major differences were observed between the various groups. Additionally, none of the participants showed any significant or severe adverse reactions or events from the care. It was noted that a number of the participants did have some mild adverse reactions, but that all of them were resolved within 1 to 2 days. The authors of this study concluded that although their study was small, it showed that three different types of chiropractic care resulted in improvement in the patients, with no adverse effects, \"it appears that all three methods of treating mechanical neck pain had a long-term benefit for subacute neck pain, without moderate or serious adverse events associated with any of the treatment methods.\" Improvement in a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder Following Chiropractic A documented case study appeared in the November 7, 2011 issue of the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health reporting on the improvement of Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) with chiropractic care. Sensory processing disorders are when a person can not properly process sensory input involved in daily activity. Various authorities have different opinions as to what constitutes SPD, however, estimates suggested that 5.3% of kindergarten children may meet the criteria for a SPD. In this study a four and a half year old boy, described as \"well nourished\", was brought to the chiropractor with Sensory Processing Disorder and related symptoms. The boy had been diagnosed with SPD by a childhood developmental therapist a year earlier. At 18 months old his parents noticed there was a problem when he started to become very aggressive, substantially increase the amount of food he ate, and was breaking out in unexplainable blotchy rashes. The study noted that the initial chiropractic exam was very difficult to conduct as every time the doctor tried to examine the child he would throw himself to the floor and start screaming uncontrollably. After 40 minutes of this behavior, the child collapsed crying into his mothers arms, and the initial attempt at examination was postponed. One week later an examination was performed and it was noted that there was a problem in the upper cervical (neck) spine. Chiropractic adjustments specific to findings of spinal subluxations were initiated. In addition to the adjustments the child was placed on a gluten-free, casein-free, and refined sugar-free diet. The mother followed the care and dietary recommendations carefully, but she did note that occasionally the boy's grandmother would \"slip him some treats\". The changes reported in this study were nothing short of life changing for the boy. The author reported, \"There were dramatic decreases in sensory stimulating behaviors, physical outbursts, and behavioral outbursts following the introduction of care. There was also a dramatic increase in his attention span and ability to focus on one thing at a time. The patient also started to read for the first time after the 8th adjustment.\" Resolution of Autistic Symptoms in a Child Undergoing Chiropractic From the October 31, 2011 issue of the scientific periodical, the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health comes a case study documenting the correction of autistic symptoms of a child receiving chiropractic care. The authors of the study start off by reporting some sobering statistics by stating, \"Autism is a neurobehavioral disorder that has shown an increase in prevalence in the children of this era. It affects more than 400,000 in the United States and ranks as the third most common developmental disorder of the pediatric population.\" In this case a 9-year-old autistic boy was presented to a chiropractic office for care by his mother. She also noted that her son had a history of repeated ear infections and fell frequently due to his hyperactivity. The boy was also suffering from delayed speech at 1-2 years of age and had not spoken by 3-years of age. Finally at the age of 3 and a half, the boy was diagnosed with autism. A chiropractic examination was performed and it was determined that the boy had subluxations in his pelvis and in the top bone in the neck, the \"atlas\". A series of specific chiropractic adjustments was begun for correction of the subluxations found. Dietary changes were also made. The results of the case were partially determined by the mother filling out an Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), comparing her son's behavior before care, to his behavior at around the 14th visit. The overall scores of the ATEC showed a 16% improvement by the 14th chiropractic adjustment. This included a 17% improvement in the Health / Physical Behavior score. In addition the child was able to discontinue one of the medications he was taking and at the time of the study, reduce the remaining one. The mother also reported that her son improved to the point where he had an almost complete absence of stereotypical autistic movements, improvements in his ability in sociable situations and improvements in communication, both verbal and physical. Improvement in Multiple Sclerosis Patient Through Chiropractic Case Report In the October 27, 2011 edition of the Journal of Upper Cervical Chiropractic Research, comes a documented case study of a person with Multiple Sclerosis being significantly helped by chiropractic care. According to the US National Library of Medicine website, \"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).\" The site goes further to explain that, \"MS affects women more than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, but can be seen at any age.\" In this case a 28 year old woman went to the chiropractor with a chief complaint of severe neck pain following an accident several years earlier where she slipped on a wet bathroom floor and struck her head on the toilet with her mid-back landing on the bathtub. She also suffered with complaints of headaches, back, shoulder and arm pain, hip and leg pain, and skin problems. Additionally, she had been previously diagnosed with MS. In a self-help attempt to relieve the pain the woman would try lying down with a rolled-up towel under her neck. This would relieve the pain and lessened the headaches, however, staying in that position for longer than 15 minutes would cause her to lose consciousness for 8-9 hours. A chiropractic examination and x-rays were performed and a determination was made that subluxations were present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Of the spinal areas involved, it was determined that the upper neck was the primary subluxation in this woman's spine. Specific chiropractic adjustments were begun to address her subluxations. At the initiation of care the patient rated her condition as a 2 out of 10, with 10 being the best and 0 being worst. By the fourth visit she rated herself as a 7 out of 10. Her improvement in all her symptoms including those attributed to her MS remained through the course of this case study. In his conclusion the author noted that in addition to this case, there had been previous studies that also showed improvement with MS patients. He wrote, \"Studies involving larger groups with MS have already been conducted showing favorable response to chiropractic care. Other related chiropractic research has shown similar outcomes with patients experiencing musculoskeletal pain along with associated symptoms of MS.\" Post-Concussion Seizures Resolved with Chiropractic A Case Study A November 3, 2011 case study published in the Journal of Upper Cervical Chiropractic Research, documents the resolution of seizures in a patient who previously had a concussion. The authors of the case study start off by reporting that in the United States alone, there are approximately half a million brain injuries per year. Of this number between 5 and 7% develop seizures. Patients who suffer seizures immediately after the accident are more likely to suffer brain damage. The authors also noted that 24% of people with mild traumatic brain injury have reported anxiety and people that sustain mild to moderate injury suffer from major depression in 25-40% of the cases. In this case a 76-year-old woman was referred to the chiropractor for evaluation by a neurologist. The woman's problems started 10 years earlier after a slip and fall accident. According to the woman, 10 years prior she had jumped out of the shower and ran to answer the phone when her feet came out from under her causing her to land straight back on her head. Immediately after falling she experienced a seizure and severe migraine which left her unable to talk or walk. She was then rushed to the emergency room and was admitted as a patient. She was then given MRI and CT scans which she was told were unremarkable. She was diagnosed with a concussion and post concussion seizure and remained in the hospital for three months. During her time in the hospital the woman experienced rapid fluctuations of her blood pressure and continued to suffer from migraines. She also had difficulty talking and experienced a swaying feeling upon standing, and had a wide gait when walking. By the time she had been released three months later her blood pressure had stabilized and her migraines had stopped. Ten years later her symptoms started to get worse again including suffering from seizures that would leave her unable to walk or talk for several days. She returned for medical care and went through numerous tests, recommendations and medical doctors before being told by a second neurologist to seek chiropractic care. A chiropractic examination was performed with x-rays. The results of these procedures revealed a neurological problem from subluxation at the first bone in the neck called the \"atlas\". A specific adjustment was given to the woman and a reevaluation and x-rays were done to verify positive changes. After the first adjustment the woman immediately noticed an improvement in her walking and she no longer had the feeling that a seizure was coming on. Two months after the initiation of care the woman had not had any seizures since her first chiropractic adjustment. She had also reported pain free neck rotation, normal walking, increased energy, improved clarity and brightness in her vision and improved hearing. Her blood pressure stopped fluctuating and returned to normal. In follow up visits, it seemed that her ten year ordeal had ended. Vaccine Study Reveals Influenza Vaccines Only Prevent flu in 1.5 out of 100 Adults An October 27, 2011 article on NaturalNews.com contains the headline above and reports and explains the finding of a new study showing that flu shot vaccines are not as effective as they are being promoted by the pharmaceutical industry. The original study on flu vaccine effectiveness was published in the October 26, 2011 issue of the prestigious scientific publication, The Lancet. The title of the Lancet article is \"Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis\". The Lancet study is heavily steeped in statistical jargon and difficult to understand. The authors do offer a small section they termed \"Interpretation\" which includes the opening statement, \"Influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, but such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Evidence for protection in adults aged 65 years or older is lacking.\" The Natural News article author, Mike Adams, sifts through the technical jargon and brought forth the meat of the Lancet article by noting in his opening comments, \"A new scientific study published in The Lancet reveals that influenza vaccines only prevent influenza in 1.5 out of every 100 adults who are injected with the flu vaccine.\" Adams remarks that the claim that the flu vaccine is 60% effective is based on using a trick in the percentages. He notes that these types of calculations are used by the vaccine and pharmaceutical industry on a regular basis. In the article, he uses the actual numbers from the Lancet study to prove his point. Adams pointed out that in the Lancet study a \"control group\" of adults consisting of 13,095 non-vaccinated adults were monitored to see if they caught influenza. Of this group, 357 of them caught influenza, which means only 2.7% of these adults caught the flu. The treatment group who received the flu shot were also monitored. Out of the treatment group 1.18% also got the flu even after being vaccinated. This should mean that the real difference between the 2 groups is the the difference between 2.7% and 1.18%, or a total real difference of 1.52%, which is not a very impressive number. However, as Adams points out, if you look at the percentage difference between the numbers 2.7 and 1.18 that comes out to be 0.43%, thus if you subtract that from 100% and claim that the vaccine is 57% effective. This fuzzy sounding math is sometimes called the \"relative risk reduction\" as opposed to the more accurate \"absolute risk reduction\". Adams clearly states the real numbers in a summation statement of the Natural News article by saying, \"So when the media (or your doctor, or pharmacist, or CDC official) says these vaccines are \"60% effective,\" what they really mean is that you would have to inject 100 adults to avoid the flu in just 1.5 of them. Or, put another way, flu vaccines do nothing in 98.5% of adults.\" For Neck Pain, Chiropractic and Exercise Are Better Than Drugs For Neck Pain, Chiropractic and Exercise Are Better Than Drugs The headline above is from a January 7, 2012 article in the health section of the New York Times. This article, as well as a similar one from Medical Press on January 4, 2012, is based on research published on January 3, 2012 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The research studied 272 adults who were suffering with neck pain for 2- to 12-weeks duration. The subjects were divided into three groups, and received either chiropractic adjustments (called SMT or spinal manipulative therapy in the study), home exercise with advice (HEA), or prescription medication. The adjustments were delivered by one of five chiropractors while the medications were prescribed by medical physicians. The medications consisted mainly of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, or both. The care in each of the three groups lasted only 12 weeks in this study. The people in the study were asked to rate their pain initially and at various points thereafter up to 12 months later. The level of pain was recorded for each of the participants at the intervals of at 2, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The results reported that chiropractic adjustments did better in helping neck pain patients and showed \"a statistically significant advantage over medication after 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.\" Even though the care rendered for each of these groups was only for 12 weeks, the long term follow-up showed that 53 percent of the people who had received chiropractic continued to report at least a 75 percent reduction in pain. The exercise group also had similar numbers. However, the group taking medication showed only a 38 percent reduction in pain overall. Dr. Gert Bronfort, an author of the study and research professor at Northwestern Health Sciences University in Minnesota, noted his reasons for the study included a lack of information on choices for people with neck pain. \"There was a void in the scientific literature in terms of what the most helpful treatments are,\" Bronfort said. He noted that the results showed chiropractic superior to medications. \"Even a year later, there were differences between the spinal manipulation and medication groups,\" Bronfort said. Not only did the group taking medications not fair as well in pain reduction, there was also a problem with usage as people kept taking them in an attempt to get help. \"The people in the medication group kept on using a higher amount of medication more frequently throughout the follow-up period, up to a year later,\" said Dr. Bronfort. \"If you're taking medication over a long time, then we're running into more systemic side effects like gastrointestinal problems.\" Flu Vaccine Hampers Children's Natural Immunity Warns New Study Above is the headline from a December 12, 2011 article posted on 121 Doc. The article was based on research published on the November 2011 issue of the Journal of Virology. The research shows that flu vaccine may weaken some children's immune systems to other influenza viruses. Lead author Rogier Bodewes, from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam Netherlands explained his beliefs by stating, \"Annual vaccination against influenza is effective but may have potential drawbacks that have previously been underappreciated and that are also a matter of debate.\" In this study, researchers collected blood samples from 27 healthy, unvaccinated children whose average age was 6 years. The researchers compared these blood samples to the blood samples from 14 children with cystic fibrosis who had received the annual flu shot. The results showed that the unvaccinated children had a superior immune response, involving broader protection against the types of viruses children are exposed to during the flu season. The study results showed that the vaccinations seem to, at least temporarily, increase one type of immunity while decreasing general immunity to many other forms of viruses and other ailments. While studying the effects of seasonal vaccinations, the researchers found that unvaccinated children developed virus-specific T cells that normally increased with age and are required for overall immunity. In contrast, researchers found that the blood samples of vaccinated children showed no increase in number of virus-specific CD8 T cells over time. The articles and study note that many countries do not recommend routine flu vaccinations to healthy individuals and children. Dr. Bodewes, wrote, \"Most countries recommend annual flu vaccination of certain high-risk groups to protect against seasonal influenza. Furthermore, some countries recommend annual influenza vaccination of all healthy children more than six months of age.\" >Resolution of Breech Presentations Following Adjustment of Subluxations The research published in the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health on December 12, 2012 documents a series of cases of breech pregnancies that were resolved following chiropractic care. The study documented the outcomes in five cases of women who had breech pregnancies that were successfully resolved under chiropractic care utilizing Webster's Technique. The Webster Technique is also called the \"In-Uterine Constraint Technique.\" The authors stated that \"Webster Technique was developed by Dr. Larry L. Webster, DC [1945-1999]) to address lumbopelvic subluxations and related biomechanical improprieties.\" The Webster Technique, essentially, is a specific set of adjustments that have shown remarkable results for women with breech pregnancies. The case series reviewed 7 documented cases of women who had a breech presentation late in their pregnancy, and were helped with chiropractic. Several of the cases presented in the study were very striking in their results. In one of the more interesting cases, a 21-year-old woman was told just one day before her due date that her baby had turned and was now stuck in a breech position. Her physician told her that she needed an immediate \"external cephalic version\" (ECV a forceful procedure used to try to turn a baby in-uterine) procedure as she and the baby were in grave danger. The woman scheduled the ECV procedure, but went to a chiropractor before the scheduled appointment. Due to the closeness of her delivery time, the chiropractor performed the Webster technique three times that day. The next morning, the woman was scheduled for the EVC procedure and was to undergo an ultrasound prior to the EVC to determine the baby's positioning. The authors of the study best described the next set of events. \"During the ultrasound procedure, the OB-GYNE began 'flicking' his finger at the screen as if to test whether it was working or not. For some reason he could not find the head in its previous position just 24 hours prior. Instead, with a sense of disbelief, the medical doctor stated, 'I don't believe this; the baby is in the proper vertex position'.\" In the conclusion of the study, the authors wrote, \"This presentation contributes to the knowledge base that pregnant patients may derive benefits from chiropractic care beyond low back pain.\" >When Cancer Screening Does More Harm than Good The headline above appears in the Healthland section of Time on January 6, 2012, based on a study from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute published on the same day. The article, and several others on the same subject, report that the new study showed that men who routinely have prostate exams do not have a higher death rate than those who do not. In fact, the articles suggest that the screening can lead to unneeded procedures and adverse effects. The new study followed 76,000 men at 10 sites nationwide over a period of about 13 years. Half of the men got annual PSA (prostate-specific antigen) tests along with rectal exams during the six years of the study. The other half, called the \"community care\" group, continued to receive care from their regular doctors without receiving a routine PSA exam. Although doctors did find about 12 percent more cancers in the group that got the regular PSA screening, both groups had about the same numbers of deaths. This showed that detecting the additional cancers did not reduce the death rate from the disease. Dr. Gerald Andriole, lead author of the study and chief of urologic surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis commented, \"The finding is along the lines that routine mass screening of men is probably not very beneficial as far as reducing the chance of dying from prostate cancer.\" The article reporting on this study notes that the increased number of findings in the men who got regular PSA tests leads to extra procedures that carry their own risks. In a January 6, 2012 ABC Good Morning America article, Dr. David Penson, director of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center noted, \"The test is far from perfect, there are many false positives because of other conditions that can elevate PSA levels, such as an enlarged prostate. That can lead to a cascade of events -- prostate biopsies are not comfortable and carry a risk of infection and a small risk of dying.\" In a CNN article on the same day, Dr. Andriole summed up his recommendations by saying, \"In the case of a man undergoing an annual checkup, I would not recommend that a PSA test be included with other 'routine' blood tests without a specific conversation between the doctor and patient or caregiver and patient about the pros and cons for him, the patients' specific circumstances.\" >Improvements in Developmental Delay, Colic and GERD in a Child Undergoing Chiropractic A case study published on January 2, 2012 in the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health documents the case of a baby girl who was suffering from developmental delay, colic and GERD, and who was helped by chiropractic care. According to the US National Library of Medicine, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a condition in which the stomach contents (food or liquid) leak backwards from the stomach into the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach). This action can irritate the esophagus, causing heartburn, and other symptoms. In this case, a mother brought her 15-month-old daughter to a chiropractor after noticing that the girl was developmentally behind where she should be. These developmental issues included not standing, walking or talking appropriately for her age level. The baby was only crawling, and could not say more that two-syllable words. The study reported that, previously, the mother had brought her baby to the chiropractor at the age of five months. At that time, the baby was suffering from GERD and colic. These issues were both resolved within three chiropractic adjustments. The study was recorded later when the child was 15 months of age and was suffering from the developmental delay issues. A chiropractic examination revealed subluxations in the upper neck. Specific adjustments were initiated once a week for a 19-week period. The results showed that by the third adjustment the child was walking with some assistance. The study reported that by the 6th visit, the child was walking by holding on to a table and had added words to her vocabulary. By the 9th visit, she had taken 6 steps by herself and increased her vocabulary by three more words. An update assessment was done on the 19th visit. At this time, the girl was 19 months of age. She had improved her walking and was now at the level of a 12-month-old. Her speech was at the proper developmental level for her age, and she no longer had any signs of other developmental delays. FDA to Limit Antibiotics to Treat Livestock to Prevent Superbugs The headline above appeared in a January 4, 2012 Washington Post Business article, and reports on the US Food and Drug Administration's plan to restrict the usage of certain antibiotics in livestock. The move is being made to reduce the growing risk that the germs that are being created as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics would be stronger and more resistant to treatment, therefore endangering humans. The article notes that the antibiotics being used are the same ones used to treat people who have serious infections. Dr. David Wallinga, a physician with the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, who also works with the Keep Antibiotics Working coalition, stated, \"This is an incredibly critical class of antibiotics for humans. In the medical world you'd call it a 'big gun' or a 'drug of last resort. It's effective against a pretty broad spectrum of bacteria.\" Dr. Wallinga added, \"When someone comes into an emergency room and you don't know what they're sick with, you try to treat them with one of the big guns. When your big guns start being ineffective, you're really in trouble.\" In opposition to the ban, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association argued that there is not enough scientific evidence to say that the use of antibiotics is unsafe. Their spokesperson, Kristina Butts, stated, \"The top priority for cattle producers is to raise healthy cattle because healthy cattle are the foundation of a safe, wholesome food supply.\" Rep. Louise Slaughter, of New York, a microbiologist who has pressured the federal government on the issue stated, \"This is a modest first step by the FDA, but we're really just looking at the tip of the iceberg. We don't have time for the FDA to ploddingly take half-measures. We are staring at a massive public health threat in the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. We need to start acting with the swiftness and decisiveness this problem deserves.\" In a January 4, 2012, Los Angeles Times article on this issue, Representative Slaughter, who has written legislation in the past intended to prevent antibiotic overuse, concluded, \"With over 1 million Salmonella cases in the U.S. each year, at least 30,000 Americans will contract cephalosporin-resistant bacteria every year. I'm glad the FDA is finally acting but how many Americans have needlessly been sickened in the meantime?\" Chiropractic Care at 2012 Olympics Enhances Individual and Team Performance Many of the US athletes at the London 2012 Olympics benefited from chiropractic care, according to numerous news stories. One article on August 29, 2012, in the Herald Online starts off by noting, \"The presence of chiropractic care and the leadership role of Doctors of Chiropractic (D.C.s) at major national and international competitive events including the Olympic and Paralympic Games -- are the result of positive outcomes in optimizing athletic performance: endurance, return-to-play and functionality.\" Dr. Phil Santiago, the first chiropractor to be contracted with the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC), and secretary-general of the International Federation of Sports Chiropractic commented, \"Chiropractic care is only one tool within the athletes' healthcare tool box, but its unique manual, non-drug methods make it a crucial component of healthcare delivery at Olympic Games which carry strict restrictions on drug use.\" Another article in the Apex Herald on August 24, 2012, Dr. Michael Borgert, a chiropractor from North Carolina who helped athletes at the London Olympics, commented on his experience by saying, \"The athletes really took it to the next level and performed better than they ever have before. We gave them adjustments before and after each event and I think it really helped. At the Olympic level, just a fraction of difference decides who wins a medal.\" Dr. Gerard Clum, a chiropractor and spokesperson for the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress (F4CP), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness about the value of chiropractic care summed up the benefits of chiropractic care for Olympic athletes by saying, \"The care our doctors of chiropractic provided helped our athletes prepare for the competition, perform at their best, avoid injuries and better deal with injuries when they occurred,\" said Dr. Clum. \"It is a privilege for our doctors of chiropractic to serve our athletes as they seek to bring honor to our nation and to themselves, being a part of the process is a career highlight for the athletes and chiropractors alike.\" Improvement in Quality of Life, Sleep, & Attention in a Patient with Attention Deficit Disorder Above is the title of a documented research case study published in the August 27, 2012, issue of the Journal of Upper Cervical Chiropractic Research. This case reports on the improvement through chiropractic of a young man who was suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder, sleep problems, and long term mid and lower back pain. In this case, a 19-year-old man went to the chiropractor suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) which his father reports the young man had been suffering from his whole life. The man's primary complaint was pain in his mid and lower back that he had been suffering with for five years. The history recorded that the man had organizational and attention issues, and his overall condition was affecting daily activities, school and work. A chiropractic examination was performed including postural analysis, and spinal x-rays. Based upon the results of the examination, a determination was made that the man had subluxations in the uppermost part of his neck, the atlas vertebra, causing neurological malfunction. Additional assessments were performed to measure physical functioning, sleep, spontaneous and evoked brain activity, and visual responses. The additional assessments were performed before the initiation of chiropractic care, and after care was started in order to objectively measure the patient's response to his care. The results of the objective assessments showed improvements in attention, sleep, visual responses, and ADD scores. The improvement was apparent immediately, and showed continual improvement on subsequent tests. The young man's mother reported that her son was doing better and was behaving better. The case study reports, \"He is more cooperative and is better able to follow through and complete tasks. These include chores at home, school work, and music related activities. He began taking classes at college.\" The young man himself reported that his back, neck, and head pain had resolved, his sleep improved, and he no longer felt \"clumsy.\" He also reported that he was able to start playing his musical instrument again. Improvement in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Following Chiropractic Care The Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health (JPMFH) published a case study on August 16, 2012, documenting the case of a young girl with scoliosis who was helped with chiropractic care. An additional study published in the June 2012 issue of the Journal of Chiropractic Medicine (JCM) reports on an additional case of idiopathic scoliosis being helped with chiropractic care. According to the authors of the JPMFH study, \"Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS), which accounts for approximately 80 percent of the reported cases (of scoliosis), is the most common orthopedic deformity affecting children.\" Scoliosis is classified as AIS (affecting adolescent) when it is detected at age 10 or above. The authors note that this form affects between 3 and 5 percent of adolescents and is more common in girls. The authors of the JPMFH study noted that there are two medical forms of treatment for AIS which include bracing or surgery. They note that the bracing option carries self esteem problems as the child is required to wear the brace upwards of 23 hours per day. The surgical option is limited in results and often requires multiple procedures costing upward of half-a-million dollars. They note that there are multiple separate studies of chiropractic helping AIS in various publications. In the case in the JPMFH, an eleven-year-old girl was brought to the chiropractor because her mother was concerned with postural abnormalities she observed in her daughter. The JCM case involved a nine-year-old girl who was also suffering with AIS and was brought to a chiropractor. Both children received a variety of chiropractic examination procedures, and both had spinal x-rays. The x-rays were measured for curvature angles with both girls having a 22 degree curve at their worst point. In both these cases Chiropractic care was initiated utilizing different forms of chiropractic care for each of the two girls. Both girls were seen by the chiropractor multiple times on regular schedules over several months. Both girls were also subsequently re-evaluated and comparative x-rays were performed. Subsequent re-evaluations and x-rays showed that both the nine year-old and eleven year-old showed corrections of the curvatures measuring 55 percent and 13 percent respectively. The case in the JCM noted that the young girl did not show any psychological issues sometimes observed with other forms of care for scoliosis. The authors of the JPMFH article noted that, in addition to the curvature improvements in their case, this patient also experienced decreased pain, increased range of motion, and improved quality of sleep. Trigeminal Neuralgia Resolved Following One Chiropractic Adjustment A study appeared in the August 30, 2012, issue of the Journal of Upper Cervical Chiropractic Research documenting a case of trigeminal neuralgia being helped with chiropractic. The U.S. National Library of Medicine describes trigeminal neuralgia as a nerve disorder that causes a stabbing or electric-shock-like pain in parts of the face. The study authors note that trigeminal neuralgia is more common in adults 40-60 years of age. The youngest reported case is of a three year old girl. Trigeminal neuralgia annually occurs at a rate of 4.3 per 100,000 people and occurs slightly more often in women. Medical care for this condition is usually medications that also carry a severe list of side effects. In this case, a 14-year-old girl was brought to the chiropractor suffering with severe right-sided facial pain that began four days earlier. One month prior, the girl had a trampoline accident where she landed on the back of her head, neck, and shoulder while attempting a back flip. Following that accident, she experienced neck pain and stiffness for a few days. At the time she was brought to the chiropractor, the girl's pain was described as excruciating with episodes lasting approximately one minute and occurring every twenty minutes. The pain was just below the right eye and extended down into the girl's right jaw. She had been diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia two days earlier by her dentist who recommended pain medication, which she did not take. According to the case report, the girl's pain was triggered by things as slight as the wind blowing on her face. Nothing seemed to help prevent the attacks or reduce the pain. A chiropractic examination was performed which included paraspinal infrared imaging, pelvic balance and leg length assessment, and cervical spine x-rays. Based on the results of the examination, the diagnosis of subluxation of the upper cervical spine was added to the previously diagnosed trigeminal neuralgia. A specific chiropractic adjustment was delivered for correction of the subluxation. The patient returned one day after the first chiropractic adjustment and reported a complete remission of symptoms after the first adjustment. The case report also noted that on subsequent evaluations one month and one year later, the mother of the girl reported that her daughter has not had any facial pain since her first adjustment. Role of Chiropractic Care in Onsite Corporate Clinics A September 4, 2012, release by the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress addresses the role of chiropractic in onsite corporate clinics. The Foundation for Chiropractic Progress (F4CP) is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing public awareness of chiropractic care. On September 6, 2012, the F4CP sponsored Ross M. Miller, M.D., M.P.H., Medical Executive for the Cerner Corporation, as a speaker at the 2012 Institute for HealthCare Consumerism Forum West being held on September 6-7, 2012, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Institute for HealthCare Consumerism states on their website that they are \"A Conference Series for Innovative Health and Benefits Management.\" The conference, which is attended by the leaders in healthcare, is designed to discuss the future of healthcare in the United States. Dr. Miller made a presentation titled, \"Onsite Health Clinics: Break the Financial and Clinical Burdens of Musculoskeletal Conditions.\" The focus of his presentation was the proposal that chiropractic should be included in services as a component of onsite corporate health clinics. Dr. Miller commented, \"As employers seek to offset rising costs and improve employee health, the latest industry trends point to providing an onsite clinic.\" Dr. Miller, also points out that the Cerner Corporation has recently published a paper entitled \"Value of Chiropractic Services at Onsite Health Centers.\" This paper documents that the inclusion of chiropractic has benefits relative to healthcare utilization and improved functional status of musculoskeletal conditions. He explains, \"By including services that facilitate improved musculoskeletal condition management and functional status within onsite clinics, there is potential both for reduced direct and indirect costs, including absenteeism and productivity losses.\" The F4CP release also quotes their representative, Laura Carabello, touting the qualifications of Dr. Miller by saying, \"Dr. Miller demonstrates upstanding credentials and experience in the onsite sector. The F4CP is privileged to have him present this research on its behalf to the highly influential group.\" The release also notes that, \"Dr. Miller functions as the national medical director for Cerner's employer-sponsored onsite primary and urgent care and occupational health centers with oversight of all clinical services, wellness programs, chronic condition management, and benefit administration.\" Healthcare System Wasted $750 Billion a Year A headline from a story on September 6, 2012, in USA Today reports that three years ago the US health care industry wasted 30 cents of every dollar spent on healthcare. The article is based on a release the same day by the Institute of Medicine. The release and the USA Today article reporting on it note that $750 billion in healthcare spending was wasted in 2009. The Institute of Medicine reports on the magnitude of the problem in their release by stating, \"The costs of the system's current inefficiency underscore the urgent need for a systemwide transformation. The committee calculated that about 30 percent of health spending in 2009 -- roughly $750 billion -- was wasted on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems. Moreover, inefficiencies cause needless suffering. By one estimate, roughly 75,000 deaths might have been averted in 2005 if every state had delivered care at the quality level of the best performing state.\" The report further stated, \"Health care costs have increased at a greater rate than the economy as a whole for 31 of the past 40 years. Most payment systems emphasize volume over quality and value by reimbursing providers for individual procedures and tests rather than paying a flat rate or reimbursing based on patients' outcomes.\" Report author Dr. Mark Smith, a former expert adviser to President Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform and president of the Oakland-based California HealthCare Foundation, commented in the USA Today article, \"I was surprised at how much waste there seems to be. We're spending money in ways that don't seem to improve people's health.\" Smith continued, \"The threats to Americans' health and economic security are clear and compelling, and it's time to get all hands on deck. Our health care system lags in its ability to adapt, affordably meet patients' needs and consistently achieve better outcomes.\" Julielynn Wong, M.D., author of the USA Today article and ABC News Medical Unit, puts the problem in perspective by saying, \"The report, released today by the Institute of Medicine, suggested the money squandered on services that failed to improve Americans' health could have provided health insurance for more than 150 million workers or covered the salaries of all of the nation's first responders for more than 12 years.\" [Read our client testimonials](reviews.html) | [Send "}
