In section 12 of Chapter 348, the Legislature directed the Commissioner of Health to convene a work group to d evelop recommendations and proposed legislation on regulating naturopathic pra ctitioners who have postgraduate degrees in naturopathic medicine. The recommendations were to address six issues and to ensure the continued practice of traditional naturopathy by tr aditional naturopaths under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 146A. Section 12 also designated membership and operation of the work group. See Appendix A-1. This document is the Commi ssioner's report of the Naturopathy Work Group findings and outcomes. The Community of Naturopathic Practitioners There are many interest/stakeholder groups in the t raditional naturopathy community concerned with the issues related to the registration of natu ropathic medicine practitioners who have postgraduate degrees in naturopathic medicine.1 Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) staff identified the following distinct interests and org anizations: /square4 In support of the registration statute representing doctors of naturopathic medicine: Minnesota Association of Naturopathic Physicians (M NANP) /square4 In opposition to one, several or all of the provisi ons in Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E representing the traditional naturopathy community: Coalition for Natural Health Minnesota Natural Health Coalition Minnesota Advocates for Complementary & Alternative Practices (MNACAP) National Health Freedom Action/Coalition (NHFA/NHFC ) Minnesota Natural Health - Legal Reform Project (MN HLRP) Natural Health Practitioners of Minnesota Formation of Naturopathy Work Group and Appointment of Members Commissioner appointment of members to the Work Gro up representing naturopathic physicians, traditional naturopaths, the associatio ns for medicine, chiropractic and acupuncture followed a self-selection, nomination process. The result of this process was that MNACAP and MNHLRP representatives were elected as alternate Wo rk Group members, and as such did not have a direct voice in Work Group meetings. All Wor k Group members, alternates and their organizational affiliations are listed in Appendix A-2. The Naturopathy Work Group was 1 In Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, sectio ns 1 to 12 and 14, naturopathic practitioners who h ave postgraduate degrees in naturopathic medicine are v ariously referred naturopat hic doctor.\" Throughout this report, naturopathic practitioners who have postgraduate degrees in naturopathic medic ine who are to be registered under Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E will be referred to as \"doctors of naturopathic me dicine\" or as \"representatives of MNANP\" (Minnesota Associa tion of Naturopathic Physicians.) 3 organized in July, 2008, and met seven times from A ugust through December 2008. Three \"break-out\" meetings were held, two with traditiona l naturopath members and alternates, and one with doctors of naturopathic medicine and alternate s. Appendix A-3 contains all meeting date announcements and agendas. MNACAP, MNHLRP and the other traditional naturopath organizations did not agree in their views and approaches to the issues concerning futur e regulation of doctors of naturopathic medicine. The differences made communications and e fforts to find consensus among traditional naturopaths challenging. However, Department staff communicated with MNACAP, MNHLRP and most other Work Group members apart from schedu led meetings so that all views and concerns could be included in discussion of issues, findings and consideration of recommendations and proposed legislation for this r eport. Naturopathy Work Group Outcomes The Naturopathy Work Group members agreed that: 1. Traditional naturopathy practitioners support regis tration of Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine and their ability to practice according to their education and training in naturopathic medicine; and 2. Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine support continued practice and practices of traditional naturopathy by providers under Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A . Regarding the issues the Legislature directed the N aturopathy Work Group to address, the Commissioner reports the following outcomes: 1. Work Group members representing traditional naturop athy practitioners offered \"that Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E should not be amended in 2009 Legislative Session if the working group members agreed to not oppose specific amendme nts agreed upon by all members and brought forth in the 2010 session...the e xact language of agreed upon amendments as follows:\" a. Proposed Amendment #1. Add a new clause to Minn. St at. section 147E.01, subdivision 10, as follows: [147E.01] DEFINITIONS. Subd. 10. Naturopathic medicine. \"Naturopathic medicine\" means a system of primary health care for the prevention, a ssessment, and treatment of human health conditions, injuries, and diseases that uses: (1) services, procedures, and treatments as describ ed in section 147E.05; and (2) natural health procedures and treatments in sec tion 146A.01, subdivision 4. (3) section 2. [147E.05] Scope of Practice (sic) in cludes a number of complementary and alternative health care practices including but not limited to naturopathy that do not require registra tion and are also provided under chapter 146A. 4 b. Proposed Amendment #2. Add clarifying language to M inn. Stat. section 147E.10, subdivision 1, as follows: [147E.10] PROTECTED TITLES. Subdivision 1. Designation. (a) No individual may use the title \"registered naturopathic doctor,\" \"naturopathic doctor,\" \"docto r of naturopathic medicine,\" or use, in connection with the individua l's name, the letters \"R.N.D.\" or \"N.M.D.,\" or any other titles, words, l etters, abbreviations, or insignia indicating or implying that the individual is a registered naturopathic doctor unless the individual has been registered as a registered naturopathic doctor according to this ch apter. The use of the title and terms \"naturopathy\", \"naturopath\" or any other title or term not otherwise prohibited by law shall not be restricted , protected, or regulated under this chapter. c. Proposed Amendment #3. Add a new definition for com plementary and alternative health care practices to Minn. Stat. section 147E.0 1, as follows: [147E.01] DEFINITIONS. Subd. 12. Complementary and Alternative Health Care Practices has the same meaning as defined in MN Stat Chapter 146A, Su bd. 4. 2. The Work Group member representing the Office of Co mplementary and Alternative Health Care Practice (OCAP) supported the position of the Work Group members representing traditional naturopathy practitioners expressing the view that the amendments were a reasonable request for assurances that Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A practitioners would be unaffected by the registrati on and practice of doctors of naturopathic medicine, that the amendments were not substantive changes that would affect the scope of practice and that it was reason able to agree to the specific amendments in 2010 in exchange for agreement to implement regi stration under Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E in 2009 without further changes in the 2009 Legisla tive Session. 3. Work Group members representing doctors of naturopa thic medicine did not support the amendments offered by Work Group members representi ng traditional naturopathy practitioners, but agreed to address during the 201 0 legislative session the impact of Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E on Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A after the registration statute was implemented. This agreement included consideration of the proposed language changes identified as \"2b\" and \"5\" in Appendix B and additi onal language that would reiterate that the terms \"naturopath\" and \"naturopathy\" are i n the public domain. 4. Work Group members representing doctors of naturopa thic medicine, the Minnesota Medical Association and the Minnesota Chiropractic Association supported the position that Minn. Stat. Ch.147E become effective without f urther changes in the 2009 Legislative Session and that following an initial p eriod of operation of the registration system by the Board of Medical Practice, considerat ion be given to any problems and issues that arise. 5. Naturopathy Work Group Members representing traditi onal naturopaths agreed and said that any statement of doctors of naturopathic medicine indicating that amendments would be \"considered\" in 2010 was inadeq uate. 5 6. The Naturopathy Work Group Members could not reach agreement on specific recommendations or proposed legislation on any of t he issues the Legislature directed be addressed. The following six sections of this report detail fi ndings of the Naturopathy Work Group for each of the six issues the Legislature directed be considered. The information in this report is the product of Work Group Member deliberations in m eetings, research submitted by Work Group Members and MDH staff, and position statement s, telephone and email communications from Work Group Members, including a lternates. 6 Issue Issue Issue Issue 1: Appropriate Level of Regulation for 1: Appropriate Level of Regulation for 1: Appropriate Level of Regulation for 1: Appropriate Level of Regulation for Practition ers Practitioners Practitioners Practitioners with with with with a a aa Postgraduate Degree in Naturopathic Medicine Postgraduate Degree in Naturopathic Medicine Postgraduate Degree in Naturopathic Medicine Postgraduate Degree in Naturopathic Medicine Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, section 1 2, Subdivision 1 (1), directs the Work Group to develop recommendations to address the iss ue of the appropriate level of regulation for practitioners with a postgraduate de gree in naturopathic medicine. Work Group Findings and Outcomes 1. In 2006 the Council of Health Boards reviewed a leg islative proposal to license naturopathic doctors with postgraduate degrees in n aturopathic medicine, and in 2007, the Minnesota Association of Naturopathic Phy sicians (MNANP) submitted legislation to create licensing regulation. At the request of MNANP, the bill was amended so that the language required a registratio n credential instead of a license. Other changes deleted provisions creating violations of p ractice of naturopathic medicine so that only use of designated titles was restricted. The practice of all naturopathic modalities is unrestricted and available to all in the public domain. 2. There was general agreement that registration of do ctors of naturopathic medicine was the appropriate level of regulation. However, there is not agreement that traditional naturopathy practitioners would be largely unaffect ed after implementation of Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E. Concerns of traditional naturopath Work G roup Members that practitioners under 146A would not be able to practice arise from those regulatory elements in the registration law which are similar to licensure and the ease with which amendment of the word \"registration\" to \"licensure\" would, with few other changes, have the effect of restricting the continued practice of traditional n aturopathy by traditional naturopaths. 3. Traditional naturopath Work Group Members requested several changes to provide protective language and assurance that any future l egislation to change registration to licensing would not threaten or compromise continue d practice of traditional naturopathy by traditional naturopaths. These changes, shown in Appendix B, included: a. Amending the description of naturopathic medicine s ervices, procedures and treatments in Minn. Stat. section 147E.05, in eithe r of two ways: i. Adding a clarifying paragraph referencing complemen tary and alternative health care practices not requiring a credential and provi ded under Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A (See Appendix B, item 2b.) ii. Alternatively, adopt \"model language\" that included a new definition of naturopathic medicine and an extensively revised sc ope of practice. (The model language is not included in Appendix B); b. Deleting the definition of naturopathic physical me dicine incorporated in the scope of practice because it included in reference to naturo pathic modalities, qualities of nature available to all living things. (See Appendix B, it em 4); c. Amending the protected titles in Minn. Stat. sectio n 147E.10 to restrict titles used to \"registered doctor of naturopathic medicine\" with c orresponding initials and to clarify that the term naturopathy in all its noun and adjec tival forms was not restricted. (See Appendix B, item 3); and 7 d. Adding a definition of \"Complementary and Alternati ve Health Care Practices\" to Minn. Stat. section 147E.01 (See Appendix B, item 5 ). 4. The MNANP Work Group Members reiterated that the am endments were unnecessary, that Minn. Stat. 147E was a registration statute an d that the issue of licensure was irrelevant because Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E does not pr ohibit anyone currently protected under Minn. Stat. 146A, specifically citing 147E.10 , Subd. 2. regarding other health care practitioners as stating: Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prohibi t or to restrict: (1) the practice of a profession by individuals who are licensed, certified, or registered under other laws of this state and are p erforming services within their authorized scope of practice; (2) the provision of the complementary and alternat ive healing methods and treatments, including naturopathy, as described in Chapter 146A; (3) the practice of naturopathic medicine by an ind ividual licensed, registered, or certified in another state and emplo yed by the government of the United States while the individual is engage d in the performance of duties prescribed by the laws and regulations of the United States; (4) the practice by a naturopathic doctor duly lice nsed, registered, or certified in another state, territory, or the Distr ict of Columbia when incidentally called into this state for consultatio n with a Minnesota licensed physician or Minnesota registered naturopa thic doctor; or (5) individuals not registered by this chapter from the use of individual modalities which comprise the practice of naturopat hic medicine. 5. Fourteen states, the District of Columbia and the U .S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands currently regulate naturopathic doctors. These laws require education, examination and continuing education equivalent to provisions enacted in Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E. The scope of practice, and the modalities and titles allowed and prohibited to licensees in these jurisdictions vary. 6. Traditional Naturopath Members in the Work Group st ated support of licensure for doctors of naturopathic medicine if the changes in paragraph #3, a. through d. above, were adopted. 7. In the traditional naturopath community, members of MNACAP strongly oppose licensing of doctors of naturopathic medicine. MNAC AP has opposed credentialing of any naturopathic practitioners arguing that the public is adequately protected under Minn. Stat. Ch 146A. MNACAP is also concerned that an unintended consequence of any credentialing is that manufactur ers of supplements and other products may restrict distribution and sale to pers ons registered or licensed by the State of Minnesota as Doctors of Naturopathic Medic ine. Though a MNACAP representative stated support for registration of n aturopathic medical doctors at the December 9 th Work Group meeting, MNACAP is concerned that the f ull repercussions of registration are not yet known in the natural health community. 8 8. MNANP Work Group Members stated satisfaction with r egistration as the designated level of regulation for doctors of naturopathic med icine and stated the professional association they represented did not intend to seek licensure. The assurances sought in paragraph #3 above were declined by MNANP Work G roup members as redundant and unnecessary at the present time, but MNANP Work Group Members agreed to discuss the impact of Minn. Stat. Ch. 147 E on Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A practitioners after the registration statute is imp lemented on July 1, 2009. MNANP representatives on the Work Group could not agree t o not oppose the specific amendments requested by traditional naturopathy Wor k Group members. MNANP representatives on the Work Group believed there we re many uncertainties about implementation of Ch. 147E; they thought other issu es might arise between the present and the 2010 Legislative Session, and there could b e concerns of other professional associations and organizations that would need to b e considered. 9. The Work Group Member representing the Minnesota Me dical Association stated that the organization may have concerns about some of the requested changes and has not had an opportunity to consider further chan ges to Minn. Stat. Ch.147E, but is not opposed to considering amendments after the Jul y1, 2009 implementation of the registration statute. 10. Naturopathy Work Group Members agreed that registra tion is the appropriate level of regulation of doctors of naturopathic medicine a t the present time, but disagreement persists as to whether Minn. Stat Ch. 147E will adequately ensure continued practice of traditional naturopathy by tr aditional naturopaths under Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. Recommendations and Proposed Legislation 1. There was no agreement by all Work Group members re garding recommendations and proposed legislation concerning the appropriate level of regulation for practitioners with a postgraduate degree in naturop athic medicine. 9 II IIssue ssue 2: of Practice: Naturopathic Medi cine 2: Definitions of Practice: Naturopathic Medicine 2: Definitions of Practice: Naturopathic Medicine 2: Definitions of Practice: Naturopathic Medicine and Traditional and Traditional and Traditional and Traditional Naturopathy Naturopathy Naturopathy Naturopathy Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, section 1 2, Subdivision 1 (2), directs the Work Group to develop recommendations to address the iss ue of the definitions to be used for the recommended regulatory scheme to ensure the distinc tion between the practice of naturopathic medicine and the practice of tradition al naturopathy. Work Group Findings and Outcomes 1. Traditional naturopath representatives requested ch anges to definitions to provide assurance that future legislative activity would no t threaten or compromise continued practice of traditional naturopathy by traditional naturopaths. These requested changes, shown in Appendix B, included: a. Adding a clarifying paragraph referencing complemen tary and alternative health care practices not requiring a credential and provided u nder Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A in the naturopathic medicine services, procedures and trea tments described in Minn. Stat. section 147E.05. Alternatively, proposing \"model la nguage\" that included a new definition of naturopathic medicine and a scope of practice; b. Deleting the definition of naturopathic physical me dicine because it included in reference to naturopathic modalities, qualities of nature freely available to all living things. 2. Doctors of naturopathic medicine Work Group Members declined requests to change definitions stating that consumer protection requir ed fully defining the philosophy, scope and practice of naturopathic medicine, and that inc luding traditional naturopathy modalities in the naturopathic medicine scope did n ot preclude others from using those modalities under Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. 3. Doctors of naturopathic medicine Work Group Me mbers asserted that the terms \"naturopathy\" and \"traditional naturopathy\" should be defined in Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E. Doctors of naturopathic medicine Members pointed ou t that the term \"naturopathy\" appeared once with reference to Minn. Stat. Ch. 146 A, and that \"traditional naturopathy\" did not appear in Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E. Doctors of naturopathic medicine Members argued that the term \"naturopathy,\" if needing defi nition, should be defined in Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. However, Traditional Naturopathy Members declined to consider making any amendments to Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. 4. Traditional Naturopathy Work Group Members requeste d adding to Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E the definition of \"complementary and alternative he alth care practices\" as written in Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. Doctors of naturopathic medic ine Work Group Members opposed this request as unnecessary and inappropriate, and that if for any reason should be added to Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E, would similarly be reason to add it to the practice act definitions of all other health care professionals regulated in Minnesota. 10 5. MNACAP representatives stated in written comments t o a draft of this report that Work Group discussion of definitions did not adequately address use of the term \"doctor\" by members of the traditional naturopathy community wh o have doctorate degrees from naturopathy schools that are not accredited. Simila rly, MNACAP states that the Work Group did not address the history of the term \"natu ropath,\" its use in the community for the benefit of other complementary and alternative healthcare practitioners and consumers and how to distinguish those naturopaths who will be registered from those who will not. Recommendations and Proposed Legislation 1. Naturopathy Work Group Members did not agree about recommendations and proposed legislation concerning Definitions of Prac tice: Naturopathic Medicine and Traditional Naturopathy . 11 II IIssue ssue ssue ssue 3: Accreditation of Naturopathic Education a 3: Accreditation of Naturopathic Education a 3: Accreditation of Naturopathic Education a 3: Accreditation of Naturopathic Education and nd nd nd Level of Education and Training Level of Education and Training Level of Education and Training Level of Education and Training Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, section 1 2, Subdivision 1 (3), directs the Work Group to develop recommendations to address the iss ue of the level of education and training, including appropriate credentialing of ed ucational programs for the postgraduate degree level of practice. Work Group Findings and Outcomes 1. Each of the following naturopathic education progra ms is currently accredited by an accrediting agency or state approval agency recogni zed by the U.S. Secretary of Education as a \"reliable authority as to the qualit y of postsecondary education\" within the meaning of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as ame nded: a. Bastyr University , Kenmore WA, accreditation with Northwest Commissi on on Colleges and Universities. b. Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine, New Wes tminster, BC Canada. c. Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, North Yo rk, Ontario Canada. d. National College of Natural Medicine , Portland, OR, accreditation with Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. e. Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine & Health Sciences , Tempe, AZ, accreditation with North Central Association of Col leges and Schools. f. University of Bridgeport, College of Naturopathic M edicine , Bridgeport, CT, accreditation with New England Association of Schoo ls and Colleges. g. National University of Health Sciences , Lombard, IL, accreditation with North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. 2. Each of the above programs has voluntarily obtained accreditation by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) except Bouche r Institute of Naturopathic Medicine and National University of Health Sciences which have candidate, or pre- accredited, status. 3. The U.S. Secretary of Education recognizes CNME as the national accrediting agency for programs leading to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medi cine (N.D. or N.M.D.) or Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.) degree. CNME was approved by Sec retary of Education William Bennet in 1987. However, that approval was withdraw n on January 16, 2001 by U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley on evidence that CNME did not apply and enforce its standards to Southwest College of Natur opathic Medicine & Health Sciences during the period 1996 to 1999. CNME reapplied for recognition, and in 2003, the U.S. Secretary of Education restored approval. 4. CNME is currently the programmatic accrediting agen cy for naturopathic medical education assuring equivalency and consistency in t he level and quality of education and training in the four-year naturopathic colleges and programs in the United States and Canada. 12 5. The naturopathic education programs listed above ea ch require a bachelor's degree for application for admission, and require at least fou r years of academic lecture, laboratory and clinical course work at the doctorate level. 6. None of the above naturopathic education programs o ffer home-study, correspondence, distance learning or external-degrees, and such pro grams are not eligible for affiliation with CNME. 7. Currently, in order to take the Naturopathic Physic ians Licensing Examination required by Minn. Stat.Ch. 147E, a person must have graduate d from a CMNE accredited program. 8. Traditional Naturopathy Work Group Members expresse d concern about time periods when a program's accreditation was suspended and wh ether graduates of un-accredited programs could become registered doctors of naturop athic medicine. Work Group Members acknowledged that it will be the responsibi lity of the Board of Medical Practice to assure that applicants are qualified and meet al l the requirements for registration. 9. MNACAP representatives stated in written comments t o a draft of this report that Work Group discussion did not adequately address and rev iew concerns expressed by legislators during the 2008 Legislature about there being no requirement in Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E for doctors of naturopathic medicine to co mplete clinical training or residencies within the medical system. Similarly, MNACAP repres entatives stated that the Work Group did not pursue analysis and comparison with o ther post-graduate educational programs conferring naturopathic doctor (N.D.) degr ees which are not accredited by CNME and which require as much or more credit hours of traditional naturopathy coursework that those programs accredited by CNME. Recommendations and Proposed Legislation 1. Naturopathy Work Group Members agreed there were no recommendations or proposed legislation concerning the level of educat ion and training, or the credentialing of educational programs for the postg raduate degree level of practice.

Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, section 1 2, Subdivision 1 (4), directs the Work Group to develop recommendations to address the iss ue of the scope of practice for naturopathic practitioners with a postgraduate degr ee in naturopathic medicine that would be exclusive to these practitioners and would refle ct the level of education and training. The scope of practice must acknowledge and ensure the c ontinued practice of all complementary and alternative health practices, including naturop athy, currently practiced under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 146A. Work Group Findings and Outcomes 1. Traditional Naturopathy Work Group Members requeste d the following changes to the scope of practice in Minn. Stat. section 147E.0 5: a. Adding a clarifying paragraph referencing complemen tary and alternative health care practices not requiring a credential and provided u nder Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A in the naturopathic medicine services, procedures and trea tments described in Minn. Stat. section 147E.05. (See Appendix B, item 4.) or b. Alternatively, proposing \"model language\" that incl uded a new definition of naturopathic medicine and a scope of practice. (The model language is not included in Appendix B.) 2. MNANP Work Group Members declined requests to chang e the scope of practice and stated satisfaction with Minn. Stat. section 14 7E.05 as enacted and asserted that the scope, though narrower than their education and training, did not infringe on the ability of traditional naturopaths to continue the practice of naturopathy under Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. 3. Representatives of the Acupuncture Association of M innesota expressed concern about acupuncture practice by doctors of naturopath ic medicine. MNANP Work Group Members stated that though acupuncture was in cluded in education and training of doctors of naturopathic medicine, it wa s not included in the scope of practice in Minn. Stat. section 147E.05, and regist ered doctors of naturopathic medicine could not practice acupuncture in Minnesot a unless they met the requirements for and were licensed acupuncturists. 4. The Work Group Member representing the Minnesota Me dical Association stated that the organization has not had an opportunity to consider further changes to Minn. Stat. Ch.147E, and may have concerns about any chan ges to the scope of practice, but is not opposed to considering amendments after the July1, 2009 implementation of the registration statute. 14 5. MNACAP representatives and a Traditional Naturopath y Work Group Member stated in written comments to a draft of this report that Wor k Group discussion did not fully address the following concerns: a. the request of traditional naturopathy practitioner s for details of a scope of practice that would be exclusive to doctors of naturopathic medicine and of modalities not already practiced by them under Minn. Stat. Ch 146A ; b. the need and appropriateness for the definition of \"naturopathic physical medicine;\" c. the ability of traditional naturopaths who dispense vitamins and supplements and the reported decision of a manufacturer to distribute i ts products only to registered or licensed doctors of naturopathic medicine; and d. the effect on the practices of traditional naturopa ths in other states where similar credentialing legislation has been enacted . Recommendations and Proposed Legislation 1. Naturopathy Work Group Members were not in agreemen t about recommendations and proposed legislation concerning scope of practi ce for naturopathic practitioners with a postgraduate degree in naturopathic medicine that would be exclusive to these practitioners and would reflect the level of educat ion and training. 15 II IIssue ssue ssue ssue 5: Appropriate Regulatory Authority 5: Appropriate Regulatory Authority 5: Appropriate Regulatory Authority 5: Appropriate Regulatory Authority Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, section 1 2, Subdivision 1 (5), directs the Work Group to develop recommendations to address the iss ue of the appropriate regulatory authority, including the possible establishment of a new regulatory board. Work Group Findings and Outcomes 1. All Naturopathy Work Group Members agreed that the Board of Medical Practice is the appropriate regulatory authority for registration o f Naturopathic Medical Doctors. 2. MNACAP asserted that the Minnesota Department of He alth would be a more appropriate authority for credentialing of Naturopa thic Medical Doctors, because it already has responsibility for regulating tradition al naturopathy practitioners under Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A, and because under Minn. Stat. Ch. 1 46A it has been regulating the practitioners who would apply for and likely become registered doctors of naturopathic medicine under Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E. Recommendations and Proposed Legislation 1. Naturopathy Work Group Members agreed that there we re no recommendations or proposed legislation to be made concerning the appr opriate regulatory authority. 16 II IIssue Regulatory Requirements for Naturopa Medicine 6: Other Regulatory Requirements for Naturopathic Medicine 6: Other Regulatory Requirements for Naturopathic Medicine 6: Other Regulatory Requirements for Naturopathic Medicine Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, section 1 2, Subdivision 1 (6), directs the Work Group to develop recommendations to address the iss ue of any other regulatory requirements for naturopathic medicine the work gro up deems necessary. Work Group Findings and Outcomes 1. Work Group Members discussed changes to Minn. Stat. section 147E.10 regarding professional titles. A discrepancy between words in the titles protected and designated initials of \"N.M.D.\" was noted. The init ials N.M.D. as well as N.D. are conferred titles of federally recognized degrees, t herefore consistent with registration, licensure and title protection of doc tors of naturopathic medicine. 2. Traditional Naturopathic Work Group Members request ed changing titles and initials listed in Minn. Stat. section 147E.10 to a title of \"Registered Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine\" with corresponding initials of \"R.D.N.M.\" so that there was one exclusive title, additional clarity and less confusion. In ad dition, they requested a protective amendment so that use of the title and or any other title or term not other wise prohibited by law would not be restricted or regulated under Minn. Stat. Ch.147E a nd would be allowed for use in the public domain. 3. The Work Group Member representing the Minnesota Me dical Association stated the Association's opposition to use of the word \"physic ian\" by doctors of naturopathic medicine and inclusion of the initials \"M.D.\" in Mi nn. Stat. section 147E.10, subdivision 1, as in \"N.M.D.\" 4. MNANP Work Group Members declined requests to chan ge titles and initials from those designated in Minn. Stat. section 147E.10, su bdivision 1. The discrepancy between protected titles and initials was acknowled ged. MNANP Work Group Members stated that the initials \"N.M.D.\" represent the educational degree that graduates of accredited doctoral education programs receive and its use is consistent with all other doctoral degrees granted by federall y accredited programs. Regarding the title and initials \"Registered Doctors of Natur opathic Medicine,\" MNANP Work Group Members stated that the public did not know t he title \"Registered Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine\" and the corresponding initia ls of \"R.D.N.M.\" and would be confused by their use. Additionally, ND, N.D., NMD and N.M.D. are legitimate degree titles granted by U.S. Secretary of Educatio n approved and federally- recognized doctoral level programs, and their use i s consistent with registration or licensure of the corresponding degree. MNANP Work G roup Members agreed that the word \"physician\" would never be used by registe red doctors of naturopathic medicine, and use of the word in their professional association's name was an issue that would have to be resolved in the future. 17 5. Department of Health staff proposed consideration o f a Statement of Legislative Intent as an amendment to Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E. Tra ditional Naturopath Work Group Members and MNACAP representatives submitted sugges ted revisions to the draft Statement. See Appendix D. MNANP Work Group Members opposed this proposal. See Appendix C. The Minnesota Medical Association a nd Minnesota Chiropractic Association Work Group Members also opposed this pr oposal. Reasons included: a. Legislative intent is rarely used in language passe d in the Minnesota House. b. The Office of the Revisor has been consistent in re commending that legislative intent not be included in statutes so that every wo rd in enactments is weighed as relevant. 6. The terms \"traditional naturopathy\" and \"traditiona l naturopath\" are not currently defined in Minnesota law, and are not defined by other stat es providing licensure or registration for naturopathic doctors or physicians. MNANP Work Group members assert that traditional naturopaths protected under Minn. Stat. 146A do not have U.S. Department of Education recognized training. These practitioners are not required to pass a standardized examination to demonstrate their skills and knowled ge. MNANP Work Group members therefore stated that, while the terms \"traditional naturopath\" and \"traditional naturopathy\" have been used as terminology for dist inction regarding the Naturopathy Work Group, such use does not imply a protected tit le or definition in statute, and such use does not suggest that it should be so defined. 7. Possible amendments to Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A were of fered by Minnesota Department of Health staff and were discussed. Traditional Nat uropathic Work Group Members opposed any changes to Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. Member s of the traditional naturopathy community expressed concern that any le gislative initiative to amend Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A would risk losing existing fre edoms to practice afforded to alternative and complementary health care providers . 8. The Work Group Member representing the Office of Co mplementary and Alternative Health Care Practice (OCAP) stated that requests of Traditional Naturopathy Work Group Members appeared quite reasonable, that the c hanges in language sought were not so substantive as to affect the registration la w and how doctors of naturopathic medicine would practice and that there was benefit to repetition to assure clarity in the law's communication to the healthcare community . The OCAP member urged reconsideration of amending language proposed by Tr aditional Naturopathy Work Group Members to avoid more conflict in the legisla tive process. 9. MNANP Work Group Members stated that many of the pr oposed amendments from naturopath practitioners protected under Minn. Stat . Ch. 146A were discussed, considered and decided in the 2008 legislative sess ion, either in conversations between stakeholders and legislators or as amendmen ts in legislative committee hearings. MNANP members assert that Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E as passed and to be implemented will not negatively impact the traditio nal naturopathy community practicing under Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. 18 10. MNANP Work Group members concur that the appropriat e location for additional statements and definitions relating to those curren tly protected under Minn. Stat. 146A is in Minn. Stat. Ch. 146A. 11. MNACAP representatives and a Traditional Naturopath y Work Group Member stated in written comments to a draft of this report that the issues directed by Minnesota Session Laws 2008, Chapter 348, section 12 for the Naturopa thy Work Group to consider were not fully discussed, and that the impact of registe ring doctors of naturopathic medicine is not well understood and has created widespread conf usion that continues. Further, it was stated that the amendments sought by traditional na turopaths (see Appendix B) should not wait until the 2010 Legislative Session and in addition were not sufficient to protect the average citizen. It was recommended that the Wo rk Group be extended for another one to two years with commensurate delay in the eff ective date of Minn. Stat. Ch. 147E until all the issues are fully addressed and resolv ed. Recommendations and Proposed Legislation 1. Naturopathy Work Group Members were not in agreemen t about any recommendations and proposed legislation concerning other regulatory requirements for naturopathic medicine deemed necessary.

(3) complementary and alternativ e health care practices including but not limited t o naturopathy that do not require registration and are a lso provided under chapter 146A. Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C Recommendations for the Naturopathy Work Grou p MNANP Recommendations for the Naturopathy Work Grou p MNANP Recommendations for the Naturopathy Work Grou p MNANP Recommendations for the Naturopathy Work Grou p November 18, 2008 November 18, 2008 November 18, 2008 November 18, 2008 H.F. No. 1724, Section 12 requires the Naturopathy Work Group to \"develop recommendations and proposed legislation, as necessary, on regulati ng naturopathic practitioners who are practicing as naturopathic medical doctors and who have postgraduate degrees in naturopathic medicine.\" Six issues are required to be addressed in the recommendations. The Minnesota Association of Naturopathic Physicians (MNANP) requ ests that the Work Group adopt recommendations in accordance with the following: (1) Level of regulation for practitioners with a postgr aduate degree in naturopathic medicine As indicated in 147E, registered naturopathic docto rs shall practice autonomously to the limits of their scope of practice. The MNANP recom mends the practice of naturopathic medicine be governed by the requirements and limits set out in 147E and by regulations prepared by the Registered Naturopathic Doctor Advi sory Council and approved by the Board of Medical Practice. The regulations should adhere to the registration standards and scope of practice provided by 147E and provide furt her detail regarding the procedures of the Registered Naturopathic Advisory Council in carryin g out duties listed in 147E Subd. 3. (2) Definitions to ensure the distinction between natur opathic medicine and traditional naturopathy Definition of Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine is defined in 147E.01 Subd. 1 0 and the MNANP recommends this definition be maintained. Registered doctors of na turopathic medicine are limited to those who meet registration requirements set out in 147E including completion of an approved naturopathic medical education program and passage of a national naturopathic licensing examination. Traditional naturopathy is not currently defined in Minnesota law, and is not defined by other states providing licensure or registration for natu ropathic doctors or physicians. Naturopaths protected under 146A do not have U.S. Department of Education recognized training. These practitioners are not required to pass a standardiz ed examination to demonstrate their skills and knowledge. Both the naturopaths protected under 146A and MNACA P have proposed to amend the definition of naturopathic medicine in 147E.01 Subd . 10 to include language stating that complementary and alternative health care practices described in 146A.01 Subd. 4 are in the public domain, and may be practiced by unregistered and unlicensed natural health practitioners. It is a matter of consumer protecti on to define the practice of naturopathic medicine and its scope. Listing practice modalitie s in Statue 147E does not prevent others from using those modalities in their work under 146 A. Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C A-22 Protected Titles Naturopaths protected under 146A and MNACAP suggest title protection be limited to \"registered doctor of naturopathic medicine\" and \"R .D.N.M.\" They also suggest a number of titles be maintained in the public domain. The purpose of 147E is to clearly define and protec t a title and scope for registered naturopathic doctors. Those eligible for registrati on under 147E receive degrees from naturopathic medical schools accredited both region ally and nationally under the purview of the U.S. Department of Education. These programs le ad to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (N.D. or N.M.D.) or Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.) degrees; the protected titles should reflect the educational degree achieved. A ssigning 147E registrants abbreviations such as \"RNMD\" serves only to confuse consumers of natural healthcare. Furthermore, it is not the purpose of 147E to defin e or protect titles for naturopaths protected under 146A. The term \"naturopath\" has been kept i n the public domain under 147E. This was a compromise worked out with the various groups working under 146A earlier in the legislative process. Naturopathic Physical Medicine Naturopaths protected under 146A and MNACAP propose that the definition of naturopathic physical medicine be deleted from 147E. Naturopathic physical medicine is part of the pract ice of naturopathic medicine and serves to describe its therapeutic approach. As part of a pr actice act, the parameters of the scope of practice of naturopathic medicine must be defined a nd clearly established within this law. It is important, therefore, that the definition remain . Including the definition of naturopathic physical medicine in 147E does not restrict others from using these modalities in their own work. Complementary and Alternative Health Care Practices Naturopaths protected under 146A and MNACAP propose to add the definition of Complementary and Alternative Health Care Practices as written in 146A Subd. 4. The MNANP asserts that this is unnecessary. This p roposal would also impact definitions of all other health care practitioners regulated by th e state, such as medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, doctors of chiropractic, physician assi stants, nurse practitioners, licensed practical nurses, licensed acupuncturists, nurse mi dwives, lay midwives, physical therapists, dieticians, massage therapists and so on. (3) Level of education and training required of naturop athic physicians, and credentialing of postgraduate educational programs Education and training required of registered natur opathic doctors as well as credentialing of postgraduate educational programs are defined in 14 7E, and the MNANP recommends these definitions be maintained. Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C A-23 MNACAP suggests that a review of 147E's education, testing and accreditation standards is needed. MNACAP expresses concern with coursework o ffered at \"approved naturopathic medical education programs,\" per the definition in 147E.01 Subd. 3. The legitimacy of naturopathic medical education pr ograms is evaluated by the U.S. Department of Education recognized accrediting agen cy, the Council on Naturopathic Medicine (CNME). The CNME has 30 years of experien ce in evaluating naturopathic medical education. Furthermore, other states offer ing licenses or registrations to naturopathic doctors rely on the CNME's expertise. The MNANP recommends the current law, which recognizes the CNME as the appropriate b ody to evaluate and accredit naturopathic educational programs be maintained. M NACAP is also concerned with the adequacy of the 25 hour annual continuing education requirement. A survey of other states providing for naturopathic doctor licensure or regi stration suggests that 25 hours annually is adequate, and turns up several states that require even less continuing education. The MNANP recommends the 25-hour annual continuing educ ation requirement be maintained. (4) Scope of practice of naturopathic physicians The scope of practice of naturopathic doctors is de fined in 147E, and the MNANP recommends the definition be maintained. MNACAP recommends several deletions to the scope of practice detailed in 147E.05 be adopted. The MNANP asserts that in order to protec t the public, the parameters of the scope of practice of naturopathic medicine need to be cle arly established within this law. These practices reflect the practice of naturopathic medi cine and comprise naturopathic medical training from federally accredited, 4-year, residen tial naturopathic medical schools. Therefore, it is important that the language remain s. Furthermore, nothing in Minnesota Statute 147E prohibits or restricts others from uti lizing these modalities in their own work. MNACAP also emphasizes that they feel hospital admi ssions privileges are not a scope of practice issue, and should be included in a separat e section of 147E, the definitions section 147E.01. The MNANP asserts that hospital admitting privilege is, indeed, a scope issue, and belongs in 147E.05. (5) Appropriate regulatory authority The MNANP recommends the Registered Naturopathic Do ctor Advisory Council regulate naturopathic doctors, with the Board of Medical Pra ctice approval of regulations. (6) Any other regulatory requirements deemed necessary In response to proposed legislative intent language , it was stated in the October 14 th , 2008 naturopathic doctor working session meeting by the MMA lobbyist attendee, Sarah Noznesky, experience has been that a preamble is mo re commonly used in the Senate, but rarely used in the House. Furthermore, even if used , it often never passes. Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C Appendix C A-24 The revisor's office has been consistent in recomme nding that legislative intent is not to be included in bill language so that every word in leg islation be weighed as relevant. In response to the proposed model language for futu re licensing by naturopaths protected by 146A, 147E as written in statute is not a licensing bill. The MNANP has no proposed licensure requests. In conclusion, many of the proposed amendments, as well as variations of those amendments, from the naturopaths protected under 146A and MNACA P, were addressed in the 2008 legislative session, either in conversations betwee n the groups and with legislators or as proposed amendments. MN Statute 147E was heard bef ore 12 committees and 3 floor sessions. Proponents were advised on bill language by the revisor's office and by both House and Senate Legal Counsel. Delegates for the Minnes ota Association of Naturopathic Physicians fully support MN Statute 147E as passed. We would like to reiterate that we fully support Minnesota Statute 146A and always hav e. We thought the discussions were productive and thank the Legislature for the proces s of putting together the Naturopathy Work Group (all stakeholders) to discuss everyone's concerns. We are assured that Minnesota Statute 147E does not impact anyone pract icing under 146A, either now or in the future. Appendix D Appendix D Appendix D Appendix D A-25 Minnesota Department of Health October 14, 2008 MDH Proposed Statement of Legislative Intent: The legislature finds that it is appropriate to cre dential naturopathic physicians by means of a registration system as defined in Minn. Stat. \u00a7214. 001, subd. 3. (3). It is the intent of the legislature to restrict to those practitioners who have met the qualifications and requirements set forth in this chapter exclusiv e use of the protected title designated in section 147E.10. Practitioners of naturopathic medicine use both con ventional medicine practices and complementary and alternative healing methods and t reatments. Nothing in this chapter is intended to prohibit or restrict the practices or p ractitioners of traditional naturopathy, the provision of such services, the practices or practi tioners of other complementary and alternative healing methods and treatments described in chapter 146A, or the use of titles or terms that include the words \"naturopathy,\" \"naturopathic\" or \"naturopath\" or any other title or term not otherwise prohibited by law. Traditional Naturopath Work Group Delegates Suggested Legislative Intent language The legislature finds that it is appropriate to cre dential naturopathic physicians by means of a registration system as defined in Minn. Stat. \u00a7214. 001, subd. 3. (3). It is the intent of the legislature to restrict to those practitioners who have met the qualifications and requirements set forth in this chapter exclusive use of the protecte d titles designated in section 147E.10. Nothing in this chapter is intended to prohibit or restrict the practices or practitioners of naturopathy, the provision of such services or the practices or prac titioners of other complementary and alternative described in chapter 146A or the use of titles or or any other title or t erm not otherwise prohibited by law. MNACAP practitioners suggested Legislative Intent l anguage: Practitioners of naturopathic medicine use both con ventional medicine practices and complementary and alternative practices to healthca re. This Statement of Legislative Intent is included to reduce possible confusion about these t wo types of practices. The intent of the Legislature is to ensure the public is protected by registered doctors of naturopathic medicine who practice naturopathic medicine which includes i nvasive medical procedures registered under Minn. Stat 147E. Registered doctors of naturopathi c medicine and unregistered, unlicensed complementary and alternative practitioners also pr actice complementary and alternative practices which are non-invasive and cause no harm, under Minn. Stat. 146A. By registering doctors of naturopathic medicine, the Legislature d oes not intend to restrict naturopaths, homeopaths, and other practitioners practicing unde "}
