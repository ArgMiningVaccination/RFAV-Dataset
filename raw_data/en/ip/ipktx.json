Fairly examines the pros and cons of this highly charged issue. Deciding whether or when to vaccinate a child is one of the most important--and most difficult--health-care decisions a parent will ever make. The recent increase in the number of vaccinations recommended and the concurrent controversies about whether vaccinations are safe or even effective have left many parents confused and concerned. Midwife, herbalist, and mother of four, Aviva Jill Romm sifts through the spate of current research on vaccine safety and efficacy and offers a sensible, balanced discussion of the pros and cons of each routine childhood vaccination. She presents the full spectrum of options available to parents: full vaccination on a standardized or individualized schedule, selective vaccination, or no vaccinations at all. Negotiating daycare and school requirements, dealing with other parents, and traveling with an unvaccinated child are covered in detail. The book also suggests ways to strengthen children's immune systems and maintain optimal health and offers herbal and homeopathic remedies for childhood ailments. Emphasizing that no single approach is appropriate for every child, the author guides parents as they make the choices that are right for their child.

Its commonsense, nonhysterical approach assures legitimate informed consent.\" \u2014 Peggy O'Mara, publisher of Mothering magazine \"Aviva Romm has written a book of aid and comfort for agonized parents who must make intelligent life decisions for their kids while lacking reliable information about how vaccines act.\" \u2014 Richard Moskowitz, M.D. \"This must-read book is a valuable resource for all parents.\" \u2014 Mary Bove, N.D., author of The Encyclopedia of Natural Healing for Children and Infants \"Aviva Jill Romm brings a high level of intelligence and insight to the debate on public policies regarding vaccination. Level-headed and thoroughly researched, yet eminently readable, her book leaves no stones unturned and refuses to shy away from challenging the status quo. It should be read by every parent who is considering vaccination for their child; and I daresay that it should also be mandatory reading for every health professional in the position of recommending (or discouraging) the use of vaccines.\" \u2014 Robert Rountree, M.D., coauthor of Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child \"Aviva Romm has written a well researched book that will educate and empower parents.\" \u2014 Lawrence B. Palevsky, M.D., Holistic and Integrative Pediatrician \"Now especially, as the anthrax scare has some folks advocating compulsory vaccinations for all, Romm's wise and well-written book is a breath of fresh air.\" \u2014 MS, Napra ReView, January/February 2002 \"Romm takes a holistic approach to disease prevention yet provides balanced information on all aspects of the vaccination controversy. Overall, the book uses a commonsense approach that allows the reader to weigh the available options.\" \u2014 Living Without, Summer 2002 \"This must-read book is a valuable resource for all parents.\" \u2014 Mary Bove, N.D., author of The Encyclopedia of Natural Healing for Children and Infants "}
