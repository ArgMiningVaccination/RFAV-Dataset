Springtime across the country is a time of rebirth and new beginnings. Many of us are recommitting to healthy lifestyle habits with renewed energy and dedication. Vibrant health begins with finding better work/life balance, finding time to exercise, and ensuring adequate sleep. But taking a look at dietary intake is also a central component. Choosing organic food, when available and affordable is one additional commitment to consider as you overhaul your personal health check list. Over the past decades there has been a burgeoning of organic farmers, eschewing chemical fertilizers and working hard to build robust soil and incorporate novel approaches to pest control. We are all the beneficiaries of this creativity and dedication. In addition, there is now [research to show that organic food production](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658984/) and consumption has potential benefits for human health. A study of more than 68,000 people indicates that [eating organic may lower cancer risks by 25%](https://www.pccmarkets.com/sound-consumer/2019-03/eat-organic-lower-cancer-risk-by-25/). Participants were analyzed for first-incidence cases of breast, prostate, skin and colorectal cancer, and lymphomas. Most significantly, the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma fell by 86%! There is also some evidence for enhanced nutritional value in organically grown produce, especially [with regard to flavonoids levels](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2017/june/organic-conditions-boost-flavonoids-and-antioxidant-activity-in-onions.html), which boast high antioxidants which help prevent and address everything from diabetes to heart disease to cancer. The [Environmental Working Group's Shopper Guide to Pesticides in Produce](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php), relates strictly to fruits and vegetables; when we add in meat, poultry, dairy and eggs we know that organically raised livestock, contains higher levels of heart-healthy omega 3 fatty acids. And with regard to growing organic grains, it has been shown that there are [lower levels of toxic metals](https://www.fda.gov/food/foodscienceresearch/risksafetyassessment/ucm485278.htm) in those grown according to USDA organic regulations. Cadmium is one example, where higher levels will be found in conventionally grown grain. With regard to produce, organic items will have less pesticide residue overall. Considering that the chemical load many of us carry from exposures to air, water, and food is increasing, whenever we can make a choice about reducing pesticide exposure, it seems like "}
