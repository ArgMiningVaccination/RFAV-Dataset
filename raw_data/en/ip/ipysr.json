The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3% THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check state laws, especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. Cannabidiol (CBD), is available in many forms, including oils. Some of the most potent oils contain up to 12,000 milligrams (mg) of CBD per 30 milliliters (mL).

This CBD oil was the only thing that blocked the pain. Although it was a new type of physical therapy, proprioceptive-deep tendon reflex therapy, that cured my pain, this CBD not only relieved the pain, it helped improve my mood, which was suffering from being in constant pain.
