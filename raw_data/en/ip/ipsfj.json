Our goal is to empower consumers and healthcare professionals with easy-to-access, simple-to-understand information and resources to make educated decisions about end-of-life care. The Closure website includes blogs, listings of resources, news items, and the Closure 101 curriculum. Closure 101 is a curriculum of educational lessons dealing with an array of complex end-of-life issues including prognosis, advance planning, medical decision making, and hospice and palliative care. These difficult concepts are explained in a way that is designed to make sense to consumers. The curriculum contains 12 easy-to-follow lessons that can be viewed online or used by health educators to teach in-person. In addition to the lessons, the site contains questionnaires and information sheets that can help guide a person through the decision-making process. Guidelines for creating a Closure 101 program are available on the site.

With better understanding of the grief process, and learning the tools and skills you will learn in this WHEE BOOK, you will find you are able to markedly lessen your pain and suffering, or those of people under your care, as you move through the grief process. WHEE: Whole Health - Easily and Effectively AKA Wholistic Hybrid derived from EMDR and EFT WHEE is a self-treatment method that is extremely simple to learn and to use, yet very rapidly and deeply effective. Within minutes it can reduce physical and psychological pains, even when these have been present for decades. WHEE is completely individualized to the preferences and needs of those who use it. No part of WHEE is a requirement. Every aspect of WHEE is but a suggestion - for people to explore and use, as and if it feels right and comfortable to do so. WHEE addresses spirit, relationships (with other people and the rest of the world), mind, emotions and body (as matter and energy). See discussion on the relationships between each of these and all the others at http://www.wholistichealingresearch.com/srmeb.html Date Last Modified 06/01/2010 Case example/study, Continuing Education course, Measure/Rating scale, PBL materials | | Primary Author: A Lion in the House, Community Media Productions, Inc. A compelling set of teaching modules is available from the Emmy Award-winning documentary about children with cancer, A LION IN THE HOUSE. Based on real-life case studies, where things do not always go so well, the stories offer a forum to consider and discuss approaches to helping families navigate life and death issues related to cancer. The Case Studies in Spirituality and Childhood Cancer Module offers specific, complicated case studies around issues of spirituality during a pediatric medical crisis. The Institute of Medicine defines pediatric palliative care to include the spiritual needs of a family, with a broad view of spirituality as the search for meaning and purpose in life and in death. Many families rely on spiritual resources in times of health-related crises, especially at end-of-life. Yet the majority of medical caregivers do not address issues of spirituality with their patients, with many feeling ill-equipped to do so. This module offers the insight of several veteran pediatric oncologists around spirituality issues. -Each DVD module contains mini movies shot over a course of six years, competencies & objectives, discussion questions, a recommended resource list, and a PowerPoint presentation.

Curlin, University of Chicago Video and audio files of a talk Dr. Farlin gave at the Mayo Clinic as part of the Veritas Forum. \"In this lecture, Farr Curlin unpacks the way medicine looks beyond science to find forces that motivate care for the sick, direct the application of medical technology, and ground clinical care in an orientation to the patient as person. He suggests that even though religious ideas are rarely made explicit in public and professional discourse about medicine, they are everywhere implicit and operative, necessarily so. In this light, Curlin argues that the time is ripe for clinicians and laypeople to develop practices of medicine that are more fulsomely and self-consciously grounded in and informed by religion.\" Date Last Modified 09/23/2009 Video, Lecture presentation | | Primary Author: Kevin Quiles This book seeks to the provide caretakers with the necessary tools to develop a warm approach toward the experiences of a loved one, friend, or patient.
