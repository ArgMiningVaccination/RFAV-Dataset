We specialize and excel in natural, drug-free solutions for neurological disorders, immune disorders, chronic and acute pain, endocrine disorders, and pediatric disorders. Our philosophy is to treat the individual first and the disease second. We recognize that the human body is designed to heal itself, and has its own self-healing abilities that modern science has only begun to understand. The vast majority of our patients are healed through a blend of modern, cutting-edge nutritional supplementation along with the ancient healing tradition of Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture (both traditional and needle-free). Additionally, we incorporate an \"east meets west\" approach to holistic medicine by utilizing modern innovations such as neurological testing, therapeutic light treatments, kinesiology. This website was created for you, the prospective patient, to help educate you on our healing methods so you can decide if our clinic is for you.
