About Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese herbs have been used for thousands of years to treat a wide range of symptoms including headaches, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, cough, nasal congestion, anxiety, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, menstrual cramps, and pain. Chinese herbs can be used as a stand-alone treatment or along with acupuncture treatments to provide enhanced benefits. There are over 300 commonly used herbs in the Chinese materia medica, and hundreds more that are less commonly used. The effects of Chinese herbs on various health ailments have been observed for thousands of years and the result is a highly sophisticated system of classification and formula composition. Some commonly used herbs include cinnamon, ginger, licorice, and mint. Most Chinese herbs that are currently used are plant-based and include leaves, stems, seeds, bark, roots, and flowers. There are also Chinese herbs that are minerals and animal parts, but animal parts are seldom used today. Chinese herbal formulas are comprised of a mixture of herbs and can include anywhere from 2 to 15+ herbs depending on the symptoms being treated. Each formula that we prescribe is tailored to your individual condition. If 10 people come in with a cough, they may receive 10 different herbal formulas that are based on their individual health circumstances. We aim to create an individualized treatment plan just for you While we primarily use acupuncture in our treatment, adding in herbs in certain situations can provide a synergistic effect with acupuncture. Chinese herbs work similar to dietary supplements, meaning that they have to be taken several times a day for anywhere from several days to several weeks for symptoms to change. There are usually very few or mild side effects, and it is important to tell use about all of the current medications and supplements you are taking to avoid any complications with your herbal prescription. Depending on the symptoms being treated, a course of herbal treatment can last several days to several months. You will be reevaluated on a periodic basis and your herbal formula may be adjusted as your symptoms change. Chinese herbal formulas come in several forms, including raw herbs, granules, pre-cooked vacuum packs, tablets/capsules, and liquid tinctures. While raw herbs are often the most effective, it is not always convenient for patients to cook herbs everyday so there are other options that make taking herbs more convenient and accessible. We will discuss the options with you and decide together on what works best for you. Herbal formulas cost anywhere from $20-70 depending on the herbs in the formula and the duration of herbal therapy required and are an additional cost on top of the acupuncture visit. "}
