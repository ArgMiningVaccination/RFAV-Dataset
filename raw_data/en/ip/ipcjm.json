Instead of gulping in spoonfuls of cough syrups, why not give this natural miracle combination a try? Lemon and honey taken together are not only effective for your sore throat and persistent cough, but also help build your immunity as well. Read on to know how you can benefit from this potent combination! In This Article What Makes Honey And Lemon An Effective Cough Remedy? Let's begin with an essential question\u2014Why do we cough? Coughing is the protective reflex to irritants in the throat and the airways ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415124/)). Pathogenic foreign bodies are mainly expelled by diaphragmatic contractioni [X]Contraction of the diaphragm, a large arch-shaped muscle located under the lungs that aid respiration. through a combination of cough and mucilaginous substancesi [X]Consisting of mucilage, a sticky, viscous fluid, made of carbohydrates that act as a lubricant in the body. . The irritants stimulate the brain to send a signal to the muscles of the chest wall, which expands to take forceful breath to expel irritants ( [2](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/cough/learn-about-cough.html)). That is why coughing is considered beneficial to the body as it clears off the mucus from within ( [3](https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html)). However, in case the mucus has accumulated in large quantities, it leads to incessant coughing making it difficult for the person to sleep at night and get through the day. A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213219821008242) analyzed the prevalence and burden of chronic cough in the US, based on 74,977 respondents. 3,654 of the respondents reported experiencing chronic cough in the preceding 12 months. The prevalence was measured at 4.9%, which increased with age in females to 5.2%. This is higher than males, who showed a 4.7% prevalence with increasing age. Benefits Of Honey And Lemon For Cough Honey and lemon combination is a traditional remedy for treating cough and has gained a fair amount of credibility in the medical community, owing majorly to its soothing effects on the throat. Individually, each ingredient has its own power to treat a cough, and when used in combination, the benefits double giving guaranteed results. Just what we need for a stubborn cough. Let's look at the individual prowess of each ingredient of this wonderful combination first: Properties Of Honey - The WHO recommends honey as the most effective demulcenti [X]A viscous substance that relieves itchiness and inflammation of mucous membranes by creating a protective layer over it. in the treatment of cough due to its chemical and nutritional composition ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3718232/#ref12)). - Honey contains antibacterial properties that help in getting rid of the harmful cough-causing bacteria ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/)). - It is loaded with vital nutrients such as potassium - 100 g of honey provides 52 mg of potassium ( [6](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328453183_Nutrient_and_antioxidant_profile_of_bee_honey_from_Kerala)). It also contains calcium, manganese, phosphorus, and copper ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2269714/)). The body needs these minerals for normal and healthy functioning. - The presence of such nutrients in honey helps repair and stimulate tissue growth. - These nutrients also serve as antioxidants and eliminate the harmful free radicals from the body. - High-quality honey contains very low water content, and hence easily attracts the surrounding tissues to use water. Properties Of Lemon - Lemon needs no introduction and is known to be one of the citrus fruits that are rich in [vitamin C](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-benefits-of-vitamin-c-for-skin-hair-and-health/)( [8](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/)). It contains 53 mg of vitamin C per 100 g ( [6](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328453183_Nutrient_and_antioxidant_profile_of_bee_honey_from_Kerala)). A glass of lemon juice provides one-third of the daily recommended allowance of this vitamin. [Vitamin C](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-benefits-of-vitamin-c-for-skin-hair-and-health/)is known to help the body build up the immune system. The antioxidants assist in repairing and preventing cell damage ( [9](https://medlineplus.gov/antioxidants.html)). - Lemons have strong antibacterial and antiviral properties. Why is the combination of honey and lemon effective against a cough? Honey's antibacterial properties kill harmful microorganisms like bacteria and viruses ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/)). This clears up congestion and relieves coughing bouts. Honey is also effective at providing relief in respiratory tract infections ( [10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32817011/)). Lemon juice boosts the immune system, fights off viruses, and reduces inflammation ( [9](https://medlineplus.gov/antioxidants.html)). Its antiseptic properties kill off germs and bacteria. This is why lemon juice is often recommended to people with allergies, sinus issues, and colds. The sweetness of honey also stimulates the salivary glands and induces the release of the mucus through the airways. Moreover, the antimicrobial and antioxidant effect of honey restricts the further formation of the mucus, thereby providing complete relief from coughing. Drinking a concoction of hot water, lemon, and honey loosens mucus, calms the throat, and clears the irritating airways. Who Can Consume Honey And Lemon For Cough? Beautiful and cozy winters.
