Gregory Professor Emeritus , Texas Tech University , Lubbock, TX , USA Abstract A mathematical model has been developed to numerically model the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) as a person ages. The model was programmed in Excel to provide a working prototype computer simulation model. The model provides est i- mates of the cumulative risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and CTE as age increases. A one -year st ep size was used. The model has two major parts: one predicts changes in slow -wave sleep as a person ages and the second component adjusts the flushing efficiency of waste products from the brain. The two components work together and interact to lower the flushing of waste components as age increases. The development of the model provides an overview of how the various factors work together that lead to the onset of Alzheimer's disease and the associated CTE. Calibration of the coefficients in the model is based on published data sets presented in the literature. Further research and refinement of calibration coefficients should be explored.

Introduction Alzheimer's disease is a complex, progressive brain deterioration that results in memory loss and loss o f mental function. It associates with the accumulation of protein fragments (amyloid ) that cl ump outside neurons and tau tangles that accumulate inside neurons [1]. Usually , amyl oid starts to accumulate first in the front center lobe of the brain that communicates with the hippocampus to convert short -term memory information to long -term memory [2]. As the di s- ease progresses, both amyloid and tau tangles increase [3] [4]. Both accumul a- paper: Gregory, J.M. (2022) Alzheimer's Disease: A Washing Machine on the Fritz .

Because the early development of amyloid affects one of the components used in the conversion from short -term to long -term memory and memory consolidation, it is logical that one of the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease is problems with memory. Various causes have been suggested. Suggested causes include genetics, pr i- marily the APOE4 allele but include other genes, inflammation, mental trauma including depression, physical trauma from head impacts, pressure waves, sleep issues, and lifestyle including exercise to name a few. Many other factors, i n- cluding education and environmental pollution, also influe nce the rate of pro- gression. Age provides the time for the various processes to operate leading to the deterioration of many parts of the brain. As the disease develops, brain structure changes , including the loss of brain volume [1] [5] [6] [7] [8] and the accumulation of amyloid and tau tangles. As these changes occur, mental pe r- formance and memory, especially short -term memory deteriorates. While ma ny factors influence the rate of development, the root cause has not been identified. Certainly, many factors are involved in the development as a person ages. Some of these factors can be managed to slow the progression but need to be controlled early in the process to obtain maximum effect. Thus, a model to simulate and preview the risks associated with changes in the various contributing factors would be a useful tool. Numerous studies have reported the APOE4 allele as the primary genetic risk factor [9]-[19]. Safinia et al. [19] report an estimate of 23 percent of the general population has one APOE4 allele. Corder et al. [20] studied familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease. They reported a dose relationship associated with the APOE4 allele. They reported an 8 -fold increase in the risk of late -onset Alz- heimer's disease for people with an APOE4 allele from each parent . Safinia et al. [19] suggest that having two APOE4 alleles leads to an 80 percent chance of d e- veloping Alzheimer's disease by age 75. Thus having an APOE4 alle le is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease. There is evidence that APOE4 disrupts lipid homeostasis in glial metabolism [9]. The glial cells are a major component of a healthy brain: shrinking during slow -wave sleep to flush away waste materials, such as amyloid ([2] page 160) [21] [22] [23]. These glial cells can experience damage from impact sports, such as boxing and football [19]. Thus, there is evidence that both APOE4 alleles and impacts on the brain are risk factors for CTE discussed later in this paper. Gofrit et al . [24] state that Alzheimer's major , neurofibrillary tangles, and sustained innate neuroinflam- mation. They suggest that inflammation is a major player in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. In another paper , Gofrit et hypothesize that Bacillus Ca l- -Guerin (BCG), a vaccine against tuberculosis, reduces infl ammation in the brain and, thus, explains why people receiving the vaccine have a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. People treated for bladder cancer with BCG had a 4 -fold reduction in risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 133 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science to people without treatment. Our exposure to infections may contribute to our risk of developing inflam- mation and Alzheimer's disease [26]. Hussein [26] reviewed the history of how researchers have concluded that a connection exists between inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. He reported a 2.5 -fold higher risk of developing Alzhe i- mer's disease for people with antibodies associated with primary infection or reactivation. There is compelling evidence that both APOE4 and infections contribute to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Both, however, are processes that require time to develop. Other factors that contribute to the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease are mental trauma including depression [15] [27]-[33], physical trauma from head impacts Green et al. [15] have reported an approximately 2-fold increased risk for Alzheimer's disease in association with depression. Green et al . [15] reported a dose- effect based on the interval between the onset of depression and onset of Alzheimer's disease. Most likely, this time interval indicates the number of years associated with depression. Even if depression is treated, the increased risk for Alzheimer's disease may remain. Kessing et al. [38] noted that the odds for Alzheimer's di s- ease are lowered by some of the older antidepressants. Finally, there is a strong connection between the development of Alzheimer's disease and slow -wave sleep ( [2] pages 157 -163) . This connection will be di s- cussed later in this paper. Lifestyle, especially fitness through exercise is another variable [39] [40]. Age provides the time for the various processes to operate leading to the dete- rioration of many parts of the brain. As the disease develops, brain structure changes , including loss of brain volume [1] [5] [6] [7] and the accu mulation of amyloid and tau tangles. As these changes occur, mental performance and memory, especially short -term memory deteriorates. The process of development has numerous variables. No one thing, such as genetics or inflammation explains the full process. There obviously is a need for a model to explain the process. Objective Based on the many factors and often suggested causes, there is uncertainty about the system that controls the development of Alzheimer's disease. Walker [2] makes a strong argument that sleep interacting with the flushing o f waste mat e- rials controls the development of Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand , Hus- sein [26] argues against the flushing hypothesis and suggests that infections are the cause. Could both be right to some degree? Needless to say, there is a need for a more complete mathematical model to describe the development of Alz-heimer's disease. The objective of this article is to present a mathematical model that offers a J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 134 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science possible explanation of how Alzheimer's disease develops and progresses with aging. Connections to the development of CTE are included. 2. Method 2.1. Model Development The propos ed Alzheimer's disease risk model is built on two major components or tasks: (1) the expression of slow -wave sleep that controls the timing for engaging the glymphatic system to flush waste products fro m the brain, and (2) the effect of genes and injury on the efficiency of the flushing system. There is considerable evidence [2] [41] [42] that sleep, especially slow -wave sleep is an important factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Certain areas of the brain seem to be affected first. Early in the development of Alzhei- mer's disease, amyloid starts to build up in the middle frontal lobe of the brain involved in controlling or staging slow -wave sleep. This area of the brain co m- municates with the hippocampus to convert short- term memory to long -term memory. The front lobe also is used in our ex ecutive function. Walker ([2] page 158) reports that the more amyloid deposits in the middle frontal lobe, the more impaired the deep -sleep or slow- wave sleep is i n older individuals. Because amyloid plaques are poisonous to neurons destroying the function of su r- rounding brain cells, the build -up of amyloid in the middle frontal lobe acc e- lerates the loss of slow -wave sleep compared to normal aging. It appears to be evidence of the beginning development of Alzheimer's disease. Coupled with the switching on and off of slow -wave sleep is the turning on and off a 10 to 20 times increase in the flushing of waste products, such as am y- loid and tau tangle materials ( [2] page 160 ) [12] [22] [23]. This increase in the effectiveness of the glymphatic system to literally flush away waste ma terials from the brain is critical to a healthy brain. Mestre et al. [21] report that \"while there are several distinct neurodegenerative causes, cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) can be found in all forms\". They suggest that glymphatic impairment plays an import ant role in SVD. This system of flushing (biological washing machine) can be compromised by the loss of slo w-wave sleep or damage to the glial cells. Glial cells next to neurons in the brain can shrink by as much as 60 percent during slow -wave sleep provid ing space to flush toxins away from ne u- rons into the cerebrospinal fluid to clean the metabolic refuse left by a day's neural activity ([2] page 161) . Sleep management and sleep quality have been linked to the buildup of am y- loid and tau in the spinal fluid of humans [41] [42]. Sleep disruption was found to increase amyloid in the fluid bathing the brain and spinal cord. Poor -quality sleep over a few da ys was associated with higher levels of tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. The evidence is strong that for good brain health, we need quality sleep, especially slow -wave sleep. J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 135 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease seems to be associated with the accumulation of amyloid waste in the brain. Thus, the risk for developing Al z- heimer's disease can be estimated by summing the waste contribution from birth to the desired age. The following equation (derived in Appendix A ) estimates the non -flushed waste that accumulates after one night of sleep: 1 0ee WFAFS FWW= (1) where WF = waste products remaining in the brain W0 = waste production A1 = calibration coefficient Fe = flushing system efficiency SWF = time in slow -wave sleep during a night of sleep Equation (1) expressed specifically for am yloid is shown in Equation (2): 1 0ee WFAFS= ( 2) where = amyloid remaining in the brain 0 = amyloid production Equation (1) expressed specifically for tau is shown in Equation (3): 1 0ee WFAFS= ( 3) where = tau remaining in the brain 0 = tau production The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease seems to be associated with the accumulation of amyloid waste. Thus, the risk for developing Alzheimer's di s- ease can be estimated by summing the amyloid waste remaining in the brain for each day of life divided by the minimum amount of amyloid associated with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease: ()1 0 011ee WFT AFS T RRR = ( 4) where R = a reference amount of amyloid generally associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease symptoms RT = accumulated risk through previous step calculation T = total time (days for Equation (4); years for Equation (5)) The (1 RT) component in the above equation limits the waste accumulation to a probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. Note that many of the v a- riables in Equation (4) may vary daily as a function of other variables. For exa m- ple, there is growing evidence [43] that genetics through APOE alleles affect the generation of amyloid 0. Sleep amount and quality var y with individuals, ma n- agement by individuals, and other variables, such as age and exercis e. Equation (4) estimates the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease associated with one day. Daily values are needed for each variable. Data input can be great- ly reduced by multiplying the right side of Equation ( 4) by 365 days/year and using average daily values for a year as input: J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 136 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science ()1 0 03651ee WFT AFS T RRR = ( 5) While this change is a practical step to estimate results for a general popul a- tion, it removes the ability to estimate risk for an individual with highly variable sleep management. A process to estimate an average slow -wave sleep amount is presented in Appendix B . Next, we can adjust the slow -wave sleep by multiplying the normal amount of slow -wave sleep by (1 RT), where RT represents the risk total up to the current age or year of calculation. It is logical that the buildup of amyloid and tau tan- gles in the brain should reduce the various brain functions, such as slow -wave sleep and flushing efficiency. The (1 RT) defin es the Fe variable when no m e- chanical insults to the brain have occurred. These equations and adjustments were programmed in Excel using a step size of one year using the RT from the previous step to update the calculations for the current step. Data repor ted by the Alzheimer's Association [1] were used to c a- librate and verify the model. The number of data points is limited. This report provides that 5.3 percent age 65 - 74, 13.8 percent age 75 - 84, and 34.6 percent age 85 and older have Alzheimer's disease. To compare to the calculated values, we need a specific age instead of a range. Ages for comparison were calculated as follows: (65 + 74)/2 = 69.5 and (75 + 84)/2 = 79.5. These ages were rounded up to the nearest whole number: 70 and 80 respectively. The number for 85 and older is more ambiguous. It certainly must be larger than 90 years. The question is how much more? The upper range certainly could be 100 or larger. On the other hand, only a small percentage of people live over 100 years. To deal with this extended range, it was assumed that a range of 15 years instead of 10 years was a reasonable estimate for ages 85 a nd older: (85 + 100)/2 = 92.5 years. This number was rounded up to the nearest whole number, 93. Based on the begi n- ning boundary condition, a 0 risk was use d for age 0 to obtain an additional data point. An R2 = 0.999 was obtained comparing mea sured to predicted data for the four ages. With four data points, the significance or probability of being a ra n- dom fit was p < 0.001. The values for A 1 (6.6) and 0/R (0.000096 for Equation 4; 0.035 for Equation ( 5)) were determined from this process. The predicted curve for risk as a function of age from b irth to 120 years of age and the mea s- ured data are shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 also illustrates the trend and bou n- dary conditions (0, upper limit 1.0) for risk. Note that the trend is highly no n- linear and cumulative over a lifespan. Because of the uncertainty of the age to be used for 85 and older, the calibra- tion was tested without the 93 years age prediction. The R2 reduced to 0.998 (p = 0.05). Either result seems to verify the model to predict the risk o f developing Alzheimer's disease for general conditions . The predicted values also were compared to the cumulative risk of developing Alzheimer's disease provided by [18]. This data set contained 50 diffe rent ages. Without any changes in calibration, the predicted values matched these reported J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 137 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science values with an R2 equal to 0.99, which was highly significant (p < 0.001). Results are shown in Figure 2 . The slope of the linear portion in Figure 2 is appro x- imately 0.034, essentially the same as the calibration value for 0/R. A mathematical model is no better than the data set used for calibration. It appears that the Alzheimer's Association either used the data from Laute n- schlager et al . [18] or that they used independent data in agreement with the Lautenschlager data. The mathematical model developed at this point has the advantage that it includes theoretical boundary conditions of 0. 0 at birth and 1.0 as a maximum probability value. It will be shown in the next section that Equation 5 as calibrated for Alzheimer's disease can also estimate the risk of develo ping Figure 1 . Predicted and measured risk for Alzheimer's disease.

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) The next step in development was to conside r the damage to brain cells from external effects. It was hypothesized that these effects might reduce the efficie n- cy, Fe, in clearing waste. External factors that are known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease include brain trauma from major head injuries, numerous little impacts during football, boxing, and soccer, and compression waves that pass through the brain from explosions. The following equation (derived in Appendix C ) was used to estimate the loss of flushing efficiency to include the effect of external stresso rs on the loss of cells in the glymphatic system: () 1efkI eTFR= ( 6) where 1 RT = the efficiency based on the build -up of waste materials in the brain, especially in the front center lobe of the brain that regulates slow -wave sleep efkI = the efficiency based on the health of brain cells after injury k = calibration coefficient If = total stressor input The \"2021 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures Special Report\" (page 16) [1] reports that the risk of developing CTE increases by 30 percent per year of pla y- ing football. This number is based on information pro vided by Mez et al. [35]. While the waste deposits are different for Alzheimer's disease and CTE, the process of development appears to be the same. Incomplete flushing appears to be the process that builds the destructive tau deposits associated with CTE. An interesting observation is that not all football players or boxers develop the condition of CTE. Some estimates suggest that only about 20 percent develop CTE. One estimate for boxers is that at least 17 percent of boxers develop CTE [19] [36]. Safinia et al. [19] also report that \"longer careers and higher number of bouts is associated with higher CTE incidence.\" Omalu ([34] pages 13 , 61) in his book, Play Hard, Die Young: Football Dementia, Depression, and Death , esti- mates about 20 percent of boxers develop a form of CTE known as dementia p u- gilistica. He suggest s that about 20 percent of football players will also develop CTE or gridiron dementia. Safinia et al. [19] report an estimate that 23 percent of the general population has an APOE4 allele. Are these numbers related? There is evidence [44] [45] that people having an APOE4 allele significantly fare worse six months and later after brain injury than people without the APOE4 allele. Thus, genetics may be one reason why about 20 percent of boxers and football players develop CTE. The APOE4 allele certainly seems to hinder long -term recovery from brain trauma. It is assumed at this point that the progression from normal aging or from early stages of Alzheimer's disease to CTE is caused by damage to brain cells from external stressors, such as impacts to the head in football, boxing, soccer, J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 139 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science etc. and/or blast waves that pass through the brain from explosions. Damage to the glial cells should greatly reduce their efficiency in removing waste that leads to a buildup of tau tangles and amyloid plaque. To calibrate and test Equation ( 6), a sampling of people exposed to repeated head impacts and non- impacted people is needed. Russell et al . [46] analyzed professional soccer players each matched to three non -players of the same age and socioeconom ic status. This design allowed direct analysis of the risk ass o- ciated with the playing of professional soccer. They report a risk of 1.6 percent of the matched population control individ u- als developing the neurodegenerative disease during the study period. The Al z- heimer's disease model was run for men only (gender factor = 10.5 and relative fitness = 0.45). The p redicted risk of 0.015 (1.5 percent) occurred at age 69 and 1.7 percent occurred at age 70 years . Based on this close agreement, a 70 -year age was used for comparisons between predictions and measured soccer data. Injury input was made by entering 1 for each year that the professionals played soccer. The model summed the years played to obtain the If value in Eq u- ation 6. After retirement, the input returned to zero, but the summed value was used for If for the continued prediction of risks with age. This process is based on the assumption that there is mini mal recovery of the flushing system after the damage is done. Professional players obviously have a beginning playing and development of skills in high school or college. A four -year period of playing and using the head was assumed prior to the professional years played. The a d- justed years of head im pact ( Table 1 ) was used as input to the model. A value of 0.0275 was determined for k in Equation 6. An R2 value of 0.80 was obtained comparing measured to predicted values. One degree of freedom was lost due to calibration; nevertheless, the results were significant (p = 0.05). R e- sults are shown in Figure 3 . If the measured hazard ratio fo r the 12 years of head impact is eliminated, the R2 jumps to 0.97. Russell et al. [46] do not explain why the 6 - 10 year range of professional play has a higher risk than the 11 - 15 range. One possibility is that defenders, midfielders, and multi -position players with a higher risk of CTE r e- tire before forwards and outfielders. They analyzed the hazard ratio for soccer Table 1 .

[46]. positions and determined that defender and multiposition had ratios of 4.98 and 4.94 respectively compared to forwards (2.79) and outfielders (3.83). Even with the noise in the measured data, the model appears to be a reasonable and stable system to predict both Alzheimer's disease and CTE resulting from playing soccer. Next, data for football players were analyzed to further evaluat e the CTE model. Mez et al. [35] used data collected from three brain banks to determine the odds of developing CTE as a function of years played by football players. Their data do not provide the actual risk of a football player developing CTE. Nevertheless, their data is useful to esti mate the risk of developing CT E. Figure 4 was used to retrieve the log odds as a function of years played. Figure 4 shows the data and a linear line fit through the log data. The 0.29 slope in the fitted e q- uation is about the same as the 0.3 value reported in their paper and in the 2021 Alzheimer's disease Facts and Figures report [1]. An exponential o f the log data odds was used to convert to odds in real instead of log space. This operation reveals that the last few points (especially the largest odds value associated wi th 20 years of play dominated the log fit equation ( Figure 5, P e0.3). An exponential equation using a calibration of 0.17 (P e0.17) is a much better fit than a 0.3 calibration for the data for years played less than 16 years. The data for years played larger than 16 years does not follow the same pa t- tern as less than 16 years. It is unknown if there is a bias in the data selection a s- sociated with years played over 16 years or if a second function (P e0.17+) starts to dominate for the higher years played. In either case, the first 15 years of pla y- ing football seem to be almost independent in terms of mathematical function from the other points. The data set also does not have any direct connection to a general population J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 141 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science Figure 4 . Log Odds data from Mez et al. [35]. Figure 5 . Odds data from Mez et al. [35] in normal space illustrating how the maximum odds point causes the model to miss match lower values of odds data. Two other models are shown for the lower values. of men. The only connection is the odds and years of playing football. On the other hand, there is a strong indication that the risk for CTE increases as a fun c- tion of years played football. There may be a way, however, to finesse a general calibration for football players. If we use the suggestion that about 20 percent of football players will develop CTE [34] before they die, we can make a rough calibration if we know the average age of death. The average age of the football players in the study by Mez et al . [35] is 61 J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 142 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science years. This age is about the same as the average age at death for football players reported by various websites. This age was used to calibrate and further test the CTE component of the model for football players. The value for k in Equation ( 6) that was determined for soccer players was assumed for football players. The model was then run with 20 years of playtime and an input number for injury input. The value for yearly input was varied u n- til a prediction of risk close to 0.2 was obtained at a ge 61 years. A value of 2.3 of input for each year played for a playtime of 20 years results in predicted risk of 0.208. Based on this rough calibration, each year playing football is 2.3 times more stressful than a year of playing soccer. An input of 2.3 for each year played was used starting at age 18 (senior year in high school) and continuing for 20 years of active playing. Zero input was used for each year before age 18 and for each year after age 37. The Excel model was programmed to sum the inputs to get a value for If for each year. The variable If, thus varied from zero to 46 (20 \u00d7 2.3) and continued at 46 after age 37. It is logical that contact sports should reduce the efficiency of the flushing and blood circulation system in the brain affecting the health of the various cells. During impact, the soft tissue of which the brain is made experiences stress/strain changes. This mechanical loading on the tissue cause minor damage to the various cells. It is logical that If would be directly related to the amount or number of loading events. Hence, f yr I hS= ( 7) where h = hit factor based on number and severity of head impacts (h = 1.0 for soccer players) (h = 2.3 for football players) yrS = sum years played for impact sports It also seems reasonable that football players might receive 2.3 times more hits and/or more severe hits to the head than soccer players. There also may be a secondary effect imbedded in contact sports data. The body, including the brain, attempts to heal the damage. While the process is complex, generally there is swelling and inflammation from the healing process. Usually, the benefits of short -term or acute inflammation outweigh the side e f- fects. With contact sports, the process is repeated numerous times and the acute inflammation lingers and tends to exist long- term. Long -term or chronic i n- flammation is harmful and appears to be another source of damage. The se c- ondary or inflammation damage should also be a function of the amount or number of loading events. During the testing of this model, the relative risk data were adjusted by divi d- ing the odds data by a calibration constant. The relative risk was adjusted to o b- tain the least residual error (best R 2 value for the first 15 years of playing foo t- ball). See Table 2 . An R2 = 0.97 as illustrated in Figure 6 was obtained. The rel a- tive risk for this match occurred when the odds values were divided by 103. Thus, for 1 to 15 years of playing, the predicted risk from the model matched the J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 143 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science Table 2 .

For 16 to 20 years of play, the predictions from the model began to mismatch the relative risk data. The extreme point associated with 20 years of play for the relative risk data is 3.544. This number exceeds the upper limit of 1.0 f or the probability of developing CTE. If we divide the odds data by the maximum value of 365, then the relative risk for playing football from 1 to 15 years seems to be extremely low; even below the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease for a gen- eral population.

Predicted risk expressed in red are not verified with relative risk data. are not verified with the relative risk data. While the R2 value and significance level are acceptable , the failure to have an agreement between the relative and predicted risk for the most extreme years of play (16 - 20) is a concern. It is certainly possible that donations to the brain bank were not random in t erms of years played. It seems likely that people ma k- ing donations would be most likely to donate the brains of people with the most extreme symptoms of a problem. Based on the model presented, the development of Alzheimer's disease and J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 145 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science CTE appears to be g overned by the same process. In addition to the loss of slow -wave sleep that reduces flushing of waste, injury to various brain cells a p- pears to further reduce flushing efficiency and leads to an increase in deposits of tau tangles throughout much of the brain. 2.3. Depression Another medical problem, depression, seems to be associated with the develo p- ment of both Alzheimer's disease and CTE. Early- onset of depression seems to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by about two times [29]. Data for depression and risk for Alzheimer's disease is fuzzy in nature with some studies in apparent conflict with other studies. There is uncertainty if d e- pression causes an increase in risk for Alzheimer's disease or if Alzheimer's di s- ease leads to depression. The nature of late- onset depression and Alzheimer's disease is especially unclear. The increased association between late-onset d e- pression and Alzheim er's disease is not considered in the model at this time. Early- onset depression, however, appears to increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease. Byers and Yaffe [29] in their discussion of early- onset depression co n- clude that \" early- onset of depression is significantly assoc iated with risk of de- veloping dementia.\" They state the following: Four of the 5 studies were longitudinal an d suggest that early- onset of de- pression, as well as the duration and frequency of depression, were ass o- ciated with a 2 to 4 -fold increased risk of developing dementia...The second study demonstrated a strong association between t he number of depressive episodes ( i.e., recurrent depression) and the risk of dementia over a median follow -up time of 24 years, suggesting a dose -dependent relationship of cumulative depression episodes to the risk of dementia. ...One cross -sectional (case -control) study suggests that a history of de- pression even 25 years prior to AD onset is significantly associated with an almost 2- fold increase in the likelihood of developing AD... To further complicate the modeling of depression effects on the risk of Al z- heimer's disease, there is evidence that some antidepressants can reduce the d e- velopment of risk for Alzheimer's disease [38]. Kessing et al. [38] report a rel a- tive risk of 0.66 for Alzheimer's disease for older antidepressants compared to newer antidepressants. Furthermore, continued use of the older ant idepressants was implied with two or more prescriptions of older antide pressants being more effective than only one prescription. If a person has depression and takes pr e- scriptions of antidepressants until the depression is in remission and then quits medi cation, is the risk for Alzheimer's disease reduced? If it is reduced, is it b e- cause of treatment? Is it due to the antidepressant or lack of depression for the rest of life? Obviously, questions like these complicate the understanding of data. In a study at Duke University [47], aerobic exercise as a treatment was co m- pared to a serotonin treatment (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI, ser- s with a relati vely rapid response to J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 146 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science treatment then flattened to a relative slow improvement over a long period of time. The aerobic treatment can be modeled with changes in VO 2max. They measured VO 2max before and after the period of study and verified that the exe r- cise increased VO 2max. Obviously, the medication did not change VO 2max; thus, this study implies that the change is related to something affected by both exe r- cise and the medication. Exercise and antidepressants both tend to \"increase the activity of neurotransmitters: norepinephrine, sero- tonin\" ([48] pages and 121) . It is also generally un derstood that depression often affects sleep resulting in too little or too much with poor sleep efficiency and probably reduced slow -wave sleep. For the model development, it was a s- sumed that like aerobic exercise depression and slow -wave sleep are related. A slow -wave efficiency factor, d 3, was added to the prediction of slow -wave sleep. Without depression , the factor has a value of 1.0. With depression, this factor or multiplier is less than 1.0 depending on the severity of depression. It was h y- pothesized that depression may build up from stress in life or reduce in response to treatment and reduced stress in life. There is evidence, at least in rats, that stress changes neurogenesis in the hi p- pocampus area of the brain [49]. As neurogenesis (gray matter development) decreases and oligodendrogenesis (white matter development) increases, an i m- balance in the ratio of gray to white matter occurs, which may exp lain in part how stress increases the risk of depression and the reduced sleep quality that o f- ten develops in parallel with depression. It is common knowledge now from various research studies that aerobic exercise in rodents and humans slowly i n- creases neuron regeneration \u2014a counter measure to depression as observed in the Blumenthal et al. [47] study. Because stress or aerobic exercise can change and be managed over time, the depression component or more general emotional stress component of the Alz-heimer's disease model was designed to allow a slow recovery when stress is r e- moved or antidepressant management is used. A column in Excel was created to input zero f or no depression and a number between 0 and 4 for each year depressed with 2 as an average degree of depres-sion. The user inputs (a number between 0.0 and 4.0) are based on the work of Byers and Yaffe [29]. The model uses a weighted average between the previous depression efficiency factor and the new input to compute a new efficiency fa c- tor. The weighted average essentially provides an exponential decay function to reduce slow -wave sleep over time due to depression or a saturating exponential to increase efficiency back to 1.0 when treatment is effective. The following equ- ation is used: ()()33 11old ES S d d m CE m= + ( 8) where d3 = current calibration for slow -wave sleep d3old = previous calibration (year before) CES = calibration to adjust depression severity t o the risk of developing J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 147 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science Alzheimer's disease (0.22) ES = new input associated with depression severity (value of number is roughly the increase in the risk of developin g Alzheimer's disease m = weight for old calibration (0.98) The weight value of 0.98 is the same as was used by your author to model the change in VO 2max over a period of time of active bed rest in a study by Saltin et al. [50]. This same value may be a coincidence or both may be related to passive changes in metabolism. The value for CES of 0.22 was determined by an input of 2.0 for ES for each year starting at age 20 going to age 70 and approximately doubling the risk for Alzheimer's disease at age 70. If depression starts later in life, there are fewer years (less dose of depression) to increase Alzheimer's di s- ease. After this rough calibration, the model was run for depression starting at di f- ferent ages to see the nature of the predicted risk for Alzheimer's disease. The model also was run for depression starting at age 20 and ending at various ages. Results are shown in Figure 8 . These simulat ions produced about the same level of risk for Alzheimer's disease in terms of years depressed more or less indepe n- dent of how the depression years occur. The results seem to match the dose su g- gestion by Byers and Yaffe [29]. Also, the odds value for 20 years of depression followed by no depression for the following 30 years compared to 50 years of depression is 0.65 compared to the report of 0.66 from Kessing et al. [38]. The model has the potential to adjust for successful treatment by turning off or r e- ducing the severity of the depression input. It may als o be possible to use the emotional stress input to link sexual assault and other traumatic experiences to the increased risk of developing Alzheimer's Figure 8 . Illustration of predicted odds of developing Alzheimer's disease in association with years of depression. J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 148 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science disease later in life. Thurston et al. [51], have related sexual assault to poor sleep, depression, and anxiety. Thurston et al. [52] have also related sexual assault and other traumas to white matter hyperintensities among midlife women. These white matter hyperintensities that show up on neuroimages are normal in older adults, but women who have been traumatized early in life tend to have an i n- creased volume of these white matter spots. Further research is needed to pro- vide sufficient data to calibrate the emotional input in the Alzheimer's disease model to predict this ty pe of input on the risk of developing Alzheimer's di sease. No data were found that directly measured a dose effect of depression on the risk of Alzheimer's disease as shown in Figure 8 . Green et al. [15], however, re- ported data relating the interval between the onset of depression and the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This information was used in conjunction with the sim u- lated data used to pr epare Figure 8 to provide a rough verification of the depre s- sion model and calibration used to predict the increased risk of Alzheimer's di s- ease. The average age of people in their study was 70 years rounded to the nearest year. This ag e matches the 70 -year age used to determine the odds of Alzhei- mer's disease in Figure 8 . Their data are shown in Table 3 along with the pr e- dicted values based on the average of the individual odds associated with each row criteria used by Green et al. [15]. A comparison of measured and predicted odds is shown in Figure 9 . An R2 value of 0.70 was obtained by comparing measured and predicted val- ues. The results were statistically significant (p = 0.05). It appears from these r e- sults that using the input of emotional stress (a number between 0 and 4 for d e- pression) is a reasonable way to model the effects of depression on the develo p- ment of Alzheimer's disease. Green et al . [15] raised the question of how depression cause s an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease: \"Is there something about depression that is pote n- tially 'toxic' to the brain and predisposes to a later vulnerability to AD?\" Based on the present model, the answer may be as simple as changes in sleep quality.

Results The results comparing estimates from the model to data reported in the liter a- ture were presented as each component of the model was developed. The general population result is shown in Figure 2 . The model is not independent of this data set; however, both the model estimates and this data set are in agreement with the risk reported by the Alzheimer's Association [1]. Results for soccer players with CTE are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 . This data set compared men soccer players to non soccer players of the same social and economic status. The results indicate a linear relationship between odds of developing CTE and years played. A second data set considering years played for football was also considered. This data set did not have a comparison to non- football players of the same s o- cial and economic status. Nevertheless, this data set was used for a relative co m- parison. The first 15 years of playing football followed a linear increase with years played. The remaining five years deviated fro m the pattern of the first 15 years. The calibration by Mez [35] seemed to be highly influenced by these points in log space. The Alzheimer's Association [1] seems to have used this c a- libration for their reporting, which seems to be an exaggeration of the real risk. The results from the present analysis indicate that playing professional football has about 2.3 times higher risk for each year played compared to soccer. Finally, the model predicts that untreated depression will increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease as a function of dose or years depressed. The age at which depression starts does not seem to be a factor other than an early start has the potential to increase the number of years depressed. J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 150 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science 4. Discussion A mathematical model was developed to estimate the risk of developing Alzhe i- mer's disease as a function of age. Predictions from the model matched reported risk values published in the literature with an R2 of 0.99, which was highly si g- nificant (p < 0.001). The model includes a gender factor and a relative fitness that adjusts VO 2max that in turn is used to adjust the amount of slow -wave sleep. Varia tions in these variables were not tested with Alzheimer's data. The model does predict that the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is highest for the least aerobically fit (lowest maximum oxygen uptake) people. It also predicts that women are at a high er risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than men. Predictions with the current model used a relative fitness average for a per- son's lifetime. The model can evaluate the effects of increased or decreased rela- tive fitness as a person ages using a yearly input of relative fitness. There is much potential to use maximum oxygen uptake as a management tool to predict the benefits of aerobic exercise to delay or at least slow the progression of Alzhei- mer's disease. The model is based on the concept that as sleep is reduced with age or lack of fitness, the efficiency of the central front lobe in the brain starts to deteriorate as amyloid begins to build up in this part of the brain. As this part of the brain becomes less efficient, slow -wave sleep is reduced and the time used to wash away waste products is reduced leaving more waste material, such as amyloid deposited in the brain. This process cycles each day slowly leading to the deve l- opment of Alzheimer's disease. There is now growing evidence [43] that genetics through APOE alleles affect the generation of amyloid . If genetics affect the generation of amyloid , then it is logical that genetics affect the calibration of 0/R. The generation of amyloid goes up as cholesterol goes up. While it may be possible to reduce the generation of amyloid by reducing cholesterol, the brain needs some cholesterol for oth er functions. Thus, the goal should be to control but not eliminate cholesterol. It may be possible to adjust the model for chole s- terol management through 0/R. We can think of 0/R as the risk associated with the generation of amyloid when there is no flushing. It is the potential for developing Alzheimer's disease. Anything that affects the metabolism of brain cells probably affects the calibration value for 0/R. In fact, epidemiological studies have shown a strong decrease in the incidence of Alzhe imer's disease when patients are treated with et al. [53] provided controlled research with guinea pigs that support the epidemiological findings. Guinea pigs treated with high levels of simvastatin had a major reduction of cerebral amyloid levels in their cerebrospinal fluid. Values for coefficients A1 and 0/R were calibrated to optimize the fit to pu b- lished Alzheimer's risk data. In addition to providing the proper limits or bou n- dary conditions, Equation (5) with the two coefficients, A1 and 0/R, can be used J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 151 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science to consider other variables. It is now evident that the production rate of amyloid occurring at the cellular level is a function of cho lesterol level in brain cells [43] [54]. Various satins lower cholester ol in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid [43] [53]. In general, treatment with satins lowers the risk of the develo p- ment of Alzheimer's disease by 60 to 70 percent [54]. It should be possible to c a- librate 0/R as a function of cholesterol management. Because the process of generating amyloid as a function of cholesterol i n- volves APOE alleles, it also appears that the 0/R coefficient may be a good place to calibrate the Alzheimer's model to include the effects of genetics (APOE4: 0, 1, or 2 alleles) . Table 4 provides values for 0/R based on some of the odds r e- ported in the literature. It has been observed that people with higher levels of education and who use their brain s in work have less risk of developing Alzheimer's disease [56]. Som e- times this effect is referred to as cognitive reserve [1]. People who are engaged mentally in education and work may have a higher number of brain cells of var- ious kinds with less production of amyloid than those who coast through life without mental challenges. The coefficient, 0/R, in Table 4 was computed us- ing the model and adjusting the 0/R value to obtain the odds value reported in the associated reference. Age 70 years was used for this analysis. It is uncertain, however, which of the two coefficients, A1 or 0/R, should be used to consider cognitive r eserve. As stated in the introduction to this article, the development of Alzheimer's disease is complex and seems to be related to various causes. For example, Hu s- sein [26] provides a strong argument that inflammation may be a major factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. If inflammation is a factor in brain health, then it may be possible to consider this variable through the I f variable in Equation 11. An acute attack would be considered in terms of the years affected Table 4 . Values of /R to adjust the calibration of the Alzheimer's disease model for a few additional variables.

Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 152 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science starting at the age when the inflammation began. An example of a possible dose evident association between inflammation and Alzheimer's disease was tested with data from Gofrit et al. [24]. They report in their Table 1 a mean age for patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and given BCG as a treatment at 67.5 years. The mean age diagnosed and not given BCG was 69.0 years. They also report the mean age at follow -up who received BCG as 78.7 years. For the non BCG treatment, the mean age at follow -up was 75.9 years. Based on this information, the Alzheimer's model was run and the pr e- dicted data were analyzed from 68 to 76 years. Subtracting the Alzheimer's di s- ease prediction for 68 years from the 76 -year prediction yielded an increase of 2.3 percent. The simulation was run for men (gender factor of 10.5). Gufrit et al. [24] report an increase for the treated men group of 2.47 percent. The fact that the group treated with BCG closely matches the percentage of 2.3 from the s i- mulation provides evidence that BCG may have removed the inflammation threat. The model was run again with injury input in units of years affected starting at age 68 and ending at age 76 years. The input was varied until a match to the reported 9.16 percent increase was obtained. An input of 5.2 for h in Equation 7 from ages 68 to 76 produced an increase of 9.2 percent. These results do not prove that an inflammation effect on Alzheimer's disease is a dose response process, but they provide evidence that the process is feasible \u2014even likely. The model provides a new way to loo k at the process of how infections and infla m- mation may influence the development of Alzheimer's disease. A derivation was provided in Appendix C that relates F e to the fraction of brains cells that function after damage from impacts to the head, such as p laying soccer or football. This equation was calibrated using data provided by Russell et al. [46]. Predictions matched measured risk values with an R2 of 0.80, which was significant (p = 0.5). A second data set [35] was also used to relate the model to the risk of playing football. Predictions for the first 15 y ears of playing football matched the relative risk of CTE for football players with and R2 of 0.97, which was also significant (p < 0.001). The variable h was used to adjust for different levels of injury. While the calibration of the CTE component of the model for football is not considered precise, the results seem reasonable. More importantly, the model provides a mathematical framework to explain how both Alzheimer's disease and CTE develop. The model is robust with stable boundaries of probability b e- tween 0 and 1. It may be possible to relate other brain injury types, such as brain trauma or exposure to pressure waves that pass through the brain to the calibration years affected. The current model is not designed to predict immediate damage from these events, but it may provide a process to predict the long -term effects after injury. Finally, this model describes the process that relates to both the development J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 153 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science of Alzheimer's disease and CTE. Both developments seem to be related to slow -wave sleep. Both develop after a period of time. Alzheimer's disease alone seems to start with the buildup of amyloid . Other factors, such as inflamm a- tion, genetics, or mental stress may also initiate or at least accelerate the process. CTE seems to be associated more wi th the buildup of tau tangles. While the process for CTE may start from the mechanical or physical stress on brain cells, the development over time appears to be related to the reduced efficiency of the flushing system. This current work only describes the development after the process starts. Equation 3 was not used in the current model for estimating the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or CTE. The equation contains the same flushing function as used in Equation ( 5). The 0 variable is probably a function of the damage that occurs to glial and other cells in the flushing system. This would explain why CTE seems to be associated with tau tangles more than am y- loid . Alzheimer's disease plus additional secondary damage from ta u tangles seems to be a reasonable description of CTE patients. 5. Conclusion The development of this article focused on slow -wave sleep. This article and Ex- cel model only evaluated the system for average conditions of fitness and the natural decline of sl ow-wave sleep with age and the development of Alzheimer's disease and CTE. It is an eas y step to expand the model to reduce slow- wave sleep for other reasons, such as restricting sleep due to work pressure or redu c- ing sleep quality due to night work or var iations in the circadian cycle. An o b- vious and major factor that reduces slow -wave sleep is sleep apnea. A model that considers both sleep and other factors that affect brain health should be a valu a- ble tool to better understand and to some degree slow the development of Alz- heimer's disease and CTE.

Equation to Estimate Waste Accumulation in Brain after One Night of Sleep Cleaning or flushing processes generally can be described as a first-order diffe- rential equation that produces an exponential decay equation when integrated over a time variable. The flushing of waste from the brain primarily occurs du r- ing a slow -wave sleep cycle. The time variable for a night of sleep is the total time of slow -wave sleep. The equation can be derived starting with the following differential equation: 1d de WWAFWS= ( A1) where W = waste products remaining in the brain A1 = calibration coefficient Fe = flushing system efficiency SW = time in slow -wave sleep during a night of sleep Next, we can separate variables: 1ddeWWAF SW= ( A2) Integration from the beginning ( W0 = production of waste) to ending limits can be used to eliminate the differential variables: 01 0ddWF F S W eW WWAF W 1 0lnF e WFWAFSW= ( A5) Taking the exponential of both results in 1 0ee WFAFS FW W= ( A6) Rearrangement yields an equation to estimate the daily amount of waste re- maining in the brain after sleep is Model Sleep is a cyclic process starting with stage 1, a transition from awake to sleep. Stage 2 occurs next. During stage 2, communication occurs between the hippo- campus (the part of the brain that processes and stores short -term memory) and the front center lobe of the brain that provides long -term memory. The trivial unimportant memory information is discarded and the perceived important i n- formation is transferred especially during sleep spindles and slow wa ves ([2] J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 160 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science pages 110- 114) . Stages 3 and 4 are slow waves (brain waves) relative to the other sleep stages. Stage 4 has more amplitude in the wave than stage 3. The fi nal type of wave during sleep is REM (Rapid Eye Movement) where the brain is active, often dreaming, and h as a similar wave form as awake. In a young adult, a cycle typical starts with stage 1, then stage 2, then stage 3, followed by stage 4, then back to stage 2 followed by REM. A cycle takes about 90 minutes. A total of about five cycles typically occurs for a total sleep time of about 450 minutes plus a few minutes of time -awake disruptions. A typical young adult needs about eight hours of sleep \u2014more if they are physically active. In older adults, time -awake increases as much as 90 minutes, reducing actual sleep to 6.5 hours or less per night. Total time in slow -wave sleep is of interest in this Alzheimer's disease risk model because of the linkage between slow -wave sleep and the flushing of waste materials from the brain. Gregory [57] developed an equation that predicts the increase in slow -wave sleep total as sleep progresses. The equation is ()2 1 21eTdN WTdSd= ( B1) where SWT = total time of slow -wave sleep d1 = variable that is a function of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max) d2 = decay rate (1.1) NT = number of cycles completed Maximum oxygen uptake, VO 2max, which will be associated with slow -wave sleep, decreases as a linear function of age as follows: 2 maxVO 107.4 RF 1 120AG= + ( = maximum oxygen uptake (ml kg1min1) RF = relative fitness (fraction of upper limit) (1.00) upper limit, Olympic class skier or runner (0.82) approximate upper limit for endurance trained (0.67) endurance trained (0.50) active (upper boundary for sedentary) (0.45) estimate for control or average population ( 1/4 endurance train ed & 3/4 sedentary) (0.38) sedentary (0.22) approximate lower limit for sedentary (0.00) non active bed rest A = age (years) G = gender coefficient (males: 10.5; females: 3.5) mlkg1min1 This equation describes the effect of age for both males and females through the gender factor. The slope is the same for both males and females at the same relatively fitness. Predictions from Equation ( B2) matched the measured values for women [58] with an R 2 = 0.85 and for men [59] with an R2 = 0.75. Both r e- sults were highly significant using t distribution to predict the probability of type J. M. Gregory DOI: 10.4236/jbbs.2022.124008 161 Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science I error (p < 0.001). The various relative fitness descriptions and values are based on these two data sets comparing the measured fitness of runners to sedentary people. Next, data for slow -wave sleep and age were obtained from the literature as shown in Table B1 . A value of 1.1 was used for d 2 in Equation (B1). Assuming a 90-minute average cycle, t he number of cycles was estimated from the measured sleep time. A value for d 1 was obtained and listed in Table 1 as a measured value. Values for VO 2max were estimated using a relative fitness (RF) of 0.45 for average fitness. These values are listed in Table B1 . The f ollowing equation was deve l- oped to predict d1: ()1 3 2 max0.0000168 VOd= (B3 ) This equation predicted d 1 with an R2 equal to 0.84. This result was highly si g- nificant (p < 0.001). Predicted values are shown in Table B1 . The relationship is shown in Figure B1 . While the calibration of Equation ( B3) was based on a relative fitness of 0.45, the curves generated for sedentary (RF = 0. 38) and active (RF = 0.50) seem to Table B1 .

Equation ( B3) coupled with Equations (B1) and (B2) provide a way to consider lifestyle effects on slow -wave sleep. To use Equation ( B1), we also need an estimate of the number of cycles used for sleep. Total sleep time with the assumption of 90- minute cycles or measured cycle number when reported was used with the sleep data sources lis ted in Table B1 to develop the f ollowing equation for cycle number as a function of age: 5.26 0.0212TNA= ( B4) This linear function from ages 7 to 80 years of age fit the cycle number data well (R2 = 0.85; p < 0.001). Appendix C . Estimating Flushing Efficiency It is assumed that flushing efficiency depends on the health of the glymphatic system including glial cells that are part of the flushing system. The change in the number of cells damaged per change in impact from stressors should be a direct fu nction of the total number of undamaged cells available to be damaged: ()d dTCkC Ci= ( C1) where C = number of cells damaged i = unit impact of external stressor k = calibration coefficient CT = initial total number of undamaged cells We can now separate variables to prepare for integration to eliminate the dif- J.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 1 to make d X = dC, then integrate: 00ddTf f TCC I CXki X = ( C3) where Cf = final number of cells damaged If = total stressor input The results after integration are ln0Tf f TCCkIC= ( C4) We can now take the exponential of sides to obtain efkI Tf TCC C= ( C5) The number of the undamaged cell s over the initial number of cells should be a reasonable estimate of the efficiency of the system controlled by these cells. Thus, the flushing efficiency, Fe becomes () 1efkI eTFR= ( C6) where 1 RT = the efficiency based on build -up of waste materials in the brain, especially in the front center lobe of the brain that regulates slow- wave sleep efkI = the efficiency based on the health of brain cells after injury In other words, the flushing efficiency , Fe, is assumed to be the product of two efficiencies: efficiency considering the buildup of toxic waste in the brain and the efficiency of the brain cells (damage or inclusion of tau tangles in neurons and glial cells and damage to the vascular system th at provides nutrients to the cells).
