Make sure you get at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night to help your body recover and rejuvenate. - Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help keep your immune system strong by increasing circulation and helping your body to fight off infections. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, every day. - Reduce stress: Chronic stress can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to infections. Try to find ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, yoga, or other relaxation techniques. - Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water is essential for overall health and can help support your immune system. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day to stay hydrated. - Take a multivitamin: Taking a daily multivitamin can help ensure that your body is getting all the essential vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly.
