It causes major losses in production throughout most of the African continent, the Balkans, the Near East , the Northern Caucasus and the Russian Federation. Since 2019, LSD has spread to some of the major cattle trading countries across Asia, i.e. Bangladesh, India, China and Nepal, as well as to other Asian countries. In fact, in early 2022, Indonesia, Singapore, Pakistan and Afghanistan reported LSD outbreaks to the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) of the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH ). Despite various attempts to control the disease, it continues to spread. Therefore, better understanding of the characteristics, epidemiology and means of effective control of LSD is urgently needed in affected countries. The global distribution of the LSD virus (LSDV) covers multiple geographical regions where cattle farming practices differ, the usage and the role of cattle within the rural societies vary according to local traditions and culture. Furthermore, risk perception and the economic consideration s differ between different sociodemographic regions. Consequently, the tools and measures essential to limit the spread of these outbreaks, need to be adapted to the local settings. As an example, in most African and Asian countries implementing stamping out as a control measure is not feasible, affordable, or legal on economic, religious or cultural grounds. Therefore, the topic of the best practices to treat LSDV infected animals, had to be re- discussed. The number of published research data on LSD has substantially increased in the last decade. Before 2012 the number of annual ly peer -reviewed LSD papers was limited. However, LSDV started swiftly to expand from the Middle Eastern region to Europe and Asia, resulting in a steep increase in the number of LSD publications. In 2021 alone, a total of 76 scientific papers on different LSD related topics were listed in PubMed records. Reflecting to the urgent need to provide, with a platform to exchange and share their ideas, novel data, experiences for scientists working on the LSD field, and improve availability of applied research results to the veterinary authorities and scientific community in affected and at -risk countries, an LSD scientific symposium, was organized in a hybrid format in 14 -16 May in Rome, allowing both meetings in person and in a virtual format. The lumpy skin disease symposium The lumpy skin disease symposium was organized in collaboration with the European Commission for the Control of Foot -and-Mouth Diseas e (EuFMD ) and the Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (EMPRES -AH) with the main objective to provide scientists with a platform to present and discuss their most updated findings on a wide range of LSD and LSDV related topics. These data have to enhance the preparedness, and in case of LSD outbreaks improve response of national competent authorities and provide them with science -based, state -of-the-art tools and options to design and implement effective disease management, control and eradication policies against LSD. 3 LUMPY SKIN DISEASE SYMPOSIUM HOW SCIENCE CAN SUPPORT EVIDENCE -BASED DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND CONTRO L HYBRID : VIRTUAL AND FAO HQ , 14-16 MARCH 2023 Conclusions Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a global challenge that requires coordination between national, regional and international authorities and organizations to ensure bet ter awareness, better preparedness, advocacy for an improved control and enhanced resources. Different risks, policies and control options are observed and available in different countries and regions. A regional/sub -regional approach is useful to better understand specific risks, facilitate sharing of risk assessment data, information on successful disease management options, challenges in disease control and harmonization of control measures. Regular monitoring/tracing of different LSD circulating strains and sharing of sequence data is necessary in order to facilitate regular assessment of threats and to assist research institutions in developing of new diagnostic techniques and vaccines. The main risks factors of LSD spread are associated with introduction of the virus to na\u00efve cattle population, high cattle density and abundance of vectors, non -controlled animal movements, use of vaccines of low quality and low efficacy. Low awareness on disease (clinical signs, mitigation measures, impact) and late notification of outbreaks also pose a risk for disease spread. Identification of risk hotspots can ensure targeted surveillance and control measures with the best use of available resources. Sufficient vaccination coverage (e.g. in some settings 80 percent enabled to eradicate the disease) with high quality and efficacious vaccines is the key for success in controlling LSD. The use of poor -quality vaccines (vaccines with low efficacy or/and not undergone quality control and with not proven safety) can compromise the control strategy with increased economic losses and the risk of releasing new recombinant strains. Immunization of cattle using a vaccine with demonstrated efficacy is the most effective option for controlling the spread of LSD especially if applied as preventive measure or as emergency response. However, the resulting trade restrictions need to be factored in by decision makers when vaccination is implemented. The countries at risk must ensure early detection surveillance and m aintain emergency preparedness against LSD to the highest level by keeping strong and up to date contingency plan, highest level of awareness among all stakeholders, diagnostic capacity, and agreements to ensure vaccine availability according to risk. Capacities of veterinary services and laboratories are key to ensure adequate prevention, early detection, response, reduce impact and control or eradicate the disease. Regular trainings and communication are useful to ensure adequate level of stakeholders awareness and improved capacity to manage risks. 4 LUMPY SKIN DISEASE SYMPOSIUM HOW SCIENCE CAN SUPPORT EVIDENCE -BASED DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND CONTRO L HYBRID : VIRTUAL AND FAO HQ , 14-16 MARCH 2023 Applied research can significantly contribute to the risk management and control of LSD providing evidence of strengths and weaknesses of control and surveillance methods and showing cost/benefits of different control options. Studies and tools to estimate impact of the disease and cost-benefits of control measures can improve advocacy and support decision making to implement preventive and control measures with adequate investments. The role of wildlife and stray cattle need to be understood in terms of LSD epidemiology to ensure adequate control and surveillance measures are implemented . The role of seasonal and weather patterns in vector distribution needs more research . The use of antimicrobial connected to the occurrence of LSD and secondary infections needs to be better understood to take appropriate awareness and mitigation measures in connection with risk of AMR. Recommendations LSD risk assessment, manag ement and communication should be improved considering political, economic, environmental, social and biological/technical factors. Regional/sub -regional coordination and collaboration are advocated for LSD surveillance, awareness, early warning and control. Notification of disease occurrence should be strongly encouraged. More studies/tools are desirable to better understand drivers and factors affecting LSD spread, considering environment and climate change, animal mobility and value chain, farming systems, genetic resistance to LSD, role of wildlife and sub -clinical infection, indirect transmission, in order to improve capacity to anticipate and model the spread of the disease. Further studies/tools to assess impact of diseases and cost/benefit an alysis of different control options should be implemented/developed in order to assist risk managers and decision makers in prioritizing resources for LSD and other TADs and to select best control options. Vaccination of cattle with vaccines with demonstr ated efficacy and safety is recommended, ensuring a good vaccination coverage supplemented by movement control and other measures considered by the countries. Emergency vaccination strategies needs to be defined before the occurrence of the disease conside ring resources for implementing vaccination, availability and accessibility of vaccines. Homologous vaccines have proved to be more efficient in control and eradication of LSD . If heterologous vaccines are to be used, studies on the use of goat pox vaccine have also provided evidence of protection against LSD. The application of vaccination based on sheep pox virus for LSD control should be strongly discouraged when not supported by clear evidence of effectiveness. Preventive vaccination should be considered in case of LSD in the neighborhood. Discussions to be initiated with WOAH, under the framework of Global Framework for the Progressive Control of 5 LUMPY SKIN DISEASE SYMPOSIUM HOW SCIENCE CAN SUPPORT EVIDENCE -BASED DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND CONTRO L HYBRID : VIRTUAL AND FAO HQ , 14-16 MARCH 2023 Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF -TADs) on the international standards and requirements to enable safe trade from areas free from LSD with vaccination applied. Research studies to understand the efficiency of vaccines against recombinant viruses should be conducted. More cross -protection/challenge studies on goat pox vaccines would be also needed to provide evidence of the efficacy of heterologous vaccination where such vaccine is used. Systems to ensure independent evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines needs to be promoted and de veloped at regional/international level in order to assist national competent authorities in the vaccine selection and evaluation processes for safety, quality efficacy of vaccines. The possibility of putting in place a Prequalification system for LSD vacc ines against circulating strains should be investigated. Bilateral agreements should be facilitated to improve availability of vaccine seeds virus to vaccines producers, only when proper evidence is provided that good manufacturing practice (GMP) s is impl emented. Policy dialogue on LSD vaccines quality, availability, accessibly should be promoted between vaccine manufacturers, national veterinary services and regional and international organizations. Multistakeholder and research platforms at global and regional level on LSD shall be developed to facilitate discussion among policy makers, researchers, vaccine manufacturers, representatives of industry and farmers on critical issues affecting the control at global and regional levels. Continuou s capacity development needs to be ensured for Veterinary Services and Laboratories including regular proficiency testing/ring trials. Improved coordination is needed among training providers to ensure adequate development and delivery of training initiati ves as well as systems/tools able to provide evidence that skills and competencies are progressively improved at individual and organizational level. FAO Reference Centres need to be identified to facilitate laboratory capacity building/assessment, improve LSD early warning and control measures on the national and regional levels and improve the LSD intelligence network . Communication on the use of safe vaccines needs to b e improved to avoid misinterpretation of scientific research communication with less trust in control options (i.e. vaccines and virus recombination) Research on development of inactivated vaccines, DIVA vaccines, DIVA tests and techniques for post - vaccination monitoring should be promoted. The lumpy skin disease symposium is organized in collaboration with the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD) and the Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (EMPRES-AH) of FAO.
