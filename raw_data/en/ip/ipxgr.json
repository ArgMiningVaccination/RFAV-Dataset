We are all on an individual wellness journey. On your journey, keep health and wellness in mind as you plan your daily, weekly and monthly activities. Together we will achieve the vision of Healthy, Self-Determining and Vibrant BC First Nations Children, Families and Communities. What Goals would you like to achieve this year in terms of your personal health and wellness? Listed in the side-bar are the four (4) Wellness Streams that the FNHA suggests you use to achieve a healthy lifestyle. A great way to set goals in these areas is to ask yourself what you would like to achieve this year in terms of your physical activity, healthy eating, nurturing spirit, and respectful tobacco use? Write down your goals in the space provided in each of the Wellness Streams and share them with trusted family and friends who will support you in achieving your goals. Then, use the journal pages every day to monitor your goals and reflect on any changes you need to make in order to further support your success. Although we suggest you set goals using the four (4) Wellness Streams, please feel free to identify something different that you would like to work on in achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.Welcome! to the new edition of the Health & Wellness Daily Organizer Wellness Streams to achieve a Healthy Lifestyle Responsibility RelationshipsWisdom Respect Com m unity NationsFamily Land Cultural Economic Environmental Social Emotional Mental Physical SpiritualHUMAN BEING First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness Meaning Centre Circle (Core of Wellness) The Centre represents individuals taking responsibility for their own health and wellness. Everything originates at the centre, and it is with one's self, that the journey of wellness begins. Second Circle (Aspects of Wellness) This circle illustrates that Mental, Emotional, Spiritual and Physical aspects of wellbeing need to be in balance and nurtured to achieve health and wellness. Third Circle (Values of Wellness) The third circle represents the overarching values that support and uphold wellness: Respect, Wisdom, Responsibility, and Relationships. These four values need to be acknowledged when honouring yourself and others. Fourth Circle (Context for Wellness) The fourth circle depicts the people that surround us and the places where we come from: Nations, Family, Community, and Land. You, the individual, underlie all of these areas and have a responsibility to care for these supports. Fifth Circle (Determinants of Wellness) The fifth circle depicts the Social, Cultural, Economic and Environmental determinants of our health and well-being. These determinants affect our health and wellbeing and it is our responsibility as an individual and as a collective to ensure these determinants are available and protected. Outer Circle (Our Community) The people are holding hands to demonstrate togetherness, respect and relationships, which in the words of a respected BC elder can be stated as \"one heart, one mind.\"First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness Holistic Wellness The First Nations Health Authority has received clear direction from BC First Nations that its vision, philosophy and approach must align with a First Nations perspective of health and well-being; Thus, the creation of the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness. This image has been derived from a holistic perspective of health, and its concepts are based on the knowledge passed along by our Elders and traditional healers. Although the model appears in layers, it is important to acknowledge that each circle and its components are all interconnected and need to be in balance. The model is intended to be used as a tool for both internal and external stakeholders. Examples of its use include: creating a shared understanding of the holistic vision of wellness shared by BC First Nations; forming the basis of Health Plans for individuals, communities and Regions; validating traditional approaches to health; fostering collaborations with partners for health promotion and disease prevention; and, developing the values, philosophy and culture of an organization - As an example, the FNHA is using the values and principles of the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness to transform the policies and approaches it uses to guide all its work. Wellness belongs to every human being and the way each person reflects the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness will be unique. The model is adaptable and can be applied in any way to support you to be the best human being you can be today!1Make SMARTER Goals that are SPECIFIC I will walk every day. MEASURABLE I will walk 10,000 steps a day. ATTAINABLE I will walk in the rain, snow or hail. REALISTIC I will walk to and from work each day.TIMEFRAME I will walk to and from work for the next MONTH and will re-evaluate this goal after the month. EVERYBODY CARES I will share my goals and desired changes with trusted family and friends. RESOURCES I will make a list of the things I need to add or take away from my routine in order to help me achieve my goals.It is important to identify the health and wellness goals you want to achieve on your Wellness Journey. We encourage you to use this Daily Organizer to develop, track and reflect on these goals. On this journey, go at whatever pace is comfortable for you, and remember, it is usually the small steps that add up to help you make bigger, life-long changes. This is the ULTIMATE goal! POSITIVE FIRST STEPS In addition to goal setting, another positive step for your Wellness Journey is to visit your family doctor or health care practitioner, especially if you are starting any new physical activity. For most people, physical activity should not pose any problem. However, if you have any medical concerns, heart trouble, chest pain, dizziness, or you are taking medication for blood pressure, please consult a care provider before becoming more physically active.\u00a92017.

If you walk 10,000 steps each day that equals: 70 cm x 10,000 steps = 700,000 cm = 7 km !Make it count! The benefits of counting steps Walking is one of the best forms of physical activity. It is a gentle, low impact activity that can be done almost any - where. It is a wonderful way to spend time with family and friends, and to be re-connected to the land. Being Active Making exercise more convenient Walking will also: Increase your energy level Enhance your mental well being Help you relax and sleep better Help you reduce your body fat and tone your muscles Lower your risk for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cancer Many people find counting steps is a great motivator for incorporating more walking into their daily life. Today, there are many great forms of technology to help you count steps. These include: Wearable tracking devices Pedometers (wearable step counters) have really stepped up their game lately. Devices such as FitBit and Garmin have become hugely popular, but you can also still use old fashioned step counters to try to reach your daily step goal! Apps and smartphones With emerging technology on many smartphones, there are also lots of options for tracking steps using your phone.Health and Wellness - It starts with me! I can take control of my own personal health by: | being active | eating healthy | nurturing spirit | respecting tobacco | Feel like you have no time to exercise? Remember, every minute of activity counts. Consider trying some of these tips: Walk to work instead of drive Keep a pair of walking shoes at work Keep clothes you need for a workout in your car Keep hand weights near your television or phone When an opportunity for exercise comes along you'll be ready.How many steps do I need? While there isn't a \"scientific basis\" for recommending 10,000 steps, it is an initial milestone to work towards. However for many, achieving 10,000 steps per day may not be possible. Instead you can keep track of your steps for one full week without changing your daily routine. Then, start adding 200 steps per day for the first week, an additional 200 steps per day the following week, and so on. Once you reach a daily step count that you are proud of and enhances your health, try aiming to reach that goal at least 4-5 days per week.My goals for Evan Adams, FNHA Chief Medical Officer Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. Aim to exercise every day of the week. If you are older than 18 years of age, you want to accumulate at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week that can be broken down into bouts of 10 minutes or more. Make sure you mark June 21st in your calendar to participate in the wellness activities that will take place province wide for the Aboriginal Day of Wellness on National Aboriginal Day.5 4Nutrition is the foundation in maintaining good health. Here are some nutrition tips for health and wellness:Eating Healthy Making better food choicesHealth and Wellness - It starts with me! I can take control of my own personal health by: | being active | eating healthy | nurturing spirit | respecting tobacco | Enjoy what you eat Eating is supposed to be enjoyable. Feel positive about what and how you eat. Eat food you enjoy! Eat foods close to nature Incorporate more traditional foods into your diet and focus on foods that have been through as little processing as possible (\"whole foods\"). Check out the Traditional Food Fact Sheets on FNHA's Eating Healthy wellness stream webpage. Be prepared Take time to plan your meals and snacks. Create a shopping list before going to the grocery store. Check flyers and sales online to plan around sale prices. Keep track of foods you eat by using the Daily Food Journal in this book. Plan for healthy snacks Snacking on healthy foods can be hard when you are not prepared. Keep healthy snacks, like vegetables, fruit, nuts, and yogurt, handy at all times. Choose a variety of foods Eating foods from a variety of food groups, with a variety of colours, and a variety of cooking methods, is ideal for optimal health. Eating a variety of foods helps you meet nutrients needs and is good for the soul.Have more family meals Planning meals together with family and/or friends can be more important than the types of foods that are eaten. Make meal time pleasant by having lighthearted conversations, and avoid distractions such as the television or electronics. Reduce refined sugars Added sugars can be found in many common foods and drinks. Obesity and other chronic diseases continue to rise, and sugar drinks are a big contributor to the problem. Popular drinks such as soda pop, sports drinks, energy drinks, juice and specialty coffee, usually contain a very high amount of sugar. Instead, water is the best choice. Try adding fresh fruits, vegetables or herbs to your water to add flavour. Practice mindful eating Mindful eating is eating with the intention of caring for yourself and paying attention to the food you are eating and the effect it has on your body. Be aware of your physical and emotional cues for hunger. Choose food for enjoyment and nourishment.8 Helpful Hints for Healthy EatingMy goals ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________The Basics of the: Nutrition Facts Table Use this table to choose healthy food products by following these three (3) steps: 1. Serving Size Compare this amount of food to what you actually eat. 2. % Daily Value Use this value to help you make informed choices about your food. A general rule is 5% or less may be too little of healthy nutrients and 15% or more is too much of other nutrients. 3. Make healthy food choices: Use the % daily value to compare two foods. Try to limit the amount of trans fat, sodium and sugar Enjoy foods with lots of fibre, vitamin A, calcium and iron. Recommendations from Suzanne Johnson Registered Dietitian from the Penticton Indian Band. Our Indigenous foods are very high in nutrients that are impor - tant for our health, but nutrients are not the only benefits that we receive from these foods. Our favorite Indigenous food is likely one that connects us to our family and stories of our past as well as holding unique and important teachings of our language and culture.7 6Five Minute De-Stressors People often say they are \"stressed\" when their normal coping mechanisms have been overwhelmed. Each day consider taking at least one de-stressing, five minute break, preferably more if you are able. These types of breaks could include: stretching deep breathing meditating reading a few pages of a novel drawing listening to your favorite song, or going for a quick walk These quick personal breaks give you a chance to regain emotional and mental control in difficult situations.Wellness is a BALANCE of many factors including your Spirit Nurturing spirit is the aspect in your life that gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. This builds your self-esteem, self-confidence and allows you to be connected to others and the land. Nurturing your spirit supports the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual aspects of your being.Nurturing Spirit Support all aspects of your beingHealth and Wellness - It starts with me! I can take control of my own personal health by: | being active | eating healthy | nurturing spirit | respecting tobacco | My goals for nurturing Environmental Scan of the Traditional Models of Wellness was done to look at the importance of tradi - tional wellness in the communities for current and future planning. The main indicators for Traditional Wellness were identified as follows: cultural sharing (drum classes, sweats, language classes), connection with the land (medicine gathering, gathering berries, fishing, hunting, camping) healing circles involvement of youth and elders in the community; integration of their knowledge into the community being active and eating healthy role models in the community who are drug and alcohol free, and support from community leaders in traditional ways* *Information from First Nations Health Society - The Environmental Scan: Traditional Models of Wellness - March 2010.Sharing our stories An important part of being happy and nurturing one's spirit is having healthy relationships; Sharing our stories helps us connect with one another and build relationships. Spirit Magazine As a part of building strong relationships and furthering its commitment in being the health and wellness partner to all BC First Nations, the FNHA produces Spirit Magazine . Spirit Magazine can be found online or in print at First Nations health centres, band offices, and Friendship Centres in BC, or through FNHA community engage- ment coordinators or regional health liaisons. The FNHA's quarterly publication focuses on sharing the many positive First Nations and Indigenous health and wellness stories taking place across the province.ACTIVE SPIRIT, ACTIVE HISTORY: A Culture of Sport, Activity and Well-being among BC First Nations First Nations people enjoy a long and rich history in sports and physical activity, and this book was created to share the stories and pictures of BC First Nations individuals who have triumphed, mentored and led the way by living a healthy lifestyle; These individuals are Wellness Champions .

Please visit www.fnha.ca/respectingtobacco to learn all about our quitting resources and tobacco-related initiatives. Keep Tobacco Sacred - Traditional Tobacco Use For thousands of years, natural tobacco has been an integral part of Aboriginal culture in many parts of British Columbia. Used in ritual, ceremony, and prayer, tobacco is considered a sacred plant with immense healing and spiri - tual benefits. For these reasons, the tobacco plant should be treated with great respect. It is also important not to confuse traditional tobacco with commercial tobacco and the addiction epidemic we see today. When tobacco is used in a non-traditional manner, like smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco/snuff, it causes lung diseases, heart disease, cancer, and pregnancy risks. Why Do People Smoke? One of the main reasons people smoke - and why it is so hard to stop - is the addiction to nicotine. This drug has a calming effect and it may relieve boredom, anxiety and irritability. Nicotine also has a stimulant effect, increasing alertness and concentration. Reasons to Quit When tobacco is used in a traditional way, it benefits the spirit and strengthens the ties to one's culture. However, when tobacco is used in a non-traditional manner, like smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco/snuff, it causes diseases, cancer, and pregnancy risks.Never Give Up It generally takes at least three serious attempts at quit - ting before a person becomes a lifetime non-smoker, and for many people it takes six (6) or more tries. If you are not successful the first time you try to quit, don't give up. Learn from the experience and get back on track right away. Youth Since 85% of smokers start before their 16th birthday, if you do not start smoking by 19 you are more likely to never become a regular tobacco user. However, if you are a young person looking to quit and you want youth friendly material, the following websites have informa- tion on tobacco addiction, quitting tips and support from others sharing their stories: www.quit4life.com and www.bchealthyliving.ca FNHA's Respecting Tobacco Initiatives Tobacco Timeout Challenge The challenge: Quit for 24 hours, enter to win a $250 cash prize. Most people who smoke or chew commercial tobacco want to quit, but may not know how. This monthly contest, on the first Tuesday of every month, challenges First Nations and Aboriginal smokers to butt out for 24 hours. Learning to be smoke-free takes time and practice. Sign up today at TobaccoTimeout.ca. Inside|Out The Inside|Out campaign is a partnership between FNHA and the BC Lung Association. It builds awareness about second-hand smoke and how to make the home a smoke-free space. When you smoke inside your home or car, it gets trapped in the fabric and carpets. Inside|Out creates a space to engage communities. It is a resource to be set up at community gatherings, such as health fairs, with an information booth and interac-tive resources. Tobacco Podcast Series FNHA has launched a tobacco-cessation podcast that shares the journey of a respected northern First Nations leader as she commits to quitting commercial cigarettes. The three-part podcast, \"Smokestack Sandra,\" tracks Sandra Teegee, Deputy Chief of Takla Lake First Nation, over a series of weeks. This was a journey she recom-mends to others who are using commercial tobacco.
