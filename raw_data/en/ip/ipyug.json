Registered and practicing nurse since 1993. Hi, I am Violeta! I studied Homeopathy for 4 years at the Homeopathic College of East of Anglia. I practice in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the Society of Homeopaths. As a homeopath, I am able to help more people experience this form of alternative medicine, which in some cases can be nothing short of a miracle. I am originally from Bulgaria and came to work and live in the UK in 2005. I am a registered nurse and have worked in different hospitals for more than 25 years. I am interested in the Human Chemistry and natural balancing therapy method of Ton Jansen and do apply it in my practice when indicated. I love learning and continuously take different courses to deepen my knowledge. I am a Center of Homeopathic Education pro member and have completed all their postgraduate online courses up to date. I am interested in a healthy lifestyle and try to have a clean diet and exercise regularly. I enjoy yoga, pilates, and body balance classes. I love gardening and work regularly on my allotment. I am a food enthusiast and love cooking from scratch and fermenting foods. I make my own sourdough spelt organic bread once or twice a week. I love dogs and enjoy long walks with our Golden Retriever- Archie. I have a personal interest in menopause problems and candida overgrowth and it happens that I see more clients with those problems. I treat clients of all ages from babies to the elderly with a wide range of health problems. Homeopathy treats the person, not the disease. It works by stimulating our self-healing mechanism. I am interested in using the Human Chemistry Integrated therapy method by Ton Jansen and in some of the more complex cases, I do employ it when indicated.
