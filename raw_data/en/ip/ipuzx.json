Homeopathy involves using energetic medicines to stimulate the body's own ability to heal itself. Homeopathic remedies are pure medicinal agents obtained from plants, metals, minerals and other natural organic sources. This makes them a great option for children, pregnancy and any acute or chronic disease. When the body is stuck or blocked, homeopathic remedies help give it a little push to heal. With homeopathy we address the whole person and the root cause of imbalances. Homeopathic medicine is really about treating the individual, respecting each person as unique even if they are experiencing a common illness. For example, 30 people may all be suffering from anxiety but they will each be given a different remedy based on their entire health picture. The emphasis is placed on how you experience illness. Homeopathy is a system of medicine which is based on treating the individual with highly diluted substances that trigger the body's natural system of healing. Based on your experience of your symptoms, I will match the most appropriate remedy that fits YOU. It works on the principle of \"like cures like\"- that is, a substance that would cause symptoms in a healthy person is used to cure those same symptoms in illness. Scientifically it cannot yet be explained, but new theories in quantum physics are starting to shed some light on the process. What we do know for sure is that a precisely prescribed remedy can stimulate the body to cure. Classical homeopathy most closely matches the totality of the individual's symptoms and personality with the homeopathic remedy in order to stimulate the body's own natural healing response. In classical homeopathy, the use of a single remedy at a time is a basic principle. With a correct homeopathic prescription, a remedy can help to achieve mental, emotional, physical and spiritual balance. What to expect Homeopathy is an energetic holistic medicine. It is a conversation about you, as a whole, unique individual. As a homeopath I am looking for the thread of continuity that runs through all four levels of a person: spiritual, mental, emotional and physical. I am looking for the pattern that is unique to each of us and matching it with a homeopathic remedy that fits the totality of the case. The first appointment is approximately 90 minutes of loosely directed conversation where I get to know you better. I often prescribe a single remedy after the first appointment. Sometimes it can take me a few days to work the case up but I do dispense a single remedy that is taken one time. A follow-up appointment is 30-45 minutes and takes place 3-4 weeks after the initial intake. "}
