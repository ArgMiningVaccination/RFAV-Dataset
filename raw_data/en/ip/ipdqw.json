The word Ayurveda consists of 2 parts \"Ayush\" and \"Veda\". Veda is derived from the root \"Vid\" meaning to \"to understand\" \u2014 So Ayurveda is to understand Ayush. \"Vid\" also means to gain \u2014 So Ayurveda is to gain Ayush. Ayush is a combination of 4 factors \u2014 Sharira (body), Indriya (Senses), Sattva(mind) and Atma(soul). Life is a union of all these 4 elements. So Ayurveda is not only a medical science but also a complete way of living to achieve health in all possible ways \u2014 Physical, emotional, Social and Spiritual. Why Ayurveda? - Cause and Effect Phenomenon \u2014 no protocol based medication based on labs, numbers but this science finds out what the root cause is and addresses that root cause - We are part of nature \u2014 the same 5 elements that are in the universe are present in us as well - Ayurveda is Eternal \u2014 its principles have not changed for the past 5,000 years - Not Man Made \u2014 Principles always existed and were downloaded by the ancient sages - Individual blue print \u2014 tailor made treatment for each individual constitution and body type - Can be used anywhere in the world - Health is addressed in many ways not just physical but also emotional, spiritual and social - Safe \u2014 no side effects due to the treatment Goal of Ayurveda: To protect the health of the healthy and to cure the diseases of patients \u2014 now comes the question what is health? Health(Swastha) according to Sushruth a Pitta and Kapha are most powerful entities that form a system for the proper functioning of the body \u2014 Creating a balance in these creates health and vice versa. Agni (digestive fire) helps in conversion of food into the 7 Dhatus (tissues). Dhatus are the building blocks of our body. Proper excretion of the waste products indicates a clean and good working environment. Health also extends to pleasant soul, senses and mind. The lifestyle changes and herbs recommended will help us achieve health as mentioned above.
