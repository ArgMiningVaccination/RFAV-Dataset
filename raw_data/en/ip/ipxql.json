It most often occurs in horses living in hot, humid climat es - like Florida and other Gulf coast states. It is an important problem for performance horses because t hermoregulation is mainly accomplished by sweating in the horse. Between 65- 70% of heat is lost via the evaporation of swea t and the humid environme nt further decreases efficiency of sweat evaporation and cooling of the horse. Prevalence Researchers have not identified any age, sex, breed, or color predisposition for developing anhidrosis. Raising foals in a hot, humid climate is not protective, as both locally -bred and imported horses may be affected. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a prevale nce of between 2 -6% of horses, though the prevalence may vary depending on the severity of climate. Diagnosis Anhidrosis can often be diagnosed presum ptively, based on appropriate clinical signs and examination by a veterinarian. Patients often present with increased respirations and failure to cool after exercise. In situations that shoul d elicit copious sweating, anhidrotic horses will have minimal or no sweat production. Some areas may still sweat, which can be confusing. In chronic cases, horses develop dry flaky skin (especially on the forehead), hair loss , fatigue, anorexia and decreased water consumption. Confirmatory testing utilizing intrad ermal injections of epinephrine or terbutaline can be performed if the diagnosis is unclear or to evaluate treatments. Treatment There is no known successful therapy for anhidrosis except moving the horse to a cooler climate. Not only does this help manage the high body temperatures, but horses are also noted to start sweating once in a cooler environment. Therefore, it is essential that non-sweaters living in Florida are carefully managed to prevent high body temperatures from occuring. Many horse owners feel that various feed supplements offer relief to their horses, but this is an anecdotal observation with no research support. Other treatments are attempted with minimal evidence, including oral supplementation with dark beer, salts, vitamins/electrolytes or thyroid supplementation. Most of these are not dangerous, but also do not appear to improve the animal's ability to sweat. Medical treatment has also been attempted with ACTH, alpha -2 agonists, prostaglandins (Lutalyse), antihistamines and Methyldopa (Aldo- Met), but has been generally unsuccessful. Acupuncture Clinical Trial A total of 44 recently anhidrotic horses w ere enrolled in the study, based on appropriate clinical signs and an inadequate response to a quantitative intradermal ter butaline sweat test (QITST). Horses were randomly assigned to treatment or placebo groups, with owners and examining veterinarians blinded to treatment. Treated horses were given four acupuncture treatments at weekly intervals and four weeks of herbal medication, while control horses received sham acupuncture and hay powder. Horses were retested t wice by QITST after the treatment month. In treated horses, sweating responses to QITST increased significantly compared to baseline, but QITST results retur ned to baseline within four weeks after stopping treatment. Because there was also a nonsignificant increas e in sweating in control horses, a significant difference between treated and placebo groups was not achieved. Thus, a cupuncture and herbal medic ation may have improved sweating in recently anhidrotic horses, although the effect lasted less than four weeks after discontinuing treatment. The use of this treatment requires further investigation to fully validate its usefulness. ENY-2028 Pest Management Perceptions and Practices for Equine Farms in North and Central Florida1 Erika T.

Nick T. Place , DeanIntroduction Integrated pest management (IPM) for equine farms requires accurate diagnosis of pest problems and the coordinated use of science-based management practices. Currently, knowledge is limited about pest problems faced by horse owners in Florida and management of pests on equine facilities. To develop an effective IPM system for horse farms, horse owners' pest problems must be identi - fied, and current management practices of equine facilities must be understood. Equine facilities have unique pest management problems due to facility structure and horse husbandry practices. In Florida, homes on small equine farms are generally located in close proximity to pastures, stalls or run-in sheds, manure piles, and other fly breeding habitats (Figure 1). Because of this association, homeowners have a high risk of exposure to pathogens that can be transmitted by filth flies to humans (Forster et al. 2007). Substrates, such as straw or sand, that are used in equine husbandry vary significantly between horse farms and other livestock facilities. Substrate type and management can influence the development of some insect pests on a property. Additionally, typical areas surveyed for biological control agents and filth fly develop - ment on cattle or poultry operations, such as silage areas, calf hutches, and laying houses, are not found on equine facilities. These differences make it challenging to adapt insect pest management protocols for equine farms that were developed on other livestock facilities.While many control methods are available for managing insect pests affecting horses, there is insufficient informa - tion on the efficacy of most of them. Commercial products used by horse owners for pest control include biological control agents, chemical sprays, personal protection devices (fly masks, wraps, and blankets), baits, and traps. Many of these products and other components of an IPM system currently may be over or under utilized by Florida equestrians because of the lack of information and training on developing IPM plans for equine farms. Figure 1. Single-family homes are often located adjacent to horse paddocks or stables in equine farms in Florida. Credits: Erika T. Machtinger2 Although horses are numerous in Florida and important to the state economy, research on managing their pests is limited, and practices are excluded from national surveys. The 2006 USDA survey, which details management practices on equine farms nationwide, did not include properties with fewer than five horses. This restriction potentially eliminated approximately half of the properties in the United States that house horses, certainly the small equine farms, and presents an inaccurate analysis of the needs and practices of the equine industry. The purpose of this survey was to gain knowledge about IPM use on equine farms in Florida and use it to guide research and Extension activities. The objectives were to determine the perceived pest problems and current pest management practices used on equine farms and to identify the research and Extension needs of horse and facility owners in North and Central Florida. Survey Design The survey was conducted from 15 November, 2010 to 20 June, 2011 by using Survey Monkey ( www.surveymonkey. com ) to collect and analyze responses from anonymous respondents. The survey link was sent to 16 major equine organizations in north and central Florida, including regional shows, clubs, and associations, requesting that it be distributed to their members. It also was provided to county Extension agents and printed in the Central Florida Equine Magazine. The survey had three sections: 1) basic demographic information of the participants, 2) pest problems and management practices on their facilities, and 3) opinions on the quality and availability of research and Extension materials. Survey Results Horse owners in north and central Florida attempt to manage their pest insects with a variety of methods, many of which could be components of an IPM program. However, based on survey responses, many opportunities are available for research and Extension programming on IPM practices for more effectively managing pests on equine farms. Responses to the survey questions ranged from 274 to 299; however, not every respondent answered every question. Therefore, response percentages were used to analyze the data.A Diverse Clientele The equine industry in north and central Florida represents a diverse sector of agriculture (Table 1). There were many differences in property acreage and number of horses, and over 21 riding disciplines were cited. More than 90% of the survey respondents were pleasure riders or engaged in performance activities, which was significantly higher than the 2005 American Horse Council survey results that found 60% of Florida horses were used in recreation and showing. Equestrians participating in these activities are likely to be affiliated with at least one organization or group that had access to the survey; therefore, it was expected that higher numbers might respond. Most facilities were 10 acres or less (56.4%), housing between one and five horses (63.7%). Perceived Pest Problems Pest problems clearly were observed seasonally in Florida equine facilities. Overwhelmingly, respondents said they experienced pest pressure in the summer months (June, July and August) (86.1%) (Figure 1). This response was expected because insect pests in Florida are aided in devel - opment by high humidity and temperatures, particularly in the summer months. Many arthropods were indicated as major pests on equine farms. The most common pest species were mosquitoes, stable flies, and gnats, with many write-in responses for \"yellow fly\" and the so-called \"cow fly\" that respondents may have applied to the horn fly, stable fly, or even house fly (Figure 2). The colloquial term \"cow fly\" typically refers to the horn flies often found on the backs of cows. Midges, Cu- licoides spp., \"yellow fly, \" and \"cow fly\" were options in the base question represented as their correct common names (deer fly and horn fly, respectively). This variability in name recognition demonstrated that many respondents may not be familiar with common names and, therefore, use col - loquial terminology. This potential confusion was observed again in the follow-up question regarding pest identifica - tion. Respondents considered stable flies a problem (63.1%) and thought they could identify them accurately (61.5%). However, this response is surprising because stable flies are not often observed feeding on horses. Although stable flies can be found on horses, particularly feeding on the forelegs (Mullens et al. 1988), they do not linger, preferring to rest on nearby walls or fence lines (Gerry et al. 2007; Mullens et al. 1988), making it unlikely that horse owners would observe and correctly identify them. Additionally, although respondents reported most pest pressure in the summer, stable flies are most abundant in late winter and spring on horse farms in Florida (Machtinger 2011; Pitzer et al. 2011). 3 Respondents may be observing horn flies or house flies and mistaking them for stable flies or they may assume that flies found in the stable are classified as \"stable\" flies. Based on responses, the ability of the survey population to accurately identify pest species is questionable and presents an op - portunity for education on insect identification. Pest Management Practices and Opinions Pests were not monitored by the majority of the survey takers. Over 76% of respondents did not monitor pest populations on their properties during the year, mainly because they lack knowledge about the required methods and materials (59.1%) (Figure 3). Owners of small equine facilities are frequently employed full-time away from the operation. Smaller boarding and training facilities that pro - vide riding lessons and other services are often family-run, and these families may lack time to learn and implement monitoring methods and gather the required information. When asked to describe monitoring techniques in the comment box, many of the respondents listed some form of control, such as biological control, traps, or insecticides. In the context of IPM, monitoring requires regular observa - tions to determine the abundance of pests on a property. These observations provide the basis for pest management decision making and action relative to economic or dam - age thresholds (Higley and Pedigo 1996). Based on these responses, it is clear that monitoring in the context of IPM is not widely understood by equine farm owners. Horse owners demonstrated a very low tolerance for pests. Survey respondents were asked how many pests they would tolerate around their animals, or their action threshold, and the majority responded with less than 10 pests. Unfor - tunately, action thresholds have not been determined for horses because the economic or damage levels are difficult to assess quantitatively in terms of losses. In this survey, it might have been difficult for owners to assign numbers of pests around their animals into the groupings we provided, so they answered 10 or lower, wishing to convey a low but not necessarily accurate number. Future research on economic losses to horse owners attributed to equine pests may further guide the research community on the needs of this sector of agriculture and provide action threshold guidelines to horse owners. Manure management is one of the most important sanita - tion practices in IPM of filth fly pests, such as house and Figure 2. Seasons when survey respondents perceived the most pest problems. Figure 3. Comparison of perceived pest problems and ability to identify pests. Respondents were allowed to select multiple pests. Figure 4. Survey respondent reasons for not monitoring pests on equine farms. 4 stable flies, and some form was practiced by virtually all the respondents (Figure 4). All but three of the 272 respondents to the pest problems and management practices section of the survey managed their manure and bedding waste, suggesting that they may be aware that it could attract and support filth fly pests. The most common methods of waste disposal were distribution with a spreader (49%), dragging pastures (22.1%), placing it in a pile (24.8%), and active composting (25.9%). Apparently, owners and operators of equine facilities are attuned to managing manure and bedding waste to maintain the health and welfare of their animals. Farms practicing rigorous sanitation may limit breeding of some filth flies (Kaufman et al. 2005), and manure management should continue to be encouraged on equine facilities. Owners of an equine facility typically require more than one method to control pest insects on their farm. Survey respondents were asked to indicate how many control methods were used (Figure 5). Most of the respondents used two (32.9%) or three methods (27.8%) and about half as many used one (11.9%) or four (15.3%). The use of five or six methods was rare and just one of the respondents reported using seven. Horse owners were not asked why they used more than one method for controlling insect pests, but it can be assumed that no single method is adequately effective for all pest species. Additionally, they may be attempting to control pests in different locations where different methods are required, e.g., in barns, on horses, around feeding areas. The abundance of pest species varies with season, so specific methods may be more effective at certain times of the year. The survey respondents were asked to indicate the pest con - trol methods they used most often to manage insect pests (Figure 6). Insecticide application was the predominant method of pest control (95.9%). Physical exclusion with fly masks (66.2%) was also commonly practiced, although respondents also used traps (38.0%), biological control (22.0%), and feed-through insecticide control (14.6%). Insecticides and repellents are commonly marketed to the equine industry, and the high numbers of respondents using insecticides suggest an over-reliance on chemical control. Horse owners clearly prefer conventional pest control methods targeted at adult insects but try options to control immature insects. Incorporating methods for controlling larvae is useless if insect pests are not breeding on equine farms. Because of a lack of monitoring, respon - dents were uninformed about pest type or abundance on their property. Nevertheless, some respondents expressed a willingness to use expensive and potentially harmful insecticides with no substantiated basis for their need or efficacy. Figure 5. Types of manure management methods used in equine farms. Respondents were allowed to select multiple pests. Figure 6. The percentage of survey respondents that used one or more methods of pest control. Figure 7. Types of pest control methods used on equine farms in north and central Florida. Respondents were allowed to select multiple types of pest control methods5 Annual expenditures by horse owners for pest control seemed unnecessarily high. About 74% of respondents spent in excess of $100 and 33.0% more than $200 annually on fly control products (Figure 7). Even with multiple methods and high annual costs, an overwhelming majority found products to be only somewhat effective (72.3 %). Horse owners attempting to manage pest problems might find a product marginally effective but continue to purchase and use more of it until some level of satisfaction in control is reached. This level of use and the associated expense may be due to the varying sizes of horse farms surveyed in terms of horse numbers, or potentially to horse owners using large amounts of a product or multiple products. Clearly, horse owners in Florida are willing to pay for pest control on their farms. However, these expenses may be excessive or unnecessary, depending on the farm. Educating owners about pests and pest control methods could help minimize expenses while maximizing control as part of an effective IPM plan. Research and Extension Requests Horse owners displayed significant preferences in research and Extension (Table 2), with more than half of the survey respondents indicating that current research was not meeting their needs (54.3%). Horse owners were asked to provide feedback on their research preferences. The high percentage of pesticide use suggested that the survey population had a positive attitude about chemical control. However, over 80% of respondents requested that more research be conducted on biological control, and non-toxic solutions were the most popular write-in answer. When asked which sources they most frequently use to obtain information on pest control, the most common answer was the internet. Respondents also consulted in similar frequencies with veterinarians, employees at feed stores, friends, and Extension agents. This survey was conducted online and, since the internet was the primary source of information used by facility owners, it is likely that they were predisposed to internet browsing and proactive in researching pest control products. The distinct preference and requests for information on biological control and non-toxic solutions found in this survey should help to establish research and Extension priorities. Future Educational Opportunities and Conclusions The results of this survey indicated that more research and Extension efforts are warranted in support of the small equine farm sector. Many equine property owners have insufficient knowledge of the identification, biology, and presence of filth fly pests on their properties, which is required to develop successful IPM programs. They continue to rely on insecticides because they lack adequate understanding of available alternatives. Although a comprehensive understanding of IPM practices was not demonstrated by respondents, a willingness to protect themselves and their animals was apparent. A concerted effort should be made to educate equine facility owners about the benefits of carefully planned IPM programs for managing external pests of horses and to provide online resources for proactive farm owners and managers. This need for pest management information presents an op - portunity for increasing production and distribution of IPM educational materials to Extension agents, equine farm owners, and large animal veterinarians.

Andrew Smith, DVM Large Animal Surgery Resident University of Florida Fibroplasia, or the formation of g ranulation tissue is a normal part of wound healing . Apart from the nuisance of becoming exuberant, granulation tissue has many important functions, which change continuously during the healing process. It fills in the wound gap, forms a barrier against external contaminants, provides myofibroblasts for woun d contraction, and forms the bed over which epithelium can migrate. Granulation tissue provides several cell types that have important functions during healing, however, too much, term ed \"exuberant\" granulation tissue can inhibit wound healing. Exuberant granulation tissue will typically develop in wounds of the distal limb, wounds under over areas of high motion, and/or the presence of infection, necrosis, or foreign bodies. When treated appropriately, most cases resolve with out reoccurrence. Occasion ally, e quine wounds can transform into or become infected to become more pathologic diseases that often look similar to exuberant granulation tissue . Differential diagnoses of exuberant A presumptive diagnosis can sometimes be made based on history and clinical features; however, a Definitive Diagnosis usually requires biopsy and histological assessment. A definitive diagno sis is important because treatment is specifically tailored to the underlying pathol ogical process. For some, prompt treatment is imperative as this can significantly affect the overall prognosis. Therefore, in wounds showing particularly complicated healing or frequent recurrence of exuberant granulation tissue, further testing should be performed for definitive diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis is critical because the current best practice for managing EGT is usually contraindicated in the management of other more pathologic diseases. Horse Health Myths and Misinformation Amanda M. House, DVM, DACVIM UF College of Veterinary Medicine Many of us have heard or passed down myths regarding equine health care. During this session, some of the most common myths and misinformation will be discussed about equine veterinary care. Colic, cough, preventative health care, and lameness myths will be demystified! Colic Myths and Misinformation 1. Never allow a horse with colic to roll. 2. The horse passed manure, so he must be doing fine and can be fed again. 3. Horses with colic should receive enemas. 4. Mineral oil should be force fed to horses with colic. 5. Colic surgery is a death sentence. The truth about colic: Colic is the number one cause of death in horses, excluding old age. The good news is t hat the vast majority of cases are mild and resolve with medical treatment. Although most horse owners hope to never have to think about it, understanding what colic is and adopting strategies for its management and prevention are an important part of resp onsible horse ownership and management. The USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System published the results of a 1998 study on equine colic which determined that the incidence of colic was 4.2 events for every 100 horses per year, that 1.2% of colic cases will require surgery and that 11% will be fatal. The cost of colic was estimated to be $115 million in 1998, and that has certainly increased in the last 10 years. So what is colic? Colic is a clinical sign of disease, but is not actually a disease itself. Colic is defined as any abdominal pain and can come from any abdominal organ, not just the gastrointestinal tract. Abdominal discomfort from liver or kidney disease will sometimes cause signs of colic. The signs of colic can vary from mild to severe. Mild, early signs of colic can include a poor appetite, decreased manure production, lip curling, depression, or laying down more than normal. The most common signs associated with colic include pawing, stretching out, flank watching, teeth grinding, bl oated abdomen, kicking at the abdomen, rolling, and getting up and down. Owners and care takers should know what is normal for their horses, so that abnormal behaviors can be recognized as soon as possible. Normal behaviors, appetite, and physical exam p arameters can vary a little bit from horse to horse. In general, adult horses should have a normal rectal temperature of 99 -101.0\u00b0F, a heart rate of 24 -48 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 10 -24 breaths per minute. The gums should be pink and moi st with a capillary refill time of less than 2 seconds. Most horses will pass 6 -10 piles of well formed manure in 24 hours. Horse owners and managers should routinely use thermometers and stethoscopes to evaluate the normal physical exam parameters for their horses. Treatment for colic depends on the suspected cause. Pain medication such as Banamine \u00ae is typically indicated for initial management. Banamine\u00ae usually takes about 30 minutes to take effect, so sedatives such as xylazine and detomidine can help relieve pain while the Banamine\u00ae begins working. Buscopan is another drug that may be administered by your veterinarian and may help treat spasmodic colic by stopping intestinal spasms. Fluid therapy is typically also administered by an oral or intravenou s route, depending on the severity and suspected cause of the colic. Laxatives like mineral oil and Epsom salts are often utilized for impactions. Horses that are exhibiting signs of colic should generally be kept off feed until the suspected cause has res olved. It is important to remember that mild intestinal upsets and colic that require surgery may start out with very similar signs. Persistent pain remains the #1 indicator for exploratory surgery in cases of colic. Fortunately, the prognosis for horses t hat undergo surgery is better now than it has been in the last 50 years. Most horses will return to their previous level of competition after about a 2 -3 month post -surgical rest. Remember to stay calm if you notice that your horse is showing signs of co lic. Remove the feed, but not the water, from the stall. Walking can help prevent injury if your horse is trying to go down and roll, but remember to first consider your safety as well as that of the horse. If the horse is too painful and cannot be safely walked, leave them in the stall until your veterinarian arrives. Call your veterinarian as soon as you notice a problem. Take the horse's heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature before the vet arrives. Evaluate your horse's gum color and moisture. It is important to have the horse's previous medical and diet histories available. Have there been any changes in the horse's routine? This information will be helpful for the veterinarian evaluating the horse. Do not give more than one dose of pain medica tion without consulting your veterinarian. Do not walk the horse or yourself to exhaustion. Absolutely do not try to pass a tube or force feed mineral oil. Mineral oil in the lungs can result in a fatal pneumonitis. It is also not advisable to insert a hos e or anything rectally into a horse to give an enema. Remember that chronic mild signs of colic over several days or longer may also indicate a serious problem and require veterinary evaluation. Cough Myth 1. Persistent coughs are usually caused by bacterial infections. In fact, the most common cause of a persistent cough from the lower airways is R ecurrent Airway Obstruction (also known as heaves), which is an allergic lower airway disease. Upper airway problems (such as dorsal displacement of the soft palate) may cause coughs as well, and would need to be evaluated by endoscopy. Lameness Myths 1. Wraps: You have to wrap both legs if there is an injury to one. Wraps must be applied in one direction (ie inside to outside). These are common myths that we have all heard about the application of equine wraps. In fact, it is OK to just wrap one limb, although we often will apply a support wrap to the contralateral limb. Wraps can be applied in either dire ction, as long as the pressure is applied evenly. 2. The lameness looks high up in the leg...don't forget the foot! 3. Lacerations or wounds near a tendon or joint are not severe as long as the horse isn't lame. Wounds may involve the tendon sheath or joint ini tially with minimal lameness. Wounds or lacerations near these critical areas should always be evaluated by your veterinarian. Preventative Health Care Myths and Misinformation 1. Only horses that travel need to be routinely vaccinated. 2. Once a year vacci nation for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is adequate. 3. Deworm every horse every 8 weeks. The truth about vaccinations and parasite control: Routine vaccination is a critical component of developing a health maintenance program for horses. It is imp ortant to emphasize that there is no standard vaccination program that is suitable for every horse, and that individual programs should be developed with your veterinarian. Vaccinations help to prime the immune system to respond quickly when a horse is exp osed to an infectious agent. Although vaccinations cannot guarantee disease prevention in all circumstances, they help minimize the risk of infection and aid in the prevention of certain diseases. Vaccination is not a substitute for other good management p ractices, and should be used in conjunction with proper nutrition, deworming, pasture management and minimizing stress and overcrowding for optimal results in each horse and herd. Ideally, all horses in a group should receive vaccinations and be on the sam e schedule when possible. The vaccination program appropriate for an individual horse or herd needs to take into account things such as age, sex, geographic location, use of the horse, pregnancy status and risk for developing the disease. Currently, there are vaccines available for tetanus, encephalomyelitis, West Nile virus, rabies, rhinopneumonitis (equine herpes virus), influenza, strangles, Potomac horse fever, botulism, equine viral arteritis, anthrax, and rotavirus. The vaccines are administered by an intramuscular or intranasal route depending on the disease. Influenza and strangles have both intramuscular and intranasal vaccines available. Adverse reactions to vaccination are not common but are a potential risk of vaccination. Signs of an adverse re action may include muscle soreness, swelling, fever, anorexia, and lethargy. If the signs are severe or are not self- limiting, your veterinarian should be informed and may want to initiate additional therapy. When considering a vaccination program for yo ur horse, it is important to remember that each horse's immune system will respond a little differently to vaccination. Not every horse will be protected to the same degree or for the same amount of time following vaccination. A primary series of the vaccines with booster doses will be required for an appropriate immune response before exposure to the disease. It will take 1 -2 weeks after a completed vaccine series for your horse to be protected against the disease. After the initial vaccine series, most ho rses will require annual or semi -annual booster vaccinations. It is recommended that ALL horses, regardless of age or use, be vaccinated for EEE/WEE, tetanus, rabies, and West Nile Virus. In Florida, all horses should be vaccinated for EEE/WEE at least 2-3 times per year. Establishing a deworming program for equine parasites has become a somewhat controversial topic of discussion. Due to the emergence of resistant parasites (worms that are not killed by traditional dewormers), some of the emphasis is shifting to prevention and control, rather than just routine rotational treatment with anthelmintics. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends establishing a program with your veterinarian that works best for your horse and/or herd, in conjunction with these suggestions for environmental management: 1. Clean and dispose of manure in the pasture at least twice weekly. 2. Mow and harrow pastures regularly to break up manure and expose parasite eggs to the sun. 3. If possible, rotate pastures by allowing other livestock to graze them. 4. Group horses in a pasture by age to reduce exposure to certain parasites, and maximize the deworming program geared to that group. 5. Prevent overgrazing and reduce fecal contamination by keeping the number of horse s per acre to a minimum. 6. Feed horses in a feeder for hay and grain rather than on the ground. 7. Remove bot eggs from the hair routinely to prevent ingestion. Individual horses can be monitored for parasites with a fecal examination and egg count. In Florid a, the peak worm season is fall, winter, and spring. Treatment should be focused around these times. The effectiveness of different dewormers can be measured using a fecal egg count reduction test, which involves performing a fecal egg count before and aft er deworming your horse. Although it is critical to target the large and small strongyles in adults, as well as roundworms in foals, rotation of dewormers should not be done as often as every 4 -8 weeks, because this may promote resistant worms. Ideally, a dewormer can be used for several treatments prior to rotation to a new drug. It is important to remember that treatment with ivermectin is done at 2 -month intervals, while moxidectin is done at 3 -month intervals. Equine tapeworms are difficult to identify in fecal examinations, and deworming for tapeworms is recommended biannually or annually with a product containing praziquantel (Zimectrin Gold\u00ae, Quest Plus\u00ae), or double dose pyrantel pamoate or tartrate. A blood test has been developed that iden tifies antibodies to tapeworms in horses. This test is only available at one lab in the United States at the University of Tennessee's College of Veterinary Medicine. However, there are likely horses with tapeworms that this test will not identify, and it is more practical to be sure horses are dewormed annually to biannually for tapeworms. Consult your veterinarian for a deworming strategy that works best for your horse and/or herd. 1Page 1 `Not pregnant after repeated matings `Cannot carry a pregnancy to term `Has known reproductive pathology `Behavioral issues that affect reproduction `Breeding management `Conformational defects `Susceptibility to dt i t i endometritis Infectious endometritis Post-mating induced endometritis `Prior to breeding Minimal inflammation `After breedin g g Acute inflammatory response `Poor ability to inflammation/infection 2Page 2`Middle-aged ciliated cells Protective Excessive in endometritis Causey, et al. 2000, 2008.`Heterogenous mix of bacteria Supported in extracellular matrix Normal flora/protective Pseudomonas spp, E. coli `Properties of bacteria can chan ge with conditions pg Can result in disease xDental caries Antibiotic J. 2005 `Strep infections More uterine fluid More positive cultures More positive cytology `E. coli infections Low volume uterine lavage RT-PCR Riddle et al, 2007; Eaton et al, 2010; Burleson et al, 2010 400 x g for 10\" `Traditional cytology 5 PMN's/hpf Degenerate cells Bacteria xStreptococcus`Low volume lavage Presence of PMN's Debris in fluid Mucus strands Ec o l i culture Streptococcus Fungal organismsE. coli culture Fungal culture rate of false negatives `Uterine Cytology Higher specificity than uterine swab `Low Volume Lavage `Low Volume Lavage Higher sensitivity for E.
