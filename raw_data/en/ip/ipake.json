The committee met, pursuant to notice, in Pine Ridge, SD, Sena-tor Larry Pressler presiding. Present: Senator Pressler. Staff present: Herb Weiss. WELCOMING STATEMENT BY MR. MEANS Mr. MEANS. Well, good morning. And I just can't thank the Sena-tor enough for coming down our way and showing his concern. Wejust got finished taking a tour, looking at various sites concerningthe Mni Wicone Water Project; and I think the Senator is going totalk a little bit on that. The presentation is ready to start, so I'll turn it over to the Sena-tor. Thank you. OPENING STATEMENT BY SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you very much. Let's move closer together. This isn't church, so you can sit in the front row. Can you hear me clearly? Thank you for being here. I also want to thank your leader forthe good job he did this morning on the tour describing the waterproject; Also, Elaine Quiver, the Director of the Foster Grandparent Pro- gram on the reservation, who has done so much to help organize this hearing. This is an official Senate Special Committee on Aging hearing, and a record of this meeting will be kept. I believe it's the only hearing to focus on the specific problems of the Indian elderly this year. Before we get into the testimony, I want to bring you up to date on the status of the water pipeline project. We are working veryhard to get this project authorized and funds appropriated. We must pass both an authorization and an appropriation bill to fund the project. The authorization bill has passed the House. I will continue to work closely with my Senate colleagues and the Gover- nor's office to make this project a reality. This morning I saw some of the worst water conditions in the United States. People have to haul water long distances to obtain (1)2 safe drinking water. The Oglala Reservoir is very polluted. At one time, children could swim there. However, if they now swim in the lake, they develop a rash. At one point the reservoir had good edible fish. But now I'm told the fish have parasites and can't be eaten. This is in part because a pump on White Clay Creek doesn't work properly. That's a sepa- rate problem. My staff will be working with tribal leaders and State officials to do something about that problem. Water samples were taken this morning out of the Reservoir and I shall review the results when they're tested in Pierre. I've al- ready been told the water is so polluted you can't swim, fish, ordrink it. It seemed ironic to me that with such pure people and clear air as we have here, that we should have such polluted water. I was told about the problems of well-drilling in the area. The shallow wells of 140 feet frequently have alkali. Deep wells that would reach down into the Madison Formation are very expensive. We have a real problem in terms of drinking water, a basic human need. We talk about people's rights and problems. We talk about problems of the elderly. But it is a hard realization that elderly people must haul water. This is a terrible problem. I remember many years ago a meeting in Chamberlain where I drew in longhand a pipeline to serve western South Dakota. I've been working on it since. Long before that meeting, I introduced the first legislation for the WEB Water Pipeline in north central South Dakota. The WEB project is nearing completion and is bring- ing clean drinking water to farms and homes. We drove by the Pine Ridge-the ridge for which Pine Ridge isnamed-which is very much in need of reforestation. We have re- forestation programs in our foreign aid program. It seems our own people and our own citizens sometimes don't enjoy these same ben- efits. That's something we need to work on. There were many other subjects discussed this morning, housing for instance, one of the concerns with which your fine leaders must deal. I have two people on my staff who deal almost exclusively with Indian problems. Over the years, I have made it a priority tovisit Indian reservations in South Dakota and I will continue to do so. The purpose of today's hearing is to examine the unique problem of the American Indian elderly. Are they different from any other population group? Do the Indian elderly utilize nursing homes more or less than other population groups? Do they have unique problems? Of course, both young and old American Indians have a multi- tude of problems to resolve. Problems found on reservations affect all age groups, young and old alike. The water problems I men- tioned before are a major problem for the elderly. Let's now turn our attention to this field hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. Senator Melcher of Montana, Chair- man of the Committee, authorized this hearing. I want to thank him for his support of my desire to pay special attention to theneeds of American Indian elderly. I want to thank the experts who are appearing as witnesses. Again, Iwould like to recognize Elaine Quiver and her Foster Grandparent Program. Programs like the Foster Grandparent Pro-3 gram provide opportunities to preserve traditional values and cul- ture through building communication between older and younger generations. Isolation between the Indian elderly and the rest of the tribal community can be reduced through this type of program. It is my belief that older American Indians are a forgotten mi- nority. They are one of the most impoverished groups in the United States. Numbering 109,000 in 1980, older Indians comprise only 8 percent of the total Indian and Alaskan population. Al- though the number of older Indians is expected to reach 200,000 by the year 1990, this group still represents only a small portion of the total elderly population in the United States. Their numbers may be small when compared to the total older population, but the needs of older Indians are far greater. Many American Indian elderly are born, live, and die in an environment of poverty. According to the 1980 census, 61 percent of these indi- viduals had incomes below the national poverty level. From Indian reservations to cities, these individuals often live their last years deprived of a decent standard of living. The American Indian elderly can barely purchase the basic ne- cessities of life. Many of these individuals were not employed in their younger years because of limited education and job opportuni- ties. The majority of these individuals will not receive a monthly Social Security or pension check because of their limited work his- tory. Because of their lower life expectancy, the Indian elderly are not likely to live long enough to become eligible to participate in Federal entitlement programs. The American dream of having the opportunity to live in safe, well-constructed housing is out of reach to many American Indian elderly. They have lived a lifetime in dilapidated, crowded housing. A 1980 survey by the National Indian Council on Aging found that 26 percent of elderly Indians lived in homes constructed before 1939. Twenty-five percent of the respondents reported that they used outdoor toilets; 24 percent had no indoor plumbing; 42 percent had one to four broken windows; and 35 percent had broken doors; and 75 percent did not have telephones to use in case of an emer- gency. Many of their homes still do not have electricity. Lack of plumbing and running water has contributed to the widespread prevalence of tuberculosis among the Indian elderly. According to the National Indian Council on Aging, the rate of tu- berculosis is five times higher among this group than among the general elderly population. A lifetime of poor health has drastically reduced the life expect- ancy of the American Indian elderly. According to the 1980 census, the life expectancy of the older Indian is 63.1 years compared to 71 years for the non-Indian older population. I think that's a very sig- nificant difference-nearly an 8-year difference. Diabetes, liver and kidney disease, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis, and heart disease reduce their quality of life. Their poor nutrition adds to their exist- ing health problems. The very limited number of studies provide us with a glimpse of mental health problems of the American Indian elderly. These studies seem to indicate'that these individuals suffer from clinical- ly significant levels of depression and high levels of anxiety be- cause of their health problems.4 The increasing mobility of the Indian population has led to olderIndians becoming more isolated from their families. Many experi-enced a diminished role in their families. Increased alcoholism ofyounger Indians has led to neglect and abuse of older Indians.Today, many barriers reduce access to health care, both on reser-vations and in cities. Lack of transportation on remote reservationsoften results in older Indians being unable to attend multipurposesenior centers. In some cases, these centers are not located on res-ervations. Thus, older Indians are deprived of social opportunities,nutritious meals, and a place to participate in fulfilling activities.In urban areas, the Indian elderly cannot utilize health careservices provided by tribal governments or by the Indian HealthService. Limited knowledge of available health care resources, com-bined with the fear of using public transportation, keep many ofthese individuals from seeking medical care in cities, even when itis needed. With multiple chronic conditions that are often debilitating,many American Indian elderly require nursing home care. Onlynine nursing homes are located on tribal lands in five States. Indi-viduals who require intensive nursing care are placed in nursinghomes located off the reservation. In South Dakota, 22 Indian el-derly have been placed at the Bennett County Nursing Home, lo-cated 52 miles from the Pine Ridge Reservation. Distance and inad-equate transportation can isolate them in an unknown environ-ment away from their families, friends, and tribal communities.Most American Indian elderly wish to remain independent andin their reservation homes. The Community Health Representa-tives program on Pine Ridge Reservation provides home healthcare and personal care services to elderly Indians in their homes.Because of limited funding, this program cannot reach all of thosein need of such assistance. Let me conclude by saying that many advocates for older Indiansare very concerned about the inadequate level of funding for TitleVI of the Older Americans Act. This legislation provides tribal gov-ernments with direct funding for nutrition and supportive services.Since 1980, the amount of funds appropriated for this program hasincreased by only 25 percent, compared to 75 percent for Title III,Parts Cl and C2, which provide funding for congregate and home-delivered meals. Because of the inadequate funding of Title VI, nutrition sites onreservations have been forced to reduce staff, serve fewer elderly,or reduce the number of meals they serve per week. According toNICOA, only one-fourth of the 504 Indian tribes receive Title VIgrants. They are able to serve an average of only 50 percent of theeligible elderly. As a member of the Senate Aging Committee, I believe it is im-portant to examine the special needs of the American Indian elder-ly. I hope that our hearing today will shed more light on better ap-proaches to providing a decent life for American Indian senior citi-zens. This concludes my opening statement. I would like now to call onour first witness. I shall request our witnesses to limit their oralstatements to about 5 minutes. We will put their entire statements5 in the record. It would be very helpful if you could summarize your remarks. Our first witness will be David Merwin of the Bennett County Nursing Home in Martin SD. He will discuss the use of nursing homes by the American Indian elderly. I thank you for being here. TESTIMONY OF DAVID MERWIN, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, BENNETT COUNTY HOSPITAL, MARTIN, SD Mr. MERWIN. I'm the acting administrator of Bennett County Hospital in Martin, SD, and we also have the nursing home con- nected with the hospital. I would like to testify at this time about the Indians in our nursing home. The Bennett County Nursing Home is located at Martin. It's been operating since 1983. It was constructed in-it began construc- tion in 1982. The project was spearheaded by a group of concerned citizens of Bennett County who wanted such a facility built in the county for the elderly. This concern led the voters of Bennett County to the primary election polls June of 1980. Eighty-five per- cent of the people at that time asked for a nursing home at Martin. The concern of the citizens became a reality when the doors were opened in 1983. The home opened to natives of Bennett County who were, at that time, placed elsewhere in nursing homes. Now they could come home. This is exactly what they did when the nursing home in Martin opened: Many of the residents placed else- where, such as Gordon, NE; Kadoka, White River, and Rapid City, came home to live in their own nursing home in Martin. Many of the residents who returned to the Martin area were Indian elderly also. They wanted to be moved closer to their home, which is the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Bennett County Nursing Home is a 50-bed facility and provides two levels of nursing care; skilled and intermediate. Skilled nurs- ing care provides more intensive care of the resident. Of the 50 beds, 8 are for skilled care and 42 for intermediate care. The Ben- nett County Nursing Home is about 45 miles east of the Pine Ridge Agency headquarters and 45 miles west of the Rosebud Agency headquarters. The community of Martin is about the midpoint of the two Indian reservations. From the opening date of the nursing home in September 1983, the majority of the residents in the home have also been-or have always been at least two-thirds Indian. The census of the nursing home on July 13 of this year shows a number of residents, 41 total, of which 27 are native American or Indian, and 14 non-Indian resi- dents. Of the 27 Indian residents, 5 are from Rosebud Indian Reser- vation, the remainder from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Of the 22 Pine Ridge Indian Reservation residents, two are private pay. That means they're responsible for their own expenses while in the nursing home. Of the 14 non-Indian residents, 3 are private pay. The remainder of the residents, or 36, are assisted by the State of South Dakota Title 19 program for long term care. With- out the State assistance, most of our Indian elderly and non-Indian elderly would not be able to live in a nursing home. The services provided by the Bennett County Nursing Home in- clude: 24-hour-a-day professional nursing care, a physician who is a6 specialist in geriatrics, an activities program coordinator, and asocial service program coordinator. The staff of the Bennett County Nursing Home includes 3 nativeAmerican LPN's out of 4 total, 8 Native American nurses aides outof 16, and 1 Native American social service coordinator in an officeof 1. This does not include the other departments in the home.These Native American employees are bilingual and are able tobridge the communication problems experienced by the non-Indian employee. A communications handbook has been established forthe non-Indian employee. A communications handbook has been es-tablished for the non-Indian employees to aid them in communicat-ing with the elderly Indian. The majority of the non-Indian residents are natives of BennettCounty and are comfortable being where they are surrounded bytheir relatives and friends. Whereas, the Pine Ridge and Rosebudelderly do not feel at home at Martin as the transition of moving off the reservation to the Martin Nursing Home deeply affectsthem. Although Martin is very close to the Pine Ridge and Rose-bud Reservation, they feel it is a non-Indian community and theydo not belong there, but would rather be \"home\" on the reserva-tion. The Indian elderly in the home come from seven of the ninePine Ridge Reservation districts. The five Rosebud residents comefrom four of the Rosebud communities. -The referral to the Martin Nursing Home of the Indian residentis usually made by the Department of Adult Services and Aging inPine Ridge or the medical social worker at the Pine Ridge PublicHealth Service Hospital. These referrals are made due to the medi-cal condition of the resident and the inability of the family to pro-vide the proper medical care needed in a home setting.Admitting a family member to the nursing home is a difficultordeal for the non-Indian and the Indian; more so for the Indianresident. Adjustment to the nursing home is more difficult for theIndian as the nursing home environment is a greater change fromthe environment they are accustomed to in their previous entirelife; whereas, the non-Indian resident and their families are morefamiliar with a nursing home setting and its purpose. These non-Indian families may have supported the building of the nursinghome in their community knowing the need was there, whereas theIndian population may have had no previous knowledge of a nurs-ing home and its purpose. The Indian resident's biggest change is food and diet. Duringtheir entire 65 to 70 years they may have never been on a diet, norhave they eaten certain foods that may be a favorite of the non-Indian, such as pizza, sloppy joes, cauliflower, broccoli, Chinese veg-etable blends, barbecue sauce, and Mexican foods. Some of their fa-vorite foods are soup and hot biscuits. They could eat that severaltimes a day or all three meals and be happy with it. They like friedpotatoes with onions, tripe with dried corn and wild turnips, wildberry pudding, and fry bread. With the Indian elderly, the change is extremely difficult. Although they eat their meals in the nursinghome, they often speak of the hunger for their traditional foods.Diets to the Native American are contradictory to their cultureas a thin Indian is considered to be poor or ill. Non-Indian ladyresidents like to have their hair cut and styled, while the Indian7 lady residents not only dislike this but consider it contradictory to their cultural beliefs. Indians do not cut their hair unless there is death in the immediate family. Cutting their hair is a sign of mourning. Due to the overall economic problems of the Indian residents find it difficult to visit the nursing home as often as they wish. The problems expressed by the families is that they do not have the transportation nor the finances to travel to Martin. Whereas, the non-Indian resident is visited frequently by their family due to the fact that they live in the immediate area of the nursing home. Although many of the non-Indians visit the Indian residents, they tend to shy away from them and are usually afraid to speak to them due to their poor English-speaking ability and recognized differences in culture. I'd like to point out some of the activities offered by the Bennett County Nursing Home of the Native American residents and maybe could be used in the development of other nursing homes for the Indian elderly: We introduce them to friends and relatives already in the nursing home and assure them that they are not alone. We assure them immediately that there are Native American staff members who can and will assist them in the area-in any area possible. That their concerns, their needs; and their problems will be addressed by these staff members to the non-Indian staff for solving. Social service coordinator, which is a Native American, corre- lates with the activities director, a non-Indian or a non-Native American. They coordinate activities that the Indian elderly are accustomed to. These activities include mini-powwows at the nurs- ing home at which time families and friends are invited. This activ- ity includes the non-Indians who wish to participate, and the ma- jority of them do. The social service coordinator assists the elderly Indian ladies in making shawls and making headdresses with beads. They encourage their gathering to listen to Indian music togeth- er and reminisce. This is a great inspiration to the Indian elderly. We provide transportation to the respective reservation hosptials for eye appointments and occasional checkups. These checkups at these hospitals are not necessary-are not necessary as the Martin clinic is located in the same building as the Bennett County Hospi- tial. However, an occasional trip is made to give the residents the opportunity to visit their hospital and doctor. The eye appoint- ments are necessary to obtain assistance through the tribal elderly programs to purchase the eyeglasses for the Indian residents. Should a referral be made to the PHS eye doctor, they provide fi- nancial assistance for the Indian elderly, should it be needed. This is not available at Martin. The dietary department of the nursing home prepare special meals for the Indian resident. This consists of beef stew, fry bread and Indian pudding, usually made of wild berries, however, the die- tary department substitutes other fruit when wild berries are not available. During the past two summer months, some of the Native Ameri- can staff members have provided wild berries and turnips to the8 Indian elderly of the home. They comment that eating these foodsrevives them, and it's encouragement for them to go on living for a period of time. However, they believe that they are slowly starving to death because they are not able to eat their own traditional foods on a regular basis. Indian elderly placed in nursing homes off the reservations needmore understanding from the non-Indian staff. The non-Indian staff must be willing to listen and understand the elderly Indian.Provisions must be made to meet their unique and special needs inorder that they may be happy in their last years of their life. These people have come a long way in life and deserve to retain their own traditional values to the end. These are objectives that we arecurrently working on. There's many supporters of our facility at Bennett County.They're the Kyle Senior Citizens Groups at Kyle. Mr. Chissoe Gray,a mental health worker at Pine Ridge Hospital. The H.E.W. Com-mittee of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, and Judge Etta Young-man of the Tribal Courts, Pine Ridge. A nursing home built in the Indian reservation would be a betterplace for the elderly Indian. They would be much happier knowing they are at \"home\" and that they have their families, especiallytheir children, the grandchildren-they are very closely bondedwith their grandchildren-friends, relatives, and homes aroundthem. Communication with reservation news and events is by listening to one of the two radio stations and the Lakota Times newspaper. We conclude our testimony on the elderly Indian at the BennettCounty Nursing Home, and we thank you for this opportunity.Thank. Senator PRESSLER. Thank you very much for that moving descrip-tion of some of the differences in diet and living conditions. I reallyappreciate your testimony. I would like to ask one question. Since it's over 50 miles from thePine Ridge Reservation, do family members, friends, or other tribalmembers visit more often than normal? Would that be the case, or would they visit less often? Mr. MERWIN. Very much less. Distance has a bigger factor to theIndian than the non-Indians in our area. And statistics show in ourfacility that the Indians have family members. visiting much lessthan the non-Indian, who live-who are closer to home. [The prepared statement of David Merwin follows:]9 BENNETT CO. HOSPITAL & NH BOX 70-i MARTIN. SD 57551 07-15-8 SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER UNITED STATES SENATE WASHINGTON, DC 20510 Dear Senator L. Pressler, The following testimony is in response to your letter of invitation dated July 8, 1988. I thank You for. the opoortunity to offer this presentation on behalf of the Bennett County Nursing Home. The Bennett County Nursing Home is located in Martin, South Dakota and has been in operation since September 1. 1983. The construction of the facility was begun in October. 1982. and was built adjacent to the Bennett County Community Ho-pltal. This Project was spearheaded by a group of concerned citizens of Bennett County who wanted such a facility built in the county for their elderly. This concern led the voters of Bennett County to the primary election Dolls on June 3, 1980, at which time 855X of the voters gave their approval on the building of a Nursing Home in Martin. The concern of the citizens became a reality when the doos of the Bennett County NMrsing Home opened to natives of Bennett County who were, at that time. Placed elsewhere in Nursing Homes. Now, they could come home! This is exactly what they did when the Nursing Home in Martin opened. Many of the residents placed elsewhere, such as Gordon, NE, Kadota, White River and Rapid City, came home to live in their own Nursing Home in Martin. Many of these residents who returned to the Martin area were Indian elderly and non-elderly who wanted to be moved closer to their home which was the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Bennett County Nursing Home is a 5 bed facility and providen two levels of nursing care; stilled and intermediate. Stilled nursing care provides more intensive care of the resident. Of the 50 beds, B are for skilled care and 42 for intermediate care.10 The Bennett County Nursing Home is approximately 45 miles east of the Pine Ridge Agency headquarters and an estimated 45 miles west of the Rosebud Agency headquarters. The commuunity of Martin is about the mid-point of the two Indian Reservations. In fact, the community of Martin is adjacent to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. From the opening date of the Nursing Home in September of 1983, the majority of the residents in the home has always been at least two thirds Native American. The census of the Nursing Home on July 13, 1988, shows a number of 41 residents of which 27 are Native American and 14 non-Indian residents. Of the 27 Indian residents. 5 are from the Rosebud Indian Reservation and the remainder from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Of the 22 Pine Ridge Indian Reservation residents, two are private pay (they are responsible for their oan expenses while in the NH). Of the 14 son-Indian residents. 3 are private pay. The remainder of the residents (36' are assisted by the State of South Dakota Title 19 program for Long Term Care. Without the State assistance, most of our elderly, both Indian and non-Indian, would not be able to live in a Nursing Home. The services provided by the Bennett County Nursing Home include; 1) 24 hour professional nursing care; 2) Physician (Special ist in Geriatrics); 3) Activities programs and 4) Social Service programs. The staff of the Bennett County Nursing Home includes 3 native american LPN's out of 4, 8 native american Nurse's Aides out of 16, and I native american Social Service Coordinator office of I. This does not include the other departments in the Home. These Native American employees are bilingual and are able to bridge the communication problems experienced by the non-Indian employee. A communications handbook has been establ ished for the non-Indian employee to aide them in communicating with the elderly Indian. The majority of the non-indian residents are natives of Bennett County and are comfortable being where they are surrounded by their relatives and friends. Whereas, the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian elderly do not feel at home at Martin as the transition of movino off the Reservation to the Martin Nursing Home deeply affects them. Although Martin is very close to the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservation, they feel that it is a non-Indian community and they do11 not belong here but would rather be 'home- on the Reservation. The Indian elderly in the Home come from seven of the nine Pine Ridge Reservation districts. The five Rosebud residents come from four of the Rosebud Communities. The referral to the Martin Nursing Home of the Indian resident is usually made by the Department of Adult Services and Aging in Pine Ridge or the Medical Social Worker at the Pine Ridge Public Health Service Hospital. These referrals are made due to the medical condition of the resident and the inability of the family to provide the proper medical care needed in a home setting. Admitting a family member to the Nursing Home is a difficult ordeal for the non-lndian and the Indian. More so for the Indian resident. Adjustment to the Nursing Home is more difficult for the Indian as the Nursing Home enviroment is a greater change from the environment they are accustomed to in their previous entire life. Whereas, the non-Indian resident and their famil is are more familiar with a Nursing Home setting and its purpose. These non-Indian famil ies may have supported the building of the Nursing Home in their communist, nowing the need whereas the Indian population may have had no previous knowledge of a Nursi n.. hes anc it urpose. The Indian residents biggest change is food and diet. During their entire 70 Years c, they may have never been on a diet nor have they eaten certain foods that may be a favorite of the non-Indian in. pizza, sloppy joes, caul iflower, broccoli, chinese vegtable blends, barbeque sauce and meuican food. Some of their favorite foods are soup and hot biscuits(some could eat this three times a day and be happier than a pig in mud), fried potatoes with unions, tripe with dried corn and wild turnups. wild berry pudding and fry bread. With the Indian elderly, the change is extremely difficult. Although they eat their meals in the nursing home, they often speak of the hunger for their traditional foods. Diets to the Native American is contradictory to their culture as a thin Indian is either considerded to be poor or ill. Non-Indian lady residents like to have their hair cut and styled while the Indian lady residents do not only dislike this but is again contradictory to their cultural beliefs. Indians do not cut their hair unless their is a death in the immediate family. Cutting their hair is a sign of mourning.12 Due to the overall economic problems on the Indian Reservations, the families of the Indian residents find it difficult to visit the Nursing Home as often as they wis h. The problems eupressed by the families is that they do not have the transportation nor the finances to travel to Martin. Whereas, the non-Indian resident is visited frequently by their family due to the fact that they live in the immediate area of the Nursing Home. Although, many of the non-lndians visit the Indian residents, they tend to shy away from them and are usually afraid to speak to them due to their poor Engl i sh speaking abi I i ty and recopn iced differences in cul ture. Some of the activities and services offered by the Bennett County Nursing Home to its Native American residents are; I) Introduce them to friends/relatives already in the Nursing Home and assure them that they are not alone. 2) Assure them immediately that there are Native American staff members who can and will assist them in all area. possible. That their concerns/needs/ problems will be addressed bn these staff members to the non-Indian staff for solving. 3) Social Service Coordinator (native American) correlates with the Activitie Director (Non-lndian) activities that the Indian elderly are accustomed to. These activities include; mini-powwows at the Nursing Home at which time families and friends are invi ted, (this activity includes the non-Indians who wish to participate, majority of them do); 4) Social Service Coordinator assists the elderly Indian ladies in making shawls and making headdresses with beads. 5) Encourage their gathering to listen to Indian music together and reminisce. This is the greatest inspiration to them. 6) Provide transportation to their respective Reservation hospitals for eye appointments and occasional check-ups. The check-ups at these hospitals are not necessary as the Martin Clinic is located in the same building as the Bennett County Hospital. However, an occasional trip is made to give the resident the opportunity to visit their hospital and doctor. The eye appointments are necessary to obtain assistance through the Tribal Elderly Programs to purchase the eyeglasses for the Indian residents. Should a referral be made by the PHS Eye Doctor, they provide financial assistance for the Indian -I13 elderly, should it be needed. This not available at Martin. 7) The dietary department of the Nursing Home prepare special meals for the Indian resident. This consists of beef stew. fry bread and Indian pudding (usually made of wild berries, however, the dietary department substitutes other fruit for the wild berries). During the past two sumner months. some of the Native American staff members have provided wild berries and turnips to the Indian elderly of the Home. They comment that eating these foods is a revival to them and can go on living for a period of time. However, they bel ieve that they are slowly starnino to death because they are not able to eat their own traditional foods on a regular basis. Indian elderly placed in Nursing Homes off the Reservations need more understanding from the non-Indian staff. The non-Indian staff must be willing to listen and understand the elderly Indian. Provisions must be made to meet their unique and special needs in order that they may be happy in their last Years of life. These people have come a long way in life and deserve to retain their own traditional values to the end. The primary supporters of the Indian residents of Bennett County Nursing Home are; I) Kyle Senior Citizens Group, Kyle, SD (Kyle is one of the nine districts on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation). This group of elderly Indians visit the Nursing Home on a monthly basis. They spend an entire afternoon at the Home nisiting, playing bingo with the residents or sometimes have a meal with them. They occasionally bring a drum and the elderly men would sing for the residents. This group also brought Christmas gifts to a11 the residents (Indian and Non-Indian) for the past two years. 2) Mr. Chissoe Gray, (Native American) Mental Health Worker, Pine Ridge Hospital. Mr. Gray has visited the Nursing Home on a weekly basis for the past one and a half years. He visits with the Indian residents and provides the support needed by them. His visits are very encouraging. 3) H.E.W. Commnittee of the 091ala Sioux Tribal Council, during his term of Chairman of this commnittee, Mr. G. Wayne Teplo brought this group of Council Representatives to the Nursing Home to bring gifts to all (Indian and Non-lndian) residents of the Nursing Home and to14 provide a Christmas program for! them. This has been in the past two Years. They also participated in Indian Family Day held during National Hospital and Nursing Home week in May of 19S7. At that time. they donated funds to the Nursing Home to purchase materials for the Indian elderly to utilize in mating projects while in the Nursing Home . 4) Judge Etta Youngman, Oglala Siouu Tribal Courts, Pine Ridge Judge Youngman is aware of the elderly needs on the Pine Ridge Reservation cud ass-its i alI ways possible to ensure that their needs are met. She trusts the professional staff of the Nursing Home to provide the needed medical care for the elderly Indian. Overall, more support from the Tribal governments and entities are needed by the elderly Indian residents in Nursing Homes. A Nursing Home built on the Indian Reservation would be the better place for the elderly Indian. They would be much happier Knowsing that they are at Ihome\" and that they have their famil ies (especially grandchildren, they are very closely bonded with their grandchi Idren), friends, relations and homes around them. Communications with Reservation news and events is by 1 istening to one of the two radio stations. One radio station (KINI) is located on the Rosebud Indian Reservation and the Rosebud residents prefer listening to this station. The other radio station is KILI located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation of which the Pine Ridge residents listen. For those who are able to read, they enjoy the Lakota Times, which tells of any Indian news and happenings. This will conclude this testimony on the elderly Indian at the Bennett County Nursing Home in Martin, SD. Thank you for the opportunity to make this presentation.' Sincerely, David Merwin, Administrator Colene Hemminger, Social Service Coordinator15 Senator PRESSLER. Well, I want to salute you because you're doing good work. My father is in a nursing home over at Salem, SD. He has Alz-heimer's disease. I would like to recognize the dedication of healthcare professionals in South Dakota and across our nation. I thinkyou're a good example of their professionalism, Dave. I can tell bylistening to you how dedicated you are to your patients. We're lucky to have such a person as you working in South Dakota.Let me next call Francis Swift Bird, manager of the Felix S. Cohen Home in Pine Ridge, SD. TESTIMONY OF FRANCIS SWIFT BIRD, DIRECTOR, FELIX S. COHEN HOME, PINE RIDGE, SD Mr. Swivr BIRD. I'm Francis Swift Bird, present director of Felix S. Cohen Home in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. The Cohen Home opened in 1964. It is equipped to serve approxi- mately 44 people. Currently 22 people reside there, and it has hadas many as 30 people living there. It is an independent living facili-ty. It was set up to serve people 60 and over who are able to takecare of themselves. The Cohen Home was funded by H.U.D. They initially providedthe home and food at that time. Later the food allotment wasdropped by H.U.D. Food services now are funded by the Title VIprogram. The operation of the home is funded by rental fees. The standard fee when it was opened was $124 a month for board and room. Wel-fare checks were $139 a month for most clients. Most residents had $9 to $15 spending money for the month. The rent is still $124 amonth because no adjustment has been made to keep up with infla-tion. H.U.D. takes a percentage of the rent, and the home operateson what's left of the rental income. The month of July our rent was $2,422. The H.U.D. percentage was $1,801. Cohen Home takes $717. The director and labor supervisor and head cook are tribal em-ployees. All workers are referred by job services from various pro-gams such as TWEEP, JTPA, WIN, or Green Thumb. At this time we have two security guards, one Green Thumbworking 24 hours a week; and the other security is JTPA, and heworks 40 hours every month; one maintenance man I've had for 4years now. I wish all our laborers were as good as he is. We don'thave any problem with our labor. We got two housekeepers provid-ed by JTPA; and four cooks, one head cook and the other three areWIN workers. What we need most now is six security guards, threemaintenance men, three housekeepers, four cooks, three helpers.That would set our staff in full force. So we'd have a better securi-ty than what we have now. Birthdays are recognized for each resident every month or maybeevery other month. Churches provide a variety of services aboutfour times a week. Lutheran churches from across the country do-nated supplies such as bedding, linen, and soap. The LutheranChurch in Estes Park, CO has been providing Christmas activitiesfor about 12 years.16 Our major problem, the roof has been leaking for the past 4 year. Now I think the money for repairing is about to be released most anytime. We're keeping our fingers crossed for that. The water causes damages to most of our inside living quarters. Here in the past 3 weeks we had to move some of our tenants to dryer rooms. The Senator is talking about water shortages. We have a lot of water there and can pipe it out. One apartment was still running water after 10 hours after the rain we had on Sunday. And my testimony of what I know ends there. So if there's any questions besides that, I'm willing to answer. Thank you. Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you. I would like to ask one question. Since this is an official Senate Aging Committee hearing, I think people reading this record would be curious about your need for six securi- ty guards. What are the conditions or the problems that require your needing security guards? Mr. Swivr BIRD. We have a lot of problems in security. In case of sickness or any thing, we don't have no security during the night. And our-our staff sets up for 50,980 bucks for five laborers. But on account of financial limitations, there's only three of us. I, the director, and the labor supervisor and the head cook are the only three that work. And we have the full staff, to bring us down to $54,600. And that would get Cohen Home a security through the night taking care of the older people because they need security. So they're there because they call that home, a home which they want safe. Because we have a lot of drinking problem here, and we've got a lot of visitors any hour of the night. And a lot of these tenants lose radios and stuff because they break in and stole stuff. So our security is our biggest problem. And our cooks. Cooks go to powwows, and they don't leave the other cooks notice. Then we're a meal short sometimes. We have later meals. So that's it. Mr. PRESSLER. Good. Thank you. My staff member, Herbert Weiss, has given me an announce- ment from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) concerning a $122,000 grant recently approved by HUD to repair the leaky roof of the Felix S. Cohen Home. That's a very much needed improvement. This is very good news. Francis, I hope this emergency funding will help you solve one of your problems. I next call on Geraldine Janis. She is the director of the Sioux Tribe's Community Health Representative Program of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Geraldine, thank you for your testimony today and what you've done. TESTIMONY OF GERALDINE JANIS, DIRECTOR, OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH REPRESENTATIVE PROGRAM, PINE RIDGE RESERVATION, SD Ms. JANIS. Senator Pressler, I'm honored to have this opportuni- ty to present testimony before your committee. My name is Geraldine Janis. I'm the director of the Oglala Sioux Tribe's Community Health Representative Program of the Pine Ridge Indian reservation.17 Since March 1965 a program for indigenous health workers was initiated on our reservation because it was obvious for a long period of time that health service to the Oglala, Lakota people has been inadequate reservation wide. I have worked with this pro- gram first as a team leader and then as the program director. I feel honored to be here to present the views of the community Health Representatives and myself concerning the elderly clients we contact as part of our duties. There are Community Health Rep-resentatives assigned to each of the nine districts on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The major purpose of the Community Health Representative Program is to assist Indian families in improving their overall health by providing preventative health education and services as well as treatment within the realm of their training. The Community Health Representatives work in six categories of health areas. These are general health, dental health, gerontologi- cal health, maternal and child health, mental health, and environ- mental health care. I will address the gerontological care category in reply to the in- formation requested in the letter of invitation to this hearing. I got my papers mixed up. Again I want to thank you. I will submit my written statement to the record. Thank you.

A Nursing Home or elderly housing complex is needed here at Pine Ridge. One that keeps the elderly close to their culture and traditions. Many of the elderly who belong to the Grey Eagle Soci.ety enjoy their meetings, activities, pow-wows, traditional feeds,22 spiritual ceremonies and all participate with enthusiasm. They cannot le taken away frawi this because this is the life they know. When the elderly Indian can no longer stay at home it seers th t the circle of family unity is broken and that the elderly's spirit gets broken. He or she usually dies from lonoli- noss in somo Nursing Home in foreigr surroundings. s. How do Community Hezlth Representatives interact with families?

Thank you very much, Geraldine. Next, we'll hear from Iyonne Garreau, who's driven a great distance to attend today's field hearing. I've talked to her numerous times over the years. She's the director of the Sioux Nation Commission on Aging. I know of your excellent work. Thank you very much for being here. We look forward to hearing your testimony. TESTIMONY OF IYONNE GARREAU, DIRECTOR, SIOUX NATION COMMISSION ON AGING Ms. GARREAU. In the spirit of unity and peace do I testify today on behalf of the elderly of the Sioux Nation. I wish to thank Sena- tor Pressler for inviting me to share our concerns regarding our highly respected elders. For those of you that I'm unfamiliar to, and that's very few, I am Iyonne Garreau. And I'm from Cheyenne River. I'm the chairper- son for the Sioux Nation Commission on Aging. For 14 years I've served as a project director for the Cheyenne River Elderly Nutri- tion Services Program. So I've been involved with the elderly for a long time. Right now I have lost my mom and dad, my parents who I miss very much. The Sioux Nation Commission on Aging was formed in 1986 to provide a forum for our elders to communicate their needs. The Commission is representative of 11 Sioux Tribes in South and North Dakota and Nebraska.-- Our primary concern today is Title VI of the Older Americans Act. Although Title VI was established in the 1978 amendments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of American Indian elders on Indian reservations, adequate funding was never provided to carry out the intent of Congress. To date, 10 years later, Title VI is still underfunded. It is true, the Indian elders are among the forgotten population, not by his own people, but by the Federal Government, which has a trust obligation not only to serve Indian tribes, but also to target services toward the vulnerable and needy among that population. No ethnic subgroup or age category better fits that description than the American Indian elderly. They are indeed among those inthe greatest economic and social need. I call to your attention the findings of Congress. Section 611.(a) The Congress finds that the elder Indians of the United States, number 1 are a rapidly increasing population. Number 2, suffer from high unem- ployment. Number 3, live in poverty at a rate estimated to be as high as 61 percent. Number 4, have a life expectancy between 3 and 4 years less than the general popu-lation. Number 5, lack of sufficient nursing homes, other long-term facilities, and other health care facilities. Number 6, lack sufficient Indian areas agencies on aging. Number 7, frequently live in substandard and overcrowded housing. Number 8, receive less than adequate health care. Number 9, are served under this Title,that's Title VI, at a rate of less than 19 percent of the total national Indian elderly population living on Indian reservations. And number 10, are served under Title IIIat a rate less than 1 percent of the total participants under that Title. I have seen the grandmothers and grandfathers of our people personally sacrifice their monthly pensions for the simple needs of their grandchildren because of an economic circumstance that plagues the Native Americans. I ask you, is this the kind of treat- ment that is bequeathed a legacy of a once proud spirited people?24 The crisis worsens each day, and little help comes from a President who wants to \"humor\" the Natives. I now refer to the 1987 amendments, our concerns per title. Senator Pressler, do I have to read those or should I just-- Mr. PRESSLER. I have them here. Ms. GARREAU. Okay. Mr. PRESSLER. It might be good to highlight the titles. Ms. GARREAU. Title I we have really identified none. Title II we're talking about the 1987 amendments. This is lawright now. We're having a problem implementing some of these things right now. Title 1, we asked for an Indian associate commis- sioner. We want this person to be Indian and fully empowered to act and implement remedial actions and programs. Number 2, the Federal Council on Aging. We need to have an Indian representative on that board. This is what we ask. Number 3, Inter-Agency Task Force. We need to include Indian tribes and non-Federal Aging organizations. Right now theIndian-or the Inter-Agency Task Force is being limited to Federal agencies. And we need people from the tribes, the people from the grass root level, people who have been working in the field withthe Indian elders. We need those kinds of people at the top repre- senting us. That's the only way we're going to get anything done. Title III, we need our Title III and Title VI to get all these little service areas. We've got one goal in mind. We need to get out there and provide the money so that all the elders are served the waythat's the intent of Congress. That's all we're asking is that every- body get out. And the money is there, the intent is there. Let's-let's do a good job. Indian contractors, these are coming again from the locality tothe-to the national levels, because I do represent another board on the national level. But we need Indian contractors. We don't have any right now. Title VI, of course, is where I'm coming from. There needs to be an increase in funding. Not only in fiscal year 1988 but with a sup- plemental appropriation to bring Title VI to its fully authorized ap-propriation-authorized level of $13.7 million. But the Sioux Nation Commission on Aging feels that the fiscal year 1989 appro-priation should be increased to the authorized level of 16.2 million. Most of these were just summarized. If Mr. Pressler-Larry. Mr. PRESSLER. Larry. Ms. GARREAU. Senator Pressler, you're going to be on our mail- ing list. And if indeed you want pages and pages of what we've done over the last 3 years, I'd be most happy to send them to you. Mr. PRESSLER. Good. Ms. GARREAU. In summary, I guess I'm saying, come join with me and sincerely in our sincere task of caring for the elderly- become very sincere in our task. I thank you. Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you very much for that moving testimony.It's very important to hear your concerns. They will become an im-portant part of the record. I now call on Elaine Quiver of the Foster Grandparent Program in Pine Ridge. Her topic is the Foster Grandparent Program. Ms. QUIVER. I thank you very much.25 TESTIMONY OF ELAINE QUIVER, DIRECTOR, FOSTER GRANDPARENT PROGRAM, PINE RIDGE, SD Ms. QUIVER. I think you all know me, the people that live in PineRidge. I think even the Cheyenne River people know who I am.I like to-the first thing I'd like to do is express my appreciationfor letting Senator Pressler speak to our needs and concerns andfeelings of our Lakota people. I think one of the Foster-as a Foster Grandparent Director onthe Pine Ridge Reservation for the last 10 years I really don't needto express the problems and the needs that we have here. Because,as elderly, you have known to share the problems that we havehere. But we do need to tell Senator Pressler the concerns and thefeelings that we have pertaining to our existence here in PineRidge. A lot of times it seems like we're never heard by anyoneother than ourselves or each other. I think \"The Forgotten Popula-tion\" is very appropriate for this hearing. Maybe this isn't the only time that Senator Pressler will comehere. I would like to invite him back and have him send a team toaudit some of these programs and to see if they're really filtereddown to our elderly and their needs. Because I think most of thetime the money is intended to be providing a basic human needhere on the reservation. And sometimes I think we-it hasn'treached our elderly. And I think maybe times have come-maybetoday is a good day to say that we need Senator Pressler to hearthe testimonies that is really needed and drastically needed here inPine Ridge. I think it was last week that I read on KILI my testimony toSenator Pressler. And he has my written testimony. And I don'timagine I need to read it again because you all know how I feel.And instead of my reading my testimony again, I would like toshare my time with some of the people that are here that wouldlike to give their testimony to Senator Pressler. The first person I'd like to ask time for is Frank Marshall. I'dlike to have him come up and say a few words because he's ourfifth member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and I'm sure he is aware ofour needs for the elderly. [The prepared statement of Elaine Quiver follows:]26 A STATEMENT or THE FOSTER GRANDPARENT PROGRAM PREPARED BY ELAINE QUIVER, DIRECTOR TEE AMERICAN INDIAN ELDERLYt THE FORGOTTEN POPULATION' HEARINm BEFORE THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING JULY 21, 1988 PINE RIDGE, SOUTH DAROTA The first thing I would like to do is, to express my appreciation for this opportunity to speak to you on the needs, concerns and feelings of of my Lakota Oyate (the society of people known as Sioux). My name is Elaine Quiver. I am a Lakota women from Pine Ridge, South Dakota. I am the Foster Grandparent DireoLor here on the Pine PNidge Indian Reservation for the past ton years, although the program has existed for 16 years. Today, I am going to express the needs and problems that we have on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. This does not mean that I am here to complain or to ask for sympathy for those of us that live here. It is not naccocary to go begging for my People, because we are here with set laws and federal regulations. Tradition- ally, age and experience have been vital and dynamic parts of the Oglala Sioux Way of life. Oglala Sioux elders were held in high regard, listened to, honored, and included in the on-going life of the Indian community. With the coming of a more complex society, the elders were expected to become spectators to the drama of life, not participants. Their place had been lost, their voices ignored. Simultaneously, a lois of tribal and cultural values among children and the youth be- came evident, creating a spiritual and moral vacuum. Implementation of the Foster Grandparent Progran in 1972 began to fill the void for some 150 children who were apathetic, disinterested and involved with various types of drugs/antisocial behavior. Indian society has become even more complex and technical, children and youth with exceptional needs are more readily indentified and a realization that older people can provide a meaningful service to greater numbers of children with special necdc, by advice, covnsel, extra parental love and knowledge has emerged. Since 1972, the project Foster Grandparent has been implemented on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The first six years were sponsored by the Oglale Sioux Tribal government, then the tribal governamnt let the roster Grandparent Program be implemented and maintained by non-profit board of directors. The Pnster Grandparent Program on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation have been budgeted for 44 volunteers. These volunteers have been a highly valuable factor to the special and exceptional children, However, certain elements in the project need to be resolved 1. Transportation --Geographic isolation coupled with shortage of transportation cause hardship. --Volunteer stipends do not currently keep up with the cost of living. --Lack of equipment on existing buses to handle handicapped. --more funding and local planning.27 --Uniform cut-rate cost for eaniors set by national legislation. --Great concern over lack of transportation in rural areas -Better design of buses for elderly and handicapped, including easier access of boarding and disembarking, adequate cooling and heating. --Car insurance discrepencies against elderly should be investigated. --Need for reimbursement to transport volunteers by host aqencies. 2. Older American voluntearism --Need more funding in Pine Ridge to use more elderly in schools. --Volunteer stipends do not currently keep up with cost of living expenses. --Like to see action emphasize SCP as valuable way to foster in- dependence of older Americans. --Lack of proper office space. --waiver for 105 match, because of being a reservation, meet programs are operated on federal funds. --Need support from local governmental entities support in tribal county and state. 3. Legal assistance, advocacy, legislation --Priority and drastically need lawyer for the Pine Ridge Indian elderly to interpet regulations and be a legal counsel. --Unbiased official (federal government representative) stationed locally to represent older persons. --Senior citizens to represent older citizens at all local legislative meetings. --Groups of senior citizens to promote housing rights, etc. --Any committees established to represent 'aging issues should include 0S older persons. --legislatures (tribal, federal and state) should coordinate efforts to assist elderly. --Need for simpler language in legal contracts. --Need to change elderly 85I decrease in summer months instead of winter, which, stems from annual individual land owner lease. --Need a congressional hearing or audit of all programs including employment, existing personnel regulations in tribal, federal and state. --Voting assistance given and information about alternative ways of voting should be made available to all elderly and handicapped individuals. 4. Social Services- --Increase number, funding of senior centers. --More recreational and social activities. --Need for more homemaker services. --Need to directly contract aging programs. --Need for bilingual office on aging on the reservation. --'Help' telephone lines for elderly. -Audit the existing programs to assess the needs. 5. Health Care and Maintenance- --Increased aid needed through revision of Medicare and Medicaid (more flexible guidelines, simplifications of forms to expedite processing). --More home health services in order to help elderly stay in own homes longer through public health nurses, community health representatives.28 --Homemaker and chore services expanded. --Great concern over high cost of quality medical care. --Pine Ridge Oglala elderly need a good doctor for the elderly. --Need a skilled nursing home. --Nursing home care seen as too expensive; should increase in-home oars services. --Up-grade nursing care for elderlyl motivate by offering scholar- ships and other monetary incentives for students and trainees in this field. --Family training for home health care. --Burial insurance should be researched. --More emphasis on preventative health oars through self-help programs and education. --Widows on low-income should be bleb to draw Medicare, Medicaid benefits at age 60. --Revise Medicare, Medicaid to cover: optical (glasses, lens) dental (dentures) proscriptions (more complete coverage) chiropractic services --Increase availability of exercise programs to enhance older persons mobility cardiovascular abilities, over-all self concept. --More hospices needed. 6. Nutrition --More home delivered meals advocated; feel that federal subsidizing of program would allow more nutritious meals. --Food stamp program should be expanded for seniors based on need (not financial) basis due to special diets often required by patient's physician. --carry-outs should be available to senior volunteers. 7. Adequate Retirement Income --social Security payments should keep pace with inflation; current benefits of Social Security not adequate. --change in Supplemental Security Income guildelines needed. 9. Housing --Better design homes for elderly. --More low-rent housing units to be built: filled by formula based on need rather than date of application. --Use of unneeded school buildings (or other available houses) as facilities to moet elderly's needs -one or two bedroom units and etc. --License boarding houses for elderly. 9. Employment --Increase in employment agencies devoted to placing older people in jobs (50-60 years of age). --More part-time employment opportunities for elderly. --Plan and development of a craft market by elderly artists.29 --Training programs for ages 50-60 years of age. 10. Minority Elderly --Ways to assure adequate share of rsources, end attention to redress the imbalances which still persist among minority elderly who suffer multiple jeopardies. --Share expenses, housing and daily travel. -Retirmsnt end nursing homes on reservations. 11. Crime, ebandonment, and abuse --Vulnerability of elderly to criminal actions and general fear it causes within them as group. --Better neighborhood security. -Restitution of elderly victims. --Prevention programs should be instituted and increased. --Enforce existing laws and codes. 44 volunteers are stationed in one pediatric ward, 11 headstarte, 4 parent/child centers and 10 schools. They have provided one-to-one service to 150 children. Many positive goals were achieved such as encouraging the children to participate in classroom activities, help the children maintain their daily basic human needs. The Foster Grandparent volunteers have maintained their traditional Indian values and their cultural heritage. The Foster Grandparents philosophy is to have the children identify themselves as being a descendent of a Lakota with the traditional values and culture, by doing so, a child will be contented and grow into the bi-cultural world as we are today. The Foster Grandparent Program has enhanced the elderly to participate in activities with the youth. The Foster Grandparent Program has maintained a well balanced programmatic system and has been audited twice. The audits were good with no question on cOsts. (Copies are included in this testimony). Being the only all Indian Foster Grand- parent Program in South Dakota has made our project unique. Two national directors have visited our project in Pine Ridge in 1985, 1986 and 1987. We are honored to have an all Indian Foster Grand- parents program with the richness in Lakota values and traditional culture. Although, there are over 1,700 people on the Pine Ridge Indian aeser- vation who are 60 years of age and over, the Pine Ridge Reservation also has 6,808 youngsters under the age of 16 years old. Due to extreme unemployment of all workers on the Pine Ridge Reservation, a rate of 97t older people are not priority for employment and job training programs offered under tribal jurisdiction. In addition 70t of all reservation household, have an income of under $3,500, with elderly income even more diminished. Furthermore, because of the nature of unemployment sad isolated counities of the general population manpower needs within the reservation, especially for transmitting inforeation and up-dated regulations, or availability of immediate employment. Because of the severe elements on the Pine Ridge Raser- vation, basic human needs are rendered by the Foster Grandparents. 89-721 -89 -230 TESTIMONY OF FRANK MARSHALL, FIFTH MEMBER, OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE Mr. MARSHALL. Thank you, Elaine. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, Ladies and Gentle- men, my name is Frank Marshall. I am a fifth member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. And on behalf of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to present testimony on the vital issue of the needs of our elderly. The term \"Forgotten Americans\" is sometimes used when dis- cussing the American Indian. In actuality it's more appropriate for those over 65 years old. No other group is more forgotten when it comes to employment, housing, social services, and so forth. Being old means many things. It means a slow deterioration of what you once were. It means having to eke out an existence on $183 a month on Social Security or perhaps $211 on State welfare. For many of the elderly, living in a substandard house is a way of life, with no running water or electricity. Health care is minimal, with Indian Health Service hampered by funding constraints. A news article recently stated that Congress appropriated $13 million for economic development for the country of Ireland. This is a country where the Catholics and Protestants are waging war against each other and many people have been hurt because of this. Had this money been used at home, perhaps some of it could have reached our \"Forgotten Americans.\" On the Pine Ridge Reservation, there exists only one Old Age re- tirement home. This is the Cohen Home, which is supported in part by the Tribe. A second home is located in Martin, SD, and this one is for anybody who needs the care these facilities offer. Living in these facilities has sometimes been compared to the convicted people living on \"Death Row\". In both instances, the end result is the same, you are only waiting to die. The people who draft Federal legislation and are responsible for most of the language in bills need to get in touch with the realities of life in Indian country. Some legislation that has been enacted seems to be directed toward those who can least afford to comply with the law. An example of this is that any income received by a welfare or Social Security recipiant, regardless of the circum- stances, would be used to offset the individual's monthly check. On the Pine Ridge, this means that once a year an elderly person may receive $200 to $300 in lease money, but because of the regulations, their monthly check is withheld until the offset is equaled. Perhaps much needed household items could have been bought with the extra money, but knowing that they won't be getting next month's check, they have to use this money for their necessities. There are many needs; and I will attempt to outline what should be done to meet the needs of our elderly. In the housing area, inadequate funding makes it impossible for the elderly to be assisted in improving the substandard homes they are now living in. The present programs must be continued and more funds made available by Congress. This would include both retirement homes and assistance in renovating those homes which are now in need of repair.31 Energy assistance: It's vital that during the winter months that additional funds be made available to the elderly to help them pay their heating bills. Meals for the Elderly: This program provides the only nutritious meal that most of the elderly receive on a daily basis. It struggles along with limited funds, yet manages to reach most of its targeted areas. Better kitchen equipment is needed at most serving sites; and what little they have is old and in need of repair. Health care: Diabetes is rampant among the American Indians today, and this is especially so amongst the elderly. Many of our diabetics have to undergo dialysis treatment and must travel 50 to 100 miles one way to receive this treatment. The Indian Health Service is unable to expand their dialysis program to the outer parts of the reservation. Elderly on set incomes can ill afford the expense for travel for the treatment. Funds need to be made avail- able so an expansion can be done to meet this priority need. I have touched only the tip of the iceberg with the issues that I have listed. I am aware that there is no easy solution for the prob- lems that face our elderly. Elderly program funding must not be decreased and must be increased to be effective. The present pro- grams are merely band-aids applied to a large wound, and it is simply not enough. In summation, gentlemen, we need to work together to upgrade the programs that serve our elderly. The problem is not restricted to the reservation, although the problems are more evident here. It is not a Republican or Democratic problem, but it is a serious and deadly one that needs our combined attention. We, as Americans, should not let this problem get out of hand in this, the richest country in the world. I thank you for your attention. Ms. QUIVER. Thank you, Frank. I'd like to have also Chief Oliver Red Cloud give a testimony on behalf of our elderly. TESTIMONY OF CHIEF OLIVER RED CLOUD, CHAIRMAN, EIGHT RESERVATION OF OLD PEOPLE Mr. RED CLOUD. Thank you, Elaine. (The Lakota language was spoken at this time.) We have come here to see-hear some of our problems. And I'll be sitting there listening to some of the young people talk and what their problem is now today. In our reservation I work with the older people and the tribal council and the superintendent and eight reservation. I'm chairman of eight reservation of old people. And I hear a lot of problems, Indian problems in all the reserva- tion and especially here. And what these young people tell you today, it's what happened today. And we have a lot of problem. We could sit here and talk to you all day. But I don't think like the old people say, \"Chief from Washington come here, and we talk to our problems with him. They've never done nothing.\" Now here we are in 50 years under their tribal government. And on the other side we have a treaty, and through that they're supposed to take care of us. And today, I don't see that happening. And I've been working hard for the generation that's coming, and there's some more coming. And there's no future for them32 today, nothing. I don't see nothing today. That's why we have allthese problems that the Indian Bureau promises to take care of.And I don't think it never work. And I didn't see it working today.That's why we're here. The people here tell you about-they have a paper here to read. I don't do that. I come in my mind. And I work hard for thesepeople here as a chief. And they're going-you're going to hear some more-some oftheir problem. And I hope you go back and see some of these hereand look at your Indian people in this country. We are the firstAmerican in this country here, and we still have problem, allkinds. There's no future for the generation that's coming. So that'sall I have to say. And I hope you do something about it. Thank youvery much. Ms. QUIVER. This will conclude my time here. It's limited. But I do want Senator Pressler to come again in the near future and dosome of the research that needs to be done on this existence of ourelderly, not only here, but in all the other reservations. We should have more input in what goes on in Washington to setregulations and policies that affect all the people, not just the met-ropolitan areas. And I'm really glad that you came back. I'veknown you for a long time. And I think you know that we do needyour help. And you-at one time, you were a very liberal. I thinkyou need to get back to be flexible to meet our needs. Thank you.Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you very much. I think your testimony isexcellent, and I really appreciate it. Let me respond to your point that Federal funds sometimes aremisspent, and of the need for audits. On the one hand, many indi-viduals advise giving block grants to States and to Indian reserva-tions and letting them spend the money on their own. Some of themoney can then be misspent. On the other hand if we have Federal audits, with that wouldcome Federal control. We would like to avoid that. But if neces-sary, it will be done. Those are some of the dilemmas we face.If you have more Federal control, you may have less money mis-spent. But if you have a block grant, then you run into the problemof money being misspent. This is a good point we must address.Next we have Vernon Ashley from Pierre, who is a good friendof mine. Vernon is one of our most distinguished senior citizens inthe State. He has been to my home. My wife, who couldn't be heretoday, thinks a lot of him. We all do. I think he's been an adviserto four or five South Dakota Governors, maybe more.Vernon's been a Senior Citizen Intern in my office. Each year, asenior citizen from South Dakota spends time in my office to adviseme on legislative issues I must consider on the Senate Special Com-mittee on Aging. I really appreciate his being here today to testify. So with that introduction, I now call on Vernon Ashley. TESTIMONY OF VERNON ASHLEY, PIERRE, SD, PAST STATE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, ACTION Mr. ASHLEY. Thank you, Senator Pressler, and to the SpecialCommittee on Aging. My name is Vernon Ashley. I'm now retired33 after 34 years of service. But in that time I think I've gained a knowledge, and I'd like to share my views with you. I understand that my topic is supposed to be those services which are available in communities throughout South Dakota or in the Dakotas. You know, it's-it is especially fashionable to be aging, especially for us who are elder members of the tribe. I say this because throughout the years of living, we have gained a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience. And I say this to my former Foster Grandpar- ents because I was a State Program Director of ACTION. Because, as I said, they have acquired a knowledge and can leave this with the younger generation. So you've got a world of that knowledge in your hands that you should leave before you leave this earth. But with that, the young people today would just cher- ish the ability to know just what you know. And with this experi- ence and knowledge, we could do something for ourselves as well. As you can see my white hair, I am a senior citizen. I was Senator Pressler's intern in 1987. Now in my 14 years experience as a State Director of ACTION, the Federal agency for volunteers service for North and South Dakota, I had the opportunity to see those services that are avail- able to the senior citizens of America. Most of my projects were in white communities or Caucasian communities, and I could go to Dickinson, Mandan, or Fargo or Sioux Falls or Rapid, Aberdeen, any one of them. And if you want to visit a senior citizen center where there is really an activity, you should visit there because all of the benefits of the Older Americans Act are available here. I always talk about Huron because it's closer. And if you go to the Huron Senior Center, you'll go in there, you'll find every office in there is set up to help the elderly. And that may be transportation, that may behealth matters, that may be helping to-help you with your income tax preparation, arts and craft, or just fellowship, playing cards and games and visiting and stuff like this. But that s in these programs I administered through ACTION, the older Americans volunteer programs. Now I'm sorry to say that I only have one program on the reser- vation. That's the Foster Grandparent Program here on the Pine Ridge. And I want to linger on that point, Senator, for a while be- cause I think the needs of the elderly on the reservation are just as important as any other community in the Nation. The things that ACTION programs could help are the Senior Companion. Senior Companion programs are like the Foster Grandparent Program. They are paid a small hourly wage for 20 hours a week to help other senior citizens who need-who are dis- abled or they're shut in or handicapped. And if you got another able-bodied senior citizen to help them, it would prolong their life a lot longer. And without nursing homes available, I think a Senior Companion could really help. And I know what they're going to say. ACTION is going to say, \"We only have a limited amount of dollars, and the Dakotas al- ready have too many of those programs in proportion to their popu- lation, you know. And I agree. Our population in the Dakotas is really low put together. I guess we're a little over a million, a mil-34 lion two, in there. But still we keep a lot of our senior citizens inthe Dakotas. So therefore I think the Congress should take another look atthis and say, \"We got to work up a little better ratio so we canhelp the elderly who stay in the Dakotas, especially the elderly onthe reservation.\" Most of us stayed. You know, we stay on the res-ervation, so the problem stays there. And I think that s one Feder-al agency that could do something is ACTION. As a former Statedirector, I say this. And the other point is, like the Foster Grandparent, when it wasestablished in 1972, for the first 6 years it was administered by theOglala Sioux Tribe. Well, there were problems in that time in ad-ministering the programs because of misuse of funds and some-thing, so ACTION lost about $13,000 in the process.But after they became a nonprofit corporation and had their ownBoard of Directors, it began to continue. We had one director. Ms.Quiver's been there for 10 years, and she's continued to maintainthis program. I think that most of our programs-ACTION is goingto tell you, \"Well, we'd like to put a program there, but we don'thave a decent sponsor.\" Well, I think we can establish thesethrough nonprofit corporations which could be under Federal law.Because then when we have more Foster Grandparents, moreSenior Companions, we could then secure another important item:transportation. I've-in my testimony I submitted to you, I elabo-rated and explained why I say this, because here we cover greatdistances. Just to come here today, I came and stayed overnight atMartin and I came here this morning. But just a tribal drive onthis reservation alone it takes a few hours to get from one end tothe other. Well, if the tribes would incorporate, they could incoporate on aState and Federal law, get a contract number, and then apply it tothe GSA, General Services Administration, the GSA, which hasbuses. I was just looking them over the other day. And why I saythe GSA is because they got a built-in maintenance system. Andyou know, as you see out here, the garages are far and few be-tween. So if you had the General Services Administration, itwould-they would be a better system of control and maintenanceand so forth. And then it would provide the transportation to ourelderly. There is no reason under the sun why the senior citizens of PineRidge can't come to the State legislature, to visit there for a day,you know, like all the other senior citizens, like in Aberdeen,Huron, Mitchell, Sioux Falls. Bus loads come in there just to wit-ness to see what's going on with the South Dakota Legislature orsome type of meetings with the Governor. Our elderly should dothe same thing. But without transportation that's pretty difficult.I guess that's-I'll get off of those programs. But I want to-Ihave elaborated on all these things. Now a lot of our programs ofACTION are the Retired Senior Volunteer programs. But we can'texpect the elderly to volunteer when they're already in a lowincome bracket. So the RSVP would not be a fitting program onthe reservation. But I think that Foster Grandparents should beexpanded, the Senior Companion should be expanded.35 I think a better system of transportation should be provided to our elderly on the reservation. We should develop on our reserva- tion-and I'm trying to help my tribe develop a multipurpose center where you can have all these things that I've witnessed throughout the country and throughout the Dakotas. And at Crow Creek, why, they think the senior center is just to have meals. They're only open a few hours a day. They'll go get the seniors, feed them a meal, take them home. They should be able to stay there and do other things, you know, socialize. They can- they've got a lot of ability in making of craft. I've got two of my relatives who are now making star quilts on the Crow Creek and doing a beautiful job. And they can sell those things for a pretty good price and supplement their income. And I want to say that the non-Indian community is interested in our Indian elderly. At Crow Creek somebody-they said they didn't know who gave them a big television set. It's-it's probably a 24 inch that they can watch and they can even play videotapes, you know, or VCR I guess they call them. And we-my wife and I, we got sewing machines and tables and stuff like that for the senior center so they're active and they're producing. But more needs to be done. Because somehow they're scared to death of a corporation. You know, they'll say, \"My gosh, oh, you're going to be responsible, and you may get sued.\" So there are mis- conceptions about a nonprofit corporation. And I'm an advocate of the corporate structure. So I think that that is the two that we, as Indian people, should realize we could use of our own benefit. And I want to tell you and end by saying I appreciate the oppor- tunity, Senator, and I wish that all the congressional delegates of South Dakota would have Senior Citizen Interns in Washington be- cause my week spent in Washington in 1987 was real beneficial be- cause you see other interns throughout the country, and you find that-well, there was just hundreds of us. It was really an interest- ing experience. And it gave me the opportunity to speak up in terms of senior citizens of South Dakota and the elderly Indians as well. And I thank you for this opportunity. [The prepared statement of Vernon Ashley follows:]36 TESTIMONY TO T-rHE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON ACINiG JULY 21. 19088 By Ver-non L. Amhlny Ladies end Gentlemen of this special Committee on Aging. It Is e privilege to have this opportunity to express my views and to aey that iis fashionable to be a senior citizen aspecialiy of the American Indian res. There ore many of the younger generatlorn who cherish the thought of gain- Ing the knowledge we have attained through the yeers of living, becuse we ere the remants of a greet race. and in our midst there ara many who have gained the knowledge. experience. and ability to do something In our own behalf. Later In my statement reference will be made as to why we need to utilize such capabilities that are available on or near reservations. On the other hand pertinent informdtion relevant to the benefits contained In the Older Americans Act need to be propagated In American Indian communitiee. end this Committee would be surprised to find whet little In known about O A A benefits on our Indian reservations. In my fourteen years experience as the State Program Director of ACTION for North and South Dakota, I worked with a considerable number of Senior Centers, plus their Advisory Councils, and I had the opportunity to witness the full use of benefits made avellable by the Older Americans Act. In a comparative way a very limited number of Older American Volunteer Programs of ACTION are Implemented on Indian Reservationa, and the American Indian elderly would greatly benefit from the Senior Companion Progrm, In two ways. First due to the complete lack of nursing home facilities on reaerva- tions, Senior Companions could ease the remaining years of those handicapped or disabled elderly In their own homes. Secondly, a majority of the able- bodied Indian elderly would qualify to be a Senior Companion volunteer. because they meet ACTIONs low-income requirement. Furthermore Congress can emend the criteria for the Foster Grendparent program. by permitting Foster Crandparent volunteers on Indian Reservations to msist other Indian elderly, We have one Foster Grandparent Program on en Indian reservation. and that is on the Pine Ridge Sioux Indian Reservation In southwestern South Dakota, and there were occasions when ACTION's Denver, Regional Office tried to terminate the program. because it did not operate like Ito metropolitan counterparts. I hope that Committee Members will bear In mind that the mores. customs. folkways and lifestyle of a metropolitan area. and that of an Indian reservation era distinctly different. Therefore, this Committee should make recommendations to the United States Congress to amend the law; so that programs already Initiated by the Congrees could be implemented In Indian country. ACTION should be required to evaluate how these Older American Volunteer Programs operate on one raeervetion to the other, and not In comparison to a metropolitan or caucasian community. Another ACTION program that could be helpful to the American Indian elderly on the reservations Is the Volunteer in Service to America program. as special volunteere could be recruited from a national area. and In that manner needed ekilrs to develop end Implement projects for the elderly cen be Initiated. The reason for such Volunteers is that the administrative and37 developmental skills are needed from an outside eource. It Is my contention that Peace Corps volunteers should be made available to Indian Reservations. In this manner the Peace Corps volunteer can serve for a longer period of time, and there Is a dire need to have continuity to properly Implement such programs. I contend that our Indian reservations qualify for Peace Corps services. From e legal standpoint the American Indian qualifies because the United States Government m-de treaties with the Tribes as sovereign nations. It would seem feasible for the United States Congress to direct this country's tax revenues toward the solution of problems plaguing communities within the confines of America, and the assistance would be appreciated. I highlight the foregoing programs because there would be no need to enact new laws to accomplish assistance to American Indian reservations where the eIderly stay sa long es possible. This Committee needs to evaluate the programs. being administered by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. es the eid Bureau needs to streamline Its services. Such programs as the General Assistance welfare program has created a dependent society. I egree that it Is needed when It pertains to the disabled, handicapped or the elderly. plus those who cannot work. It should be discontinued for those of a younger age category. We are concerned ebout the senior citizens of the Amaricon Indian population. and the funds allocated by the Congreas should be _anarked for the senior citizen populition. to build large adequate facilities that can be used for servicas for the elderly. The Congress should require the Bureau of Indian Affairs to direct more resources end staff tow\"rd the specific welfare of the Americen Indian elderly. I have referenced my experience in working with Senior Centers throughout the Dakotas, end I would like to linger on the subject for a moment. Through ACTION I had Retired Senior Volunteers working and assist- Ing In different categories of senior programs. Almost onehundred percent of my programs were In caucasian communities. end in these Senior Centes there was transportatlon for the elderly, depending on the size of the community there may be more then one mini-bus; handicraft was produced by the elderly and marketed out of the Senior Center; health progrems to monitor blood pressure, etc. were available: balanced diets were provided In a plessant atmosphere: plus fellowship In a card room, pool for the men: and each month birthday recognition program ware held. Now let us reference an Indian reservation whereohey are lucky to have a meals progr m. The elderly mey or may not be trap4orted to the meal eitse a meal-is provided, and then they are transported back to their homes soon after. It seems there is very little Interast In Initiating other activities that would be helpful to the senior citizen. One of the hindering factors, I understand, Is that federal funds re made available directly to the Tribes through Title VI. and the elderly may or may not get the full benefit of such funds. The State' Adult Serviceand Aging Office Informs me that they are not permitted to Intermingle TilU III funds with Title VI funds, end this Is detrimental to the *enlor programs on the reservatlons. Let us take a look at the other side of the coin, because there ae reasons as to why the benefits ar not available, and In e case It mty be due to the lack of a good administrative set up. With reference to ACTION's Foster Grandparent Progrem. Initially the Oglls Sioux Tribe wes the Sponsor. funded In June 1S72. and In the Administrative changes caused by e!ctions. funds were lost In the shuffle. It was during a fw trying yars that Sponeor change had to be Initiated, end a Non-Profit Corporation assumed sponsorahip. Since then one Project Director remained with the prolect. and the FPotor38 Grandparents have met the needs of school children throughout the reserve- tlon with a little different emphasis then e metropolitan project. but thie highlights the feat that a corporate structure may be an answer to such an admInistrative need. On the other hand the Important aspect of a NawPrelt Corporation Is the members of the Board of Directors. There Is a dire need to search out progressive thinking people. and they may be members of the clergy, the spouse of a succesful ftrmer or rancher a looal store operator, plus some local senior citizen who has retired returning to the reservation. because you need active, responsive, plus progressive thinking people to make the plan work. With due respect to those elders who have resided all their lives on a reservation, have not gained the experience. and may not be able to contribute toward the development of e multi-purpose center, and this may contribute to the problem that prevails. Therefore, the make-up of th Board of Directors is Important, and without such a Board, the corporate structure will fall. Therefore, I implore this Satet Committee to keep In mind that the reservation communities need assistance, In the form of expertise to formulate, from beginning to end, the development of a sound administrative set up. so that en Indian community can ferret out the benefits of the Older Americans Act. I have assisted my reservation to do just that, preparing the Articles of Incorporation, educating the senior group on whet a corporate strurture can accomplish for them, If. a good board of directors could be assemblid. *nd some Improvement can be een at the Senior Center. but more nees to be done. The Indian communities need to vilsit on-going multl-purpose senior centers, and then they will know what to strive for. because without such knowledge, they cannot set their goals. The Federal Agency for Volunteer Service iACTION) could be very helpful to the nation's American Indian reservatlons by Implementing Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA) projects for the specific purpose of developing Multi-Purpose Centers, from beginning to end, and such Vista Volunteers will render a needed service. ACTION had some bad experiences on rservations but that again was due to bed sponsorship. end with proper initial planning this can be alleviated. The Bureau of Indian Affairs staff can dired mort resources toward assisting the elderly on the reservations, and with the coordinated effort of Federal Agencies, and the State Agencies, services for the senior citizens on the Indian reservations can be Improved. The benefits made avallable by the Older American 4 Act are applic- able to the American Indian elderly, the sponsor of the projects need to dedign the services that fit their needs, and all of the foregoing factors need to be taken Into consideration. The progl-am that Is available on the reservation Is meals, and that constitutes what they conceive as a senior center. I do not believe that aging hesitates for any race, but we need through existing federal pro- grams to alleviate end prolong the life span of senior citizens of Indian communities, and this can be done by establishing strategically located nuraing homes for the American Indian elderly. I highilght nursing homes because the American Indian elderly must leave the reservation to get the services of a nursing home, thus leaving their relatives and friends and be amidst people of a different culture. ThIs Is the cause of early passing because they become homesick and they have nothing of familiarity. We should take Into account the fact that our American Indian elderly possess skills, In the production of craft Items such as quilts, bead-39 work, quill work. and they should have the opportunity to peas on thes skills. The Crow Croek Golden Age Center after the Implementttion of their new Non-Profit Cbrporation have started the production of star quilts and' two people with the needed skills are producing. There Is a continuing need to get the elderly involved. Transportation Is an Issue that needs further study. In comperison to South Dakotas non-indlan communities, and their Senior Centers, transportd tion Is very limited on Indian reservations. The distances are greater, the vehicles In Indian communities are of an older vintage, and there Is a need. but there Is a need to control the use of transportation for senlor citizens. At one location, namely the location where the hearing Is being held. the Urban Mass Transit Administration placed five Mini-bussesawith the Tribe being the recipient, and without controls the busses were won Inoperative. In any event, the need Is there, and with the development of a sound adminih trative set-up, transportation should be made available to the American Indian elderly. The edditional problem In Indian communities Is that of providing a storage facility (a garage to be specific), so that the vehicle can be protected from the inclement weather, from vandals, and to prolong the life of the vehicle. It would seem practical for the Ceneral Services Adminletration. Interagency Motor Pool system to provide the Mini-busses to Centere eponsored by Incorporated Bodies of the American Indian Reservatione. The AdminIstre- tive Body could be Incorporated under federal law, a contrect number assigned. My reason for such recdtimendation Is that an established system of maintenance can be utilized. At the present time, the Inter-Agency Motor Pool is provid Ing vehiclee to different programs on the reservations, and this could be Implemented. Outside organizations, or groups. are willing to help the elderly on the reservatlona. Recently the Crow Creek Golden Age Center received a large screened console television aet, plus an Individual gave about thirty electric fans, because of the extreme warm temperatures this summer, and the donors remained anonymous. In conclusion I want to reference Art Linkletter's book entitled \"Old Age Is Not For Sissies\" Choices for Senior Americana, a resource book that has some meaning to senior citizens. I hope that this Senate Specil Committee can make recommendations that will equip the senior Cltizen on Indian reservations to stand up for themselves, and Implement the benefits of the Older Americans Act. There Is a continued need to provide information on programs aveilable to ali senior Americana. I appreciate this opportunity, and in the event further Information is needed on any aspect of my testimony, I will be obliged to provide It.40 Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you very much for your outstanding testi- mony. I wanted to say that hearing you mention star quilts brought to mind one of my wife's and my most prized possessions-a star quilt. It was made by the late Florence Tibbetts who recently passed away. I know her son is here today. Her family has really been good friends of mine. Over the years, my wife has really en- joyed her visits here. It's always a pleasure coming back. Vernon, I think what you said here today regarding the Senior Citizen Intern Program provides a unique perspective on aging issues. For that, I thank you very, very much. Next, I'm going to call on Royal Bull Bear from Kyle, who is going to talk about his experience as an older native American Indian. The committee is very interested in and eager to hear your testi- mony, Royal. TESTIMONY OF ROYAL BULL BEAR, KYLE, SD Mr. BuLL BEAR. Thank you, Senator Pressler, and staff and friends. I am glad this morning that I have this opportunity to speak tothe Senator and other programs. I live in Kyle, SD. At the present time I'm over here at the Hills working with some kids. There are some kids from this reservation go up there and have a camp of alittle training. So after this meeting, I have to get back over and work with the kids again. Now, what I am going to say at this time is I've been to a lot ofmeetings such as this. And every time at meetings like this weheard reports from different programs. But let me say this fromthe people of the Gray Eagle, these reports come from offices. Itdoesn't come from people where the needs are. I say this because Gray Eagle has been out there, talked with the people. Some of the people are handicapped. And they have no way to come to hospitals or programs. And nobody's been out there to explain what's available for them, so they don't know what theprograms are. But the Gray Eagles are out there, talk with his people. And this is what we come up with. I think Senator Presslerhas a copy of this, and I hope he took a very good study of this paper. In the future I hope something come out of this report. Some of this elders need help, and they come to hospital. Butthey'll have to wait in line so many hours, and sometimes theywent home without getting services. I've seen it happen. And Ithink we need to expand some of these programs so people set upinstead of city and offices, go out to the people and talk to them, because they need help. And another thing: I'm sorry to say this, and I might hurt your feeling, but this is what it is going to take to come up with an answer or solution to help this needy people. We have programs and we have tribal government, but we are in a situation that's bad, very bad. I've been thinking all this last few month, there's nofuture in the tribal government, no future. So what are we going to do for our children? There's a lot of children. Then it's a very badsituation. Not only here but other tribes. I have been getting phone41 calls from different tribes. I don't have the authority; I don't have the power to help those other tribes, but they call on me. And if I can do it, they want me to go over there and talk with them be- cause they heard about the Gray Eagles. Gray Eagle Society is all the elders. You see some of them sitting back there and back here. They know the situation is getting bad. That's why they form this Gray Eagle Society, to see if we can solve some of these problems. If we don't, like I say, children, there's no future. So I am not going to go into detail about this paper. But I hope Senator Pressler take a good look at it and study and see if we can get together and come up with an answer. Now, in closing, I'd like to tell a story. It's a true story at a time when our great-great-grandfathers are still hunting buffalo or whatever. And one time there are 200 hunters went out to hunt. And while they're walking, they heard something, and they know what it is. It's a mean buffalo. This buffalo bulls. When it gets to fight, one of them is bound to get killed. And another buffalo come up and fight with this bull. This buffalo, after he kill so many buf- falo, he lost his mind. He's out of his mind. He so mad that he don't know what he's doing. He operates under any option to kill; female buffaloes or calf, whatever. And pretty soon he took off run- ning. So this two hunters heard buffalo coming, so they run toward where the trees are. And just as they got to the tree, this buffalo caught up with them. The one jumped up and grabbed a limb and pulled himself up, and the other one couldn't make it. And there's a hole down in the bottom there so he crawl in that hole. So this buffalo started looking around, and pretty soon he come up and see this man there. So just as soon as the buffalo pull away, this man came out. So he seen it and took after it again, but he crawled back in. He done that about two or three times. So this man up there shouts, \"You stay in that hole.\" And this man said, \"How can I? There's a bear in that hole.\" So I think this is what happened to the needy people. What are we going-where are going to turn? What are we going to do? This is-this is the kind of situation we're in now. And I'm sorry to say this, I might hurt somebody's feelings, but that's all right: Some of you older people know that the chiefs of the elders make this kind of a speech to the people and the people listen to them. Now we don't have that anymore. Nobody give advice to the council or to the young children. And this is one of the things that the elders are doing now- trying to teach our children so they learn to respect others. We don't have that respect anymore. Thank you.

I shall next call on Marie Randall from Wanb- lee, SD, also an elderly Indian witness. We look forward to your testimony. I know that the group of Indian women sitting here in the front row to my left want to submit testimony in opposition to the sale ofthe Sioux San land in Rapid City. I have already written a letter urging that the sale of the land be cancelled. However, at the end of the hearing we will hear from them. At that time, I also will present an award to Elaine Quiver in recognition of her 16 years as the Director of the Foster Grandpar- ent Program at Pine Ridge. Right now, we will hear from our last scheduled witness, Marie Randall. TESTIMONY OF MARIE RANDALL, WANBLEE, SD Ms. RANDALL. I'm greatly happy to have Mr. Pressler come down to our reservation and the committee that is with him to hear the grievances and the problems of the Lakota elderlies. And I can't be happier. (The Lakota language was spoken at this time.) Ms. RANDALL. My name is Marie Randall and I live in the Eagle Nest District on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Our district is located about 100 miles from here. And everybody's talking about transportation. I almost not madeit this morning. And I'm a wife, a mother, a grandmother, and Ihave-including my adopted children, I have 13 children raised. And this is-me and my husband raised our family just my hus- band being a laborer. He was not a-any kind of a-just home lifelaborer is what-is how we raised our children. And at this point of my life I thought I was qualified to representthe elderlies because I'm an elderly myself. And living in the Eagle Nest District and being active in the Senior Citizen and the FosterGrandparent Program and the Gray Eagle Society, I thought I would be qualified to represent my people. So that is one reason why I have come here to testify about the concerns of the elderlies. And as you have heard before, there is a lot of things that theelderlies are having hardships in. And I believe all elderlies thatare here present and the ones that are not here are living undera-we are living under fixed income. And I really agree with that,because we're in a fix. We just have a certain amount of money to spend through the month in order to survive. And the Social Security some of us have earned. But a lot of ourelderlies at the age group that they are now, they didn't have no organized work. We didn t have no Social Security at that time oftheir life. So what they are living on is the Supplement Security Income. And that is something that is helpful to our senior citizen. And yet there's another way of looking at it-because most ofour elderlies are holding onto their land base and their mineralrights because of the feeling they have toward their children andtheir grandchildren. That is why they're holding their land baseand mineral rights. And when they get their SSI for a period oftime, and when their lease income comes in, what do the SSI, Sup-plement Security Income, do, they cut off their income. And this isa very bad hardship. They cut them off a certain period of time ac-48 cording to the amount of lease money they receive. And I really don't think that is right. And the transportation was talked about very much, and I'd like to go into that. Like I have said, I live 100 miles. And I had to go to the school and talk to our principal in order to transport some of my elderlies with me here today. So it is very hard for our elderlies transportationwise. And when we receive our Social Security and Supplement Security Income, we have to think about, \"Are we\"- \"What are we going to spend it for?\" First of all, in order to survive, we have to think about food. And so then we have to travel a distance in order to buy different varie- ties of food. Someone talked about a diabetes among our Lakota people, so some of them are on diet. And community stores don't carry very much supply of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meat. Our Lakota people, we live on soup, meat. We like-we just love our meat. And one of them mentioned here that they are satisfied in order to have soup three times a day. We're happy with fry bread, wojobe pudding. You know, we live on that. Our ancestors have lived like that. And we, as Lakota people, can continue living like that. And so, when we get our checks, we have to decide which town we can go to to pick up our fresh fruits, vegetables, meat. And the transportation problem come-comes in there. Kadoka is 27 miles away from our Eagle Nest District Community Settlement. And 27 miles away they charge us $30. Anybody that you have to hire charges $30. And Philip is another town, which is 50 miles away. They most generally charge $45 to $50 a day. Martin is another town 50 miles away from Eagle Nest District, and they charge from $45 to $50. And then, if an elderly wants different-more different varieties of things or clothing or material stuff, they like to go to Rapid City because there's a lot of choices there and a lot of reasonable priced items that they can pick up. And what do they have to pay, 475 to $100 for that trip. and if a-just estimate a person getting $337 a month. I'm not ashamed to tell my total amount of money that I receive monthly and that I have to survive on. Now, if we pay somebody $100, that leaves me $275. And if I pay-if I put away $50 for other expenses, for instance, like medi- cal expenses that I might need or if I get sick and I have to go to a doctor, I have to put $50 for transportation. That leaves me about 100 and some odd dollars for my groceries to survive on through the month. And with food prices going up, what do you think? It's not very easy for us elderlies. We have to budget very, very closely in order to survive. These are not included in our Social Security, our Supplement Security Income. We have IHS. Yes, we have IHS. But being from that district, we don't expect an injured elderly or a sick elderly to travel 100 miles. And sometimes they transfer them to Rapid City, which is another 100 miles. No, they re suffering enough, so we try and get them to the closest medical attention they can have. And it's the same price again; $30, $35, $40, $75, $100, whatever. Sometimes if a person feels for the elderlies, maybe they charge less. So that is one49 reason transportation is very important for our elderlies. And the income is very important. And besides that, if we want to see at night, we have to think about our electricity bill. If we want to keep warm through the winter, prepare our food, we have to think about our propane. There goes some more of our money. So you can imagine what the senior citizens are going through. And I was happy-I was scared at first when I received a letter having to come up here and testify for my people. And then I read the topic, \"The American\" elderly, \"Indian Elderly.\" And then it says, \"The Forgotten Population.\" Yes, that just fits us pefect. We have been forgotten for many, many years. And Mr. Bull Bear mentioned that here. We educated our chil- dren in order that they would be our tomorrows, our future. But I see they get their education, do they look back? No, some of them do not look back at us as elderlies. Some of them, I do not know why, but they think about material things more maybe. And they forget about their relationship and their respect that the Lakotas have for one another. And most of our educated children are Lako-tas here on the reservation. I know with my 10 children, I try my best to educate them. But as a family, I really teach my children the Lakota values and they understand well. And a lot of my people know my children, so I'm not afraid to say this. And so the $50, that's set aside for emergen- cy use, medical use. If we don't use it, it most generally goes to other necessities that we need. And then the best part is coming- when we pay out all the utilities, propane, medical bills, transpor- tation. And then I would like any of you Senators, Congressmen, Presi- dents, whoever you are, to come to our Lakota homes and visit us. We welcome you to come and visit us. Because of the money that's allocated to the elderlies, when they get through paying for our survival through the month, we do not have enough for our repair in our homes. That includes broken screens, no screens, broken windows, broken locks. And for the safety of our elderlies today, we need locks in our doors because of the problem of alcohol and drug on this reserva- tion. We need to protect our elderlies more. And that includes asafety-what do you call the people down there? Why, they make their rounds, but do they get off to visit the elderlies to see if their needs are met? No, they drive around in cars. Boy, I think those safety people have lots and lots of gas because they drive and drive and drive, but they do not come to meet the elderlies and ask themtheir needs. So it's very dangerous. Not only here on the reserva- tion, but I'm sure in the neighborhoods of the urban towns, cities,it's the same way. And that is what I'm testifying for my elderlies, the income, the transportation. And we had some meetings because I was going to come up here and testify. And what we come up with was a waiver for the lease income, for the elders, Lakota elderlies that receivethat lease income. Although they do not go up to $1,500 but still what money they receive, they should not be cut off their Supple- ment Security Income. That's the way I look at it.50 And another thing that we come up with, a salaried officer, an advocate for the elderlies in local communities; not just one person to represent the elderlies at the council meeting or one representa- tive to visit the nine districts. No, we're looking at the local point of view. A salaried advocate that would look out for the elderlies,the assistance that they can give, information providing for the senior citizen. And the health care that we need is home health care for our elderlies. Because most of our elderlies are still the head of house- holds, and they play a main family role in the life of a family. They live within the family, and everybody looks up to them and listens to them. And I think we need a home health care. And someone talked about an elderly complex in each communi- ty where the senior citizen can live within the community; they do not have to go off anywhere. And we need an extended care facili- ties and services. I mean we have Green Thumb Programs, we have Companionship Programs. But the only program that I know ofthat is existing in this Pine Ridge-on this Pine Ridge Reservation is a Foster Grandparent Program. But the Foster Grandparent Pro-gram cannot hire all senior citizens. And I think we need other programs here on the Pine Ridge Reservation for our elderlies. And housing I just say-wish to invite all of you to come to our homes. Because of the income that we have to live by, our repairs, we sit there and watch our homes deteriorate. What else can we do? It's sad, very sad for our Lakota elderlies. And the water rights, Mr. Pressler, himself, viewed and seen. And we would like to guarantee protection for our water rights. And that is about all I can bring up. But I hope that everyone here on the committee would view our testimony. And with the closing, I would like to ask Mr. Senator Pressler and the committee president and thank them for coming here onthe Indian reservation to listen and hear our problems and needs. We are the people. All of us here together are living on this conti-nent or on this reservation or other areas. And if we come together like this more often and hear one another, the problems and issuesthat we have to face together, getting together for more under- standing and communication and in betterment of our future; Ithink we needed to do this more often. So, Mr. Senator Pressler, when you go back, I would like for you to invite any Congressman. We're not desperate people. We're people here, and you're welcome to come more often to visit us. Wehave-what we have said here today, we have more to present. Buthere we are just a few chosen ones that are presenting our testimo- nies. So let us work together as people and make a betterment of our Nation and the Lakota nation. I thank you very much for listening to me. [The prepared statement of Marie Randall follows:]51 Senate Select Committee on Aging Eagle Nest District Oglala Sioux Tribe Pine Ridge Indian ReservationMarie Randall. Eagle Neat Senior Citizen Wanble, South Dakota 57577 July 21, 1988 INTRODUCTION My name is Marie Randall. I live in the Eagle Nest District on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Our district is located 100 miles north east of Pine Ridge. I am a wife, mother, grandmother and have raised 13 child- ren including 3 adopted ones. My husband and I raised our family on his wages as a laborer. Our family is a traditional Lakota family and we have raised our family to respect the Lakota values. At this point in my life I feel I am qualified to represent the elderly because I am an elderly living in the Eagle Nest District. I am 68 years old and active in the Eagle Nest Senior Citizen. Poster Grandparents Program and Gray Eagle Society. I have come to testify concerning our elderly in order to leave a legacy of hope for my children and grand- children. The hard life that we, the elderly, have led is not what we want for our children. In order for you to have a better perception of the life of an elderly living in the Eagle Nest District I pre- sent the following: The elderly live on fixed incomes and I agree we are in a fix. We subsist on Social Security and SSI. I receive my check monthly. Upon receiving this.check several deci- sion making and priority processes occur. A decision on food procuring must be made first. I have to decide if I can afford to go to Kadoka, Philip, Martin or Rapid City. Transportation costs from Wanblee to the above areas are: Kadoka -27 miles -$30; Philip -50 miles -$45-50; Martin -50 miles -$50-60; and Rapid City -$75-100. I must then look at my electric and fuel bills. If I want to see at night I pay the electric bill. If I want to be warm and cook for my family I buy propane. If I decide to go to Rapid City, pay my electricity and buy pro- pane I have spent $200.00. I now have 157.00 left. I then set aside $50 for medical transportation cost if something52 occurs during the month. So I now have $107.00 to buy food for the month. The $50 I set aside is primarily for medi- cal transportation costs but usually is utilized for food and other things during the month. After food, shelter, transportation and medical emergencies, there is no money for clothing this month. I have now spent my money for the month. For other elderlies the same decision making processes must be made. For others this means no screens or screen doors, the lock cannot be fixed on the door; there is no money to buy a fan for the summer months; no money for entertainment or recreation. The majority of elderly utilize their money for basic needs. I have listed the problems we face daily and will now list recommendations that will greatly assist us: 1. Transportation -Provide a vehicle to transport the elderly for shopping, medical care, personal business, and perhaps entertainment; for example visiting. 2. Waiver of Lease Income -Waive upto $1500 of annual lease income with no loss of Social Security and SSI income, Medicaid and medicare benefits. 3. Salaried Office for Advocate for the Elderly - Assistance and information providing senior citizens in all facets of everyday living. 4. Health -Home Health Care -More protection for the elderly regarding Public Safety (Security) -Extended Care Facilities and Services -Ambulatory Nursing Home 5. Housing -Low income elderly complexes 6. Water Rights -Guaranteed protection of our water rights53 Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you very much. We are nearing the end ofthe hearing. I do want to say a couple of things. I'm holding otherhearings on elderly issues. This afternoon, I'm going to Aberdeento attend a hearing examining nursing home issues and some ofthe problems associated with financing care in these facilities. Wewill also discuss the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Tomorrow I'm attending a program on Alzheimer's disease inSioux Falls. Dr. Zavin Khachaturian, an internationally knownexpert on Alzheimer's disease, will speak. I have been working onlegislation to increase research funding to find a cure for this dev-astating disorder. We could save large sums of money in our socie-ty if Alzheimer's victims could take care of themselves longer intheir own homes rather than being placed into nursing homes.I also wish to say I am glad to be here again in the Billy MillsAuditorium. I frequently come to the Indian reservations of SouthDakota. I recently visited the Lower Brule. I speak at a variety ofgraduations. I'm always moved by the hardship many Indian people experience and the need to create opportunity and jobs onthe reservations. I do want to give a special recognition to Elaine Quiver. My con-gratulations to you, Elaine, for your excellent work. When I calledTim Giago of the Lakota Times to get suggestions for witnesses,you were the first name he suggested. And we're very glad to haveyou here. I have a flag that's been flown over the U.S. Capitol I'dlike to present to you. This U.S. flag was flown over the U.S. Cap-itol on July 18, 1988, at my request. It's a beautiful flag. Can youpronounce that word for me? Ms. QUIVER. Okachop. I'd like to acknowledge this presentation to the Foster Grandpar-ent Program. I think it's kind of-I didn't expect this, so I'm notprepared for a speech. But I'd like to have all the elderly stand,because I think this is symbolic, that you all have earned this to-gether, I know there is a lot of elderly here. And thank you verymuch for your presentation. Thank you very much. Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you very, very much. Very shortly I will begoing out to the airport on one of the buses provided by the FosterGrandparent Program to catch my plane. However, I want to yield for one minute to a group that wouldlike to talk about a project for the elderly in Rapid City. Do youhave a short presentation, or would you rather submit testimony.Why don't you come forward? Let me say I agree with your posi-tion. I've already announced that and have sent a letter on yourbehalf to the General Accounting Office. Now I'd like to hear from you. Please identify yourself. TESTIMONY OF CECELIA MONTGOMERY, WA WO KIYE OS-PIYEA ELDERLY PROGRAM, RAPID CITY, SD Ms. MONTGOMERY. Senator, at this time I would like to expressmy thanks for giving me the opportunity to say a few words.And I am Cecelia Montgomery from the Wa Wo Kiye Os-piyeaElderly Program in Rapid City. And I represent-I and two othersthat came with me, we represent this Wa Wo Kiye Os-piyea group,54 formed in 1984. And the purpose of this was to start the aging group in Rapid City so that we could work together and start an elderly building complex on the Sioux San land. At that time, this land was still available, and that was in 1984 when we started. We have a membership of about 25, 30 people. We have about 15 that are very active. And I would like to come right to the point. Perhaps many of you have been reading the papers, in the Lakota Times and the Rapid City Journal, word that land was put up by GSA for bids on this certain land that we needed. It was in the Journal on June 16, I believe. And so we went directly to the city and met with Bonnie Hughes because they had the first option to buy that land. And Bonnie came right out and told us, briefly, she said, \"Cecelia we don't have no use for that land. If you need support to get an elderly complex on there, we will sure support you. And I will call the GSA right now and see why they put that up for sale if you people had al- ready paid for it.\" I have papers here showing that we have written letters to the Aberdeen area office. We wrote to Terrence Sloan on October 16, 1987, requesting that the members of the Wa Wo Kiye Os-piyea would like this location because of the proximity to the Sioux San Hospital and the availability and excee to Federal land. That was our first letter. On December 17, we wrote to Terrence Sloan again. We send him $1 to put claim on that piece of land. And I have here the copy that we did pay $1 on that land so we could put a hold on it. And if this land was surplus since 1985 from what we found out when Bonnie Hughes told us, then why didn't the Aberdeen area office have the heart to tell us elderly that we had already lost it then. But they did not tell us until we saw it in the paper. Then I got a letter back from Aberdeen Area Indian Health Serv- ice, a letter in response to the request to purchase excess land in the Indian Hospital in Rapid City. The General Services Adminis- tration Office of Real Estate in Forth Worth, TX. They told us to call them and call their attention to this land because they saidthat it was now up for sale. And if we wanted that land, we had to put in our bid for it. But do you know something, friends? All of you have elderly from every reservation residing in Rapid City. And why-I'm here today, I'm calling for your support so that we can get this land back to build that elderly complex. We started this, and we're going to hang in there and try to get it. And we don't want to buy it. We want the land because it's Federal land and at one time it was Sioux San Land, and that's Indian land, right? (Audience response.) MS. MONTGOMERY. All right. And that's why we're here today. We need your support from the Gray Eagles, the Sioux Tribes. I know Iyonne worked with us on this. We made several trips to Pierre for the Commission on Aging, and we got resolutions fromother different reservations for their support to get this going. But somehow or other, I don't like to say this, but because we're Indian, we fell through the cracks. And now they have it up for sale. So that's what we would like to stop. And we do need -money55 to get this complex going. If we can't hit up H.U.D., we'll be hitting other areas. And also, we need your support so we can get this aging complex going for the disabled, all those who are in need of housing. And we are talking about housing. So that's one thing that we need in Rapid City. And I hope that you will go home and put it down in writing Aberdeen don't have anything to do with it anymore is what I found. It's General Services Administration has gotten ahold of this now. So that's who we have to battle with. So again, I need your support. And think of all the elderly we have in Rapid City from all these different reservations. After all, they are our Indian people. Thank you. Mr. PRESSLER. This hearing is concluded. Thank you.APPENDIX Item 1 HOMEAR NATIONAL ASSOCIAT1ON FOR HOME CARE MARGARET i. CUSHMAN HONORABLE FRANK E. MOSS T519 C STREETNE, STANTON PARK cAIMOl-IE D SE-RCOSI_WASHINGTON. D.C 12 VAL J. HA S(202) 547-7424 STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR HOME CARE SUBMITTED TO THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING ON \"THE AMERICAN INDIAN ELDERLY: THE FORGOTTEN POPULATION\" The National Association for Home Care (NAHC) is the nation'slargest professional association representing the interests ofhome care providers, homemaker-home health aide organizations andhospices. NAHC is committed to assuring the availability ofhumane, cost-effective, high quality home care services to allwho require them. We in the home care field are pleased to participate in thiseffort to focus on the issue of the needs of the American Indianelderly in a community setting. We would like to commend SenatorPressler for holding this hearing to examine this vital issue. Approximately 75% of the federally recognized Indian Reservationsdo not have the Medicare home health care benefit available tothe elderly Indian population. This basically means that thereare no Medicare benefits such as skilled nursing care, physicaltherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and home healthaide care available. Further, Medicaid benefits are notavailable because they quite often are part of an organized homecare program, which is not available on the reservation. Thereappears to be a combination of factors which contribute to thelack of home care programs on the reservations. These factorsinclude: the isolation of the reservations from surroundingwhite communities where there are certified home healthagencies; the tribal customs, which may inhibit the elderlyIndian person from receiving personal care services from astranger or non-Indian; the lack of training of reservationpersonnel in the intricacies of the establishment of aMedicare-certified home health agency, as well as in the billingprocedures, coverage issues and methods of integrating theseservices into current delivery systems. Currently there is a community-based Tribal outreach health careprogram that is staffed by well-trained medically-guidedparaprofessionals. This program is found on 250 federallyrecognized Indian reservations and is called the Community HealthRepresentative (CHR) Program. The CHR Program provides servicesin the areas of general health care, dental care, gerontologicalcare, maternal/child health, mental health care, environmentalhealth services in the home, hospital/clinic services andcommunity care. This program was established in 1968. By 1987, approximately1400 paraprofessionals were working under this program on the 250reservations served. The 1400 CHRs made 3,470,364 clientcontacts in 1987. 13% of the client contacts (451,147) were madein the gerontological health area. 5.9% of all client contacts(204,751) were listed as home health care to all ages of clients.The majority of these contacts were on the few reservations wherea home care program had been organized and either integrated intoor coordinated with the existing CHR program. (57)58 -2- Since 1982 there have been severe cutbacks in federal funding inthe CHR program, which seriously limits the program's ability to meet the needs of the elderly Indian on the reservation. In 1982, the program had 2400 paraprofessional workers, as opposedto 1400 CHRs in 1987. Based on the current rate of servicedelivery, had the same number of CHRs been employed in 1987,there would have been 6,000,000 client contacts provided. Thiswould have increased the home health care visits to approximately 354,000 based on the 5.9% of total visits figure. It should benoted that the national average salary of a CHR is less than$11,000. This significantly impacts the ability to retain CHRsand is yet another area of difficulty in the provision of homecare services on the reservation. The recruiting of qualifiedskilled personnel to provide the supervision of paraprofessionalsas well as to provide the skilled care needed in the homes is felt far more severely on the reservations than the physicianshortage. There are very few Indian nurses or physicians.Recruitment efforts outside the Indian community quite oftenbring recent nursing and physician graduates to work out theircommitments to the federal government for scholarships and loans.The recent graduate is in the majority of cases inexperienced,especially in the field of home care, and the inexperienced bringinexperienced medicine. There is a large turnover rate amongprofessionals on the reservation, which affects the continuity ofcare which is greatly lacking on the majority of reservations. There are also few rehabilitation services available on thereservations. Those most needed to allow the elderly strokevictim to return home are physical therapy and speech therapy.These are virtually unavailable to the Indian elderly. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that there are very fewreservations where there is a nursing home or skilled nursingfacility. Thus, Indian elderly who can no longer remain in thehospital and have no skilled home care benefits on thereservation are being forced to leave their communities and beplaced in nursing homes off the reservation. These placementsare often many miles from the reservation, which then severelylimits contacts with family and friends. There appear to be few, if any, organized hospice programs whichserve the Indian elderly on the reservations. Many of the olderIndian people go to the hospital to die. At or near the time ofdeath the Indian custom is to have the extended family present to be with the dying individual. This is not understood by mosthospitals who may see an influx of many Indian people trying towait with their loved ones. At the same time, it is difficultfor the family who doesn't understand why they must abide by thevisiting requirements which limit the number of visitors and thetimes that can be spent with their dying family member. In isolated cases, the CHR programs have tried to provide sometypes of hospice care to the dying. This cannot be done duringthe paid time of the CHR paraprofessional, or all the otherservices would be neglected during that time. So, the CHR paraprofessional staff have had to volunteer their time afternormal work hours to provide the service. In summary, there is a paucity of hospice and home care services,especially those funded by Medicare and Medicaid, available tothe elderly American Indian populations. NAHC recommends that technical assistance and funding be madeavailable to tribes to help in developing and integratingMedicare and Medicaid home care programs into their currentsystems. A second recommendation is to restore the CHR programto at least the capacity of service level that was available in 1982. This would go a long way in improving the health status ofAmerican Indian elderly.59 Ien 2 Testimony Before Honorable Senator Larry Presaler, Oversight Aging Field Hearing, Rapid City, South Dakota, July 21, lH9, by Progrun Director, California Indian Council On Aging. Honorable Chairman Larry Presaler, my name is Patrick Renick, Program Director for the California Indian Council on Aging has been in existence for over eight yeara. Representatives are frin 42 tribes and Indian organinatinon in California. The majority of the eight yearn have been without adequate funding and through dedication of the Board nembera, the California Indian Council On Aging hae maintained its good standing as a non-profit (501)(3)(C) state of California Corporation. AS the Program Director of California Indian Council On Aging, I an requesting the Honorable Senator Larry Preseler, Special Committee on Aging support the amendments to the Older Americana Act of 1984, Public Law 98-459. With California having the largest Native American population in the nation, I would suggest our State merit Oversight Aging Field Hearings because the majority of the Native Americana populations have been effectively excluded fron nervicen due to inadequate funding levels and other factorn which mitigate against having their needa net. California Native American Senior Citizena are the nost undereerved, under-reprenented, ninority group in our State, and maybe the nation. Of the thirty-three (33) Planning and Service Areas (PSAn) designated by the State Department of Aging, each with an area agency responsible for administering program for the elderly. Our office has identified only three (3) Native American that are represented on Area Aging Boards out of the thirty-three (33) Planning and Service Areas. The Indian Health Service/California Area Office contracts to eight (8) urban and twenty-one (21) rural tribal health centers. our uniquenesn is that California is 100% contract State, unlike the ten (10) other Indian Health service Area officen where they have Indian Health Service federally financed and operated Service Unit., along with Indian Health Service financed and operated hospitals. California does not have any IHS financed clinic facilities or hospitals. Many of the twenty eight (28) clinice in California do not have comprehensive health care because of inadeqgate funding or are in the developing stages. The overlaying factor maybe because federal Indian health services were not reinstated to California until 1972, and only a minimal amount of fund. provided. During the termination era in California (1955-1965), none forty one (41) rancherias were terninated from federal trust status, the remaining aeventy-six (76) Reservatinna/Rancheriaa in trust status received no health benefits from federal Indian Health service or the State of California.60 For over twenty (20) years, California Indiana received little or no health services, providing treatment to Native Americans senior citizens today is very expensive. eany area. of California have exceeding high rates of diabetes and other congential diseases. Housing availability for the elderly has been in short supply. nouses the elderly occupy are nsually in deteriorating conditions, in some instances hones are isolated from major roadway artries and have no telephones. There are only three (3) Title Six -VI Programs in the entire State of California. The two federal agencies (NIA-HUD) that have responsibilities for Native American housing does not index elderly housing needs. The State of California even has less statistical information concerning housing needs and availability for Native American senior citizens. The nost health service for Indian elders are under-utilized because of limited access (due to lack of transportation, no telephones, information and resources) lack of outreach on the part of mental health providers, lack of a specialized focus within the Indian nealtb service/California Area Office delivery system on gerontological study or geriatric health care, and lack of documented information where they live, housing conditions, status of their health conditions. The failure of service providers and policy makers to design Mental Health Services approaches which are appropriate to the social and cultural setting in which the elders have need of services. Several of the Tribal Health contractors provide excellent care of the Indian elderly, while several developing Tribal contractors need to develop service programs. The Indian Health service/california Area Office does not have any master geriatric health care program. In concluaion, Mr. Chairman, the California Indian Council on Aging is aware that the daily living circumstances of Indian elders pose a continnal threat to the ability of Indian elders to maintain a healthy outlook on their daily lives and on their future. I Will quote an article by doctors Spero Hanson and Donald Calloway, in their article -Health and Aging Among American Indians, -Growing older presents great difficulties for a sizable segment, perhaps 30% of American aged population. Being Indian and being old intensifies these difficulties, but being an Indian over the age of 75 and living in a rural area nay represent being a member of the most discriminated segment of the American society-. I would hope my comments will give the Special Aging Oversight Field searing, sine ideas for way to improve level of care and communications for the Native American senior citizens in California. The vast complexities of amresolved Indian issues necessitate's future Oversight Field nearings in California by the Honorable Larry Pressler. Thank you, Honorable Senator Larry Presasler for having the California Indian Council On Aging testimony submitted in your Oversight Aging Field searing. I'61 Itou 3 LEGAL ISSUES OU TSE ELDERLY AMERICAN IEDIAl My name is Jlae M. Smitb and I am the president of the National American Indian Court Clerk. Aosociation. I -also the Court ad- ministrator fnr the Colville Confederated Tribes Tribal Court in Northeastern Washington. I wan requested to suhmit written testtirny concerning what I beliaved to be lega1 prohblom and imn.s experienced by elderly Indiana. At the forefront of ny concerns is the increase in elderly buse. Wn are hearing mote and more abot parental huso and elderly bhse. However, very few incidents are being formally reported to either the police or to the Court ystems. This raies two questions: Why is it taking place and what can we do to stop or decrease the sobaer of inc identa? I feel that one major factor is the high unexployment rate on reservations. Currently, our reservation is eaperiencing 60-801 une-ploynnt. Most of the unemployed hove no hope of getting jobh doe to lack of experience and education. Many that obtain jobh will lose them within the first few amnths due to alcoholism and its inherent proble-s Same are unhappy witb their employment due to a Iow rate of pay and unsatisfactory working conditions. Many times, a person will make norm amney on public assistance than going to a job every day, especially when you consider gas, insurance, h bysitters, etc. More and more drugs are entering our reservation. We are seeing younger and younger children using drugs. DSigs and alcohol cost enney and wbat easier way to obtain meney than to get it fram an elderly person who cannot protect bim or berself. The fct tbat the elderly peron may be your gr-admuth-r or grandfather doesn't make a difference vhbe you urn h-viog withdouwl sympto.- from alcobol or drugs. Th. bhoic fact is they have money and you don't. We are at a loss as to how conhat this proble=. The reasons for not reporting these bahses re varied and many. Parents do not want to get their children into trohbl. They would prohbbly end up paying any fine imposed anyway. There is the fear of retaliation. Many hope that toorrow th hu- ilt .the light and change. Usually, when the person sobers op he or she will be very apologetic and swear never to do that gain. This cycle continues idetinitely natil samehow the person gets caght. We send those that do get apprebended to impatient and outpatient treatment centers ftr alcohnl 89-721 -89 -362 and drug buse. We health counseling. We set up cen-unity service wurk with the elderly iu controlled situetiona to try and educate the offender to respect and learn frou these people. We levy fines and incarcerate. It helps a few, hut the probleh , keeps en greying. Until we can increase the self-estee of our people, we can only bandage the real problen. Another area that I feel woeld be of great help to many elderly Indians is a liaison. Host of the elderly Indians knoe what they want hut they do not kaew how to go about getting it. There are many prograns and help for then, hut there is elan a lot of paperverk and redtape. Many of the older Indians were hen at hoe and my not knew their exact age or birthdate. They den't reneaer where they wcrked twenty years ago and bave no idea if any benefits were paid or not. They don't know habt benefits they may qualify for now. They den't knew where to begin to find the answers to the questiena that are required en the application ferns They my be distrestfnl of anyone whe werks directly with the State or governent. semoane whe hut who knewa whe to talk to, where to go and what to say. Basically, they need a friend. A liaison is someone whe they can talk to and not feel ebharrassed to ask queations that night seen silly to semane else. The liaison my have \"walked\" their neighbor through this .arn redtape and bureau.racy last moth and therefore is experienced in getting than threugh the redtape today. The liaison weuld probably he useful in finding net what the real needs of the elderly are and why they aren't getting than fulfilled. Many older Indians are raising their grandchildren and seed to have legal guardianship over then before receiving nedical benefits or public assistance. They don't knew what to do or what to ask for. We refer then to attorneys because we cannot legally dvise then, hut not a11 of the go. They my feel intimidated or feel that it is just too each work for what little benefita they wold he getting. When aseone in the systen starts explaining the process, I'n sure that it overwhelm mn-y of then and they feel they can't or don't want to go threugh the hassle. Many don't wat to bring their children's problemn into Court to explain why they aren't taking care of their en child- ren. Slae are afraid that if they do bring their children into court, they may suffer retaliation later en. Worse for nany, the parents may63 return and tek the grandchildren sway from them. Then the grandpare- nt, suffer the loneliness of being separated fron their grandchildren. They nay wonder if the parents are abusing the grandchildren or feeding them properly. If they had a liaisou, that person night be Able to sit down with theo and tbeir attorney and explaio the whole process slowly and thoroughly in a Iaguage they could understod. If it was someone they trusted, they would feel comfortable in asking qoestions sud giving infortios. Sometimes knowing how to ask a qu.ation is better than knowing what question to ask. I feel that tbere needs to be more training in how to deol with elderly people in general. I bee m-ny times where people are weey respectful of the elders ut gatherings, but are very rude and impatient when that sane person cones into their office, We need to become aware that these people may not hear well, may not see well and nay not really understand exactly what is going on. They may be vary intel- ligent otberwise, hut the legal system hun a way of becoming very confusing very easily. We need to keep remembering that we need to bave patience and we should take a11 the time necessary to help then. people resolve their problem. Many courtu do not bave sdequate access for wheelchair clients or those using walkers. eserved parking for the handicapped is slomut unheard of on many reservations The cbhirs and benches in courtro--u are usually very uncomfortable. Most court syatemo had to make do with whot they could rustle up and don't bave the funding for 'comfortable\" furniture. Henltby people get tired and restlesu, let alone those that are suffering from arthritis or rheumatism. I would guess that mast comrt personnel are inadequately trained in CPR or basic first aid. Mny would not know what to do if no-eone, elderly or not, bed n stroke or heart attack in the Court. Moat probably don't have disaster plnning. What would happen if a fire started or n gas nain broke? What about the little gentleman or lady who baa an eaccidente while waiting three bours for court? Hba anyome made provisions for these types of problemu? Probably not. They are probably struggling just trying to make the Court run somothly for the general population. Those people that need special consideration usually end up in a low priority level, Here is anotber ares where liaisons could be very belpful. If they are aware of these unforseen64 problems, they could alert the court personnel to be on the lookout and to be prepared. That alone could save a lot of embarrassment and time for everyone. There needs to be more interpreters in the Courtroom. Many of the older Indians speak their native tongues. English is a second language to them and often it is still not well spoken or understood. Court personnel need to take the time to make sure these people understand what is going on before proceeding. There needs to be more people who can translate basic legal terms into a native language that makes sense to these people. Even someone that can translate \"legalese\" into English would be a big help. I am sure that there are many, many more problems that should be looked into. Guardianships over the elderly, right to die, probate and wills are some that come to mind. These are problems that can't be just thought of off the top of your head and then written down in any sensible manner. There needs to be a lot of research and thought put into a project such as this. I'm very glad that someone is taking the ball and going with it. If ever a few elderly Indians are helped in any way by this project, I would consider this a worthwhile effort. If I can be of any further assistance to you, please contact me and I will do my utmost to help in any way possible. Thank you for your time and consideration of my written testimony. Jane M. Smith President, NAICCA Court Administrator, CCT65 Item 4 Testimony of Steve R. Wilson, Chairman The National Title VI Grantees Association The American Indian Elderly: The Forgotten Population Senator Pressler: I want to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for this Field Hearing that will give us an opportu- nity to bring to this committee the problems the Title VI Grantees have experienced in trying to bring a much needed and deserving service to a much deserving population -Our Indian Elderly of this great country. Field Heafings in 1986 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Santa Fe, New Mexico conducted by the Honorable Senator Don Nickles, OKLA. and Senator Bingaman, N.M., brought frustrations of Indian Elderly advocates to the forefront. Subsequent testimony presented at hearings in Washington, D.C. in 1988 again contained our dreams of changing the plight of the Indian Elderly; but again we met frustration due to the lack of funding increases for Title VI and continued insensitivity on the part of the Administration on Aging. HISTORY OF TITLE VI In 1978 Title VI became an Amendment to the Older Americans Act that would provide direct funding to the federally recognized Tribes. It was not until 1980 that funding was approved for Title VI at $6 million. Dreams of establishing comprehensive services to the Indian Elderly population were not forthcoming by the orig- inal 83 grantees. Funding levels for the large tribes with large numbers of elderly was a maximum of $100,000 and funding for the smaller tribes staircased downward from that level. In 1984 the original 83 grantees experienced a cut in fund- ing ranging up to $20,000 for some grantees due to the Adminis- tration adding 42 new grantees. Wewere glad to see our brothers receive this funding but not at the expense of the original grantees. Many of the 83 original grantees had to cut back on the limited services they were providing before the cut in funding. The grantees had to cut down on the days they served meals from66 5 to 4 days and even to 3 days. Many homebound meals,chore ser- vices and transportation were either cut back or entirely elim- inated. Due to the regulations that stated \"Title VI Participants could not participate in Title III programs\", this prohibited any state programs from assisting in any way; although we didn't expect this from the States in the first place. If the State Title III programs had been sensitive to the special needs of the Indian elderly and were serving them we would not have gone after any amendments to the Older Americans Act. This brings us up to the recently passed Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, 1987. As you know, there is more lan- guage in this bill identifying the American Indian Elderly and the targeting of minorities or those with the most economic need. When we drafted this legislation, we felt that just maybe, we could see a significant change in the on-going Title VI programs and outher Titles of the Older Americans Act and in the attitudes of State programs and a more cooperative effort between the Tribes and states. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT -1987 In the past years the Title VI Grantees were faced with pol- icies and administrative decisions that created a misunderstanding and hardships on our programs. If you were administering a Title VI Program, you would get the impression that nobody cared for Title VI (except the Indians) and that it would go away. We could not get any leadership from the Commissioner on Aging in developing or spearheading the National Indian Aging Policy approved by the 1986 National Indian Conference on Aging in Phoenix, Arizona (see attachment). Therefore, we approached members from the House and Senate sub-Committee on Aging to draft this Policy into a legisla- tive bill which was attached as amendments to the Older Americans Act and approved by the Senate 98-0. ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER ON NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS With the insensitivity toward Title VI from the Administration on Aging, we felt we needed a position, \"Indian Desk\", within the administration that would understand the programs and understand the Indian people. We also felt this position should have decision making authority and be staffed by an American Indian. This person would also head up an interagency task force on the needs and ser-67 vices for older Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawai- ians. We received reports that these things we invisioned for this position were not being followed by the Administration. A letter was circulated among several Senators questioning the motives of the Commissioner and submitted to her for an answer. At this date, we haven't heard what her reply will be. TITLE V -SENIOR EMPLOYMENT A study conducted by the National Indian Council on Aging shows that the participation of Indians in this program is 1.59t of the total Title V positions allocated nationwide. (see attach- ed report). In the Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, language was approved by Congress that an Indian Aging organization be given a contract to implement Title V slots to the Grantees. This was to be if Congress appropriated funds over and above the '87 levels. The appropriations by Congress did not come. Prayerfully, this will be corrected by Congress this year. TITLE VI- COORDINATION OF SERVICES Language prohibiting Title VI Participants from using Title III services was eliminated. In drafting this legislation in this manner, we felt that Title VI participants could be included in some of the supportive services enjoyed byouthessbut unable to by Indian elders. The targeting of these in \"the most economic needs\" and minorities that is in the language of the Older Americans Act has not been implemented at this time. We do not know how the states are going to address this im- plementation of the Act. I do know that it is a dilemma for many of them. I attended a National Association of Area Agencies on Aging Board meeting representing the National Title VI Grantees Association and they were asking me. I do know that when we drafted the legislation, we felt that New Monies appropriated by Congress could be used to implement these new targeting items in the Act. We didn't invision that their funding would be cut. As a matter of fact, we were again frustrated when we learned that Title VI had been cut in funding by 4.251 -more than any other cuts in the Titles of the Act. These cuts have created more problems for Title VI Grantees throughout the Nation. Any plans by the Grantees for expanding any services were done away with due to lack of funding. Many of68 the Indian elderly don't have the financial capabilities to donate like they want to help their programs. Turn over in Title VI Directors has always been a problem. Experienced Directors are being lost, thereby, we are losing their expertise in this area, because they do receive training. The Grantees are trying to serve their elderly in areas that are considered rural. This creates added cost to the programs, but if these grantees did not serve them, they would not receive any services of the Older Americans Act. The American Indian Elderly: The Forgotten Population is a good topic for this hearing. They are no. forgotten by the Tribal programs- and Indian advocates, but by those in decision making positions. People who can make the difference in their lives; Administration on Aging, Indian Health Service and other Federal agencies., Also, Congress. If we had received the approved fund- ing levels, perhaps we could see the difference in their lives by expanding nutrition programs, transportation and other needed ser- vices that other elderly of this country are enjoying and benefit- ting from the Older Americans Act. Too many Indian Elderly of this country are passing away without receiving one penny of service from the Older Americans Act. The Title VI Grantees are willing to work with state pro- grams if approached. We call upon the Congress of this United States to correct the low funding levels of Title VI by approving appropriations that would enable grantees to plan and implement comprehensive services for their elderly. Maybe one day we can stop calling our Indian Elderly -\"The Forgotten Population\". Thank you.69 NATIONAL INDIAN AGING POLICY Section I. Statement of Policy It shall be the policy of the United States of Aserica. and the Congress of the United States that it has a legal and soral responsibility to ensure that the Indian and Alaskan Native elderly of this country are a vital resource and shall be entitled to all benefits and services available; and that these services and benefits shall be provided in a s.nner that preserves and restores their dignity. self-respect and cultural identity; and thereby shall reinforce and strengthen the unique tribal-federal relationship that has been established by treaty. by Executive Orders, and by the Constitution and laws of this country. Section II. Findings The Congress of the United States finds that the Indian elderly (age 60 years and over, according to the 1980 U.S. Bureau of Census) of this country are: 1. Increasing in population from 64,000 in 1970 to 109,000 in 1980; and it is projected that this population will increase to over 200,000 by 1990; and 2. Unemployed at a rate exceeding 80%; and 3. Living in poverty at a rate of 61% ; and 4. Living eight (8) years less than the general population in terms of life expectancy; and S. Impacted by the lack of Indian nursing homes (there are currently eight (8) nursing homes on Indian reservations, with a total capacity of 492 beds); and 6. Impacted by the lack of Indian Area Agencies on Aging (there are currently 3 out of a to- tal of 665 Area Agencies on Aging in the nation); and 7. Living in substandard and over-crowded housing; and S. Receive less than adequate health care; and 9. Are served under Title VI of the Older Americans Act at a rate of less than 25% of the total national Indian elderly population; and 10. Are served under Title III of the Older Americans Act at a rate of less than 1% of the total participants; and 11. Are being physically and mentally abused, af- fecting an estimated 30% of the nation's In- dian elderly population; and 12. Are being excluded from benefits under Social Security at a rate of approximately 57% of the nation's Indian elderly population. Section III. Policy Statements Based on the preceeding sections, the Congress of the United States hereby establishes the following policy directives designed to meet the physical and mental health needs of the Indian elderly, their spiritual well-being, their continued in- volvement and roles within society; and the im- plementation of a policy that is consistent with, re-affirms and strengthens the concepts of tribal sovereignty and self-determination. .I70 A. Economic Security -the Congress of the United States believes and recognizes that all Indian elderly shall be entitled to in- comes that meet their needs and allow them to live in dignity. I B. Long Term Care -Health care delivery systems shall be consistent with unique federal- tribal relationships, tribal sovereignty, tribal values and the continuum of care concept. C. Physical Well-being -The Congress of the United States believes and recognizes that all Indian elderly shall be entitled to health services that enable them to live healthy, productive and enriched lives. D. Social Well-being -The Congress of the United States believes and recognizes that all Indian elderly should be entitled to receive supportive services which enable them to remain in their own homes and communities, thus maintaining their culture, dignity and independence. E. Role of the Elderly in Society -The Congress of the United States believes that all Indian elderly are a vital resource and should be entitled to opportunities to continue con- tributing to their families, tribes, states and to the preservation of their culture. F. Education and Training -The Congress of the United States believes and recognizes that, through education and training, Indian tribes will implement effective programs which are conducive to the establishing of a society which is sensitive and responsive to the needs of the American Indian elderly community. G. Research -The Congress of the United States believes and recognizes that an effective re- search effort will result in a more informed society and will enable the Indian elderly to live their lives in a dignified and indepen- dent environment. H. Spiritual Well-being -The Congress of the United States believes and recognizes that all Indian elderly people have an inherent right to believe and practice their native religion as a right that enables them to live in harmony with their Creator. Section IV. National Indian Aging Policy Task Force THEREFORE, the Congress of the United State hereby establishes a comprehensive, coordinated and sys- tematic policy to ensure its elderly Indian and Alaskan Native citizens are provided services in conformance with the intent of this policy. FURTHER, to ensure the expeditious development and implementation of this policy, the Congress of the United States hereby directs the Administration on Aging and the Federal Council on Aging to create a National Indian Aging Policy Task Force composed of federal agencies, tribal representatives, na- tional Indian aging organizations, other aging or- ganizations and individuals in the field of aging71 whose responsibilities shall include but not be limited to the review of existing rules and regulations; procedures, and statutes, and recom- mend programmatic modifications and legislative actions. FURTHER, the Congress of the United States hereby directs the National Indian Aging Policy Task Force to submit a comprehensive report to the Congress on the progress made in implementing these policies, and further, the Congress directs the appropriate House and Senate Committees and Sub-Committees on Aging to serve in a monitoring capacity to ensure the receipt of this report. This report shall be submitted to the Congress not later than December 30, 1987.72 ANALYSIS OF TITLE V OF THlE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AND ITS LI11+ITED IMPACT ON NATIVE AMERICAN ELDERS BY Ken W.-hite Program Specialist National Indian Council on Aging, Inc.

Wilson, Chairman Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging Manager, Community Research & Development Administration of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma 'THE AMERICAN INDIAN ELDERLY -THE FORGOTTEN POPULATION\" Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging Senator Pressler: I wish to express my gratitude for giving me this opportunity to Express, on behalf of the Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging and our 20,000 Elderly Indians of Oklahoma, the frustrations we have experienced in trying to work with a state that for many years have declined to admit that their are soverign Indian Nations in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging (OICOA) was formally organized and chartered in 1978 whose members represent thirtY-nine (39) Indian Nations in Oklahoma. The members of this council are the tribal leaders themselves or are ap-- pointed by their tribal leaders. Due to many of our Indian Elderly not participating in state orograms funded by the Older American Act, the Indian Nations met to organize to advocate on behalf of our elderly. Our elderly were counted in the general Population for the state to receive monies, but little was done to encourage Indian participation in their programs. Many reasons our people didn't participate was mostly to culture barriers, language and many felt out of place. The state programs actually didn't have to recruit Indian participants because they had people on the waiting list to nartic- ipate. Because of the realtionship the Tribal Governments had with the Federal govern- ment, a move nationwide was implemented to develop legislation that would create a title in the Older American Act which Would fund monies direct to the Tribes from Washington. Thus Title VI was as an amendment to the Older Americans Act. TITLE VI AND TITLE III Although the Title VI amendments was passed in 1978, the first Title VI Grants were not awarded until September 30,1980 due to difficulties in developing the regulations. One of the criterias established was that \"Older Indians served by Title VI could not be served by Title III funds.\" This stipultion drove, even wider, the wedge between the Tribal Grantees and the State's Title III program. Title VI was not funded in such a manner that tribes could not provide comparable comprehensive programs for their elderly.81 In Oklahoma, the thirteen (13) original grantees were funded in amounts that would only allow them to establish one nutrition site. Any supportive services were transportation on a limited basis and chore services on a limited basis. We also had to define a certain serice area within our Tribal jurisdictions that we could serve. As an example, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation's service area is on the attached map. As you can see the city of Okmulgee and Morris are within this service area. We served approximately 120 elderly per day of which 60 were home bound deliveries. By designating this service area you can see that much of the Creek Nation was left out of this service area. However, many state project directors thought that because a Tribe received Title VI funds all the Indians of that tribe could not recive Title III services. This misunderstanding by the state's project directors have left many of the Indian elderly out of the system. A personal experience I have had with a Title III program involved my mother and father. Both of them had surgery, so my mother was unable to cook for them. They lived alone and my nearest family was 65 miles away. I called the Title III pro- gram to see if they would deliver meals to them. The project director told me \"well, well have to get an intake form on them.\" Three days later they went to our home and the outreach worker told Mom \"This will cost you each day and let us know when you can get around and cook for yourself so we can take you off the program.\" My mother and father was on the program less than two weeks. My understanding was that no charge was to be made for services. I know they call it a donation, but to set a certain figure for this \"donation\" I feel is illegal. This incident also shows that without adequate funding, the tribes can't provide any supportive services to assist out Indian elderly in time of need, even to those within the service areas, much less to those outside these areas. Although Indians are citizens of this state and do pay taxes, none of the tribes receive state monies for our programs. All the tribes have provided their own in-kind to make their programs success- ful. \"MORE THAN BOWS AND ARROWS\" One of the problems we saw with non-Indian organizations and states was they didn't know the inter-workings of the Tribal Govern- ments and their programs. So, the Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging embarked on a two year travel agenda putting a a workshop titled \"More Than Bows And Arrows. We traveled to State, Regional and National Conferences trying to educate the non-Indian aging network about the Tribal Governments and about how they may serve the Indian elderly. We were successful in some respect by making aware the needs of the Indian elderly to these providers. We could not, however, get the support of the decision makers who should and could make a difference in the lives of our elderly if they understood them. We were able to82 gain the support of many people in the aging network to support our ideas of cooperation. For example, we asked the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (N4A) to amend their constitution and by-laws to allow an Indian on their board. Our friends on the board introduced it for us and pushed through the amendment, whereby, we are now represented on their board by the Chairman of the National Title VI Grantees Assoc. We have also worked closely with the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in their minority initiatives that they are promoting today. We have also worked with the American Foundation for the Blind and the National Council on Aging. Statewide, we have representatives on the Oklahoma Alliance on Aging which is the largest and strongest advocay organization in Oklahoma. The Chairman of the Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging has been on the Governors Special Committee on Aging and most recently been in- volved in a feasibility study on the reorganization of the Oklahoma State Unit on Aging. Many of the recommendations have been submitted to the Governor and every indications shows that this plan for reorg- anization will be followed in the near future. The most successful conference in Oklahoma is the Oklahoma Minority Task Force's State Wide Outreach Conference held yearly which gives the state ourtreach workers an opportunity to learn about how to serve the minority elderly population. The Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging has been a big part of the planning and implementing of the Task Force and its conference. I mention these things because I want everyone to know that we are not sitting around idle just waiting for Federal monies. We are trying to work with the existing state and local level organizations to better improve their image of the Indian elderly and how they may serve our elderly. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE OLDERS AMERICANS ACT The Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging was very much involved in the amendments to the Act that was passed this past year. The Chairman was on the committee made up of Indian advocates nationwide to imple- ment these amendments. We felt that the attitudes of the Administration on Aging and the states were not going to change the way things were or have been, and that we needed to develop this legislation that would enhance the programs for the Indian's programs. Many of the changes in the Reauthorization such as targeting of minorities and those in the \"most economic need\" have not come to past. I have not been approached by the State programs on how they would like83 to follow these mandates now in the law. Is the problem with the Adm- inistration on Aging? Has the Commissioner done all that can be done to assure that the mandates of the law have been fulfilled to the limit? We feel the Commissioner should take the lead role in imple- menting these mandates. The coordination of state and tribal programs could be a big difference in the service of our Indian elderly, if they were mandated to follow the law. When we see these changes written and implemented by the states, we do not want \"lip service\". We want to see that they are following the spirit of the law. Title V -Senior Employment-' would be a big asset to the tribal programs, if we could get a contract to a National Indian Aging Organization as stated in the Reauthorization. This falls into the hands of Congress to see that enough monies is appropriated so that this Indian organization can get a contract. The cost of implementing a Title VI program far exceeds the amount of funding the tribes are receiving. Many of the programs are established in rural settings so they can serve their elderly. If not for the Title VI programs, many of the Indian elderly would not be receiving any services from the Older Americans Act today. It is because our program people care about serving their elderly who live in isolated locations. The approved funding levels were not passed by Congress last year for Title VI. Instead we were cut by 4.25% which again puts added hardships on the tribal programs. Services had to be cut againg to many of the homebound, transportation has to be cut to many because of these cuts and other services been done by the tribal programs had to be cut back or eliminated due to these cuts. Many tribal governments cannot pick up the cost no longer available because of these cuts. One of the greatest losses are the Title VI directors who are being lost to higher paying jobs because their program was cut and the tribe couldn't pay them full time or had to lower their salary. This may sound selfish on my part about the directors, but when stability in a program is threatened then it becomes weak. Many of these directors have gone through training that would make them better for their programs and they have learned to reach out to other agencies and organizations for assistance for their elderly. When they leave then a new director has to learn all over again and the elderly are the ones who suffer while the new director learns the ropes. I84 In Oklahoma we have twenty-three (23) grantees receiving Title VI and we have gone through thirteen (13) new directors this pasr year alone. We have come to those tribes' rescue many times trying to keep their programs afloat and helping their new director cope and learn about their program. We see the Federal Agency Task Force as a vital part of the Reauthorization because of the chance for changes at the Washington level with all Federal Agencies that would and could make a difference in services to the Indian elderly. We would like for this agency task force to include Indian leaders and Indian organizations so they could have input into any changes. Is this being done? The Associate Commissioner for American Indian, Alaskan Natives and Hawaiian Natives Aging Programs is a very important part of the Reauthorization. We have not had any success with the Administration on Aging's Policies that have been implemented in the past. Their Policies have hurt our programs in the past and when we have not had any input into these Polocies, its our elderly who get hurt. We felt that the Associate Commissioner for Native American Programs should be staffed by an American Indian froma federally recognized tribe who could and should understand the tribal programs and tribal governments. We felt that with this position fulfilled in this manner, then and only then, when policies are made by the Admini- stration on Aging, we would have an American Indian helping to set these policies. We also would have a focal point within the Administration on Aging that would assist in the implementing of-the mandates of the Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. As Chairman of the Oklahoma Indian Council on Aging since 1984 and as an Administrator of programs for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation since 1976, I can speak for what is happening in my own state, knowing that as Chairman of the National Title VI Grantees Association, many of these same problems exist in all the states. As program admin- istrators and as advocates for our Indian elderly, we have taken that extra step in trying to work with state programs. We have worked with Congress in developing much of the legislation that was put into the Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act of 1987. Yet, today, we are still crying out on behalf of our Indian elderly, to change the history of Title VI programs to a point of providing adequate, comprehensive services so that our Indian Elderly can enjoy their later years in harmony and pride. It is time to change so that85 we can take pride ourselves and stop saying about our Indian elderly, \"the Forgotten American.\" Thank you again, Senator Pressler and to this Committee for giving me this opportunity to express what I know is going on in Indian Country. I thank you also on behalf of my Indian Elderly for whom I have spoken. {/ 0 REGIONAL CENTER / G COMLeITY CENTER J.r~fe~L S.X~;.- lavacA t s S It-_.II86 Item 6 NICOA 7/88 STATEMENT OF CURTIS D. COOK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NATIONAL INDIAN COUNCIL ON AGING Mr. Chairman, and distinguished members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I want to thank you for the~ invitation to submit written tes- timony for your consideration. I especially want to thank Senator Larry Pressler for conducting a field hearing at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, and for having the insight to use this hearing as a means of documenting the fact that American Indian elders are, in many ways, \"a forgotten population;\" forgotten and neglected by a governmental system that seems to have lost sight of the fact that there are many frail, vulnerable and needy among its own \"First Americans.\" In the testimony which follows I will show that our government and its policy makers have not only forgotten the needs of the Indian elderly population, but also that it has developed and implemented practices which discriminate against the nearly 200,0001 American Indian and Alas- kan Native elders in our country. I will show that there is an ever- increasing trend toward policies which deny them their rights, and mitigate against the ability of Indian elders to have even their most basic needs met. I submit, Mr. Chairman, that discrimination and neglect continue and are growing in the procedures being observed by our human service agencies-- in gathering and reporting statistical data, in the establishment and administration of program and Congressional budgets, and in an insensi- tive public policy. Consider the evidence: A. Discrimination by Statistical Manipulation: Some agencies of our federal government are gathering and reporting data in such a way that it effectively discriminates against Indian elders, in that the data obscure the fact that these Indian elders are not being given adequate opportunity to participate in programs which are based on misleading and inaccurate statistics. The unfortunate outcome of this misrepresentation of the real facts is that services which are supposed to be targeted toward the truly needy are not actually getting to those who need them most. In sup- port of this statement I submit the following: Bureau of the Census -- The Census of 1980 revealed that 61% of the American Indian elders living on reservations had incomes which were below the national poverty level. Later, in 1986, the Census Bureau \"recalculated\" their figures and mysteriously arrived at a much lower figure of 33%. Conventional wisdom and first-hand observation of the conditions which prevail on our Indian reservations (with high unemployment, economic suppression, poor housing, etc.) will tell you that the earlier figure of 61% is likely to be much closer to the actual level of poverty. The effect of this radical statis- tical adjustment, however, remains: programs which are allocated on the basis of these poverty figures are less likely to reach Indian elders. The Indian Health Service (INS) -- the Indian Health Service presented testimony at a hearing in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1986 which was sponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman when he was a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. In the IHS testimony it was stated that \"while Indian elders represent only 5% of the total IHS service population, they utilize 18% of the inpatient care resources.\" This statement was presented as proof that Indian elders receive more than their share of IHS services. 1 Source: Bureau of Census projections based on the 1980 census figures..87 We reject and resent this line of reasoning. Perhaps, it never oc-curred to IHS policy makers that the 18% utilization figure may havebeen more reflective of the actual level of need for services, andof the relatively higher costs associated with treating chronic anddegenerative illnesses of the elders, than it was an indication thatthey receive \"more than their share\" of services. We believe that aresource allocation methodology which is based purely on populationand utilization figures such as this is both short-sighted and dis-criminatory against those who are vulnerable, frail and most in needof health care and services. Another example of the discrimination which can and does result fromthe use of misleading statistics may be seen in the recent and ques-tionable adjustments IHS has made in its reported Indian life expec-tancy figures. Indian life expectancy was reported in 1980 to havebeen 63.1 ye2rs (or about eight years less than that of the generalpopulation). However, the Indian Health Service in 1986 reporteda rather remarkable and drastic increase in life expectancy to 71.0years (IHS testimony presented before Senator Bingaman, September 3,1986). This later figure is being presented by IHS as an indicationof their \"success\" in addressing the health care needs of Indianpeople, and one cannot help but wonder if this success was what Dr.Everett Rhoades, Director of the Indian Health Service, had in mindwhen he told a Congressional appropriations committee in 1987 that IHS did not need any more money than was budgeted for the prior fis-cal year. Contrary to the supposed success of the Indian Health Service is areport which was issued by the Senate special Committee on Aging in1986 which expressed some rather alarming mortality rates for Indianpeople as compared to the rates for the general population.Specifically, the report indicated that mortality rates for Indianpeople from various causes were considerably higher:--- deaths from alcoholism, 459% higher--- deaths from tuberculosis, 233% higher--- deaths from accidents, 155% higher--- deaths from diabetes, 107% higher--- deaths from pneumonia, 66% higher In studies conducted by the National Indian Council on Aging in 1981, 1982, it was found that as high as 40% of the adult population on some reservations had diabetes milletus. In the 1986 study, itwas found that as high as 50% of the elders on some Indian reserva-tions were afflicted with crippling arthritis. Other studies revealan excessively high incidence of hypertensive illness, circulatoryproblems and other morbidities among Indian elders. More recently,Doctors Spero Hanson and Donald Callaway have revealed some verydisturbing findings as to the effects of degenerative and chronicillnesses on the quality of life and the mental health of Indianelders. Mr. Chairman, the above findings clearly indicate that a) the IHSclaims of success in Indian health are greatly exaggerated, and b) the Indian Health Service has neglected the needs of Indian elders in its service delivery and budgeting priorities --- witness the ex-istence of specific budgeting categories and programs for women,infants, children and youth; as opposed to the total absence of anygerontological focus or specialized geriatric health care in the IHSservice delivery system; and the elimination from the IHS budget ofservices characteristically needed by the elderly (i.e., eyeglasses,hearing aids, dentures and prosthesis). The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BEA): -- the BIA, when asked if theyhave any special programs focusing on the needs of the elders,characteristically answers, \"We treat all age groups alike.\"Consequently, BIA does not keep any statistics on the elders, doesnot know what their needs are, nor how many elders are in theirservice population. It is not surprising, then, that there is noBIA initiative or program designed to address the needs of theelders -- unless we consider BIA's burial assistance one whichfocuses primarily on the elders; in which case, an elder must die tobecome eligible for this service. If this is not evidence enough that the BIA is practicing at leastpassive discrimination, consider the BIA-sponsored policy in its Housing Improvement Program, which requires that an elder \"wait histurn\" to receive needed repairs on his home, sometimes in spite ofthe fact that the elder may be living in a life-threatening housingsituation. Some elders will not live long enough for \"their turn\"to come up. 2/ Source: IHS statistics quoted in the Technical Report of the 1981 White House Conference on Aging.88 The Administration on Aging (AoA): -- the Administration on Aginghas previously reported in testimony before Senator Matsunaga of the Senate Subcommittee on Aging of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources (April, 1987) that 90% of the 'eligible' Indian elders are receiving services under title VI of the Older Americans Act (a title which is designed to provide nutrition and supportive services to older American Indians through direct grants to Indian tribes). This claim is being held up as evidence of the amazing 'success\" of the title VI program, leaving the impression that nearly all Indian elders participate in the program -- but the facts are these: a) just slightly more than one-fourth (136) of the 504 federally recog- nized tribes have title VI grants; b) a nationwide survey of these title VI grantees by the National In- dian Council on Aging in 1986 revealed that the grantees are able to serve only an average of 50% of their elders (not 90%) due to lack of funding; c) putting together the findings in a) and b) above, it is not dif-ficult to calculate the proportion of today's Indian elders who areactually served under title VI: approximately one-eighth of those who are living on the reservations (this does not include Indian elders who are residing in urban areas). d) the largest Indian tribe in the nation, the Navajo, with a popula- tion of more than 25,000 Indian elders, has only two title VI mealsites, serving less than 100 elders each. The remaining elders of the tribe, scattered over at a three-state area, must be served un- der title III; and these services are actually provided to only a small percentage of the total Navajo elderly population; e) the second largest Indian tribe in the nation, the Cherokee of Oklahoma, has an elderly population of more than 7,900 spread over a 14-county area. Due to lack of funds, the Cherokee title VI program is able to serve elders in only two (2) of its fourteen (14) counties; or 300 out of a total population of 7900 elders; f) the previously-mentioned NICOA survey (1986) found that some title VI grantees were serving meals only two or three days per week due to lack of funding. Others were paying program staff only 1/2-time for full-time work, and some sites had to shut down altogether; g) the Older Americans Act title VI language requires that title VI services be comparable to those provided under title III (i.e., that the grantees provide the full complement of supportive services as well as congregate and home-delivered meals). However, again due to lack of funding, this is not possible for most title VI grantees; and their elders are, therefore, deprived of services mandated under the Act; b) in 1984, when 43 new title VI grantees were added to the existingtotal of 83 grantees, the existing grantees experienced cut-backs infunding averaging $20,000 per grantee, further exacerbating an al- ready difficult service delivery budget situation; and i) of the 673 Area Agencies on Aging in the country (which administerthe title III funds) only 9 are operated by Indian tribes. On theother hand, most Area Agencies have not conducted effective outreach and targeting efforts. The unfortunate consequence of this is thatfar less than 1% of the total title III participants are Indian or Alaskan Native elders. In summary, then, the statistics reported by the Administration on Agingare both inaccurate and misleading, and services are not being targeted toward Indian elders who are among those who are in the greatest economic and social need -- even though the Congress has been very clear in its intention that Older Americans Act services be so targeted. The supposed \"success\" of the administration in this area is nothing to crow about. Taking all of the above into consideration, we contend that the Bureau of Census, the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs andthe Administration on Aging are practicing discrimination by means ofstatistical manipulation and justification of their failure to address adequately the needs of Indian elders. Discrimination Via Budgetary Negligence:89 Additionally, Mr. Chairman, we submit that Indian elders and their families are being discriminated against by means of the budgetary process, and through inappropriate prioritization of available resources by federal agencies. Whether these practices are intentional or have developed through sheer negligence, they represent de facto discrimination. Consider the following: a) economic development efforts on Indian reservations over the past several decades have been so minimal that unemployment on some reservations runs as high as 95% of the adult labor force; b) since 1980, funding for subsidized Indian housing has been reduced by over 70%, although Bureau of Census figures in 1970 and 1980 showed that the vast majority of homes occupied by Indian elders were substandard and generally in need of replacement or repair; c) since 1980, the Community Health Representatives program which is the primary in-home care service needed most by Indian elders, has been a program which has been targeted by the administration for elimination from the Indian Health Service budget; d) the Indian Health Service is already employing a highly dis- criminatory critereon in its resource allocation methodologies -- it is the critereon called \"years of productive life lost\" (or YPLL). It is the principle by which IH5 determines that budgetary resources and service priorities must go to the younger population groups based on the assumption that a younger life lost represents more potential \"years of productive life lost.\" Need I add my own com- nentary here, Mr. Chairman? I am appalled that our so-called \"enlightened society\" has so soon outgrown its need for the elders, and that any of us would think for a moment that an elder's life is of less value than that of a younger person. Perhaps, it is no ac- cident that the word \"euthanasia:! starts which \"euth-\" (youth). Who will be next? the disabled? the unemployed? the Indians? Whatever happened to \"inalienable rights,\" or \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\"? e) the Older Americans Act, which contains the only human services programs in all of the federal budget specifically designed to provide services to Indian elders as a targeted group, has been con- sistently stripped of its budgetary capability to keep pace with the growing needs of Indian elders, much less the needs of appreciable numbers of Indian elders on reservations and in urban areas across the country. Witness the following budgetary history of the Older Americans Act: a) title VI (direct grants to Indian tribes) was introduced into the Act in 1978, 13 years after the original passage of the Act; and it was not funded until 1980, two years after it was authorized; b) since 1980, while other programs of the Act were being increased substantially, title VI funding has experienced very minimal increases, and has had to share its resources among increasing numbers of grantees. For example, title III funding has increased by 75% since 1980 with no increase in the ratio of Indian to non- Indian participants (still at less than 1% Indian). At the same time that title III funding has increased by 75% title VI funding has increased by only 25% from $6 mil- lion in FY '80 to $7.5 million in FY '87 with a 50% in- crease in the number of grantees who must share in its limited resources; c) as a result of the passage on December 22, 1987 of the Budget Reconciliation Act, funding for title VI (the only Indian specific title in the Act) was reduced by 4.25% (from $7.5 million to $7.181 million), while some of the other programs of the Act were either increased as much as 2.2% or received new monies; d) in the pending Senate appropriations bill for Labor, HHS programs in fiscal year 1989, some budget categories are being given substantial increases for relatively less im- portant purposes, while title VI is only being restored to its FY '87 level of $7.5 million, I wish to call your attention to the appropriations for: a) the Employment Standards Administration increased by $6,780,000 (purpose: to add 43 FTE staff to the ESA)90 b) the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased by 513,916,000 (purpose: to add 53 FTE staff to the Bureau) c) title VI of the Older Americans Act increased by only $319,000 (purposed: to provide nutrition and supportive serv- ices to Indian elders). Somehow, Mr. Chairman, it seems to us that building a bureaucracy with more staff cannot be nearly so important as providing much needed meals and services to at risk Indian elders. This, I believe, is an unfair budgetary practice. Discrimination Via Public Polciy and Sentiment: Mr. Chairman, we see developing a very dangerous pattern in our public policy and in some pockets of public sentiment. All the way from the mis-informed statements that our government \"humored\" the Indians by giving them reservations, to those who would seek to deprive Indian tribes of their rights by \"re-negotiating\" their treaties, the anti- Indian spirit is having its way with the budget, with treaty rights cases before the courts, and within the administration of human services programs designed to help the truly needy. Discrimination is alive and well in our country -- in Indian country: -- the day of Gramm-Rudman is the day of the grim Redman; -- programs most needed by the most needy are being terminated by means of an insensitive budget-cutting mania; -- the first Americans in many ways, are the last to receive services; look at the reservation quality of life, if you don't believe me; -- states are disowning any and all responsibility to provide services to Indian people; or they are insisting that Indian tribes waive their sovereign immunity from law suit in order to receive services; -- and even our Congress is in hasty retreat from any sense of obliga- tion to fulfill the requirements of treaties struck with Indian tribes generations ago. One Senator described to me the mood of the Congress toward Indian treaties with these words: \"some in the Congress believe that the only treaty obligation of the government to the Indian tribes is to give to them an acre of land, a horse, a plow, and a blacksmith shop.\" It has been said, Mr. Chairman that the-true measure of the greatness of a society is not the level of the prosperity of its rich, but -rather what it does about the poverty of its poor. Mr. Chairman, please do something about the Indian elders. Please lead us in developing mean- ingful legislation and strategies for the creation of a caring society around our \"respected\" Indian elders. I have provided with this tes- timony a number of suggestions as to how we might go about doing just that, and I would like to have them entered into the record along with this written testimony. Thank you for your consideration.91 Recommendations 1. Increase funding for title VI of the Older Americans Act for fiscal year 1989 by $5 million, bringing the total for FY '89 to $12.5million. Offsets for this funding may be found in the proposed in- creases for: a) the Employment Standards Administration, being increased by $6,780,000 over fiscal year 1988 in order to add 43 FTE to the present staffing level; and b) the Bureau of Labor Statistics, being increased by $13,916,000 over FY '88 funding in order to increase the present staffing level of BLS by 53 FTE. 2. Draft and introduce legislation which will appropriate $5 million to establish an office of gerontology within the Indian Health Service, and to provide specialized training in geriatric health care at each IHS service unit, or to conduct regular geriatric clinics. 3. Draft and introduce legislation which would mandate the development of Indian elderly health promotion and mental health projects. 4. Draft and introduce legislation which will provide in-home care for Indian elders by means of establishment of home health agencies on Indian reservations. 5. Draft and introduce legislation which would fund housing improvement and housing construction programs which will focus on the needs of Indian elders. 6. Draft and introduce legislation which will provide supplemental in- come support programs for Indian elders who are not now covered by Social Security or SSI. 7. Draft and introduce legislation which will provide health care in-surance to Indian elders which can be used to enable them to access IHS or other health care services at levels of participation which are more commensurate with the levels of care they require. 8. Draft and introduce legislation which will provide for the long-term care needs of Indian elders, including in-home, community-based and nursing home care. 9. Conduct oversight hearings on the effectiveness of the Administra- tion on Aging and its network of State and Area Agencies on Aging in providing Older Americans Act services to older Indians. 10. Assure adequate representation of Indian tribes and Indian organiza- tions at the 1991 White House Conference on Aging. 11. Draft and introduce legislation or resolutions whinh reaffirm thevalidity of treaties with Indian tribes and which require that bothstate and federal agencies acknowledge their responsibility to provide services to Indian elders and their families. 12. Conduct oversight hearings dealing with the failure of IHS, BIA andother federal agencies to address the needs of the elders within their service populations. 13. Draft and introduce legislation~which will require the Bureau ofCensus to include the Indian Supplemental Questionnaire in the 1990Census of the Population in order to assure that statistical infor-mation needed for Indian human services programs continues to be available.92 Ites, 7 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STATEMENT OF DR. EVERETT R. RHOADES 0 DIRECTOR INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE Nr. Chairman and Meabers of the Committee: I- Dr. Everett R. Rhoades, Director of the Indian Health Sarvica (IHS). I appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony on this important hearing on our Aneriran Indian elders. Tne Indian Health service (IHS) is the Federal agency charged with adminiatering the principal health program for American Indiana and Alaska Natives. on January 4, 1988, by order of the Secretary of Health and Ha.an Services, the IHS bename one of seven agencies of the United States PublIc Health Service. The goal of the INS iE to raise the health status of American Indian and Alaska Native people to the highest possible level. its mission is threefold: 1) to provide or asaure the availability of high quality, comprehenaive, and accessible health serviceas 2) to provide increasing opportunities for Indians to mnage and operate their own health programsa and 3) to serve as a health advocate for Indian people. With this mission in mind, the InS is very much concerned with the growing numbhrs and needs of our American Indian and Alaska Native elders. They represent a very important focal point for the Indian family and cultural traditiona of the tribes. This is also the aegment of our servine population that ham the greatest need related to chronic and debilitating conditions. The Indian population is younger than that of the general United States Population as indicated by the median age cocporiaon from the 1980 Census, i.e., 22.6 versus 30.0. However, the Indian population is aging at an93 increasing rate. From 1960 to 1970, the Indian median age increased 1.2 years, from 17.2 years to 18.4 yearn. From 1970 to 1980, the increase as 4.2 yearn. As the Indian population is aging, Indians are beginning to asperience at a greater rate those diseases that are associated with an older population. During the period 1975 to 1985, the Indian mortality rate for malignant neoplasms (age-edjasted rate per 100,000 population) increased 21 percent, from 70.4 percent to 84.9 percent. The five leading causes of death for Indians aged 65 years and older in 1903-85 were 1) diseases of the heart, 2) malignant neoplasms, 3) cerebrovascular diseases, 4) pneumonia and influen.a and 5) diabetes nallitus. Older Native Americana are more likely to have more than one chronic disease present than non-Indian elders. The elderly Indian population is utilising a relatively high proportion of the health cars casnurcas There ware nearly 400,000 outpatient clinical impressions (i.e., reasons for outpetient nisits) recorded for patients aged 65 yeara or older in IHS facilities in PY 1987. This age group accounted for 8.8 percent of all impressions, considerably higher than their percentage of the total Indian population (5.3 percent). Persons aged 65 or older accounted for 8.2 percent of the clinical impressions in P7 1983, the percentage has been steadily rising since then. Diabetes mellitus was the leading specific cause of visits among the 65-and-over age group, while hypertensive disease was the second leading cause. The elderly Indian population is even a larger consuer, in relative terms, of inpatient services. in P7 1986, Indians aged 65 years and older accounted for 11.6 percent of hospital discharges from IHS hospitals and those hospitals that IHS contracts with. This was over double the percentage they comprise of the total Indian population (5.3 percent). In this age group, the four leading causes of hospitalieation in P 1966 were: 1) circulatory systee diseases, 2) respiratory system diseases, 3) digestive system diseases and; 4) genitourinary system diseases. The IHS in improving coordination with other Federal Agencies with the Administration on Aging (Ack), Health Hesourcee and Sernicsa Administration (HRSA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (8IA). Memoranda of Agreement have been established with particular emphasis including the special needs of elders. The IHS is emphasising health promotion and disease prevention (HP/DP) 89-721 -89 -494 activities including the elderly and linking with the promotion of scientific and technical activities such as with the National Institute on Aging (NIA) which carries out biomedical social and behavioral research and training on a wide range of issues relevant to the aging process and diseases of the elderly. The IHS also cooperates with the HRSA faculty training fellowship in geriatric medicine and dentistry for a stronger geriatric focus in the clinical disciplines. The IHS temporarily assigned Dr. J.T. Garrett, Deputy Associate Director, office of Health Programs to the Commissioner's Office, Administration on Aging as a Special Advisor for Native American elders. This assignment, initiated in March of this year, will be of six months duration and Dr. Garrett will assist the Administration on Aging in the organization and implementation of a newly proposed Office of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Hawaiian Natives in accordance with amendments to the older American Act. Activities include awarding grants to tribes for nutritional programs, providing technical assistance, establishing an interagency task force, and conducting Indian studies on Title III and Title VI of the Older American Act with recommendations and reports to Congress. The IHS is proud of this cooperative activity with the Administration on Aging, and we look forward to continued special emphasis on American Indians and Alaska Natives. Currently, joint activities include alcohol and drug prevention initiatives and training of Community Health Representatives for increased sensitivity to aging, debilitating, and limited activity of elders. Planning is underway for jointly sponsored meetings to cross-train AoA as well as IHS/tribal staff for special emphasis on diabetic foot care, alcohol prevention, nutrition, exploring mental health issues of our elders, and special studies for improved services and quality of care and life for Indian elders.95 The INS has placed significant emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention (HP/DP) in all INS areas. Each INS Area Office has an HP/DP plan in effect. During FY 1987 a special national conference on health promotion and disease prevention was held in which Tribal leaders and the IHS exchanged ideas and plans for a healthy future, which include the involvement of our Indian elders. The greatest impact on the overall health status of the American Indian and Alaska Native population will be achieved by promoting healthful life styles, instituting community injury control programs, and continuing the provision of disease prevention services. These advances require a different model of health care delivery than the 'traditional' physician-patient relationship and success will be achieved, not by physicians alone, but by the added involvement of health educators, public health officers and nurses, community health workers and traditional native healers. Equally important, success will depend upon the degree to which each community makes a commitment to changing the life style of all its members and to fully include this very important family and culturally related resource -the Indian and Alaska Native elder. I personally feel and I am confident that most of our INS staff would agree that providing services to and working with our Indian elders is an honor and a unique opportunity. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing the INS to provide testimony, in hopes that it will bring us all closer together in the best coordination of our efforts in serving our American Indian and Alaska Native elders so that they may have a good and healthful quality of life.96 Item 8 Department of Social Services OFFICE OF FIELD MANAGEMENT OFFICIAL HEARING OF THE SENATE AGING COMMITTEE \"The &Zcoy MiMe Hatt Thuanday, June 'igni zhock waves aft the way to the Potomac i6 it happened o66 the 'tezeivation.

The College shares in your belief that the older Native Americans are a forgotten minority. It is our hope that the Special Committe on Aging with the help of other interested organizations can overcome the problems facing the American Indian. ACHCA supports the Special Committe on Aging in appealing for the quality care of our elderly Native Americans. Sin erely,\\ ardL. Thor Executive Vice iresident THE NEED FOR LONG-TERM CARE AMONG THE NATIVE AMERICANS The American College of Health Care Administrators has over a quarter-century history of dedication to quality services through competent and caring long-term care administration. The long-term care administration profession is committed to providing comprehensive health, personal, and social services for persons who require various therapeutic, protective, and supervised environments and milieus. ACHCA's mission involves education, research, information dissemination, and accrediting of the professional long-term care administrator. The major focus of the American College of Health Care Administrators is on quality assurance activities that enhance the knowledge and skills of professional administrators and assure quality care and quality of life for nursing home patients and residents. Quality health-care should be available for all Americans. Now it is time to focus our attention to the quality of helath- care that Native Americans are receiving. An increasing concern is the availablility of long-term care for Native11ron99 Americans. In 1980 the Native Americans over age 65 numbered 109,000. By the year 1990, the number of older American Indians is estimated to be more than 200,000 (National Indian Council on Aging, Inc.). The need for long-term care is here and with the estimated population growth, today's need may become tomorrow's crisis. According to a study done in 1975 by Shannas and Tobin it was determined that 4, 150 elderly Native Americans receive long-term care. We are caring for only 10% of the Native American population on their homeland. This segment of the aged population is continuing to grow faster than any other group. In 1960 the average life expectancy of the Native American was 44; today it is 65 years (Westbrook, 1986), a significant increase compaired to the remaining population. The general life expectancy in the United States has also risen slightly, from 72 to 73.3 years. The need is here -we must provide long-term care to the Native Americans. Today there are nine nursing homes located on reservations. These nine homes provide care for 410 people (National Indian council on Aging, Inc.). Nursing homes are needed on the Native Americans reservations, due to the fact that the majority of the older American Indian population lives on one of the 600 reservations. Quality health care is not easily accessed, often because of geographic distance. Some reservations are less than one acre, others extend over 14 million acres. Therefore, many reservations are isolated, making it difficult to transport those who need health-care. Increasing the number of nursing homes on reservations would solve the problem of transportation and provide comfort to the aged in their own environment, an environment that is familiar. Native Americans have distinctive health-care needs. Common ailments are tuberculosis, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, hearing impairment, and sight impairment (Westbrook,1986). These health-care needs are slightly different than that of the general population, whose most common ailments osteoarthritis, diabetes, and angina. The physical needs of the Native American are slightly different, however the psychosocial needs are tremendously different.100 The obligation we have to the Native American goes beyond simply providing health-care. We must sensitize ourselves to the special needs of American Indians and address the problems that they face. There are a number of ethnic, cultural, and social barriers that must be overcome to provide quality care to the Native American. For example, the Native Americans are traditionally less educated than the remaining population; 29% of the American Indian population has had less than four years of educational training. Malnutrition is also a great problem faced by the Native American. Often malnutrition is the result of alcoholism or poverty. Native Americans are the poorest minority; 32% of those over 65 live below the poverty level (American Association of Retired Persons). Making quality long-term health care accessible by establishing facilities on reservations goes beyond providing for the physical needs of the elderly, it includes providing for the psychosocial needs that many Native Americans have. Native Americans have a strong sense of ethnicity. They have struggled to remain a distinct cultural group. Indian reservations and the regulations governing those reservations exemplify their desire and need to remain independent and distinct. Establishing and maintaining long-term care facilities on Native American reservations is a positive means of keeping the Native American culture alive. The elderly Native American depends greatly on his or her family and community. Keeping families together is one of the benefits of nursing homes located on reservations. Visits from friends and family to off-reservation nursing homes are difficult because of transportation problems; cars are rare on reservations and public transportation is often not dependable or accessible. As a result of the lack of company and companionship the aged often feel isolated and lonely. This isolation and loneliness in many cases has resulted in severe shock that results in premature death. Premature death is common for newly institutionalized Native Americans. The creation of long-term care facilities on reservations affords many possibilities for growth to the Native American101 community. The elderly Native Americans are the most respected members of the community; they know the history and folklore of their culture. It is the responsibility of the elderly to pass on their knowledge and wisdom to the younger generations. Facilities on reservations would allow for the exchange of information between generations and possibly act as community centers. It is the goal of every long-term care facility to give patients quality care and ensure quality of life. Providing quality of life includes providing for the special services and needs of the patient, including orienting the staff to the patients' cultural beliefs and practices. It is important to identify religious values, nutrition and eating habits, vocabulary, and history. There are over 500 different Native American tribes, speaking 250 different languages and living on 600 different reservations (Stitelman, 1982). Each tribe has its own values, traditions, and beliefs; it would be unfair to assume that one type of long-term care facility would be appropriate for all tribes. Each reservation needing a long-term care facility should identify its unique needs. Facilities can then be constructed and administrated with consideration to these traditions and needs. Long-term care facilities on reservations allow for more than a comfortable, familiar environment for the elderly, and a place to share Native American culture. It would also create employment for the younger Native Americans. For example, the construction and maintenance of the facility, and care of the elderly, would include the work of younger American Indians. Many Native Americans on reservations are forced to leave the reservation to find employment. The long-term care industry could provide the employment they need to stay on the reservation and preserve their culture. Native Americans have always been an extremely ethnocentric group; long-term care facilities would cater to their desire to remain ethnocentric. The Native American culture is the culture of our land it is our obligation and responsibility to help the Native Americans preserve their heritage.102 The American College of Health Care Administrators stands ready to assist in the professional development of Native American administrators through education, research, professional achievement, and a code of ethics. The mission of the college is to assure the quality care and quality of life for all nursing home residents and patients.103 Item 10 AMERICAN INDIAN ELDERLY: MENTAL HEALTH STATUS AND SERVICE NEEDS Sperc M. Manson Ph.D. Associate Professor and Director National Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research Department of Psychiatry University of Colorado Health Sciences Center 4200 East Ninth Avenue Denver, Colorado 80262 (303)-270-4600 Health problems play a large role in the lives of older American Indians (Schulz & Manson, 1984). For example, 73% of the elderly Indian population is estimated to be mildly to totally impaired in their ability to cope with the basics of daily living (National Indian Council on Aging, 1981). Forty percent of all adult Indians hive some form of disability (Indian Health Service, 1978). Liver and gall bladder disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes also occur far more frequently within this special population than in any other (Sievers & Fisher, 1981). Other health problems include obesity, hypertension, pneumonia, poor vision, and dental decay (West, 1974). The impact of these diseases is reflected in the significantly higher rates of depression among Indian elderly when compared to non-Indian elderly (National Indian Council on Aging, 1981; General Accounting Office, 1977). The physical as well as psychological consequences contribute substantially to the decreased longevity of this special population when compared to Whites (Hill & Spector, 1971; Sievers & Fishers, 1981; Manson & Callaway, in press). One can continue to list the health-related problems facing older American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indeed, four recent publications detail their excess morbidity and mortality and, in turn, disparity when compared to Whites as well as other ethnic minorities. These publications include: (1) Indian Health Care (1986) released by the Office of Technology Assessment; (2) Report of the Secretary ' s Task Force on Black and Minority Health (1985); (3) Bridginq the Gap: Report on the Task Force on Parity of Indian Health Services (1986) and its companion Indian Health Conditions (1986), and (4) Health and Behavior Among American Indians and Alaska Natives: A Research Agenda for the Biobehavioral Sciences (Manson & Dinges, 1988). However, the most telling example is embodied in the following case study recounted by Manson and Callaway (1988):104 B.H. is an elderly Navajo man suffering fromParkinson's disease. B.H. lives with his wife of 40years in a one room earth covered hogan withoutelectricity or running water. B.H. 's wife suffers fromsevere arthritis in her legs and can not walk even withthe aide of a walker. A wheelchair would be of no useto her as the sand and mud (during the rainy season) surrounding her hogan would not support the narrow gauge wheels of a wheelchair and she would become stuckwithin several yards of leaving her hogan. B.H. also has great difficulty getting around. He usually spends most of the day sitting in a very worn easy chair, alert except for short periods following theadministration of his medication. Tremors and weakness in his extremities make it very difficult for him toaccomplish even the most simple chores, e.g. carryingdrinking water inside from barrels stored outside the hogan. B.H. and his wife could not care for themselves were it not for three important factors. A Tribal Home Care Program pays their daughter-in-law minimum wage to spend four hours a day with them, helping with cooking, washing and other chores. The daughter-in-law, even though she lives two miles away, would probably provide these services for free. However, the income she earns from this program is critical in keeping her family'spickup running. Her husband, B.H. 's son, has workedonly four months during the last year. His sporadic wage income, his wife's meager salary and contributions from his parents (whose combined income is about $500/month) help support him, his wife and their fourchildren. In return, the son's services are critical tothe support of his parents. He hauls wood for fuel andwater for drinking, cooking and bathing. He contributes meat from his wife's small herd to his parent's diet(prohibitively expensive otherwise). He also providescritical transportation to a hospital some 45 miles from their residence. At least once a week he takes hisparents on an outing to the Trading Post where theysocialize and purchase necessities. Both of his parent's degenerative illnesses are monitored by a Community Health Representative (CHR) who takes vital signs, delivers medicine and tries toanticipate any acute episode. During the last three years due to federal budget cuts the Navajo Tribe haslost over $100 million dollars in revenue. Further funding for NHR's and Home Health Care are problematic. In addition, the Indian health Service (IHS) has cut its field health staff in half, doubling the area ofresponsibility for the remaining staff. The reservation economy is extremely bleak. B.1. 's son must compete for wage employment in an environment of 65% unemployment -although the Census would count him as being employedbecause he had some employment during the 12 monthreference year. B.H. and his wife's diseases will become progressively worse but it is doubtful whether he or his wife would accede to being placed in a nursing home. However, if they were placed in such an institution it is clearthat outlays paid for their support by the federal government would be 20 to 40 times the amount now being spent to support their portion of the CHR and HomeHealth Care programs. These situations find their parallels in our cities as well. Examples of which will be brought to your attention later this morning. One expects that the mental health consequences of these circumstances are considerable. Little has been done, however, to105 demonstrate how such deprivation translates into emotional and mental problems or low levels of morale and life satisfaction among older American Indians. Only six studies have been published which address this topic. They are essentially regional and focus on specific aspects of the stress, illness, and coping process. Nonetheless, these efforts provide some insight into the nature and magnitude of the problem. In l980, I and several colleagues (Manson, in press) studied the daily problems faced by 231 older Indians living in two Pacific Northwest reservations and in a nearby city. Our findings indicated that certain types of problems--particularly physical illness and resulting limitations on activities of daily living-- occur with alarming frequency among these individuals, resist solution in terms of the social, economic, and psychological resources available to them, and, consequently, engender high levels of persistent stress. The vast majority of these older adults were unaware of potentially appropriate services, did not know how to seek information about needed care, and expressed concern about what people might think of them if they did seek such help. Over 80% of this sample had seen a primary health care provider within the month prior to interview. Slightly less than 10% of those experiencing significant stress due to physical health problems reported that their providers had inquired about their emotional well-being; only 3% were offered specific information about supportive services. Clear urban/rural differences emerged, revealing that the older American Indians who lived in the city were even more disadvantaged than their reservation counterparts. More recently, I and my colleagues have been annually interviewing 320 older members of four Pacific Northwest reservations about various aspects of their mental and physical health status. These individuals were originally selected because they had been seen for the first time in a local health clinic during the 1984 calendar year for one of three chronic physical health problems: rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease. Using a widely accepted screening tool, over 32% of these individuals were deemed to be suffering from clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms, more than twice the rates reported by recent studies of older Whites with similar106 types of physical illnesses. Subsequent medical chart reviews indicated that less than 7% of their primary care providers-- physicians and community health nurses--had observed (or at least documented) these symptoms. Their reported life satisfaction was similarly low; again with little apparent recognition by providers. There also is a strong relationship among these depressive symptoms, low life satisfaction, and ability to perform activities of daily living. It is not too surprising, then, that they are generally dissatisfied with the nature of .the health care available to them. Several years ago, we conducted another study among a small number (n=104) of primary care providers who serve American Indians in two western states. Our focus was on attitudes toward and perceptions of long-term care. Their definitions of long-term care almost invariably centered around institutionalization: 81% (n=84) of them named nursing homes as the only or primary service setting. Furthermore, when asked about the service objectives of long-term care, the vast majority of these providers emphasized rehabilitation and protection, seldom prevention or prolonged longevity. Lastly, in response to the degree to which long-term care is concerned with enhancing patient status, the respondents invariably selected physical functioning and rarely noted psychological or social functioning. Unfortunately, our recognition and understanding of these problems has been slow to mature in light of extensive documented need. Considerable programmatic emphasis has been placed upon identifying and intervening in similar circumstances among the elderly in the general population. New preventive and promotive technologies have resulted. Yet little of this has found its way to Indian and Native communities. A concerted effort should be undertaken to ameliorate the physical and psychological disabilities that plague older American Indians, to lessen the crushing burden that their illnesses place on already stressed family care-givers, and to assist local communities in developing innovative responses to the ensuing needs.107 Item 11 Testimony Submitted by Theodore H. Koff, Ed.D. Kristine Bursac, M.P.A. Arizona Long Term Care Gerontology Center 1807 East Elm Tucson, Arizona 85719 LONG TERM CARE AND NATIVE AMERICANS Many variables will impact the future use of long term care services by the Native American elderly population. Projections regarding the future demand for long term care services should address not only demographic shifts in the age of the Native American population, but also trends in mortality, stability of social supports, functional status and technological advances over time. Current Status of the Elderly American Indian Between 1970 and 1980, the number of elderly American Indians 60+ has increased by 73%, from 63,000 to 109,000. It is expected that this number will reach over 200,000 by 1990. In the last 10 years, the life expectancy of Native Americans has increased by about six years which is almost identical for that of all races in the United States The incidence of chronic illness and the need for health and social support services increase with age. Chronic illness is found among 50% of the total rural Indian population. Impairment levels of American Indians 55 and older are comparable to non-Indian U.S. elderly 65 and older. Rural Indians 45 and older are comparable to non-Indian elderly 65 and older.* Of major significance are the implications of these trends on the delivery of quality health and social services to elderly Native Americans. Socioeconomic status of elderly American Indians is significantly worse than that of the general population. Over 69% of Indians 65+ have incomes below the poverty level, as compared with 25% of the general United *A.ne,.caic -lnchli.,, Elderlyv A NA 'iii Lci ci i Na S l i h-;11 ldi- nit ii i- Aging, 1981, p. 31108 States population.

Speciai attenton and enhanced financial support must be given to the deveiopment of these long term sate systems to ensue eoordioation cith existing tribal services as cell as toreae a frameoirk for the future delivery of quality care within a co-prehenui-e health delivery system. Some of the major lsses or concerns .oofronting tribes in the deve-lnpmen of co-mounity and in-home services are:110 1. What and how should various federal, state and local agencies begin to coordinate their resources to ensure the planning, development and availability of long term care alternatives to titioial izarion? Who andl what kind of technical nssislt .mc will he avaiilaibl c t- I besll)( to plan and l-ve luop cnoprelnlnsivy 111tm i nld procedures (funding and administrative) for aging programs and services, including cultural and traditional considerations? 2. Eligibility standards for community-based long term care services differ depending upon funding source(s) (federal, state or local agencies). Eligibility determinations need to be sensitive to demographics of tribal populations and existing delivery systems. Indians who reside on reservations should be afforded the full range of long term care services available to the non-Indian population. 3. Essential to the appropriate allocation of resources and the provision of quality chronic care services is the development and implementation of tribal junctional and social assessment data bases for Native American elderly populations. Assessments should be compatible with the current tribal service delivery systems and be culturally relevant and sensitive to client needs. Tribes and their service providers should be authorized to enter into administrative agreements with the state and federal governments so that assessments are conducted which will insure that appropriate admissions and services are provided to each individual. 4. In order to select and monitor appropriate home and community-based services for elderly Native Americans a case management system must be implemented and coordinated with tribal service providers. Administrative funds (state or federal) must be made available for training and maintaining case management staff. 5. Based on the strong intergenerational ties between Native American family members, opportunities for the continued support and training of informal caregivers must be provided for on-reservation families and friends. Who and what funding sources need to be made available to maintain and strengthen informal support networks on the reservation? 6. A legislative mandate needs to be initiated which would allow the Administration on Aging to coordinate Title III and Title VI of the OAA and provide for the direct flow of federal funds (Title III and Title V) to Indian tribes. Who at the Administration on Aging will be responsible for the administration of this program? 7. Currently there exists a lack of public transportation on the reservations. Most transportation to health, social and recreational services is provided by relatives or friends of the elderly or chronically ill person needing assistance. Additional funding is necessary to enhance the capacities of tribes to provide much needed transportation services. 8. The level of edncat ional at Irai issent of lTdi;Han lackill of culturally relevant training materials. Efforts need to be initiated for the education and training of Native American long term care services providers, including both initial training curricula to teach basic skills as well as curricula for upgrading knowledge of service delivery and care of the chronically ill Native American. Where and how will additional training funds be generated? Who will be responsible for the design and development of culturally relevant and sensitive training materials. Summary It is with great urgency and of utmost importance that policymakers begin to examine and, when appropriate, reexamine the impact of 'select\" public policies on the delivery and development of long term care services for chronically ill Native Americans. It is essential that a national Indian long term care policy be developed and mandated to ensure the delivery of quality comprehensive care within an environment built on mutual concern, dignity and respect.Characteristics of Eight Nursing Homes Located on Tribal Landsl Name American Indian Chinle Blackfeet Oneida Toyei Carl LagunaLocation Ar__izona Arizona Arizona Montana Wisconsin Arizona Nebraska Arizona New Mexico Total BedsNumber of Beds 96 79 49 50 66 25 20 25 410Types of Beds2 SNF INT PC Other3 X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X 1A Profile of American Indian Nursing Homes.

S. Senate Washington. D. C. 20510 Honorable Larry Pressler: Most Idaho Indian Elderly Nutrition Service Delivery is remote and miles apart from the nutrition sites. Some are divided into districts, for example, the Fort Hall Indian Reservation has five districts and only two are served by the Fort Hall Elderly Nutr- ition Center. The third district is being served by Title III under the area V. The nearest Nutrition Center to this district (Bannock Creek) is the American Falls Elderly Nutrition Center. This title III Program is contracted to serve the Indian Population in this remote area thru the Pocatello Elderly Nutrition Center. The other two districts do not receive any nutrition service. Both districts are quite a few miles from the Fort Hall Nutrition site. The Shoshone-Paiute have a small Nutrition Center which is very under funded and under staffed. Their reservation is located in Idaho and Nevada. Their Nutrition Program is under Title VI. The Nez Perce have two Nutrition Centers, one which is located in Lapwai and the other in Kooskie. It is quite a few miles apart. This Nutrition Program is under Title VI and is very under funded. The Couer d'Alene Tribal Nutrition Center is located in Plussser, Idaho. They have a problem in their funding. They serve only one meal a week and are under s:. and under funded. Their Tribal Business Council will not help in their fusling. They are in with three other tribes under Title VI. Now they have enought qualified members to apply for their own grant. They are now working towards this goal.114 We have a communication problems here in Idaho. We have an Idaho Indian Council on aging and we meet quarterly. We have the Nat- ional Executive Director attend our meetings when available. He offers to us the information on the national level. The Executive Director attends two or three meetings during the year. Congress appropriated more funding to the Aging program. The appropriations Committee reduced all the grants for the Idaho Tribes under Title VI. We expected an increase in our grant but were cut $7,000.00. The same with the state programs for the Aging. They never include the tribes into their budgets because we are funded under Title VI. This is not all the problems of the Idaho Indian Aging programs. The Idaho Tribal programs on aging have more problems than we can deal with concerning housing, health problems, and financial hardships, which includes transportation. Any advice or any type of assistance from your office or any other department who is willing to offer any type of assistance or in- formation is very much appreciated. I thank you for your reply.

Washftso@. D.C. 20038 Tdeph-e. (202) 887-5280 STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL SENIOR CITIZENS LAW CENTER Prepared by Alfred J. Chiplin, Jr., Esq. with Donna Shea, Law Clerk 'THE AMERICAN ELDERLY INDIAN: THE FORGOTTEN POPULATION\" HEARING BEFORE THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING July 21, 1988, Pine Ridge, SD Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, the National Senior Citizens Law Center (NSCLC) is a national back-up center that assists Legal Services Corporation (LSC) and Older Americans Act (AoA or the Act) funded legal assistance providers across the country in providing legal representation to elderly clients. We appreciate this opportunity to present our views and comments, the focus of which are barriers to services for older indians under the Older Americans Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a73001, et sea., amended in 1987, P.L. 100-175, 100 Stat. 926 (Nov. 29, 1987). I coordinate the AoA funded activities of our office and provide technical assistance to legal assistance advocates about the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations and about AoA policies and guidelines that impact on the delivery of AoA funded legal assistance. Summarv of Testimonv 1. Older indians are significantly under-served through AoA resources. 2. Greater outreach efforts are necessary in order to reach older indians. 3. Language and cultural considerations must be part of efforts to target and serve older indians. 4. Legal assistance is an important access service for older indians.116 Some twenty-two (22) years after its enactment, and after several reauthorizations, the Act should be an efficient vehicle for addressing the fundamental needs of all of America's aging population. However, the American Indian elderly population is still not receiving assistance appropriate to its numbers. In the 1987 amendments to the Act, Congress sought to do more to address the needs of older indians by providing for grants to Indian tribes for supportive services and for nutrition programs. Awarding the money and implementing the services, however, pose complicated problems. Methods for reaching older indians, whether through state and area agencies on aging or through other outreach methods are in serious need of development and extension. Under the guise of -flexibility,' the Administration on Aging, the federal agency with responsibility for the overall administration of the Act, has taken the position that it need not provide direction and guidance to state and area agencies on how to extend services to specifically targeted population groups such as older indians. A central problem with this approach is that it leaves a serious gap in leadership, planning, and service delivery. This gap acts as an effective barrier to developing programs and outreach efforts that could make AoA funded supportive services programs (legal assistance, transportation, health promotion, etc) truly available to and viable for older indians. A critical aspect of developing services for all groups under the AoA is the -state plan.\" This plan, as is true with the \"area agency plan,\" is to be developed through public participation. State and area agencies are to have a mechanism to obtain and to consider the views of older persons. Sadly, neither the current nor the recently proposed regulations implementing the Act provides guidance for facilitating the the development of such plans. This lack of guidance should prove'especially difficult in obtaining the input of the elderly indians. As such, this omission acts as a significant barrier not only to plan development but to the actual receipt of services.117 With respect to plan development, there is also the question of language. What language(s) will be used in notices of public hearings on state and area plans? In what language(s) will public hearings be conducted? Finding the older indian is part of the obligation to target those in greatest social and economic need. This involves convenient access to information and referral services and community center services that take into account cultural and language differences. While it is true that state and area agencies on aging have not seen the value of legal assistance for the elderly population generally, this oversight is all the more detrimental to older indians as older indians are often the \"poorest of the poor.\" The recognition of legal assistance as an access service along with specific efforts to develop and to implement such services for older indians can function as a tool for addressing discrimination in community services, in public and private housing, in employment, and in educational opportunities for older indians. It is of vital importance that additional fora such as this one are conducted. It is only when the problems of specific segments of our population are identified and made the focus of in-depth scrutiny that we as a nation begin to act. As a nation, it is imperative that we make the Older Americans Act an Act for all older Americans, including older indians.118 Item 14 WRITTEN TESTIMONY PRESENTED BY THE FEDERAL COUNCIL ON THE AGING FOR INCLUSION IN RECORD OF HEARING HELD BY SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1988 ENTITLED: THE AMERICAN INDIAN ELDERLY: THE FORGOTTEN POPULATION The Federal Council on the Aging (FCoA) was created in 1973 and is authorized by Section 204 of the Older Americans Act, as amended. The Council is composed of 15 members selected by the President and the Congress. Council members, who are appointed for three-year terms, or continue to serve until they are reappointed or a successor is appointed, represent a cross-section of rural and urban older Americans, national organizations with an interest in aging, business, labor, and the general public. According to the statute, at least nine members must themselves be older individuals. The President selects the Chairperson of the Council from among the appointed members. The FCoA is mandated to meet quarterly and at the call of the Chairperson. Functions of the Council include: Continuously reviewing and evaluating Federal policies, programs and activities affecting the aging which are conducted or supported by Federal departments and agencies in order to assess their value and impact on the lives of older Americans. Serving as spokesperson on behalf of all older Americans by making recommendations to the President, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner on Aging, and to the Congress with respect to Federal policies regarding the aging and federally conducted or assisted programs and other activities relating to or affecting them. Informing the public about the problems and needs of the aging by collecting and disseminating information, conducting or commissioning studies and publishing their results, and issuing reports. Providing public forums for discussing and publicizing the problems and needs of the aging and obtaining information relating to those needs by holding public hearings and by conducting or sponsoring conferences, workshops and other such meetings. The Council is required by law to prepare an annual report for the President on the Council's activities and recommendations for the ensuing year. During its February 1987 meeting, the FCoA approved a recommendation to hold the May meeting in Pierre, South Dakota, with the theme being Methods and Practices for Serving Rural and Native Americans.119 Because the testimony, experiences and activities the FCoA members encountered were so meaningful and productive, it was decided to have staff make a compilation of all data pertaining to the May meetings. This print was distributed to key policy makers in the public and private sectors involved with rural and native American affairs. Noteworthy among the testimony received from the Cheyenne River Sioux and the Sioux Nation Commission on Aging, Eagle Butte, were the following facts: 1. Nutritional programs among Sioux need careful study because of high incidence of diabetes. 2. Home-health care-delivery to tribal members is in need of native American personnel and added funding. 3. Congregate housing for elderly could be answer on reservations but \"Indian way of life' makes it hard to institute. 4. Swing bed program in IHS hospitals would help make up for lack of nursing homes in or near reservations. 5. Tribal councils must take a more enlightened and active part in serving needs of Indian elderly. 6. Health care programs though still inadequate contribute to increasing numbers of Indian elderly though life expectancy of native Americans is still 4 years less than national average. 7. I.H.S. community health representative program works at local levels using tribal members who have had basic health training. Compared to \"Chinese barefoot doctors.\" 8. Rejuvenation of intergenerational bonding (a tribal heritage) is being aided by Foster Grandparent Programs. 9. Less funding for Title VI of OAA by Congress in 1988 inexplicable. 10. Health care of elderly not locally based and often exacerbated by language barrier. 11. Drugs among younger tribal members lead to elder abuse. 12. Dietary linkage between diabetes and surplus commodities. 13. Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management, spending more on wild horses and burrow care than is appropriated for OAA Title VI. (See below). The FCoA later in executive session took the following action: 1. It was moved and seconded that staff be authorized to approach proper HHS officials regarding the \"swing bed issue\" involving the Eagle Butte reservation I.H.S. hospital. Dr. Sloan was thought to be the best South Dakota contact person for INS input with State Director Vogel to be kept informed of FCoA actions.120 2. Council requested staff to obtain Agriculture department information regarding surplus commodities effect on high incidence of diabetes among Sioux tribal population. Could products be selected with this anomoly in mind? 3. Staff was instructed to research transportation initiatives for rural areas which might result in forum on this aspect of services at a future FCoA meeting. 4. Staff was instructed to contact the National Institute on Aging regarding the requests of Dr. Sloan of IHS and Bernie Long, IHS clinician, for data base assistance in formalizing treatment of diabetes among the Sioux people. 5. Members requested staff to provide numbers and funding distribution data regarding increase of eligible tribes effecting Title VI. 6. It was agreed that if the Older Americans Act is amended to allow broader tribal participation in Title III, the ensuing AoA regulations should be monitored carefully. Members of the FCoA were most distressed by testimony by one witness, Wayne Ducheneaux, Chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Mr. Ducheneaux pointed out that Congress has appropriated twice as much money for administering the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act than for Title VI of the Older Americans Act which provides benefits and services for older native Americans. Current appropriations reflect exactly the same imbalance. Thank you Senator Pressler for giving the FCoA this opportunity to present our concerns for the plight of native American elders.121 Item 15 BOX 248 Sioux MARTY, So.

Sone reservations have de- veloped tribally operated nu-sing homes for their elderly; perhaps this should be explored here on the Yanl:ton Sioux Reservation for those elderly so inclined. in addition xo the foregoing concerns, the Yank-- ton Sioux elderly expressed the following misfortunes befallen them: 1. There is no advocacy program to represent the needs and problems of the elderly to the tribal government. 2. Lack of transportation systems to assist the elderly when the need arises. 3. The elderly are too idle. A program for the elderly could noe1 to remedy this deficiency. 4. There is a need for better police protection in the form of additional police personnel. 5. The housing conditions are nearle helpless, cer- tainly not hopeless, but pretty well pitiful. The Yelnkton Sioux Elderly Advisory Board ex- pressed it's desire to administer the elderly comelexes rather than the Indian Housing staff. Kir. Pressler, the Yankton Sioux Elderly Case Management Services would like to express our supp- ort for any proposal which, if adopted, nould improve vastly the operation of a program of vital importance to efforts by tribes and tribal members to engage in123 activities which benefit Indian elderly. We, therefore, strongly urge the congress to adopt measures that will permit the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide fund- ing or grant monies for programs other than direct services to clients as is the present case. We likes wise strongly urge support for the existing federal programs serving the elderly on this reservation and nationwide, and at a funding level consistent with the cost of living fluctuations. \"Pursuant to treaties whereby Indian tribes exchanged vast land areas in return for the promise of federal support for Indians, the federal government has a trust obligation to assist tribes in their quest for relief of distress and conservation of health among Indian elderly.\" I recount here in summary form the dark descript- tions of the welfare system reported as late as 1928 as a reminder that contemporary society be ever mind- ful of, and responsive to, the needs of the elderly: \"Old, crippled, almost helpless Indians are required to cone to the agency office in all sorts of weath- er to get their supplies. On several reservations the survey team saw poorly clad, old People, with feet soaked by long walks through snow and slush, huddled in the agency office waiting for the arrival of the superintendent or other officer who could give them an order for rations to keep them from act- ual starvation.\" Fortunately, the present situation of our elderly is better, yet, Mr. Pressler, and disting- uished members of the Senate Aging Committee, the elderly on the Yankton Sioux Reservation are not persuaded that their needs and concerns are adequat- ely met. The Yankton Sioux elderly stand collective- ly opposed to any budget reduction in Title VI fund- ing, to any reductions in Indian Health Centers, hospitals, to Social Security changes, to the Food Stamp programs, and Medicare/Medicaid, and urge the creation of an office on Aging within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Lastly, to any overall reductions in124 programs designed to provide for their dignity, se- curity, and welfare guaranteed them. The elderly on the Yankton Sioux Reservation understand that to create a comprehensive elderly Indian program on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in- vokes such questions as: 1. Necessity of such a program. 2. Type and range of such a program.3.. What agency should administer the program. Again, the consensus of the elderly is that the Yankton Sioux Tribe is in a better position to hear and be responsive to elderly needs, and that moreover the responsibility rests with tribal govern- ment. However, since the Yankton Sioux Indian Reser- vation area is disfavorably characterized with 1.) extreme poverty, 2.) high unemployment, 3.) poor. health, and 4.) low educational attainment, then it becomes the duty of the federal government to assist this tribe in it's quest to provide a safe and sani- tary environment for the elderly by virtue of treaty commitments. In conclusion, we strongly impress upon the committee the urgency of remedying the distress of the elderly on the Yankton Sioux Reservation and nationwide for the unmeasurable benefits proposed and supported here will uplift the spirit in an area that has been utterly deprived.125 Item i6 TESTIMONY BY COMMISSIONER ON AGING CAROL FRASER FISK U.S. ADMINISTRATION ON AGING Senator Pressler, I want to thank you for this opportunity to offer testimony today on benefits and services to Indian elders under the Older Americans Act. The Administration on Aging is deeply committed to assuring that all American Indian elders are afforded the opportunity to participate fully in Older Americans Act programs. In my statement. I wish to present an overview of services to American Indian elders under the Act and to describe the progress made by the Administration on Aging in implementing the 1987 Amendments to the Older Americans Act (PL 100-175) as they affect Indian elders. Title III of the Older Americans Act provides for grants to State and community programs on aging. Title III is designed to build comprehensive systems of services for older persons in communities throughout the Nation. The goal of this effort is to provide opportunities for older persons to live independent. meaningful and dignified lives in their own homes and communities as long as possible. Resources are made available to assist communities to provide supportive services such as information and referral, transportation, and legal assistance. and nutrition services including both congregate and hone-delivered meals. Title III programs are administered by State Agencies on Aging and the area agencies on aging that the State agencies designate. There are currently 662 area agencies on aging. State agencies have designated nine American Indian tribal organizations as area agencies on aging. In FY 1987 there were 39,506 older Indians (age 60 or over) who received supportive services under Title III, Part B, of the Older Americans Act. A total of 29,458 older Indians received congregate meals under Title III, Part C-1 while 7,997 older Indians received home-delivered meals under Title III, Part C-2. 89-721 -89 -5126 In 1978 Congress amended the Older Americans Act to enact Title VI, a grant program specifically for American Indian tribal organizations. The 1978 amendments set forth the relationship between Title III and Title VI. Services provided under Title VI are to be comparable to those provided under Title III. The 1987 amendments to the Act made significant administrative and programmatic changes in Title VI. Previously the Act had prohibited an Indian elder who was eligible to receive services under Title VI from receiving services under Title III. This prohibition was deleted in 1987. The 1987 Amendments also revised Title VI to provide for two parts, Part A for American Indian and Alaskan Native elders, and a new Part B for Native Hawaiian elders. Grants may be made under Part B only if the total appropriation for Title VI (Parts A and B combined) exceeds $7,500,000. In the current fiscal year (FY 1988), the Administration on Aging has awarded $7,181,000 of Title VI funds to 136 tribal organizations. All programs provide meals for Indian elders. Supportive services such as information and referral, transportation, legal, ombudsman, and in-home health vary from Tribe to Tribe according to the need of the elders. On reservations receiving both Title III and Title VI funds, the services are coordinated. Regional Office staff of the Administration on Aging carry out a range of training, technical assistance and other management functions designed to assure high quality programming by State agencies and tribal organizations. Program performance data for FY 1986, the latest year for which we have complete data, indicate that the Title VI program continues to maintain a very high participation rate. Of the eligible population of 35.015 in FY 1986, about 908 participated in nutrition services. n 601 received one or more supportive services. The two supportive services most frequently used are transportation and information and referral. Let me note in this connection that the Title VI program attracts a large number of volunteers (approximately 60% of staff) who assist in providing services to Indian elders.127 In addition to activities under Titles III and VI of the Act, tribal organizations are also encouraged to submit applications for grants under Title IV, Training, Research, and Discretionary Projects and Programs. Several sections of the FY 1988 Title IV announcement were of particular relevance to Tribes--Research on Native American Aging, Minority Management Traineeship Program, Training for Indian Tribe Directors of Title VI Programs, and Prevention and Treatment of Alcoholism among older Indians. Beyond the different types of grants authorized by the Older Americans Act which benefit Indian elders, the Act, by the 1987 Amendments, also calls for the establishment of an Office for American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian Programs within the Administration on Aging. I have initiated a series of specific steps to establish the Office, which is to be headed by an Associate Commissioner on American Indian., Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian Aging, to be appointed by the Commissioner. To assist me in the process of setting up the new Office and implementing other statutory provisions affecting Indian elders, Dr. J. T. Garrett from the Indian Health Service has been temporarily assigned to serve as my Special Advisor for Native American Elders. Dr. Garrett is a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service and is a member of the Eastern Band of Cherokees. I have also assigned selected AoA staff to assist Dr. Garrett in carrying out a variety of responsibilities relative to the 1987 Amendments on Native American elders. The necessary materials to organize the new Office have been submitted within the Department. In addition to the establishment of the Office for American Indian., Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian Programs and the appointment of an Associate Commissioner, the 1987 Amendments include other significant requirements which affect the wellbeing of Indian elders. These requirements include: the establishment of a permanent interagency task force on older Indians, the preparation of a special report on services for Indians elders, and a continuing assessment of the services available to older Indians. The task force is to consist of representatives of departments and agencies of the Federal Government with an interest in128 ' older Indians and their welfare. Chaired by the Associate Commissioner on American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Aging, the task force is charged with making recommendations to facilitate the coordination and improvement of services to Indian elders. Plans for implementation of the task force have been prepared pending approval of the proposed Office for American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian Programs. The 1987 Amendments also call for the Commissioner on Aging to enter into a contract with a public agency or nonprofit private organization to conduct a thorough study of the availability and quality of services under the Act. Information developed is to include an analysis of how many Indians are participating in Title III and Title VI programs, a description of how these grants are awarded to tribes, and an analysis of how well the Administration on Aging is assuring that services under Title VI are comparable to those under Title III. This report is to be submitted to Congress by December 31, 1988. Arrangements for collecting data for the study have been implemented through an Interagency Agreement with the Indian Health Service. Finally, the Amendments also require the Associate Commissioner on American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Aging to undertake an evaluation of the adequacy of outreach to Indian elders under Title III and Title VI. Information on these services will be included in the annual report required by section 207(a) of the Older Americans Act. The Interagency Agreement with the Indian Health Service will also provide for studies on services to Indian elders which will report on the status of service delivery, outreach, and coordination between III and VI. The Administration on Aging is committed to strengthening the development of comprehensive community based systems to more effectively serve Indian elders. I am pleased that the Administration on Aging is in a position to be even sore responsive to the critical issues and needs of our special and unique population of American Indian elders. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to provide written testimony on behalf of the AoA in its mission to better coordinate and serve our American Indian elders.129 Item 17 NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN HOUSING COUNCIL 321 D Sheet, N.E. 2nd Floor Washington, D.C. 20002 Georg 11(2 546401 Testimony of Virginia E. Spencer Before The Senate Special Committee on Aging Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, my name is Virginia Spencer and I am Executive Director of the National American Indian Housing Council. I am pleased to provide you with testimony on housing and the American Indian elderly. I also want to thank you, Senator Pressler, and other members of this Committee, for your support and commitment to Indian housing expressed by your passing the \"Indian Housing Act of 1988,\" Public Law 100-358. American Indian and Alaska Native Housing The 1980 Census counted 1.4 million American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts in the United states, and may well have missed many more. About half of the Indian population lives either on reservations or in rural areas near those reservations. About two thirds of the 1980 rural Indian population (449,781) lived on reservations, tribal trust lands, historic Indian areas in Oklahoma or Alaska Native Villages. Assuming that Indian population has increased at the 1970-80 rate, there are now over one million rural and reservation Indians. A tragically high proportion face almost unsurmountable housing problems. Almost one quarter of all American Indians live in housing that either lacks basic plumbing facilities or is overcrowded, four times the proportion for the country as a whole. One reason for this is poverty: Indians are more than twice as likely to be poor as other Americans. In addition to poor housing, a safe water supply is a major problem on many reservations. While the incidence of unsafe water for the nation as a whole is about 3%, the average for Indians on reservations is 20-25%. According to the 1987 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) survey of reservation housing, in 1987, only half (49.9%) of the 186,000 households on Indian reservations lived in standard housing. Almost one household in ten (8.9%) lived in housing that was so bad it needed to be replaced. One household in five (21.5%) lived in units needing rehabilitation. Perhaps worst of all, more than one household in four (28.6%) had no housing of their own, and either lived doubled up with relatives or friends, or in cars, tents, or temporary shelters. In all, BIA found a need for 93,000 new or substantially rehabilitated homes on Indian reservations. In 1970, the comparable figure was 63,000. Experience has demonstrated that neither the regular pro- grams of HUD nor the somewhat more flexible, rural-oriented programs of the Farmers Nose Administration (FmHA) have proved usable in Indian country. Special housing programs are needed to meet Indian housing needs. Yet a series of programs which have worked effectively in providing decent housing on Indian reserva- tions has suffered deep cuts in recent years. The newly enacted Indian Housing Act of 1988 now provides a solid basis for moving ahead with an expanded program to meet Indian housing needs. To do this, the federal government will have to provide the needed funding and programs, in consultation with Indians and working through tribal agencies on reservations. This will require both addressing low income housing needs, by providing at least 6,000 additional units each year, and develop- ing new ways of serving families and the elderly who could pay for housing if they could obtain financing.130 American Indian Elderly The proportion of elderly among the American Indianpopulation has grown faster than in any other group. Between 1970 and 1980 their numbers increased by 65%, a rate twice thatof the white or black elderly. (National data, AmericanAssociation of Retired Persons (AARP), 1986). older Indianscomprise only 8% of the total Indian population, however, the number of elder Indians is expected to reach more than 200,0oo bythe year 1990. Life expectancy at birth for American Indians and Alaska Natives has increased from 51.0 years in 1939 -1941 to71.1 years in 1979 -1981. However, it is still 3.3 years lessthan the 1980 figure of 74.4 for the U.S. white population.(National data, Indian Nealth Service Chart Series Book, 1987). The major health problems of American Indian elders aretuberculosis, diabetes, liver and kidney disease, high bloodpressure, pneumonia and malnutrition. (AARP). Indians have staggering health problems. They have one ofthe highest infant mortality and lowest life expectancy rates of any group in the United States. What is most disturbing is theIndian death rate from curable diseases, such as tuberculosis andinfluenza, which approaches four times the national average. Many of their physical illnesses are directly related tomalnutrition and substandard housing. Substandard housing conditions cause serious health problemsfor Indian elders. Crowded living conditions, insufficientquantities of safe water and the lack of sanitation facilitieshelp spread disease.* Information provided to the National American Indian Housing Council from the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewas exemplifiesIndian elderly housing problems: Most of the typical housing problems that face our elderlytoday are associated with sub-standard housing which createshazardous living conditions. The most common of these problems are a lack of insulationand air infiltration. Single pane windows with little or nocaulking is another factor in the sub-standard homes. Thiscauses heat loss in the winter months, creating higherheating bills and over-labored furnace systems. In somecases, the over-labored furnaces produce toxic fumes thathas hospitalized our elders. Deteriorated roofing is another problem that occursfrequently. When this problem occurs, it affects manyitems. For instance, rain can destroy the \"R\" factor of theinsulation and rot the rafters. Foundations, if any, in most of the elderly homes areusually settling and breaking apart, which throws off thedelicate precision of a home. This causes almost everythingto be off square and causes spacing around the windows and doorways. One of our major concerns are the problems encountered byour handicapped elders. Most of the homes of this group arenot equipped with the devices necessary for them to lead asafe and sanitary life. The astronomical prices of handicapped equipment does notallow the elderly handicapped persons who live on a fixed income to purchase the equipment they need to live undersafe and sanitary conditions. * Pevar, Stephan. The Rights of Indians and Tribes.Published for the American Civl Liberties Union by Bantum Books, New York, 1983.131 Many of our elders haul their own water because ofcontaminants in their wells, or because their wells havegone dray. This causes many health related problemsconnected with not having sanitary facilities within thehome.* According to the National Indian Council on Aging (NICOA),more and more Indian leaders are falling below the poverty line.If this trend continues, the quality of life will continue to deteriorate for them. Please consider what effects the followingprogram cuts have on Indian elders: -funds for HUD Indian housing programs have been reduced by66% since 1981; -HUD will not permit the building of a Mutual Help Home foran elder 62 years of age or over, yet 65% of the HUD IndianHousing Program are Mutual Help units; -the Indian Health Service has eliminated from its budgetmany services most needed by our elders (eg., eyeglasses,hearing aids, dentures, prosthetics, etc.); -IRS in itsservice delivery system; -the CHR continually targeted forelimination from the IHS budget; -BIA has not focused on the needs of elders; in fact, theydo not even know how many elders are in need of services; -unemployment has taken a big jump on reservations whereenergy companies were the main source of jobs -- this meansthat more and more of those who would normally help tosupport their elders are no longer able to do so; -resources under Title III, V and VI of the Older AmericansAct, supposedly targeted toward those in the greatest ofeconomic and social needs are even less available to Indianelders today than they were four years ago; and -there seems to be a growing disregard in our Congress andin federal agency policies for treaty obligations to Indiantribes and for services designed to help the truly needy. In addition, under the HUD program, -elderly' is defined as62 years and over, while under the Bureau of Indian AffairsHousing Improvement Program, the BIA recognizes Indians 55 yearsand over as eligible for \"elderly\" assistance. The NationalAmerican Indian Housing Council recommends a lowering of age to55 for Indian elderly for HUD eligibility (see Appendix 1). As you can see from the above comments on typical conditionsand current program cut-backs, American Indian elders are finding themselves in increasingly stressful conditions. Housing formany elders is totally inadequate. In 1981, the Native AmericanRights Fund held citizen hearings on Indian housing in severalareas of the United states. At that time a witness from the Winnebago Tribe in Wisconsin testified that in the outlying areas of his reservation several families continued to live as they hadin the 1950's in wigwams, without, of course, plumbing and electricity. Most of them are elders who are adamant about continuing to live on the mame land they orew uo on. Money isnot available ao they construct traditional structures. It is a hard life, but to these people it is harder to live elsewhere. A witness from San Carlos Apache presented slides of housing conditions of the elderly on that reservation. Many of the elders live in 10' x 10' shanties expanded with an open-air arborused during the warmer weather for cooking and sleeping. One slide showed the \"house\" of an old woman which consisted of a tent pitched under a permanent roof structure supported by poles.For her this was home, summer and winter. * Photographs can be provided on request.132 Obviously, housing and housing assistance to Indian eldersmust be improved and made a priority, but enormous sensitivitymust be used in \"improving things.\" Safe and adequate drinkingwater supplies and sanitary sewage disposal must be provided toall Indian communities. Housing assistance programs must meetthe needs of the elderly -on their own homelands. Due toextreme poverty, housing improvement and new construction arantsshould be utilized to develop warm and dry, affordable homes. Acontinuing Federal commitment must be made as no other means offinancing homes can be made on trust lands. While housingdevelopment programs are expensive, what is the cost to Indiantribes and American society when our elders suffer ill health,poverty and bad housing? The National American Indian Housing Council urges thisCommittee, and all members of Congress, to continue to providesupport for housing assistance and safe, sanitary water and sewerfacilities to all American Indian and Alaska Native communities.For our elders, please help us provide the support necessary tomake their old age, comfortable to live in beauty and peace. Appendix I National American Indian Housing Council Resolution 88-22 LOWER ELDERLY QUALIFICATION TO 55 WHEREAS, the.National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC) isrepresentative-of and advocates for national, regional and tribalhousing concerns and issues: and WHEREAS,'the NAIHC is a national organization comprised of IndianHousing Authorities in HUD Regions; and WHEREAS, the life expectancy of the American Indian is less thanthat of the overall population of the United States; and\" WHEREAS, the Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes this fact andsets the age -for elderly at age 55 for the Housing ImprovementProgram (HIP); NOW, THEREFORE,; BE IT RESOLVED, that HUD lower the definition ofelderly from age 62 to age 55 for the HUD' Indian HousingPrograms. This resolution, was passed unanimously at NAIHC's AnnualConvention held in Rapid City, South Dakota, June, 1988.133 Item 18 TESTIMONY OF COMMISSIONER TONY GALLEGOS OF THE U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION SUBMITTED TO THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING UNITED STATES SENATE PINE RIDGE, SOUTH DAKOTA JULY 21, 1988 Thank you Senator Pressler for affording me the opportunity to present written testimony on the problems facing American Indians in today's society. I have always had a keen interest in the issues affecting American Indians. One reason for my interest is the fact that my father was born and raised at the Taos Pueblo in the State of New Mexico. The other reason is my involvement, as a Commissioner at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, with one of the most effective programs founded by the federal government -- the Tribal Employment Rights Offices Program. The TERO program has been successful, not because of what any federal agency has done, but because of the determination and effort of each TERO to be economically self-sufficient. Since my appointment to the Commission in 1982, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to see the TERO program develop from a program destined for extinction to a program that is successfully applying the concept of Indian self-determination to economic development. ADEA AND TERO STATISTICS In your letter of invitation, you requested specific information regarding American Indians and enforcement of the ADEA. I would like to address these areas. EEOC does not request or determine the race of persons filing ADEA charges. As a result, I cannot provide you with the number of ADEA charges filed by American Indians. The TERO program deals with Title VII issues. As you are aware, the ADEA is a separate law and TEROs do not fall under it. As a result, an Indian who wishes to file an ADEA charge is referred to the appropriate EEDC field office. As a result of not being able to specifically identify American Indians filing age claims, we are unable to provide information as to whether any claims by them passed the ADEA statute of limitations. I believe awareness of elderly American Indians of TEROs and EEOC has risen considerably since I have been at the Commission. As I stated earlier, the program faced extinction. It has not just survived, it has prospered. By prospered, I mean provided relief for Indians in terms of dollars, jobs and hope for the future. Word gets around on reservations about successes. TERO is successful. As a TERO director achieves more benefits, people who live on or near the reservation discuss it and awareness increases. The cultural barriers which may lead to reluctance to file discrimination charges are no different for elderly Indians than for other Indians. Ambivalence toward the federal government, concern for preserving autonomy in internal affairs and tribal loyalties may be barriers. However, over the years we have seen these barriers slip. TEROs and tribal councils look to EEOC as a model for federal/tribal relationships. TEROs are EEOC agents on the reservation. Thus, the contact is not with the federal government, but with a tribal member. Confidence in the services provided is much higher and as a result, barriers are giving way. TRIBAL EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OFFICES134 The vast majority of employment discrimination Problemsfacing elderly American Indians today are not based upon age,but upon race. All American Indians, not just the elderly,represent \"The Forgotten Population.\" I am not contending that age discrimination does not occur in the Indian population; however it is deeply overshadowed by the primary reason AmericanIndians are discriminated against--and that is because of theirrace. The Tribal Employment Rights Offices (TEROs) were createdto help end discrimination against American Indians in the work place. A Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) is the name givento a unit within the tribal government structure whose purpose is to encourage and facilitate the use of Indian employment inbusinesses and industries located within the geographicalboundaries of the reservation. To achieve these ends, the TERO seeks to identify, eliminate and remedy illegal employment discrimination. TEROs also direct seminars and conferences which serve aseducational processes in making tribal members more aware oftheir special Preference rights and of their federal employmentrights. EEOC's role in the TERO program is to provide funding andtraining to Indian tribes and to assist in the continueddevelopment of the TEROs' ability to identify, remedy andeliminate unlawful employment discrimination occurring on or near the reservations. EEOC first became involved with TERUSin 1976, when it let acontract to an Indian-owned consulting firm to establish 15Tribal Employment Rights Offices. The tribes were selected forparticipation by the contractor and EEOC on the basis ofinterest, the potential for a successful model program and thetribes' willingness to commit at least one staff person to the program. Out of respect for the diversity of each participatingtribe, the contract allowed the tribes full license to worktoward the enforcement provisions of Title VII according to the needs of and political climate surrounding each reservation. At the end of the contract period, it was determined theproject was successful and 15 TEROs were established. Interest in the program continued to grow and EEOC entered into a secondcontract with the firm to establish 10 additional TEROs. Thisproject also was very successful. There were now 25 TEROsestablished, which completed the first step in achieving equal employment rights for Indians on reservations. The next step was to solidify an EEOC/TERO relationship whereby EEOC would fund TEROs under a demonstration contract toassist in promoting and protecting the employment rights ofIndians working for private employers on reservations. Tribal governments have the inherent sovereign power toregulate commercial dealings by all entities within theirjurisdiction, which gives them the authority to require employers on the reservations to give preference to Indians in employment and business opportunities. The tribes can: .set the minimum number of Indians each employer must hirefor each craft or job classification, .review the employer's job qualifications to make surethere are no qualifications that are irrelevant to goodperformance, .set up a hiring hall system to refer applicants toemployers, .set up a training program that requires employers to hire a certain number of partially trained Indians and continue totrain them on the job. TEROs operating under contracts with EEOC enforce the abovetribal ordinances, serve as referral and placement links betweenemployers and residents of the reservations, negotiate Indianpreference agreements and take and process complaints ofemployment discrimination.135 Complaints of employment discrimination are processed by TEROs under tribal ordinances and under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. For processing a charge under Title VII, EEOC developed specific procedures for TEROs to follow which allow the TERO 30 days to negotiate a settlement. If settlement is not reached, the TERO notifies EEOC that a settlement attempt was unsuccessful and EEOC will take control of the charge on the 31st day. TEROs do a great deal of what we refer to as preventive maintenance. They use employment rights laws to compel employers to hire and promote Indians. Being a part of a sovereign government, they operate under statutory authority of those sovereigns. TEROs meet with new employers coming onto the reservations and explain the requirements of their tribal ordinances. Once an Indian is hired, the TERO works with the employee and the employer to ensure retention. If a problem arises that can be solved, the employer is required to retain the employee while TERO makes the appropriate referrals to get help for the individual. In many instances it prevents the need for filing a charge. Prior to 1983, it was generally recognized that one area where EEOC had not functioned as effectively as it should was in providing service to American Indians. In addition to that concern was the concern that many of the Commission's staff were not familiar with American Indian problems and issues. Since 1983, when the Commission approved funding for 20 TEROs, EEOC has made the effort each year to expand and improve the TERO program usually in the face of budgetary constraints. In fiscal year 1986, despite Gramm-Rudman budget cuts, the Commission not only increased the number of TEROs funded to 36 but also was able to avoid any reduction in TERO funding. The TEROs were so effective that in FY 1987 the Commission funded 44, and in FY 1988 the number increased to 53. Congress earmarked just $20 million for state and local programs for 1988 as it had in previous years. Congress has proposed the same $20 million funding for FY 1989. Every year for the past seven years Congress has appropriated less than the President requested for EEOC's budget. Because Congress did not fund EEOC at the requested level, the Commission will not be able to increase the TERO contract amount for next year or fund any new TEROs. In FY 1987, the 44 TEROs processed 382 complaints of employment discrimination--most of which were handled under tribal ordinances. Of these 382 complaints, the TEROs successfully settled 253. As a result of complaint settlements and placement of American Indians, the TEROs obtained over $20 million in benefits for 6,065 individuals. The monetary benefits obtained in 1987 were substantially more than in 1986--a banner year when monetary benefits of over $15 million were obtained. That was twice as much as the total monetary awards collected in all the previous years of the TERO program. In addition to their settlement efforts, the 44 TEROs negotiated 2,049 preference agreements with employers working on or near the reservations. They also conducted 6,183 on-site inspections of employer operations to ensure that employers were complying with current preference agreements. Further, the 44 TEROs prevented the need for filing charges of discrimination through preventative activities that affected over 53,000 individuals. But it doesn't end there: TEROs were also responsible for referring over 15,000 Indians for jobs, recruiting 18,000 and placing 7,555 Indians with employers. Numbers alone cannot tell us the whole story. They don't reveal all the effort and dedication that the TERO staff pour into their jobs, nor the difference they make in improving the quality of life for thousands of individuals. These numbers do tell us, however, that the TEROs are working hard and are very successful. At a funding rate of only $22,500 each, the TEROs more than pay for themselves and constitute one of the most effective programs funded by the federal government.136 However, TEROs have on occasion been met with resistance from some employers and contractors. In my opinion, thisemployer reluctance to abide by the TERD ordinance is due largely to a lack of understanding of what Indian employment preference is all about and what the TERO program is all about. The EEOC recently issued a policy statement clarifying theIndian preference provision of Title VII. I believe this policy statement strengthens and clarifies Section 703(i) of Title VII and will aid in prohibiting discrimination against AmericanIndians. I am submitting a copy of this policy statement(Attachment A) for the hearing record. SCHOLARSHIP ENDOWMENT The American Indian population in the United States facesdifficult problems and issues now and in the years ahead. Interms of the needs of this segment of our population, the twomost important are education and gainful employment. The Indian population is the poorest and most under served in the nation--America's first forgotten minority. Indian students have a dropout rate of 60 percent between kindergarten and high school and half of all Indian youth above the age of 14 have no formal education. These figures are especially alarming when viewed against the projection that three-fourths of the 16million new jobs over the next two years will require skilledtraining beyond high school. Obviously literacy and education are essential ingredients for the progress of all people and the betterment of our communities. Literacy and education are the first chapters in the American dream and without them, we cannot hope to get to the next chapter--gainful employment. The roleof the TEROs is to assist in this important goal. We are proudof their accomplishments and look forward to their continued success. Throughout the history of the United States, American Indians have consistently contributed to the strengthening ofthis nation. In times of war, they have stepped forward tofight for the principles upon which this country was founded. And those principles are reflected in the goals of a college I want to mention-D-Q University, a predominantly American Indiancollege. The reason I am mentioning D-Q University is because D-Q was chosen to receive a $50,000 scholarship endowment as anextension of a 1983 settlement agreement of a job discrimination charge between the EEOC and General Motors. The original EEOC-GM agreement established a $16 million education assistance program for minorities and women resulting in endowments to 32 colleges and universities. The award ceremony took place at 0-Q University on June 28, 1988. Such an award for a university with a primarily AmericanIndian student body will result in resources to educate and prepare our Indian youth for entry into the business world on an equal footing with the rest of society. EEOC AND ITS ENFORCEMENT OF THE ADEA The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is proud of its record of vigorously enforcing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In 1979, the Commission was given enforcement authority for the ADEA. Since that time the number of agediscrimination charges has increased at a greater rate than anyother category. This new challenge came at a critical time for the agency. Foundering under an ever increasing work load, the Commission implemented major initiatives in policy and management to establish the credibility and predictability of the agency's law enforcement efforts in order to better fulfill our responsibilities under all four of the acts we enforce. The Commission decided that this task could only be accomplished through a strong litigation program and a policy of seeking fullrelief for victims of discrimination. The Commission's major policy initiatives include: .an enforcement policy which calls for every case ofdiscrimination which fails conciliation to be presented to the Commission for litigation consideration; .a remedies policy which calls for a full remedy to be sought in every case where discrimination is found;137 .an investigative compliance policy to enable EEOC to deal more effectively with respondents who fail to cooperate with Commission investigations; and .a method for charging parties to appeal to EEOCheadquarters determinations by field offices that no cause has been found to believe discrimination has occurred. A number of administrative and management tools have been employed by this Commission to support the agency's enforcement program. Among those tools are improved financialaccountability, computerization, goal-oriented employee performance agreements, a streamlined organizational structure and implementation of a Commission-wide quality assurance program. In June 1987, EEOC for the first time in Commissionhistory comprehensively trained virtually all (1,400) fieldinvestigators. This comprehensive training of investigators is now a continuing part of the Commission's staff development program. The training was recently given to new investigators and attorneys from the field as well as to headquarters personnel. This training program is another important element in the Commission's ongoing work to improve the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of its service to the public. The Commission also has developed unique, personalized outreach programs designed to augment the deterrent effect ofits enforcement through public education and assistance. Inaddition, the Commission provides charging parties with a full explanation of their rights at the time they contact us to file a charge. Predictable, efficient law enforcement and insistence onfull remedial relief have benefited victims of age discrimination. As Congress recognized in enacting the ADEA,those who suffer from age discrimination must have promptvindication of their rights for any legal relief to be meaningful. Accordingly, this Commission has aggressivelyinvestigated and prosecuted claims of age discrimination on anindividual, classwide and a systemic basis. Statistics on the numbers of cases satisfactorily concluded, lawsuits initiated and monetary recoveries obtainedclearly show this Commission's commitment to eradicating agediscrimination and the public's growing trust in our processes,as well as our credibility as a law enforcement agency. We are pleased to keep this Committee informed of the Commission's record of accomplishment and commitment to thepurposes of the ADEA: to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workersfind ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment. I remain personally and professionally committed to the success and well-being of the American Indian people. Theytruly are one of America's natural and best resources. Training and the opportunity for fair and gainful employment areessential. It follows that the goal of equal employment opportunity be available for everyone. I commend SenatorPressler for holding these hearings. I am pleased EEOC has beenprovided the opportunity to further enlighten the committee ofthis agency's commitment and progress in its mission of equal employment for all American Indians.138 D G N-915-027NOTICE [ l7 l _ (Auotautic.I C-celled in 180 Days) 516/88 1.

ORIGINATOR. Title VII/EPA Division, Office of Legal Counsel. 6. INSTRUCTIONS. This notice supplements the discussion at Section 604.10(d)of EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 604, Theories of Discrimi-nation. The notice should be filed behind the appendices to that section. 7. SUBJECT MATTER. Section 703(i) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(i) (1982), provides an exception to Title VII's generalnondiscrimination principles allowing certain employers under certain circum-stances to exercise an employment preference in favor of American Indians. 1/That section provides as follows: Nothing contained in this title shall apply to any business or enterprise on or near an Indian reserva-tion with respect to any publicly announced employ- ment practice of such business or enterprise under which a preferential treatment is given to any indi-vidual because he is an Indian living on or near areservation. The statutory language makes it clear that an employer seeking to availitself of the Indian preference exception must meet three conditions: (1)the employer must be located on or near an Indian reservation, (2) the employ-er's preference for Indians must be publicly announced, and (3) the individualto whom preferential treatment is accorded must be an Indian living on ornear a reservation. Neither Section 703(i) nor any other section of the Act,however, defines the terms 'Indian reservation\" or \"near.\" V This policy statement does not extend to charges/complaints brought undereither the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (ADEA); 29U.S.C. 5 621 et seq. (1982), or the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), 29 U.S.C.\u00a7 206(d) (1982), since, unlike Title VII, neither of those statutes contains anIndian preference exception. Additionally, neither the ADEA nor the EPA providesa jurisdictional exemption for Indian tribes as does Section 701(b)(1) TitleVII. DISTRIBUTION: CM HOLE-RS 1M06, AR 876OF510,A5139 N-915-027 5/88 Although the Commission has issued several decisions involving the jurisdictional exemption of Indian tribes under Section 701(b)(1) of Title VII, 2/ its one published decision involving the Indian preference exception under Section 703(i) of the Act turned solely on the question of whether the employer had satisfied the public announcement requirement of that section. See Commission Decision No. 74-26, CCH EEOC Decisions (1983) 1 6398. Thus, the Commission did not have occasion in that case to address the statutory requirement of being \"on or near an Indian reservation.\" Because the Commission has received various requests from employers, Indian tribes, and state fair employment practices agencies for its interpre- tation of the 'on or near\" phrase and the applicability of the Indian prefer- ence exception and because the issue is an increasingly important one on which the Commission has not previously issued guidance, the Commission now delineates its position with respect to the exception provided in Section 703(i) of the Act. Specifically, the Commission addresses: (1) the defini- tion of \"Indian reservation\" for Title VII purposes, (2) the meaning of the term \"near,\" (3) the scope of the term 'employment practice,\" and (4) the issue of whether a preference based on tribal affiliation conflicts with the provisions of Title VII. Indian Reservation The need to define the term -Indian reservation\" within the meaning of Section 703(i) of Title VII arises in connection with the circumstances that exist in the state of Oklahoma. As has been brought to the Commission's attention, Oklahoma is the home of a large number of Indian tribes and many areas of the state contain high Native American populations, yet there are no longer any Indian reservations as such in Oklahoma. 3/ Many employers in the state, however, are located in and around the sites of former reservations. Thus, the question presented is whether the Indian preference exception provided in Section 703(i) is available to such employers or whether applicability of that provision is dependent upon the present existence of an Indian reservation as the necessary base from which to measure whether the 'on or near\" requirement is met. The issue is one of first impression. As noted above, Title VII does not define the term 'Indian reservation.\" Nor is there any Indication in the legislative history of the Act of the meaning intended by Congress in its use of that term in Section 703(i). Further, research has di sclosed no court decision defining the term for Title VII purposes. 2/ See Commission Decision No. 80-14, CCH EEOC Decisions (1983) 1 6823, and Commission Decision 85-6 and 85-7, Guide 11 respectively. Prior to statehood in 1907, the area comprising present-day Oklahoma was Indian Territory. For a detailed discussion of the history of that land, see F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 770-75 (1982 ed.). See also S. Pevar, The Rights of Indians and Tribes 231-33 (Bantam ed. 1983). 2140 5/88 N-915.027 Before examining statutory use of the term outside the context of Title VII, we consider its ordinary meaning: The term \"Indian reservation\" originally had meant any land reserved from an Indian cession to the federal government regardless of the form of tenure. During the 1850's, the modern meaning of Indian reservation emerged, referring to land set aside under federal pro- tection for the residence of Tribal Indians, regardless of origin. 4/ Although 'Indian reservation\" is the more commonly familiar term, the governing legal term for most jurisdictional purposes is 'Indian country.\" 5/ The latter is defined at 18 U.S.C. 5 1151 as follows: Except as otherwise provided in sections 1154 and 1156 of this title, the term 'Indian country,\" as used in this chap- ter, means (a) all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights-of-way running through the reservation, (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, includ- ing rights-of-way running through the same. The definition in Section 1151 is controlling with respect to the appli- cability of federal criminal law in Indian country. While this definition relates specifically to determinations of federal criminal jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has noted- that it is also applicable to questions of federal civil jurisdiction. 6/ However, although Indian reservations are included in the statutory definition of Indian country, the term \"Indian reservation\" is not separately defined. 7/ 4/ Cohen, supra note 3, at 34. 5/ Id. at 27. 6/ DeCocteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425 (1975). \"While \u00a7 1151 is concerned, on its face, only with criminal jurisdiction, the Court has recognized that it generally applies as well to questions of civil jurisdiction.\" Id. at 427 n.l (citations omitted). 7/ In determining whether a particular tract of land constitutes a reservation within the meaning of 5 1151(a), courts have examined the history of the land in light- of acts of Congress, rulings by the Department of the Interior, and prior judicial decisions bearing on its status. See, e.g., United States v. John, 437 U.S. 634 (1978); Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes v. State of Oklahoma, 618 F.2d 665 (1980); and Langley v. Ryder, 602 F. Supp. 5/88 Similarly, the terms -Indian reservation' or \"reservation' appear but are undefined in numerous other federal statutes. 8/ A review of Title 25 of the U. S. Code, which pertains specifically to Indians, has disclosed only three instances in which 'reservation' is defined, although the term is used repeatedly throughout that title. 9/ Of these three definitions, one relates specifically to an Indian tribe in Connecticut. 10/ A second definition, which is of general application, is found in the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C. S 1901 et seq. Incorporating and expanding upon the definition of Indian country, that Act provides as follows: '[R]eservation\" means Indian country as defined in section 1151 of title 18 and any lands, not covered under such section, title to which is either held by the United States in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation. 25 U.S.C. 5 1903(10). The third definition appears in the Indian Financing Act of 1974, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451 et seq., which provides Indian tribes and individuals capital in the form of loans and grants to promote economic development. That defini- tion specifically includes former Indian reservations in Oklahoma. As defined therein: Reservation- includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settle- ment Act 143 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.]. 25 U.S.C. 55 796(2), 797(e); 25 U.S.C. SS 33, 46, 155, 175, 176, 196, 200, 211, 231-233, 253, 262, 264, 279, 280, 283, 286, 291, 292, 304, 307, 309, 311, 312, 318a-321, 331, 333, 334, 336, 337, 339, 340, 342, 344, 348, 350-352, 380, 381, 393, 396a, 397-399, See citations to 25 8. -6142 5/88 N-915.027 While no statutory definition discovered other than that in the Indian Financing Act explicitly recognizes former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, they are included in the definition of \"reservation\" contained in various regulations promulgated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) of the Department of the Interior. For example, in the regulations governing BIA's financial assistance and social services program, 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1 et seq. (1987), the following definition is provided: -Reservation\" means any federally recognized Indian tribe's reservation, Pueblo, or Colony, including former reservations in Oklahoma, Alaska Native regions established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), and Indian allotments. 25 C.F.R. 5 20.1(v) (1987). 11/ Against this background, the Commission must determine the meaning of the term \"Indian reservation\" under Section 703(i) of Title VII. In so doing, the Commission is mindful that Title VII is remedial social legislation and is, therefore, entitled to liberal construction in order to effectuate the purpose of the Act. 12/ The purpose for the inclusion of Section 703(i) is explained in the legislative history: _1/ The cited regulations were issued under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, which authorizes BIA to expend money appropriated by Congress for the, benefit, care, and assistance of Indians. For other instances in which BIA regulations define \"reservation\" as including former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, see 25 C.F.R. SS 101.1(k) (loans to Indians from revolving loan fund), 103.1(h) (loan guaranty, insurance, and interest subsidy), 151.2(f) (land acquisitions), 273.2(o) (education contracts under Johnson O'Malley Act), and 286.1(j) (Indian business development program). A similar definition is provided in regulations of the Department of the Interior (implementing Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 450e(b)), provides: \"Indian reservation\" includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, ,regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). 12/ See EEOC Association, 694 F.2d 1068, 1070, 30 EPF Y 33,175 (6th U.S. 819, 32 EPD \u00b6 33,829 (1983); and Zimmerman v. North American Signal Company, 704 F.2d 347, 352, 31 EPD B 33,486 (7th Cir. 1983).143 N-915.027 5/88 A new subsection 703(i) has been added permitting enterprises on or near Indian reservations to follow preferential hiring practices toward Indians. This exemption is consistent with the Federal government's policy of encouraging Indian employment and with the special legal position of Indians. 13/ In the Commission's view, the Congressional purpose of encouraging the voluntary extension of employment opportunities to Indians would be unduly hampered by narrowly defining the term 'Indian reservation\" within the meaning of Section 703(i) to exclude former Indian reservations in Oklahoma. Such a definition would effectively preclude the applicability of Title VII's Indian preference provision to employers in a state which was originally Indian Territory and whose present population includes a high percentage of Native Americans, a result which appears contrary to the intent of Section 703(i). Additionally, the Commission takes note that a narrow definition of that term would similarly render the preference inapplicable in the state of Alaska. 14/ In light of these considerations, the Commission believes that the purpose of Section 703(i) would be furthered by defining 'Indian reservation in a manner that accords special recognition to the circumstances that exist in both Oklahoma and Alaska. Therefore, guided by the definitions of \"reser- vation\" provided in the Indian Financing Act of 1974 and in regulations issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, 15/ it is the Commission's position that the terms 'Indian reservation -and \"reservation\" in Section 703(i) of Title VII include former Indian reservations in Oklahoma and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations in Alaska under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Should a dispute arise regarding whether a particular tract of land falls within this definition, the Commission will present the question to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and will make its determination after consideration of the conclusion reached by that agency. On or Near an Indian Reservation Section 703(i) of Title VII uses the phrase on or near an Indian reservation\" in identifying the businesses or enterprises that may lawfully exercise the Indian preference exception provided in that section. The individual Indians to whom preferential treatment may be extended are similarly identified as those living \"on or near a reservation.\" With respect to this phrase, the issue presented in determining whether the statutory criterion is met regards the meaning of the word \"near,\" which is undefined in the Act. 13/ 110 Cong. Rec. 12723 (1964) (statement of Senator Humphrey). 14/ For a discussion of native land rights in Alaska, see Cohen, supra note 3, at 739-48. 15/ See supra note 11.144 5/88 N-915.027 The sole Title VII case deciding the applicability of the Indian preference contained in Section 703(i) is Livingston v. Ewing, 601 F.2d 1110, 20 EPD 1 30,002 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 870, 20 EPD \u00b6 30,266 (1979). In that case, the non-Indian plaintiffs challenged the policy of the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe of permitting only Indians to sell their handmade jewelry and crafts on the grounds of the Museum. Holding that the Museum's policy came within the Section 703(i) exception, even though the Museum was not the direct employer of the Indians, the court found that the \"on or near\" requirement was satisfied by facts showing that the Museum was located eight miles from an Indian reservation and within a \"short distance\" of other reservations, including the ones from which the Indians came. 601 F.2d at 1115. However, because the court's holding in Livingston v. Ewing is fact- specific, the decision in that case does not provide a definition of the word \"near\" for Title VII purposes. Nor is general guidance on the meaning of that term found outside of Title VII in the Supreme Court's decision in Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199 (1974). Although the Court there held that, in appropriating funds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs' general assistance program, Congress did not intend to limit eligibility for benefits under the program to Indians living \"on\" a reservation, to the exclusion of those living \"near\" one, the Court did not decide the breadth of the term \"near.\" Rather, the Court held that it covered the Indian plaintiffs, who lived in an Indian community fifteen miles from their reservation. Although applicable judicial precedent defining \"near\" is lacking, a definition of that term is found in regulations issued by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) of the Department of Labor. 41 C.F.R. 5 60-1.1 et seq. (1987). The regulations, which apply to federal contractors, define -near\" with reference to an Indian preference provision similar to that contained in Section 703(i) of Title VII. The regulations provide in pertinent part: Work on or near Indian reservations. It shall not be a violation of the equal opportunity clause for a con- struction or nonconstruction contractor to extend a publicly announced preference in employment to Indians living on or near an Indian reservation in connection with employment opportunities on or near an Indian res- ervation. The use of the word \"near\" would include all that area where a person seeking employment could rea- sonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day. 41 C.F.R. i 60-l.5(a)(6) (1987) (emphasis added). 16/ 16/ The Commission notes that the term 'near\" is similarly defined in Department of the Interior regulations implementing the Indian preference provision of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. S 450e(b). At 48 C.F.R. 1 1404.7001 (1987), these regulations provide: \"On or near an Indian reservation\" means on a reserva- tion or the distance within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) that a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day.145 N-915.027 5/88 Upon considering the intent of Section 703(i), the Commission is persuadedthat the definition of 'near' in the OFCCP regulations cited above is consistentwith and furthers the purpose of the Title VII provision. As noted, this defi-nition appears in the specific context of an Indian preference provision thatparallels that in Title VII. Unlike a definition that establishes the outerreach of that term by specifying a fixed distance applicable in all cases, adefinition based on what may be considered reasonable commuting distance pro-vides the flexibility necessary to take differing geographic and economiccircumstances into account. Thus, since proximity to employment sources variesfrom one reservation to another and one part of the country to another, such adefinition avoids potential inequities and promotes a fair application of thestatutory exception. For these reasons, the Commission adopts the definition of \"near' providedin the OFCCP regulations set forth above as the definition of that term underSection 703(i) of Title VII. Applying this definition, determinations ofwhether the \"on or near\" criterion is met shall be made on a case-by-casebasis. -7c'tent Practice To what extent may preferential treatment be accorded Indians under' 703(i)? That section provides an Indian preference exception withrespect to -any publicly announced employment practice.\" The legislativehtstory, discussed above, indicates that this exception permits covered employ-ers to follow preferential hiring practices toward Indians. 17/ The questionbefore the Commission is whether the term \"employment practice\" in Section703(i) thus refers solely to initial hiring decisions. In Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 7 EPD q 9431 (1974), the SupremeCourt upheld an employment preference for Indians in the Bureau of IndianAffa:rs (BLA) under Section 12 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25'.S.C. 5 472. The-Court held that the preference provided in the 1934 Act wasno: repealed by implication by the 1972 amendments to Title X'II, which extendedlcie VII's discrimination prohibitions to federal sector employment. TheCourt further held that the preference did not constittte invidious racialdiscrimination in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.The statute at issue in Mancari provides a preference with respect to \"appoint-ment to vacancies.\" Although the preference previously had been accorded onlyat the initial hiring stage, under BIA policy as revised in 1972 it was extendedto filling vacancies by original appointment, reinstatement, and promotions.417 U.S. at 538 n.3. Because the question of whether the 1934 Act authorized apreference in other than initial hiring was not before the Court in Mancari,the Court noted that it expressed no opinion on that issue. Id. at 539 n.5.However, the Court cited two lower court decisions in which the phrase \"appoint-ment to vacancies\" in Section 12 of the 1934 Act was specifically construed,Freeman v. Morton and Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Hickel. In Freeman v. Morton, 499 F.2d 494 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the court held thatthe BIA preference applies to filling vacancies through initial hiring, promo-tion, lateral transfer, and reassignment. In Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Nickel, 17/ See supra note 13 and accompanying text. 8146 5/88 N-915.027 432 F.2d 956 (10th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 981 (1971), the court concluded that the preference was not applicable to reductions in force since such circumstances do not involve the filling of vacancies. Based on the statutory language and the legislative history, the court in Mescalero found that Congress did not intend the preference to be applied in a manner that would result in the displacement of existing non-Indian employees of BIA. Following the Tenth Circuit's decision in Mescalero, however, Congress enacted legislation making the preference applicable to reductions in force at BIA and the Indian Health Service. See 25 U.S.C. 5 472a(a) (1982). 'The purpose of this provision is to overcome the adverse effects of the Mescalero decision..... H.R. Rep. No. 370, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 12, reprinted in 1979 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2068, 2077. See F.2d 1359, (1984) (co--enting on the Congressional response to Mescalero in a case involving apsrca:ion of the preference in the Indian Health Service). :- the Commission's view, Congress's use of the general term \"employment ;raz:tce- in Section 703(i) of Title VII suggests an intent to permit preferen- :r.arment of Indians more broadly than in the context of hiring alone. A: --- the court cases discussed above analyze the scope of an Indian pref- er,- .a_:horlzed under a statute other than Title VII, the Commission believes .:- c- se decisions and the subsequent Congressional enactment in response to c provide useful guidance in determining the breadth of the term *- rt practice\" in Section 703(i). : rawing upon this guidance, it is the Commission's position that, for r:::e VII purposes, employment practices under which preferential treatment =a< be accorded to Indians are those requiring the selection of individuals tc f\u00b1:2 positions, however created, or to retain positions when jobs are e:'minated. Accordingly, the preference is applicable to employment decisions lrvolvlng, for example, hiring, promotion, transfer, and reinstatement as well a, tc layoffs and reductions in force. -Com=ission does not reach a determination of whether the tern employ- e ractice- in Section 703(i) covers other terms, conditions, or privileges cf e=:o>ment, such as compensation, benefits, work assignments, or training. The Issue of whether the Indian preference in Title VII extends -o employment decis:ons involving such terms and conditions is non-CDP. Charges raising this issue should be processed according to the instructions provided in EEOC Compliance Manual 5 603 for processing priority-issue charges. Tribal Affiliation The final issue to be addressed is whether the extension of an employment preference based on tribal affiliation--that is, a preference limited to Indians who belong to a particular tribe, to the exclusion of members of any other tribe--is permissible under Section 703(i) of Title VII. The issue arises, for example, where an employer located on or near a specific Indian tribe's reservation wishes to accord a preference restricted to members of that tribe either on its own initiative or in compliance with a tribal ordi- nance requiring that a preference be given to members of the tribe.147 N-915.027 5/88 The Indian preference exception provided in Section 703(i) is stated in general terms. That section neither expressly authorizes nor prohibits a distinction among Indians based on tribal membership. By contrast to Title VII, which is silent on the issue of tribal affiliation, regulations promulgated by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) of the Department of Labor and by the Department of the Interior specifically prohibit considera- tion of tribal affiliation in according the preferences permitted. The relevant provision of the OFCCP regulations, which are applicable to federal contractors, is found at 41 C.F.R. S 60-1.5(a)(6) (1987). The first two sentences of that section are set out in the foregoing discussion of the definition of the phrase -on or near an Indian reservation.'

Thus, under the cited regulations of both OFCCP and the Department of the Interior, covered federal contractors may not discriminate among Indians on the basis of tribal affiliation in extending an employment preference. Although Title VII is silent in this regard, the Commission considers the prohibition expressed in those regulations to best serve the purpose intended by Section 703(i). On this point, the Commission believes that, in enacting Section 703(i), Congress intended to encourage the extension of employment opportunities to Indians generally, without allowing discrimination among Indians of different 10148 5/88 N-915.027 tribes. Under Section 703(i), the exception applies to employment practices under which preferential treatment is given to 'any individual because he is an Indian living on or near a reservation' (emphasis added). The statutory language supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to permit tribal distinctions among Indians otherwise qualifying for such preferential treat- ment. Further, as a practical matter, the Commission notes that in some instances employers may be located on or near the reservation of only one tribe and that the Indians living on or near that reservation may be members of that tribe. Under such circumstances, the preference may operate, in effect, to favor only members of that specific tribe without disadvantaging Indians of other tribes. However, in sane parts of the country employers are situated near the reservations of more than one tribe cr more than one tribe may share the same reservation.

DATE ,g / APPROVEDL ___ _ __ Clar ece Thomas Chai ran149 Item 19 STATEMENT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development operates three major housing programs In the Indian community: the Lower- income Indian Housing Rental Program; and the Homeownership Opportunity Programs, which include Mutual Help (MH) and Turnkey 111. Indian communities are also eligible to participate in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program for Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages; and the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) Program. In addition, private sector sponsors can develop housing under the FHA mortgage insurance programs. such as the Section 231-Housing for the Elderly Program, and private non- profit sponsors are eligible to apply for Section 202 direct loans for development of projects for the elderly or handicapped In Indian communities. Other Section 8 programs, including but not limited to Vouchers, are available near reservations. Multifamily projects for the elderly were eligible to participate in the Congregate Housing Services demonstration and several made applications. HUD's Indian Programs are administered through six Indian field offices, in Chicago, Oklahoma, Denver. Phoenix, Seattle, and Anchorage. The Department's Indian programs for housing and community development are administered In the context of the special needs and circumstances Imposed by Indian trust land restrictions, the diverse and complex historical and cultural patterns of Indian and Alaska Native life, and the special legal and historical relationships between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. The design of HUODs current Indian programs reflects a continuing effort to achieve delivery systems that are responsive to the special housing and community development requirements of Indian and Alaska Native communities. The Department provides housing assistance for American Indians and Alaskan Natives, including elderly individuals and150 families with elders in the household, pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended. Indiun Housing Authorities ([HAs) operate rental and homeownership opportunity programs primarily on Indiao lands. As of June 30, 1988, there were 176 IHAs operating more than 61,000 units, of which about 3,000, or 4.80, house the elderly in specifically designated units. HUD has proposed 1,000 new units in FY 1989. This is in addition to the 2,000 units to be reserved in FY 1988 and the almost 10,000 units in the Indian Housing pipeline. These additional units will meet 251 of the reported need. It should also be emphasized that since the early 80's HUD has provided 38% of all housing in Indian areas. Nearly all of the units developed under the Indian housing programs are free standing, single family houses, and more than 60% of those are under lease-purchase contracts; for this reason, and because many of the units are built on land assigned or allocated to the resident families, families tend to remain in residence for long periods of time. As a result, homes originally occupied as family units ten or fifteen years ago are now occupied by elderly families. Recent occupancy surveys indicate that between 20% and 25% of the units under IHA management (about 12,000 units) are homes to elderly people or to families that include one or more elders. With respect to the issue of need for additional new units specifically for the elderly, the Departments experience in this context Is limited. We have historically based allocation decisions on the fact that the IHAs do not usually apply for centralized elderly apartment projects for the elderly in Indian communities. Our information suggests that this population generally has closer family structures than does the society in general, and that elders tend to remain with their grown children and their families, rather than seeking specialized housing environments for the aging generations).151 The Department has implemented the statutory preference for large-family units reflected in successive appropriations acts. We do not know if IHAs are misunderstanding this 'preference as an absolute prohibition on elderly units, or if elderly demand In so small relative to family need that the IKAs do not feel elderly units are justified. Our experience tends to support the latter case. In the case of IHAs without a rental program, IRAs might not be able to address the needs of the elders, knowing that elderly individuals or couples would neither be eligible for 3 or 48R Mutual Help units nor interested in a long term lease purchase a rrangement. In informal discussions with two of our field offices concerning this year's application cycle, we learned of requests for three rental projects specifically for elderly/handicapped. The total units requested for these projects is 46; they would be located in three different rural communities. Another IHA stated that there was definite need and interest in their territory, and that they have two communities where they would be interested In locating an elderly project. There are examples of Indian housing targeted to the elderly in every Indian region. In the Midwest near Duluth, Minnesota, the Fond du Lac IHA Is developing a 15-unit elderly multiplex. located near a medical clinic. The Chicksaw IKA recently built a high-rise complex in Ardmore, Oklahoma. The Laguna Rainbow Project in New Mexico consists of a 20-bed nursing home and a 40- unit congregate facility. Specialized services are provided to the projects' residents using funds from HUD's congregate service program. In Anchorage, Alaska, the Cook Inlet Housing Authority has already developed two Congregate Elderly projects of 60 units funded about 60% by the State of Alaska and the rest through HUD's Indian housing program. CONGREGATE SERVICES There are five Congregate Housing Services Projects (CHSP),152 Pueblo of Laguna Housing Authority in New Mexico Northern Cheyenne Indian Housing Authority, Montana Yankton Sioux Indian Housing Authority, South Dakota Cherokee Housing Authority, Jay, Oklahoma Cherokee Nation Section 202 project, Talequah, Oklahoma Projects included In the CHSP demonstration were required to indicate that CHSP services were needed because services existing in the community were Insufficient or Inadequate to meet the needs of the elderly population. SECTION 202 Our experience with Section 202 program indicates that the program Is not feasible In many smaller Indian communities. The Indian housing experience shows that a project of less than I00 units is usually not economically feasible under the 202 program. Typically applications for Indian 202 projects are smaller than 100 units. It is also true that Indian Housing Authorities have experienced difficulty In attracting Indian elders to \"elderly\" projects; the Laguna Pueblo project, for exanple, has generally had a vacancy rate of 40 percent or more throughout its life. Accordingly, the Department has not emphasized outreach to potential Indian Section 202 sponsors. However, individual field offices -- particularly In Greensboro and Oklahoma City -- have attempted to circulate program information to Indian communities and to encourage development of approvable applications in recognition of special, local circumstances. In addition, it must be stated that the Section 202 program operates on a note-and-mortgage principle, and that the issue of loan security Is as central to Section 202 lending as it is to any other mortgage. Therefore, in proposing a Section 202 project, Indian communities face the familiar question of land inalienability, with the predictable limitations on the security of the loon.153 Item 20 F DERARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES -__________ _ - Mbmorandum mit July 7, 1986 Fm Clinical Director Rapid City Service Unit s~oact Third Party Payments to Ur. Everett Rhoades Di rector Indian Health Service THhO: Terrence W. Sloan, M.D. Director Aberdeen Area IKS As IHS physicians, we are dedicated to the improvement of health care for our patients and the Indian community. Often, we feel that our hands are tied with bureaucratic rules and red tape in providing this care. I specifically refer to current laws, mandates and regulations preventing us from collecting third party payments. Funding for the Indian Health Service has always been tight but the added dollars from third party payments can make a difference in Service Unit budgets, staffing, equipment and health care. Clearly, to the clinicians providing medical care to the patient, generating health care funds should be considered IHS's second priority. I have found five areas in which legislation could significantly improve our present budget crisis. 1. Currently, IHS physicians providing care In private hospitals are unable to generate bills to Medicare or Medicaid. The hospital bills are paid but we cannot collect for physician fees if the services are rendered in a non-Public Health facility. Sioux San Hospital in Rapid City, South Da- kota, is losing thousands of dollars from GYN surgeries, Ceserean Sections and vaginal deliveries performed by our physicians at Rapid City Regional Hospital. Almost 501 of our 08/GYh work is for Title 19 eligible pa- tients. Collection of these dollars could provide funds to hire an addi- tional OB/GYN for our hospital. INS physicians providing care at private institutions appears to me to parallel Mr. Reagan's desire for privitiza- tion of the 116. As thisjprivi~tization spreads throughout the INS, this problem can only become worse.- 2. Medicare and Medicaid eligible patients who are admitted to the hospital for less than 24 hours are being forced to be billed as outpatient proce- dures or else be denied by the Professional Review Organization for inpatient billing. Therefore, a tubal ligation performed at Pine Ridge, including anesthesia, can only be billed for the $66.00 outpatient charge. A chronic admission for a four unit blood transfusion can also only be billed for S66.00. Private hospitals have found inroads around this problem by 'itemized billing', a process that the Public Health Ser- vice is denied. It doesn't appear fair that private hospitals can gener- ate income by billing each Item (i.e., anesthesia, blood banking, labora- tory, etc.) separately and the INS should settle for a $66.00 outpatient fee. Significant dollars are lost on many costly outpatient procedures such as day surgery, endoscopy, chemotherapy, transfusions, and IV hydra- tion, to name a few.154 3. 1 understand that for many years. the discussion as to the IhS billingprivate insurance has existed. Many of our patients, including our Indian hospital staff, have good paying insurance. If the IS is the 'Agency of Last Payment\", then insurance companies should be billed for services ren- dered. The dollars should then be returned to the Service Unit, not placed in a general trust fund as is the present situation. 4. Frequently, IHS hospital beds are filled with sociai admissions or pa- tients needing nursing home placement. We are unable to bill Medicare or Medicaid because intensity of medical service requirements are not met on these patients. Thus, much labor and intenstive nursing and other hospi-tal services are not being reimbursed. Apparently, the IS is unable tobill MM for 'swing\" beds because they are-n-ot considered acute care. In priviate Istitutions, \"swing beds\" arebilled but it a lower rate than medical necessity beds. This allows some compensation for the expendi- tures. S. The Indian health Service should consider the development of several stra- tegically-located IHS or Tribal Nursing Homes. M/M dollars could bebilled to those patients who'were eligible. A more culturally sensitive atmostphere could be provided to our elderly population, a condition which is very important to our patients. Adequate Nursing homes would reduce the number of hospital admissions of those patients who refuse to go to a white Nursing Home but are extremely comfortable in staying in the hospi-tal with other elderly patients. These patients are receiving poor care, even neglect and abuse, in their present home situations and are admitted to the hospital once they are extremely ill or dying. I feel that a subtle cost savings in addition to the improvement of elderly health care would be of benefit to the IHS. As a member of the National Council of Clinical Directors, I have forwarded these suggestions to Dr. Chuck North, Chairman of the NCCD, for discussing at the next NCCO Meeting in November of this year. It is my hope that the NCCOwill pass resolutions towards headquarters in working on these items. I hope that you will support our efforts on these items. Please forward copies of this letter to those Headquarters personnel involved in these areas. Thank you for your time, consideration and continued support of the physicians in the field.155 Item 21 STATEMENT OF THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BEFORE THE HEARING OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING OF THE U.S. SENATE IN PINE RIDGE, S. 0. ON 'AMERICAN INDIAN ELDERLY-THE FORGOTTEN POPULATION\". JULY 21, 1988 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is pleased to respond to the Committee's request for a statement for the record of the subject hearing. Social services provided by the NIA are tee services that are not available from other Federal, State or locally funded programs. The DIA, in most cases, provides interim assistance until the Indian elderly can qualify for either Federal or state programs. As a result the majority of Indian elders are served by various programs authorized under the Social Security Act such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicare, and Title VI of the Older Americans Act. Recipients of aid from Title Vl must be 60 years of age and those receiving SSI must be 65 years of age if age is the only factor being considered. Other services include general assistance, custodial care, and Individual Indian Money (IIM) account supervision. The BIA also provides assistance in the management of interests elders may have in land held in trust by the BIA. Other assistance given the Indian elderly relates to the preparation of wills and assistance in the preparation of conveyance documents. Advice is also provided to those owners who wish to deed their land to a relative and retain a life estate. The 3IA operates a Housing Improvement Program (HIP) which involves repair and renovation of Indian housing and the construction of some new homes. This program is aimed at improving the standard of housing for those people who are not qualified to receive sousing assistance from any other source. The HIP program has a ranking system based on need. Although the program by design Is not specifically for the Indian elderly, a majority of the elderly qualify as HIP recipients based on need. Programs for the Indian elderly vary a great deal in different BIA Areas. For the most part, the tribes provide the most comprehensive programs that are available. They are able to oo this tnrough cooperation with the above mentioned Federal programs. Referrals usually come from the Indian Health Service centers. The centers often assist with applications and guide the elderly to the program for which they qualify. The 31A does respond to special needs that could not be met otherwise.156 On a number of reservations in South Dakota, BIA social services staff serve on local committees which focus on the needs of tribal elders. The Indian population in the BIA's Aberdeen Area includes 6,130 elderly individuals, 95 percent of whom reside on reservations. The elderly represent 9.2 percent of the Area's total service population. The Wind River Reservation tribes of Arapahoe and Shoshone in Wyoming have a nursing home called Morning Star Manor. The tribe supplements individuals' Social Security income to defray the total cost of care at Morning Star Manor. The cost per individual is $1900 per month. They serve 37 full-time live-in elderly. The tribes contract the operation to professionals with the plan of training tribal people to eventually take over the full time operation. In addition to this facility, there are four Senior Citizen centers on the reservation. Two serve the Shoshone Tribe ano two serve the Arapahoe Tribe. Each day, 48 noon meals funded by Title VI are served to those 60 years and over. Twenty-four meals are delivered to homes each day. The centers also proviae transportation for the elderly to enable them to take care of personal and medical needs. The BIA General Assistance program serves low income members of the community who are 55 years of age and a few handicapped individuals. Last year the Shosnone Tribe contributed $20,000.00 to the program ano also paid out $28,000 to help with heating bills. The members who are eligible for SSI receive $354 per month. It is estimated that there are approximately 400 Arapahoe and 200 Shoshone who are 60 years of age and older. The Phoenix Area and Navajo Area in the state of Arizona have an unusual situation because Social Security has denied SSI service to Indian people who are placed in facilities where the BIA pays for the balance of their care. Arizona never had the Medicaid program and the counties have never approved Indian people as clients for assistance programs. In the absence of assistance from the State, the aIA vas developed a program for adult care. Six or seven group homes are operated which are similar to nursing homes. These are contracted by the tribes and are 81A funded. The homes serve 350 elderly beginning at 55 years of age. The tribes also operate Senior Citizen centers under Title VI and Title III of the Older Americans Act. They serve meals at the centers and deliver some meals to homes, The problem of distances and lack of vehicles prohibit them from providing more delivered meals. It should be noted that our FY 1989 budget proposes to phase out our aid for institutional care in Arizona as the State phased in its program for Indians and nonIndians. Although the House Appropriations Committee accepted that proposal, the Senate Appropriations Committee has directed that we continue providing for those costs in Arizona as in the past.157 Several Issues that have a negative impact on the Indian elders have been identified by the local committees in South Dakota and include the following: Contrary to popular belitf, tribal elders are not always accorded nigh status in their communities. Concomitantly, there is limited awareness of their needs and of their overall importance to the culture. It is believed that Indian tribes,-as well as agencies which serve reservation populations. could counteract elders loss of status and respect by emphasizing their needs and designing programs to meet those needs. In most communities there is no novocacy for the Indian aged. Tribes and service agencies should be encouraged to sire specialists to advocate for the aged population regarding a variety of issues, including the need for social stimulation of this highly isolated group. Transportation costs are excessive for the Indian elderly. On most reservations, the elderly rely on private individuals for transportation (including family members) who may charge for transporting them to medical facilities, church, and even to visit their families. Transportation difficulties is the most universal issue with the Indian elderly. Telephone service is generally too expensive in rural reservation communities, and Is therefore beyond the financial capabilities of the Indian elderly who vitally need telephones. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and tribal housing authorities should reevaluate housing rent structures for the elderly, because rental cgsts are often disproportionally high for the incomes of most Indian elderly. Although some tribal interests oppose out-of-home care for the elderly, others strongly believe that tne development of reservation based nursing home facilities should be given high priority.158 Presently, homemaker/housekeeper services are available on a limited basi from the State of South Dakota and, marginally, from the BIA. It is Our understanding that the State of South Dakota's funding for homemaker/servicas is sometimes exhausted prior to the *nd of the fiscal year. At this time UA attempts to provide a minimal program to finish the year to prevent undue haroship on those who are dependent on this service. Due primarily to the extraordinarily high Incidence of diabetes among the Indian elderly, much emphasis should be placed on nutrition education programs and on the importance of the proper use of medications, Reliable statistics on Indian elder abuse do not exist. Sociea Service professionals express the consensus that, in the majority of Caes, abuse IS from within the family and 1s usually wall hidden. It is suspected that a high percentage of elder abuse Is perpetrated by family members who seok to extract money from either ISM accounts or from the small monthly Income that most elderly receive. It has been recommended that Indian elder abuse be identified as a public health issue, and that greater emphasis be placed on reporting and on generating a greater awareness of the problem. According to the 1980 Census, the average life expectancy for the Indian population is eight years shorter than that of the rest of the population. Studies by the National Indian Council on Aging show that the Indicn elderly live in poor housing and poor health. Federal programs that are established to provide health care to the Indian population indicate problems regarding the accessibility and utilization of these programs. The lack of transportation is a barrier to the services and facilities that do exist. This concludes the statement of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.159 Item 22 gem NATIONAL INDIAN HEALTH BOARD 50 South Steele Steet.

Source: Indian Health Service Chart Series Book, April, 1987 28161 Written Testimony Prepared for the Senate Special Committee on Aging to augment those statements presented before the fieldhearing \"The American Indian Elderly: The Forgotten Population'. Following is NIHB's response to questions posed by Senator LarryPressler. I. What is the health status of the Indian elderly compared toother groups? According to the Indian Health Service (UHS) the ten leading causes of death for descendants 65 years old and older for American Indians and Alaska Natives in Reservation States, 1982- 1984 (please see next page for comparative data) are as follows: 1. Diseases of heart; 2. Malignant neoplasms; 3. Cerebrovascular diseases; 4. Pneumonia and Influenza; 5. Diabetes mellitus; 6. Accidents; 7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and allied conditions; 8. Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; 9. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis; and 10. Atherosclerosis. The National Indian Council on Aging (NICOA), has provided insights shared by past conference participants. An undisputed finding is that one indicator of the poor health encountered by Indians is their lower life expectancy, which is approximately 10 years lower than the rest of the population (65 yr. vs 73 years in 1980) .A number of diseases, such as tuberculosis and diabetes, are much more prevalent among Indian elders than among the non-Indian elderly. A recent national study conducted by NICOA found that the rate of tuberculosis is five times higher among the Indian elderly than among the non-Indian elderly. There is also an exceptionally high rate of adult-onset diabetes. On one reservation, 40% of all adults have diabetes. Obesity is a health problem that increases the severity of certain diseases and has been identified as a catalyst of other health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. In the area of mental health, elderly Indians, if they have any mental problems, are likely to suffer from some type of neurosis, such as anxiety or depression. As it is with the non- Indian elderly, the total number receiving mental health services in proportion to their population is low. II. What type of health care services are available or not available to these individuals? Elderly Indians are subject to the same restraints imposed on other segments of the Indian population; this is particularly true for those residing within the Indian Health Service delivery system. IHS does not have the financial resources necessary to fund 100% of the level of need; the latest estimations place the162 figure at 89%. Even so, this is conservative at best, since supporting documentation is lacking for mental health needs; and there is an ever growing alarm over elder abuse. IS does not have programs with a comprehensive response to address this issue, other than medical attention. Much more is needed-- starting with an assessment of the frequency and severity of abuses to the elderly. Communities need to be included in the treatment approaches. Services available to those Indians residing outside the IS service area, is very limited. As a result, very few elderly Indians in the city seek out health care, either because the cost of modern urban health care is too exorbitant or because the surroundings are too foreign. The National Indian Council on Aging, (NICOA) has found that preventive care and dental treatment are very rarely sought. Many of the elderly are unemployed and consequently uninsured. The rising costs of insurance rates, places this basic need out of reach for many of our nation's Indian elders. All of this contributes to our elders going without medical care, with the exception of emergencies. This reality in all probability, costs us many lives that could have been prolonged with proper medical attention. Indian elders, among others, need to be able to access medical services when needed. When urban Indians do seek out health services, some may be refused services from public agencies because of the common misconception that IHS and BIA will meet their needs. For the rural and reservation elders who are served by INS other problems arise in spite of IHS's significant efforts and contributions. Lack of transportation continues to be a major dilemma for elders. More home health aides and CHRs for the Indian elderly are needed for such services as assistance with responding to minor medical problems; bathing, toileting and other types of hygiene; dispension of medicine; and sanitation measures. fidian people have long prided themselves on taking care of their elders. Recent public attention has brought to the forefront a much more painful concept that some of our elders are163 not only not being held in reverie but are being assaulted as well. IHS needs to record such matters that come to their attention, better enabling preventive and treatment programs to respond. Cooperation with the police, social services and other agencies to streamline efforts would also prove beneficial. III. How is the physician and nurse shortage impacting the quality of care provided to the elderly Indian? According to the Office on Technology Assessment's (OTA) report on Indian Health Care in 1985, IHS estimated its unmet need for health professionals relative to workloads in terms of unfilled positions, using an application of the resource requirement methodology. In 1985, unfilled staff positions in IHS facilities and tribally operated health programs were estimated to exceed 1,500 health professionals, including 155 surgeons (among other types of physicians) and 697 nurses. The ramifications of this scenario are obvious--would-be patients, including the elderly, are put on hold and left unserved, in favor of those deemed to be of a higher priority. Difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical staff limit the types of services available at many IHS hospitals, and surgeons are particulary difficult to recruit, in part because there are no National Health Service Corps (NHSC) scholarships for surgeons. The following are among the services not provided in any IHS hospital, according to the 1983 American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals: cardiac catheterization, X-ray radiation therapy and other megavoltage and radio-isotope therapeutic services, organ transplantation, burn care, and neonatal intensive care. Only nine (out of 47) IHS hospitals have a separate mixed intensive care unit, four operate premature nurseries, and three provide hospital-based renal dialysis. Conversely, 32 of 51 IHS and tribally operated hospitals have obstetrical services and 42 offer dental services. Although outpatient psychiatric and alcoholism services are widespread, there is only one inpatient alcoholism service and there are five inpatient psychiatric units .In part because IHS direct inpatient services are relatively limited even where hospitals are accessible, the IHS contract care programs has been under increasing budgetary pressures in recent years to fill these service gaps.164 As stated in previous point, the shortage of nurses, including home health aides and CHRs has negatively impacted the services available to the elderly. IV. Do the elderly Indians seek health care among non- professionals? While it is generally agreed, Indians, including some of the elderly, do seek out and utilize the expertise among traditional healers or medicine men, it is not possible to document this belief with any convincing data. It is also known, that some Indians, have employed the use of both their traditional medicine and Western medicine, depending on the nature and severity of the malady. Factors which influence the choice of resources, include among other things, how commonly practiced and accepted traditional medicine is within the specific community. A very rough estimation places the use of traditional healers between 5 (five) and 10 (ten) percent. There has been some resurgence of Indian people going back to the old ways in finding meaning to their life; and with this pursuit came a desire to learn and apply their ancestors beliefs. V. What problems can you identify in the current health care delivery system that reduces the quality of care? Tribal leaders and/or the elders need to be a viable force with meaningful input into the formulation of policies, prior to their development. In fact, tribal health consumers need to be involved in all aspects of health care which impacts their health and survival. To exclude their participation reduces the level of quality attainable by overlooking valuable and necessary sources. Alcoholism is the number one killer of Indian people, yet only one percent of the total IHS budget is directly allocated toward its preventi on and treatment. It is a gross understatement to say more needs to be done. It is imperative that tribal people are involved and participants in the approach selected. Family violence continues to make headlines daily in tribal and community newspapers, yet only recently has IHS focused attention on this matter. Elderly abuse can no longer be ignored or viewed as the family's problem and responsibility. IHS needs to take an active role in first assessing the magnitude of this165 type of violence and other assaults that occur to all age groups of the Indian population. NIHB has been encouraged by some recent headway made in this area. NINB congregated a small group of Indian people, whose background included extensive experience related to family violence programs. Through this effort, contacts were made with the IHS Special Initiatives Team, the American Indian Law Center, Victim Services Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs and others who sent representatives to meet in how to proceed to address this problem. A task force developed with INS assuming major responsibility for spearheading this effort. It seems appropriate to respond to this question with a list of recommendations developed by the National Indian Council on Aging (NICOA) conference participants in 1985 and more recently by the elders attending the National Training and Program Development conference on substance abuse and destructive behavior August 2-5, 1988: * Programs and services to combat elder abuse need to be developed and implemented. * Alcohol and substance abuse programs need to be adapted to specifically recruit and help elders and their families with the problems that occur with addictions. * Elders are in need of advocacy efforts in their best interests. Comments have been made that elders are being \"warehoused' and shoved into places--places not desired, such as nursing homes. * Attention needs to be given to the problem of medical equipment, such as wheel chairs, walkers, hospital beds, glasses, prostheses, etc., for which there is never enough funding or thought given to replacement problems. * More senior Indian centers need to be established where elderly can meet, have meals, games, activities, and companionship. * Title III programs need more volunteers. The younger generation of Indians need to become stronger advocates for services to the elderly. * More funds need to be made available for home health demonstration grants to allow tribes to establish these vital programs. * In-home services need to be increased. Again, more funds need to be made available to tribes for these services. * More homemakers should be provided for under Title VI of the Older Americans Act.166 * Members of the some tribes, such as the Navajo often live apart from each other and from services. They need better health services in the homes. * The age limit for in-home and other related services needs to be lowered in order to serve more of the needy elderly. * There needs to be more coordination between the agencies working in the home health care field and related services. * Transportation funds and services need to be increased to allow for greater service delivery -outreach, CHR, home health. * In some areas (notably the Navajo area) interpreters are needed in conjunction with transportation services when monolingual elderly have errands, appointments, etc. during which they have to interact with others who don't know their language. * Interpreters should be hired to work with elders as out-reach workers or Information and Referral Technicians. Funding should be made available for this. * Every community needs an information and referral service for health services for the chronically ill. Planning, training and research for the community could come from this central source. * Better basic information on all titles and programs should be provided so that everyone can understand how and why the services are provided. * A system to develop more program awareness needs to be devised: how to get benefits; where to get benefits; what program titles are available to the elderly, etc. * Workshops for tribal elders on the use of Medicaid and Medicare should be provided; better use of these services could thus be accomplished. * Assistance needs to be provided to the elderly in applying for SSI, food stamps, etc. * Food Stamp regulations should be made more flexible. Direct funding to reservation programs should be made available. * More emphasis needs to be placed on training elders to advocate at the local, state and national levels for their own programs. * Individuals performing services of the elderly need to educate themselves better in performing their duties. * Tribal program administrators need training to make them aware of the tribal elderly who will come under their programs, and167 also of what funds and programs are available. I More training funds need to be allocated to train people to work with Indian elderly. * In general, more funds are needed for work with the elderly, and more people need to be trained for this work. * The Federal government needs to be educated that even though some of the tribes have small population counts that the need for vital services is still great. There should not be a minimum population required for eligibility for grants. * More funds need to be allocated, over-all for Indian aging programs. I Tribes should be able to determine their own needs and service delivery concepts -i.e., direct funding. Title VI programs should be written so as to be more understandable to Indians and less bureaucratically phrased. * More tribes should apply for and utilize Title VI, direct funding. The Federal government needs to allocate more funds for various direct funding programs. ^ There needs to be increased coordination at the state (county) and Federal levels with tribal aging programs. Plans need to be developed to deal with the BIA to make it more supportive of elderly needs. I The Office Of Native American Affairs, mandated by Older Americans Act (OAA) Amendments of 1987 should be administered by an American Indian/Alaska Native with extensive experience working with tribal elder programs. ^ As Congress reconsiders the impact on the final rule on eligibility special attention should be given to the needs of Indian elders who may not meet the revised eligibility criteria, but nevertheless rely on IHS as their principle source for health care. Consideration should be given to exempting Indian elders from any changes in INS eligibility regulations.
