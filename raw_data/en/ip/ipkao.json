Those who possess a toxic faith have stepped across the line from a balanced perspective of God to an unbalanced faith in a weak, powerless or uncaring God. They seek a God to fix every mess, prevent every hurt, and mend every conflict. Toxic Faith distinguishes between a healthy faith and a misguided religiosity that traps believers in an addictive practice of religion. It shows how unbalanced ministries, misguided churches, and unscrupulous leaders can lead their followers away from God and into a desolate experience of religion that drives many to despair. Toxic Faith shows readers how to find hope for a return to genuine, healthy faith that can add meaning to life. In the words of the author, \"I want to help you throw out that toxic faith and bring you back to the real thing.\" Stephen Arterburn is the founder and chairman of New Life Ministries\u2014the nation's largest faith-based broadcast, counseling, and treatment ministry\u2014and is the host of the nationally syndicated New Life Live! daily radio program aired on over 180 radio stations nationwide, Sirius XM radio, and on television.

A bit odd reading it from an atheist perspective but enlightening nonetheless when viewing my faith experience retroactively. Arterburn is a psychologist who operates a practice focused on helping individuals solve longterm personal issues. He is a believing Christian and writes this book from the perspective that toxic faith (or immature faith) is detrimental while mature faith is healthy and uplifting. Even as an atheist I see great value in his perspective and, in retrospect, reading his book many years ago could have done me a world of good. Arterburn discusses cults but, aside from one case dealing with Hare Krishna, does not name them. The typical case presented is of overly fundamentalist evangelical believers or ministers/pastors who simply go overboard in childlike, immature faith. What struck me most about this book was that while Mormonism has some very respectable and admirable traits, there were very few pages where the unhealthy concept being discussed was not an integral or influential part of either Mormon belief or cultural practice. On the plus side, some of the traits of toxic/immature faith are not present in Mormonism in the least. Here are four key summarizing tables the author presents that identify elements of Toxic Faith.

I enjoyed it in the main, although some parts weren't really about things I could relate to, but I am sure others could. I read it because I need to heal from things that have been taught at a church we attended which border on cult-like, i.e. controlling leadership that made itself a very unhealthy mediator between church and Christ. The book is good and making someone who has suffered in church rethink what happened. Often one can fall into self-blame for what happened - this book helps unpick unhealthy teaching and measure it against a God of love and justice. It also challenges religious addiction, which is interesting. Toxic Faith is the most comprehensive work I have read regarding the dynamics of a spiritually abusive church--including its leader(s), co-conspirators, enablers, and members. Especially fascinating discussion of the roles in an abusive church or family, this book goes beyond the basic explanation of what an abusive religious system is, and how it operates, and goes into the particular tendencies that are found in both the leaders of toxic faith systems and their victims, and the role that religious addiction plays in the whole ball of wax. Highly recommended to anyone interested in this area of study. A good dialogue from professionals about one type of addiction: religious addiction. The authors are believers in God so they have a basis from which to speak about this addiction that is probably much more prevalent and widespread than most people would think. The main author, Stephen Arterburn, is well known in Christian circles for his radio shows, New Life Treatment Centers and various other books he has authored (Every Man's Battle, Healing is a Choice to name a couple). As happens in Christianity the need and use of trained psychologists is a controversial topic and so Arterburn finds himself often in the midst of controversy due to his training and his treatment centers, etc. However, the man has solid information that has been helpful and healing to many, many people. In this title Arterburn and his co-author, Felton, take what is true about any kind of addiction behavior and symptoms and correlate it to religion. It makes SO much sense and reading the book the reader can see how religion even becomes an addiction. In fact most readers will probably be able to see someone they know and/or love described in the book or perhaps themselves described! The title caught my eye as well as the fact that it has been sitting on my parents bookshelf for years, probably since it was released in 1991. So I'm reviewing the 1991 edition, it has since been updated and edited - the length of it has been cut by about 75 pages. As I was reading the original edition I found myself wishing I had the updated in my hands. The original edition is good, lots and lots of info, but it is too long. I'm tempted to flip through an updated copy and see what they nixed - my guess is the point still gets made. Regardless of the length, one chapter was literally 50 pages long (1991 edition), the book presents solid information about what this particular addiction looks like, behaves like, sounds like and how we can avoid it and how people can overcome it. I recommend the book but I recommend the updated edition (yellow cover). I read this book as someone who was surrounded by toxic faith my entire young life. I've watched those around me ruined by religious addiction and then watched that addiction turn into other addictions as we grew out of the church. I though as I started that this book might help me further understand and come to terms with this pain. However I just kept asking questions out loud of how can intelligent people watch what religion does to people and still logically believe that anything good can come out of such close minded hate driven by power and money? We need good secular ethics and then realize we are all here together to learn something together. Not keep dividing ourselves based on what outdated mythology we prescribe to. EVOLVE! Very unhelpful from a trauma-healing perspective especially if you suffered religious abuse as a Christian and are no longer in or interested in religion. The subtitle should be changed from \"experiencing healing from painful spiritual abuse\" to \"recognizing addiction to church (whatever that means?)\" or \"identifying unhealthy churches and christians\" because that is what it accomplishes although poorly. Not to mention, trying to think your way out of trauma and abuse is absolutely not how this works and no better perspective on God will fix real abuse and trauma like good psychiatric help will. I wouldn't recommend this book to Christians, ex-Christians, or otherwise. Outstanding book. Must-read for people of all faiths, especially those who work in ministry/pastoral/chaplain/ spiritual counseling or teaching roles. Some discussion of Christian beliefs but overall the book is applicable to all religions. Includes extensive discussions of how people from dysfunctional/abusive family backgrounds can develop toxic faith patterns. Only complaint is that I wish that the section on recovery was longer and more detailed. Great book at the beginning and end but the middle turns into a book on religious addiction that just doesn't seem to fit, overall, with the first 2 or 3 chapters. It was still interesting in the middle but was off from the overall tone set at the beginning. The last 2 or 3 chapters seems to get back on track again. What's great about this book is that it was written by a Christian insider, as opposed to an outsider who thinks he has a clue. The author is respectful yet honest about what happens in churches and ministries of any religious faith. It is incredibly insightful and interesting. The subtitle of this book is misleading. Although there IS a small section at the end dealing with recovery, the bulk of the book deals with how to identify toxic faith structures and what sort of person is prone to buy into them. As such, it was unhelpful for my purposes. I thought the book suffered from a lack of definition of toxic faith. I could not tell if the authors were addressing all the ways faith can be warped, the cultish, power-hungry leaders and organizations that exploit others, or the psychological needs that drive us toward misshapen faith. All of them were addressed, but I still don't really know what the book was about. I do think it is very healthy and important for churches and parents to be aware of the spiritual damage they can do to others, even when motives are good. Religious addiction is a new concept to me, but it resonates. And it is an important consideration that seeking fulfillment in religion may mean not actually dealing with our problems. This opened my eyes to how toxic some churches can be. Opening up my eyes to the idea of a 'persecutor' 'co-conspirator' 'enabler' 'victim' and 'outcast' and my experience was enlightened by identifying all of these. They don't just identify these things they also offer advice on where to get support. I've been thankful to go to a different and far healthier church and put much of this behind me but it is validating and helpful to read and gain a deeper understanding. If spiritual abuse has been a part of your life, this is a good look into that realm of pain. While I thought it would cover a broader spectrum of spiritual abuse, it mainly focused on overt forms of abuse, such as cults. It didn't really speak to covert, subtle ways spiritual abuse takes place. Overall, it was hood though. Odlina knjiga o religiji. A very solid informative read. All of the points raised contain good reasoning and sound Christian theology. It is, however, a very heavy read with lots of information to digest. I would recommend reading it, then reference back as you think and process. "}
