Recently, hypoxia has been identified to play an additional pathogenic role in diabetes. In this study, we hypothesized that ROS overproduction was secondary to the impaired responses to hypoxia due to the inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) by hyperglycemia. Methods: The ROS levels were analyzed in the blood of healthy subjects and individuals with type 1 diabetes after exposure to hypoxia. The relation between HIF-1, glucose levels, ROS production and its functional consequences were analyzed in renal mIMCD-3 cells and in kidneys of mouse models of diabetes. Results: Exposure to hypoxia increased circulating ROS in subjects with diabetes, but not in subjects without diabetes. High glucose concentrations repressed HIF-1 both in hypoxic cells and in kidneys of animals with diabetes, through a HIF prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD)-dependent mechanism. The impaired HIF-1 signaling contributed to excess production of mitochondrial ROS through increased mitochondrial respiration that was mediated by Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). The restoration of HIF-1 function attenuated ROS overproduction despite persistent hyperglycemia, and conferred protection against apoptosis and renal injury in diabetes. Conclusions: We conclude that the repression of HIF-1 plays a central role in mitochondrial ROS overproduction in diabetes and is a potential therapeutic target for diabetic complications. These findings are timely since the first PHD inhibitor that can activate HIF-1 has been newly approved for clinical use.

Editor's evaluation The paper is novel, informative, and with interesting translational implications. This paper will be of interest to scientists interested in diabetes and its complications, as well as the wider field of hypoxia biology. It provides evidence to understand why diabetes causes damage to multiple tissues when oxygen supply becomes limited. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70714.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70714.sa0) Introduction Excessive production of mitochondrial ROS is a key contributor to oxidative stress, which is a major cause of diabetic complications ( [Charlton et al., 2020](#bib11); [Giacco and Brownlee, 2010](#bib18)). In diabetes, excessive production of ROS in mitochondria is caused by an increased proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. This occurs secondary to elevated electron transport chain flux, mainly at complex I and complex III ( [Nishikawa et al., 2000](#bib28)). Hypoxia also plays an important role in the development of diabetic complications and is present in both patients with diabetes ( [Bernardi et al., 2011](#bib3)) and in animal models with diabetes, in all tissues in which complications occur ( [Catrina, 2014](#bib8); [Catrina and Zheng, 2021](#bib9)). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor central in the cellular response to low oxygen tension ( [Prabhakar and Semenza, 2015](#bib33)). HIF-1 is a composed of two subunits, HIF-1 and HIF-1, both of which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. Regulation of HIF-1 function is critically dependent on the degradation of the HIF-1 subunit in normoxia. The molecular basis of its degradation is oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of at least one of the two proline residues by specific Fe2+-, and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent HIF 1-3), among which, Egln1 gene) has the main role. Hydroxylated HIF-1 binds to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein, which acts as an E3 ligase and targets HIF-1 for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 is stabilized against degradation, translocates to the nucleus, binds to hypoxic responsive elements (HRE) and activates transcription of a series of genes involved in different processes (i.e. angiogenesis, cell proliferation, survival, and cell metabolism). These processes enable the cell to adapt to reduced oxygen availability ( [Sch\u00f6del and Ratcliffe, 2019](#bib36)). HIF-1, as the key mediator of adaptation to low oxygen tension, contributes to a balance in redox homeostasis by supressing the excessive mitochondrial production of ROS under chronic hypoxia, thereby minimizing potentially deleterious effects ( [Semenza, 2017](#bib37)). Since HIF-1 stability and function is complexly repressed in diabetes ( [Catrina and Zheng, 2021](#bib9)), we hypothesized that its repression might contribute to increased ROS. We therefore investigated the impact of glucose levels on ROS production during hypoxia in cells, animal models of diabetes and patients with diabetes, and whether the excessive mitochondrial ROS production in diabetes could be normalized by restoring HIF-1 function. We found that repressed HIF-1 function secondary to hyperglycemia contributes to an overproduction of mitochondrial ROS with direct pathogenic effects. Consequently, pharmacological or genetic interventions to prevent repression of HIF-1 function normalize mitochondrial production of ROS in diabetes and inhibit the development of nephropathy, in which hypoxia plays an important pathogenic role ( [Haase, 2017](#bib20)).

Clinical study [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70714?item=s2-1) Thirteen non-smoking patients with type 1 diabetes (28.9 \u00b1 7.2 years old; 53.8% exposed to intermittent hypoxia for 1 hr, consisting of five hypoxic episodes (13% O2, 6 min) that alternated 6 min) ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/70714/figures#fig1s1)). The subject breathed through a disposable mouthpiece which was connected via an antibacterial filter (Carefusion, Yorba Linda, CA,USA) to a T-tube carrying one-way respiratory valves (Tyco Healthcare, Hamshire, UK). A nose clip assured that respiration occured through the mouth. The air supplied to the subject came from a tube connected to a stopcock (Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS, USA) connected to a 60 L Douglas bag (Hans Rudolph) which was continuously filled with hypoxic gas. By turning the stopcock, the air supplied to the subject could be switched from hypoxic to ambient (normoxic) air. The Douglas bag was positioned behind the subject's bed, so that he/she could not notice when the hypoxic gas or normoxic air was supplied. Blood samples were taken before and immediately after hypoxia exposure. Patients had been diagnosed with diabetes for 10-20 years, showed no signs of peripheral neuropathy and had intact peripheral sensibility when checked with monofilament and vibration tests. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, and carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The fluorescent using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Animals Diabetic male BKS-Leprdb/db/JOrlRj (Leprdb/db) mice and healthy controls were from Janvier Labs. Characteristics of the mice prior to experiments are summarized in [Table 1](#table1). Leprdb/db mice with HbA1c levels > 55 mmol/mol or blood glucose >15 mM when HbA1c levels were between 45 and 55 mmol/mol were included in the analysis. Mice were allocated into groups according to their age, HbA1c or blood glucose levels. Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with DMOG (320 mg/kg body weight) 4 days and 1 day before sacrifice for the analysis of mitochondrial function. For other analyses, Leprdb/db mice were injected (i.p.) with DMOG (50 mg/kg body weight) every second day for 1 month before sacrifice. Egln1+/- mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were generated as previously described ( [Mazzone et al., 2009](#bib25)). Characteristics of the mice prior to experiments are shown in [Table 2](#table2). Diabetes was induced in male Egln1+/- and WT mice with streptozotocin (STZ) i.p. injections. STZ was administered at 50 mg/kg body weight daily for five consecutive days, and mice were diabetic for at least 6 weeks before sacrifice. Blood glucose before and after STZ injection are shown in [Table 3](#table3). Mice were exposed to a 12 hr light/dark cycle at 22\u00b0C, and were given standard laboratory food and water ad libitum. The sample size was calculated to achieve 30% difference in albuminuria between DMOG or vehicle - treated Leprdb/db mice or between diabetic Egln1+/- and WT mice and was adjusted for each parameter according to preliminary results. The experimental animal procedure was approved by the North Stockholm Ethical Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70714?item=s2-13) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded kidney tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer using a pressure cooker. After washing the slides with PBS-T three times for 3 min each, sections were demarcated with a hydrophobic pen. Sections were blocked with goat serum in PBS for 30 min at RT and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary were then washed with PBS-T four times for 5 min each. Sections were incubated for 1 hr at RT in the dark with a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody, Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa fluor 488 or 594 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A-11008 or A-11037, 1:500 diluted). Sections were then washed with PBS-T four times for 5 min each and treated with 0.1% Sudan Black-B solution (Sigma) for 10 min to quench autofluorescence. Sections were counterstained with DAPI for 3 min, and were mounted and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 and SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Image analysis was blinded and performed using Image-Pro Premier v9.2 (Media Cybernetics) software. To detect hypoxia in mouse kidneys, pimonidazole solution (Hypoxyprobe-1 Omni Kit, Hypoxyprobe, Inc) was i.p. administered to mice at a dosage of 60 mg/kg body weight 90 min prior to tissue harvest. Pimonidazole adducts were detected on kidney sections using a 1:100 RED PE dye-conjugated mouse monoclonal according Hypoxyprobe RED PE Kit protocol. To detect HIF-1, the above method was modified to incorporate the Tyramide Superboost kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, after antigen retrieval, the sections were blocked with 3% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase activity before blocking with goat serum (both ingredients provided in the kit). Following the PBS-T washes after primary HIF-1 antibody incubation, the sections were incubated with an HRP-conjugated rabbit antibody for 1 hr at RT. Sections were washed rigorously and incubated with tyramide reagent for 10 min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped by incubating with the stop solution for 5 min, and samples were washed with PBS-T three times for 3 mins each. The sections were subsequently treated with 0.1% Sudan Black-B solution, counterstained and mounted as mentioned above. Evaluation of ROS levels in kidney [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70714?item=s2-14) ROS levels in kidney tissues were indirectly assessed by evaluating non-enzimatic lipid peroxidation by measuring 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adduct levels using the OxiSelect HNE Adduct Competitive ELISA kit (STA838, Cell Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Kidney mitochondrial function [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70714?item=s2-15) Mitochondria were isolated from mouse kidneys, and mitochondrial function was determined using high-resolution respirometry (Oxygraph 2 k, Oroboros) as previously described ( [Schiffer et al., 2018](#bib35)). The analysis was blinded. Briefly, respirometry was performed in respiration medium containing EGTA (0.5 mM), MgCl2 (3 mM), K-lactobionate (60 mM), taurine (20 mM), KH2PO4 (10 mM), HEPES (20 mM), sucrose (110 mM), and fatty-acid-free BSA (1 g/L). Pyruvate (5 mM) and malate (2 mM) were added to measure state two respiration, followed by the addition of ADP (2.5 mM) to measure complex I-mediated maximal respiratory capacity (state three respiration). Complex I + II-mediated maximal oxidative phosphorylation was evaluated after adding succinate (10 mM). LEAK respiration was measured in the presence of pyruvate (5 mM), malate (2 mM), and oligomycin (2.5 M).

Urine albumin and creatinine concentrations were evaluated in thawed urine samples using a DCA Vantage Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare GmbH) with the corresponding test cartridges DCA Microalbumin/Creatinine ACR urine test (01443699, Siemens Healthcare GmbH). Statistical analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70714?item=s2-20) All data used for statistical analysis are independent biological replicates. Technical replicates were applied during luciferase reporter, ELISA, caspase 3/7 activity, DNA and protein concentration, and QPCR analysis; and the average of the results from technical replicates is regarded as one biological data. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. Outliers identified using Grubbs' test were excluded from analysis. The differences between two groups were analysed using unpaired two-sided Student's t-test. Multiple comparisons of three or more groups were performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test or Holm-Sidak's test, or Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests followed by Dunnett T3 multiple comparison test for sample set with unequal standard deviations. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Results Hypoxia increases circulating ROS in patients with diabetes but not in control subjects without diabetes The effect of hypoxia on ROS production was evaluated in patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes (28.9 \u00b1 7.2 years old; HbA1c: 74.4 \u00b1 11.8 mmol/mol) and matched control subjects diabetes (30.5 \u00b1 8.5 years old; HbA1c: 35.5 \u00b1 2.6 mmol/mol). were exposed to mild and intermittent hypoxia (13% O2) for 1 hr ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/70714/figures#fig1s1)), which is known to elicit a clinical response ( [Duennwald et al., 2013](#bib14)). As shown in [Figure 1](#fig1), ROS levels in peripheral blood were increased by hypoxia in patients with diabetes. However, hypoxia did not change the ROS levels in normoglycemic control subjects. [see all](/articles/70714/figures#fig1) High glucose concentrations inhibit HIF-1 signaling through PHD-dependent mechanism and induce apoptosis in hypoxia Since hypoxia induces ROS in diabetes, and HIF-1 is the central regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia ( [Prabhakar and Semenza, 2015](#bib33)), we hypothesized that the dysregulated HIF-1 signaling contributes to the ROS overproduction in diabetes. We tested this hypothesis using mouse inner medulla collecting tubular cells (mIMCD-3), given the important pathogenic role of hypoxia in diabetic kidney disease ( [Palm, 2006](#bib32)). As shown in [Figure 2A](#fig2), the nuclear expression of HIF-1 increased after exposure to hypoxia; however, this effect was attenuated under hyperglycemic conditions. Moreover, HRE-driven luciferase reporter assay showed less HIF activity in conditions compared with normoglycemic conditions ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)). High glucose concentrations cells during hypoxia ( [Figure 2C](#fig2)). Interestingly, when the cells were exposed to dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), a competitive inhibitor of PHD, 2E](#fig2)) under hypoxic and hyperglycemic conditions. These results indicate that high glucose levels inhibit HIF-1 and induce apoptosis in hypoxic mIMCD3 cells through a PHD-dependent mechanism. Moreover, high glucose levels in hypoxia also enhanced caspase-3/7 activity in mIMCD3 cells, which could be inhibited by DMOG treatment ( [Figure 2F](#fig2)), suggesting that the apoptosis induced by high glucose levels and hypoxia is dependent on caspase-3 and -7. [see all](/articles/70714/figures#fig2) We next assessed the role of ROS in mediating apoptosis induced by hyperglycemia under hypoxic conditions, by pretreatment the mIMCD3 cells with the thiol reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC). As shown in [Figure 2G](#fig2), pretreatment with NAC significantly inhibited the increase of caspase-3/7 activity in mIMCD3 cells exposed to high glucose levels and hypoxia, indicating the role of ROS in the induction of apoptosis in these conditions. Repression of HIF-1 by high glucose concentrations contributes to increased mitochondrial ROS production in hypoxia We further investigated the influence of HIF-1 on mitochondrial ROS production in diabetes. Mitochondrial ROS levels were increased in cells exposed to high glucose levels and hypoxia ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)), which corresponded to impaired HIF-1 activity. Interestingly, HIF-1 activation by DMOG diminished the mitochondrial ROS overproduction induced by high glucose levels in hypoxia ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)), indicating HIF-1 repression as an important mechanism for increased mitochondrial ROS production in diabetes. This was further confirmed by similar results that were observed when HIF-1 activity was maintained during hyperglycemia in hypoxia by genetic approaches, that is silencing cells exposed to hypoxia and high glucose levels was followed by an increase of nuclear HIF-1 expression ( [Figure 3C](#fig3)) 3D](#fig3)). Mitochondrial ROS was also decreased in mIMCD3 cells expressing GFP-HIF-1 compared to cells expressing GFP under hypoxic and hyperglycemic conditions ( [Figure 3E-F](#fig3)). Taken together, these results suggest that mitochondrial ROS overproduction in cells exposed to a combination of hypoxia and hyperglycemia is dependent on the impairment of HIF-1 function and can be attenuated when HIF-1 activity is maintained. [see all](/articles/70714/figures#fig3) HIF-1 repression is responsible for excess ROS production in diabetic kidney To investigate the relevance of HIF-1 modulation on ROS levels in diabetes, we further focused our investigation on the kidney, where low oxygen levels play an important pathogenic role ( [Palm et al., 2003](#bib31)). ROS levels were higher in the kidney from mouse models of both type 2 diabetes (Leprdb/db mice) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes, as evaluated by 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) levels ( [Figure 4B and D](#fig4)). At the same time, HIF-1 signaling was repressed, as shown by insufficient activation of HIF-1 ( [Figure 4A and C](#fig4)), staining ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/70714/figures#fig4s1)). This reverse correlation between ROS and HIF-1 activity further supports the hypothesis that the repression of HIF-1 signaling contributes to the ROS overproduction in diabetes. [see all](/articles/70714/figures#fig4) We therefore sought to assess the influence of promoting HIF-1 function during hyperglycemia on ROS production in these animals. To this end, we inhibited PHD activity, either through pharmacological inhibition, by treatment of the Leprdb/db mice with DMOG or through genetic modification by employing Egln1+/- mice in the STZ-induced model of diabetes. Both methods were able to increase HIF-1 levels ( [Figure 4A and C](#fig4)) and HIF-1 activity, as assessed by HIF-1 target gene expression, despite persistence of hyperglycemia ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2](/articles/70714/figures#fig4s2) and [3](/articles/70714/figures#fig4s3)). Importantly, HIF-1 activation in the kidney was followed by a decrease in renal ROS levels in both Leprdb/db mice and STZ-induced diabetic mice ( [Figure 4B and D](#fig4)). Investigation of mitochondrial respiration in the kidneys of both animal models revealed an increase of the complex I- and complex I + II-mediated state three respiration and mitochondrial leak ( [Figure 4E and F](#fig4)). Promoting HIF-1 activity in the kidney of diabetic animals, by either DMOG treatment or by haplodeficiency of Egln1, was followed by HIF-1 target gene that inhibits the flux of pyruvate through tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and subsequent mitochondrial respiration ( [Kim et al., 2006](#bib24)), was down-regulated in diabetic kidneys and could be rescued by HIF-1 activation ( [Figure 4G and H](#fig4)). These results indicate an important role of PDK1 in mediating the effects of HIF-1 on the regulation of ROS production in diabetic kidney. In order to verify this mechanism, we transfected plasmids encoding GFP or GFP-fused PDK1 (GFP-PDK1) in glucose in hypoxia ( [Figure 4I](#fig4)), and assessed the mitochondrial ROS levels using flow cytometry analysis of mitosox intensity in GFP- or GFP-PDK1-positive cells. shown in [Figure 4J](#fig4), PDK1 overexpression diminished the mitochondrial ROS overproduction in cells exposed to high glucose levels in hypoxia, suggesting that the increased mitochondrial ROS is at least partially mediated by the inhibition of HIF-1 target gene PDK1 in these conditions. Promoting HIF-1 function reduces renal injury and ameliorates renal dysfunction in mouse models of diabetes Promoting HIF-1 function in diabetic animals, with its secondary suppression of ROS production, exerted protective effects on kidney function. In both Leprdb/db mice ( [Figure 5A-C , and H](#fig5)), promoting HIF-1 function prevented typical diabetic kidney lesions, as measured by reduced Kidney Injury Marker-1 (KIM-1) F](#fig5)). This resulted in improved renal function, as demonstrated by decreased albuminuria in both mouse models of diabetes ( [Figure 5G-H](#fig5)). Discussion Excessive mitochondrial ROS production is a central pathogenic contributor to the development of diabetic complications. In addition, excessive ROS stimulate several other deleterious biochemical pathways such as activation of protein kinase C, formation of advanced glycation end-products, polyol pathway flux and overactivity of the hexosamine pathway ( [Nishikawa et al., 2000](#bib28)). Here, we show that in diabetic models, overproduction of ROS from mitochondria is not due to increased electron transport chain flux secondary to hyperglycemia alone. Impairment of HIF-1 signaling is also a critical mechanism, since promoting HIF-1 activity in diabetic models in vitro and in vivo attenuated ROS production, despite the persistence of hyperglycemia, which prevents the development of oxidative stress-induced kidney injury. In subjects with diabetes, ROS levels increase after exposure to hypoxia in opposition to control subjects. Acute hypoxia can unmask the impaired HIF-1 signaling that presents in patients with diabetes. However, other ROS sources responsive to acute hypoxia, either from mitochondria ( [Hernansanz-Agust\u00edn et al., from elsewhere ( [Weissmann et al., 2000](#bib40)) cannot be excluded. The concentration of oxygen in tissues ranges from 1% to 10%, which continuously activates HIF-1 signaling machinery ( [Carreau et al., 2011](#bib6)). Therefore, the small decrease in oxygen tension present in patients with diabetes ( [Bernardi et al., 2017](#bib4)), combined with an impaired HIF-1 activation ( [Catrina et al., 2004](#bib7)), may contribute to increased ROS levels in tissues associated with diabetic complications. Indeed, the direct relationship between hyperglycemia-dependent repression of HIF-1 signaling and excess ROS in hypoxia was demonstrated experimentally both in vitro and in vivo in this study. We found that HIF-1 signaling was inhibited by hyperglycemia in tubular cells during hypoxia and in kidneys from mouse models of diabetes, through a PHD-dependent mechanism, which is in accordance with previous observations ( [Bento and Pereira, 2011](#bib2); [Catrina, 2014](#bib8)). This was followed by increased ROS production in mitochondria, when assessed by a specific mitochondrial probe ( [Wang et al., 2010](#bib38)), which was not evident under hyperglycemic conditions when HIF-1 function was promoted with different approaches. The relationship between HIF-1 and ROS is bidirectional, with most evidence showing that mitochondrial ROS has a stabilizing effect on HIF-1 ( [Brunelle et al., 2005](#bib5); [Chandel et al., 1998](#bib10); [Guzy et al., 2005](#bib19)), although the exact mechanisms are still unclear. Several mechanisms in the repressive effects of HIF-1 signaling on mitochondrial ROS production have also been identified ( [Fukuda et al., 2007](#bib17); [Kim et al., 2006](#bib24)). Our results indicate that the role of HIF-1 on ROS is due to the decreased respiration rate of the mitochondria, since both pharmacological and genetic induction of HIF-1 prevents increased respiration. This effect is at least partially mediated by HIF-1 target gene PDK1, that has been previously shown to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, leading to reduced flux of lactate through TCA cycle and electron transport chain ( [Kim et al., 2006](#bib24)). Along with the cellular systems that mitigate the effect of ROS (e.g. Nrf2) ( [Jiang et al., 2010](#bib23)), the increased mitochondrial leak noted in diabetes is a pathway aimed at diminishing ROS production by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential ( [Echtay et al., 2002](#bib15); [Miwa and Brand, 2003](#bib26)). However, to produce enough ATP, this is followed by increased flux through the electron transport chain. Although HIF-1 activity normally suppresses electron transport chain, this regulation is diminished in diabetes, resulting in an increased oxygen consumption rate and aggravation of cellular hypoxia that contributes to tissue injury. This was confirmed by increased pimonidazole staining in diabetic kidney in this study, as previously observed ( [Rosenberger et al., 2008](#bib34)). Thus, our results provide evidence for repressed HIF-1 in diabetes as a critical mechanism underlying the vicious cycle between oxidative stress and hypoxia, which is suggested to contribute to kidney injury ( [Honda et al., 2019](#bib22)). Indeed, pharmacological or genetic interventions to sustain HIF-1 signaling in diabetes normalized ROS production and had direct consequences on kidney function, despite persistent hyperglycemia. Albuminuria, a typical marker of diabetic nephropathy, was prevented in animal models of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes when HIF-1 signaling was maintained. This is in accordance with the previous reports after exposure to cobalt, which also stabilizes HIF-1 ( [Ohtomo et al., 2008](#bib30)). The expression of the proximal tubular damage marker KIM-1, which in diabetic nephropathy becomes positive even before detection of albuminuria ( [Nauta et al., 2011](#bib27); [Nordquist et al., 2015](#bib29)), was not evident when ROS levels were suppressed by promoting HIF signaling in both animal models. This is in agreement with the absence of an increase of KIM-1 in diabetic kidneys where the renal oxygen levels were normalized ( [Friederich-Persson et al., 2018](#bib16)). Moreover, apoptosis, another classical marker of ROS damage in diabetic nephropathy ( [Allen et al., 2003](#bib1)), was reduced not only in DMOG-treated mIMCD3 cells exposed to high glucose concentrations in hypoxia but also in DMOG-treated Leprdb/db mice and diabetic Egln1+/- mice. Thus, promoting HIF-1 is a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat even other chronic diabetes complications since excessive production of mitochondrial ROS is a key common driver of diabetic complications ( [Charlton et al., 2020](#bib11); [Giacco and Brownlee, 2010](#bib18)). In conclusion, we demonstrate that the PHD-dependent HIF-1 repression induced by high glucose concentrations contributes to excessive production of mitochondrial ROS in diabetes, which is mediated by increased mitochondrial respiration secondary to the inhibition ( [Figure 6](#fig6)). Promoting HIF-1 function is sufficient to normalize ROS levels during hyperglycemia and protects against diabetic nephropathy, making HIF-1 signaling an attractive therapeutic option for diabetes complications. This is a timely finding, given that the first PHD inhibitor that can activate HIF-1 has been recently approved for clinical use ( [Chen et al., 2019](#bib12)).

Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Repression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 Contributes to Increased Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species Production in Diabetes\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ernestina Schipani as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: The reviewers have listed numerous strengths. Weaknesses were also identified. Please, address concerns and comments point-by-point. Of note, additional experiments are less important than modifications to current data and text. Reanalysis and modifying text are essential to support the claims of the paper. Reviewer #1: In this study, Zheng and colleagues report the novel findings that in diabetic models hyperglycemia suppress HIF1a in a PHD-dependent manner, and this in turn leads to increased mitochondrial ROS and cell death. Both the increased ROS and the cell death are prevented by increasing HIF1a activity either pharmacologically or genetically. The paper is novel, informative, and with interesting translational implications. The authors used a variety of in vitro and in vivo models for the testing of their hypothesis, with special emphasis on a model of diabetic nephropathy. However, a few issues need to be addressed in order to strengthen the authors' conclusions and their biological significance. 1. Suppressing HIF1a should also increase mitochondrial oxygen consumption and, thus, intracellular hypoxia. Along those lines, it would be helpful if the authors could show the pimonidazole data per se, in addition to the ratio HIF1a/pimonidazole. Increasing intracellular hypoxia could be an alternative mechanism that may promote cell death upon HIF1a suppression. 2. The authors do not provide unequivocal evidence that the increased mitochondrial ROS are responsible for the cell death upon exposure to hyperglycemia. Along those lines, use of reducing agents such as NAC could be helpful and informative. 3. Is the cell death documented by the authors caspase-3 dependent? 4. All western blot data should be properly quantified. 5. In the various genetic models, inactivation or increased expression of the gene of interest should be properly documented. Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Zheng et al. addresses the question of whether abnormal HIF stabilisation in response to hypoxia could be responsible for the increased ROS generation in diabetes, and whether hyperglycaemia could be the driver for the ROS damage and cell death in hypoxia. Diabetes complications across multiple organs are associated with oxidative damage and are accompanied by restricted oxygen delivery due to vascular dysfunction. Thus, understanding how these two phenotypes are linked by diabetes is an important question for advancing our understanding of diabetes complications and to identify novel therapeutic targets. Strengths This study uses multiple different techniques to address this question, using cell culture, animal models as well as human samples. Mechanistic conclusions are based on both genetic and pharmacological approaches, adding strength to the key findings. This is an excellent continuation of high-quality work conducted by this group in this field. The conclusions have far reaching consequences within the field. Weaknesses Although the authors establish a translational pipeline for their findings, from cells to animals to humans, the findings from the human studies could be interpreted in alternative ways to that presented. Cells cultured for 24hrs in hypoxia have sufficient time to activate the HIF transcription factor, its downstream targets and result in a functional outcome for the cell. Humans exposed to hypoxia for 1 hr will not have the same time to induce the HIF-dependent effects, and other mechanisms will be at play. To some extent this is due to the difficulties of performing mechanistic studies in humans, however, care should be taken in not oversimplifying findings and instead highlighting alternative conclusions. Reactive oxygen species are a group of molecules comprising different species with different reactivities. It is important to be clear which aspects of ROS and their downstream damage are being measured with these methodologies. Care must be taken to ensure the correct statistical analysis is performed based on the groups assessed, the study design and the scientific question being asked. My major concern relates to the conclusions drawn from the human studies and their direct relevance to the cell/animal work. 1. Results - human study. This is a really interesting and important finding that the diabetic patients have greater ROS generation in response to hypoxia. However, this is an acute hypoxic response and will not be related to any HIF-related changes in mitochondrial function that form the core of the rest of the paper. These are two independent mechanisms/phenomena. I think this has to be addressed at some point in the paper, that the findings in patients cannot be explained by the mechanism presented in the rest of the manuscript, and are more likely due to other acute hypoxic factors. For example, in the discussion the authors state 'An optimal HIF-1 response during hypoxia, as seen in the control subjects in our study\" - this is false - 1 hr is not sufficient to induce a HIF response that has a functional outcome that could have been measured in the blood of the patients. 2. Abstract - nonspecific terminology needs correcting to make the abstract specific to the findings. Terms such as \"the dynamics of ROS levels\" and \"was followed by functional consequences\" don't really tell the reader what was found in the paper. Also, please don't use the term \"findings are highly significant\" as this could relate to statistics. 3. Introduction - paragraph 1 - The final sentence about ROS generation being related to increased glucose availability is not relevant to all tissues - in heart for example there is decreased intracellular glucose availability. Please correct to make this broad statement more tissue specific. 4. Methods - Evaluation of ROS levels in kidney. 4HNE does not detect ROS - it measures oxidative damage as evident by lipid peroxidation. It is incorrect in the methods and results to describe this as ROS levels. 5. Methods - Clinical study - please describe how the patients were given 5 hypoxic episodes - methodological detail is lacking. 6. Statistics - I am confused about some of the choices for statistical analysis. In figure 1 why was an unpaired t-test used when the same patient has been tested at 0 and 4 hrs, this should be a paired t-test. Figure 2 - I'm unclear why a repeated measures ANOVA was used, when these were independent groups of cells, not the same cells measured at different points/conditions (this shouldn't be repeated measures). Figures 4 and 5 - when there are groups with 2 factors varying - genotype (wt vs PHD) and diabetic status (Ctl and db) - this should be a 2-way ANOVA not a one-way ANOVA. 7. Figure 3 - panels B and C - could the authors show HIF blots for these same groups, to compliment the mitosox intensity, so its possible to relate ROS to the degree of HIF stabilisation in these genetic cell models. 8. Figure 4 - could the authors please comment on why respiration in the PHD2 mutant isn't below the WT? One would expect the HIF stabilisation in this model to decrease oxygen consumption. 9. Discussion - 3rd paragraph. The authors have made incorrect conclusions regarding their respiration data. They state that \"our results indicate that the role of HIF on ROS is limited to complex I\". What the data shows is that when respiring through the ETC that involves all of complexes I, II, III, and IV - with substrate feeding in at the start and oxygen consumed at the end - that there is a HIF dependent effect. They cannot conclude it is at complex I as they haven't independently assessed complex II (independent of complex I), complex III and separately complex IV (which would need to be done with succinate alone, DHQ and TMPD as 3 separate experiments). The data shows the HIF effect resides at some point between Complex I and Complex IV. 10. Table 3 - blood glucose before STZ - is this significantly different? 11. Page 9 - PDK1 only inhibits flux through the TCA is exclusively metabolising glucose - not the case if metabolising amino acids or fatty acids. Reviewer #3: Strengths: 1. Oxidative stress and damage is central to pathology of diabetic complications. As mitochondria are a key generator of ROS-mediated damage, the authors nicely connect glucose-dependent HIF1a deficiency with the development of mitochondrial ROS-mediated damage. 2. Approaches to understand and target oxidant stress in diabetic complications are elusive and the authors nicely delineate a PHD2-dependent mechanism by which HIF1a levels decline, subsequently giving rise to renal dysfunction. 3. Notably, improvement of HIF1a levels by PHD2 pharmacologic or genetic inhibition appears to ameliorate renal injury independent of glycemic control. This could be of high translational value as therapies to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy do not exist currently in the clinic. Weaknesses: 1. The mechanism by which hyperglycemia precipitates PHD2-dependent HIF1a degradation and activation of renal injury is not clear. 2. The induction of mitochondrial damage to elicit mitochondrial ROS and subsequent renal compromise downstream of HIF1a deficiency is proposed to be via PDK1. It would strengthen the paper if the PDK1-dependent mechanism was further solidified. 3. Clinical data on patients with uncontrolled T1D and impaired circulating hypoxia responses are very interesting, but it is unclear how they directly relate to the renal specific findings presented in the remainder of the manuscript. The study presented by Zheng and colleagues is well written and serves to highlight the important role of ROS in the development of diabetic kidney disease. The studies are interesting, well written, and nicely performed. Further, the translational implications of PHD2 inhibition to potentially ameliorate diabetic nephropathy are highly appealing. However, a central concern is that some of the major observations of this study, while interesting, appear to be consistent with other previous observations in the field. Indeed, several groups have observed a depletion of HIF1a leads to renal demise. Further, PHD2 genetic and pharmacologic inhibition have been shown by several groups to protect against renal injury. Finally, the importance of mitochondrial ROS in diabetic kidney disease is also well known. While this study nicely weaves the concept together, a concern is the results are mostly confirmatory in nature. Thus, several approaches could be employed to enhance the novelty of the observations within the manuscript. 1. The authors note that glucose reduces HIF1a levels through a PHD2 dependent mechanism, yet in Figure 4 supplement 2, PHD2 levels do not rise in db/db mice. It would substantially improve the manuscript if the mechanisms underlying increased PHD2 activity/HIF1a degradation were reconciled. Is enzymatic activity enhanced? Is it possible that VHL targets HIF1a for degradation more rapidly? Garcia-Pastor et al. (Sci Reports 2019) previously published that glucose inhibits the interaction of HIF1a with Hsp90 in cell lines. Does this occur in primary cells as well? 2. The authors implicate loss of PDK1 activity downstream of HIF1a deficiency as a key mechanism underlying the increase in complex I activity and subsequent mitochondrial ROS. However, reductions in PDK1 gene expression are modest at best. This mechanism, while based upon a highly interesting study from Kim and colleagues in Cell Metabolism, is not well substantiated in the author's study. More conclusive experimentation reconciling this pathway's importance is crucial for the development of the mechanism underlying the authors' model. 3. Increases in mitochondrial ROS in diabetic nephropathy have also been thought to be related to effects on the Nrf2 anti-oxidant response, which is not discussed in this study. It would be helpful to address the potential roles of Nrf2 in the pro-oxidant responses surveyed in their mouse and cell based models. 4. Clinical data on T1D patients, while interesting, is of unclear utility in this manuscript. Do these patients have renal disease? While HbA1c levels are higher in T1D patients versus non-T1D patients, are ROS responses improved in T1D patients with normal glycemic control? Further, as ROS levels are often transient in the blood stream, what are the ambient blood glucose levels during the period of the EPR assays?

Suppressing HIF1a should also increase mitochondrial oxygen consumption and, thus, intracellular hypoxia. Along those lines, it would be helpful if the authors could show the pimonidazole data per se, in addition to the ratio HIF1a/pimonidazole. Increasing intracellular hypoxia could be an alternative mechanism that may promote cell death upon HIF1a suppression. The levels of hypoxia evaluated by pimonidazole staining were added as Figure 4-supplement figure 1. It is true that the levels of intracellular hypoxia were increased in diabetic kidneys compared with the animals without diabetes that confirms previous observations (Rosenberger, Khamaisi et al. 2008, PMID: 17914354) and were improved by HIF induction in both animal models. Their potential contribution to tissue injury was added in Discussion (the first paragraph of page 26). 2. The authors do not provide unequivocal evidence that the increased mitochondrial ROS are responsible for the cell death upon exposure to hyperglycemia. Along those lines, use of reducing agents such as NAC could be helpful and informative. We thank to the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. Since we have found that the cell death induced by high glucose levels in hypoxia is dependent on caspase-3/7 (next question), we have verified the effect of NAC on the caspase-3/7 activity in mIMCD3 cells. As shown in Figure 2G, the caspase-3/7 activity increased in mIMCD3 cells exposed to high glucose concentrations and hypoxia, and was inhibited by NAC pre-treatment. These results indicate that the increased mitochondrial ROS is responsible for cell apoptosis upon exposure to hyperglycemia and hypoxia. This result has been added to the manuscript as Figure 2G. 3. Is the cell death documented by the authors caspase-3 dependent? The caspase-3/7 activity has been evaluated in mIMCD3 cells exposed to normal (5.5 mM) or high (30 mM) glucose levels in normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H) using Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit from Promega. As shown in Figure 2F, high glucose levels in hypoxia enhanced caspase 3/7 activity in mIMCD3 cells, which could be inhibited by DMOG treatment. These results suggest that the apoptosis induced by high glucose levels in hypoxia is dependent on caspase-3 and -7 and are added to the manuscript as Figure 2F. 4. All western blot data should be properly quantified. All the western blot data were quantified as suggested. The quantifications have been added below each western blot. 5. In the various genetic models, inactivation or increased expression of the gene of interest should be properly documented. We thank the reviewer for very good suggestion. The expression of VHL gene in cells transfected with control siRNA and VHL siRNA is shown in Figure 3B, and the endogenous nuclear HIF-1 protein expression was analysed fluorescent immunocytochemistry (Figure 3C). of GFP and were verified using confocal microscopy and the nuclear HIF-1 expression in GFP-HIF-1-expressing cells was further confirmed by immunocytochemistry using anti-HIF-1 antibody (Figure 3E). Egln1 gene expression in healthy and diabetic wild-type and Egln1+/- mice is shown in Figure 4 \u2014figure supplement 3B. Reviewer #2: [...] My major concern relates to the conclusions drawn from the human studies and their direct relevance to the cell/animal work. 1. Results - human study. This is a really interesting and important finding that the diabetic patients have greater ROS generation in response to hypoxia. However, this is an acute hypoxic response and will not be related to any HIF-related changes in mitochondrial function that form the core of the rest of the paper. These are two independent mechanisms/phenomena.

For example, in the discussion the authors state 'An optimal HIF-1 response during hypoxia, as seen in the control subjects in our study\" - this is false - 1 hr is not sufficient to induce a HIF response that has a functional outcome that could have been measured in the blood of the patients. We agree with the reviewer that exposure for 1 hour to hypoxia is not sufficient for the functional outcome of HIF-1-related genes. We believe however that this short exposure to hypoxia unmasks the impaired function of HIF-1 that is already present in the subjects with diabetes before exposure to hypoxia. Our hypothesis is sustained by the findings that the plasma levels of microRNA-210 (which is a target uniquely regulated by HIF-1) are lower in the subjects with diabetes (26.7 \u00b1 14.5 %, P<0.05) than in controls (100 \u00b1 52.5 %) before exposure to hypoxia. However, we cannot exclude other sources of ROS independent of HIF-1 that are activated by short exposure to hypoxia, either from mitochondria (Waypa, Marks et al. (Hernansanz-Agustin, (Weissman, Tadic et al. 2000. PMID: 11000128). This has been added to the Discussion in the manuscript (2nd paragraph of page 24). 2. Abstract - nonspecific terminology needs correcting to make the abstract specific to the findings. Terms such as \"the dynamics of ROS levels\" and \"was followed by functional consequences\" don't really tell the reader what was found in the paper. Also, please don't use the term \"findings are highly significant\" as this could relate to statistics. We made the changes suggested by the reviewer. 3. Introduction - paragraph 1 - The final sentence about ROS generation being related to increased glucose availability is not relevant to all tissues - in heart for example there is decreased intracellular glucose availability. Please correct to make this broad statement more tissue specific. The sentence was changed as suggested. 4. Methods - Evaluation of ROS levels in kidney. 4HNE does not detect ROS - it measures oxidative damage as evident by lipid peroxidation. It is incorrect in the methods and results to describe this as ROS levels. We completely agree with the reviewer and changed the description accordingly. 5. Methods - Clinical study - please describe how the patients were given 5 hypoxic episodes - methodological detail is lacking. The details of the hypoxia exposures were added (page 7). 6. Statistics - I am confused about some of the choices for statistical analysis. In figure 1 why was an unpaired t-test used when the same patient has been tested at 0 and 4 hrs, this should be a paired t-test. Figure 2 - I'm unclear why a repeated measures ANOVA was used, when these were independent groups of cells, not the same cells measured at different points/conditions (this shouldn't be repeated measures). Figures 4 and 5 - when there are groups with 2 factors varying - genotype (wt vs PHD) and diabetic status (Ctl and db) - this should be a 2-way ANOVA not a one-way ANOVA. Unpaired t-test was applied in Figure 1 because some samples were missing that precludes the use of paired t-test. We agree that ordinary one-way ANOVA test is appropriate to be used for Figure 2 and changed in consequence. We agree that two-way ANOVA test should be applied in the experiments that have two independent variables (genotype and diabetic status) and we changed accordingly. 7. Figure 3 - panels B and C - could the authors show HIF blots for these same groups, to compliment the mitosox intensity, so its possible to relate ROS to the degree of HIF stabilisation in these genetic cell models. We agree with the reviewer that it is important to show the HIF-1 expression levels in these experiments. We have therefore documented the nuclear HIF-1 expression in the conditions where ROS levels were decreased. These results have been added to Figure 3. 8. Figure 4 - could the authors please comment on why respiration in the PHD2 mutant isn't below the WT? One would expect the HIF stabilisation in this model to decrease oxygen consumption. Very interesting question! We believe that non-diabetic condition is a non-challenged state, where the local oxygen levels in kidney are similar between WT and Egln1+/- mice (PHD mutant), as shown by similar pimonidazole staining levels (Figure 4 \u2014figure supplement 1B). Under this condition, HIF-1 signaling is under proper regulation as illustrated by similar HIF-1 (Figure 4C) and HIF-1 target gene e.g. GLUT3 (Figure 4 \u2014figure supplement 3) expression levels, therefore oxygen consumption rate is comparable. The effects of HIF-1 stabilisation secondary to the genetic manipulation of Egln1 (encoding PHD2) is however uncovered in diabetes, where it maintains an adequate HIF-1 level in opposition to WT mice with diabetes and in consequence to have a lower respiration. 9. Discussion - 3rd paragraph. The authors have made incorrect conclusions regarding their respiration data. They state that \"our results indicate that the role of HIF on ROS is limited to complex I\". What the data shows is that when respiring through the ETC that involves all of complexes I, II, III, and IV - with substrate feeding in at the start and oxygen consumed at the end - that there is a HIF dependent effect. They cannot conclude it is at complex I as they haven't independently assessed complex II (independent of complex I), complex III and separately complex IV (which would need to be done with succinate alone, DHQ and TMPD as 3 separate experiments). The data shows the HIF effect resides at some point between Complex I and Complex IV. We thank to the reviewer for the comments. Indeed, the experimental design used does not allow to rule out other mitochondrial ROS generating contributors and we changed the statement in consequence. 10. Table 3 - blood glucose before STZ - is this significantly different? The blood glucose levels before administration of STZ are not different between wild type mice and Egln1+/- mice using two-way ANOVA test. 11. Page 9 - PDK1 only inhibits flux through the TCA is exclusively metabolising glucose - not the case if metabolising amino acids or fatty acids. We completely agree with the reviewer and we have made the appropriate correction. Reviewer #3: [...] The study presented by Zheng and colleagues is well written and serves to highlight the important role of ROS in the development of diabetic kidney disease. The studies are interesting, well written, and nicely performed. Further, the translational implications of PHD2 inhibition to potentially ameliorate diabetic nephropathy are highly appealing. However, a central concern is that some of the major observations of this study, while interesting, appear to be consistent with other previous observations in the field. Indeed, several groups have observed a depletion of HIF1a leads to renal demise. Further, PHD2 genetic and pharmacologic inhibition have been shown by several groups to protect against renal injury. Finally, the importance of mitochondrial ROS in diabetic kidney disease is also well known. While this study nicely weaves the concept together, a concern is the results are mostly confirmatory in nature. Thus, several approaches could be employed to enhance the novelty of the observations within the manuscript. 1. The authors note that glucose reduces HIF1a levels through a PHD2 dependent mechanism, yet in Figure 4 supplement 2, PHD2 levels do not rise in db/db mice. It would substantially improve the manuscript if the mechanisms underlying increased PHD2 activity/HIF1a degradation were reconciled. Is enzymatic activity enhanced? Is it possible that VHL targets HIF1a for degradation more rapidly? Garcia-Pastor et al. (Sci Reports 2019) previously published that glucose inhibits the interaction of HIF1a with Hsp90 in cell lines. Does this occur in primary cells as well? We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. The mechanisms by which high glucose levels impair HIF-1 expression and function are still incompletely unraveled. We agree with the reviewer that, even though we bring pharmacological and genetic evidence about the importance of PHD-dependent degradation for the HIF-1 repression in diabetes, we did not dissect the specific mechanisms facilitating the PHD2-mediated regulation of HIF-1 in diabetes, a subject that warrants further investigation. Our results have shown that silencing VHL gene can stabilize HIF-1 and reduce mitochondrial ROS levels in cells exposed to high glucose levels and hypoxia (Figure 3B-3D), indicating that VHL contributes to the degradation of HIF-1 in diabetic conditions. We would like to clarify that we have not claimed that the inhibition of HIF-1 in diabetes is specific to the PHD2-dependent HIF-1 degradation. The contribution of other mechanisms to the inhibition of HIF-1 signaling in diabetes needs to be further elucidated. 2. The authors implicate loss of PDK1 activity downstream of HIF1a deficiency as a key mechanism underlying the increase in complex I activity and subsequent mitochondrial ROS. However, reductions in PDK1 gene expression are modest at best. This mechanism, while based upon a highly interesting study from Kim and colleagues in Cell Metabolism, is not well substantiated in the author's study. More conclusive experimentation reconciling this pathway's importance is crucial for the development of the mechanism underlying the authors' model. We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. In order to further investigate the role of PDK1, we transfected plasmids encoding GFP or GFP-fused PDK1 (GFP-PDK1) mIMCD3 to high glucose levels and hypoxia (Figure 4I).The mitochondrial ROS levels were assessed by flow cytometry analysis of mitosox intensity in GFP- or GFP-PDK1-positive cells. As shown in Figure 4J, mitochondrial ROS overproduction in cells exposed to high glucose levels and hypoxia was diminished by PDK1 overexpression, suggesting that the increased mitochondrial ROS is at least partially mediated by the inhibition of HIF-1 target gene PDK1 in diabetes. These results have been added to the manuscript (page 22). 3. Increases in mitochondrial ROS in diabetic nephropathy have also been thought to be related to effects on the Nrf2 anti-oxidant response, which is not discussed in this study. It would be helpful to address the potential roles of Nrf2 in the pro-oxidant responses surveyed in their mouse and cell based models. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The potential role of Nrf2 for diabetes nephropathy has been included in the discussion (page 25). 4. Clinical data on T1D patients, while interesting, is of unclear utility in this manuscript. Do these patients have renal disease? While HbA1c levels are higher in T1D patients versus non-T1D patients, are ROS responses improved in T1D patients with normal glycemic control? Further, as ROS levels are often transient in the blood stream, what are the ambient blood glucose levels during the period of the EPR assays? The patients with T1D were without any detectable complication, including renal disease. The clinical study provides the proof of concept that the subjects with uncontrolled diabetes responded with an increase in ROS levels after exposure to hypoxia, while as ROS levels did not increase in subjects without diabetes. We agree with the reviewer that a separate investigation on whether improvement of the metabolic control can affect the ROS response to hypoxia warrants further investigation. In the present study, plasma glucose levels before hypoxia exposure (0h) were significantly higher in patients with diabetes (12.79 \u00b1 6.62 mM) than in control subjects (4.66 \u00b1 0.90 mM), as expected, since only patients with poor glycemic control have been included. After one hour of hypoxia exposure (1h), plasma glucose increased in healthy subjects by 0.64 \u00b1 0.91 mM (P<0.05). This is in line with previous findings (e.g. PMID: 28087818), and may represent a mechanism to protect tissues during hypoxia by increasing fuel supply. Interestingly, plasma glucose levels decreased in patients with diabetes by 3.05 \u00b1 5.03 mM (P<0.05). This opposite response of blood glucose is part of the impaired adaptive responses to hypoxia present in patients with diabetes, that is subject of our ongoing investigation.

However, it remains largely elusive how cell cycle recovery is initiated after DNA damage. In this study, we discovered the upregulated protein level of MASTL kinase hours after DNA damage. MASTL promotes cell cycle progression by preventing PP2A/B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation of CDK substrates. DNA damage-induced MASTL upregulation was caused by decreased protein degradation, and was unique among mitotic kinases. We identified E6AP as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated MASTL degradation. MASTL degradation was inhibited upon DNA damage as a result of the dissociation of E6AP from MASTL. E6AP depletion reduced DNA damage signaling, and promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTL-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that E6AP was phosphorylated at Ser-218 by ATM after DNA damage and that this phosphorylation was required for its dissociation from MASTL, the stabilization of MASTL, and the timely recovery of cell cycle progression. Together, our data revealed that ATM/ATR-dependent signaling, while activating the DNA damage checkpoint, also initiates cell cycle recovery from the arrest. Consequently, this results in a timer-like mechanism that ensures the transient nature of the DNA damage checkpoint. - - Cancer Biology - Cell Biology Blocking a protein known as EPAC1 may prevent the development of heart-related side effects caused by a chemotherapy drug.
