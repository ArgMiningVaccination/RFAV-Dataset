The study evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and acceptability of the leading commercially available measles-rubella (MR) vaccine administered via microarray. Vaccination by microarray was found safe and well tolerated with no allergic reactions or related serious adverse events. Day-42 immunogenicity showed seroprotection rates for MR in all cohorts for both the microarray (93.2% - 100%) and SC injection (89.8% - 100%) groups. And in infants who were MR-vaccine na\u00efve at the start of the trial, seroconversion rates were high and similar for both the microarray (92.9% -100%) and SC injection groups (89.7%-100%). Over 90% of the parents of toddlers and infants enrolled in the trial, which took part in an acceptability survey, said that the microarray technology would be better than SC injection to give vaccines to children. \"Supporting innovations in vaccine delivery is critical to addressing ongoing health inequities,\" said James Goodson, Senior Scientist and Epidemiologist in the Global Immunization Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and co-investigator for the study, in a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/micron-biomedical-announces-positive-measles-and-rubella-vaccination-results-from-first-clinical-trial-of-microarray-injection-free-vaccine-delivery-in-children-301826746.html) on May 17, 2023. The technology significantly simplifies the transport, storage, and administration of vaccines traditionally delivered via injection and eliminates sharps waste. "}
