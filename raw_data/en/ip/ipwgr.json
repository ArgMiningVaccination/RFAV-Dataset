Diarrhea occurs when foods and liquids pass through the body too quickly. If diarrhea is severe or lasts a long time, the body cannot absorb enough water and nutrients. It is important to manage diarrhea to prevent dehydration (not enough water in the body) and poor nutrition. See Nutrition and Hydration section for more. In addition to a side effect of cancer treatment, diarrhea can also be a sign of infection or sensitivity to certain foods. Work with your healthcare team to determine the cause of your diarrhea so it can be treated. Tell your healthcare team if you are experiencing new or worsening diarrhea or constipation. Do not take over-the- counter medications without talking to your doctor. Follow these tips to manage diarrhea: Drink clear liquids including water, ginger ale, sports drinks, and clear broth, or suck on popsicles to stay hydrated. Avoid alcohol, caffeine and acidic drinks such as orange juice. Drink at least one cup of liquid after each loose bowel movement to prevent dehydration. As diarrhea starts to improve, eat foods that are easy to digest, such as white rice, puffed rice cereal (or other low- fiber grains), soft fruits (such as bananas and applesauce), and cooked soft vegetables without seeds or skins. Avoid foods that can make diarrhea worse, including high-fiber foods, raw fruits and vegetables, spicy food and high-fat foods. Avoid drinks and foods that contain sugar alcohols (for example, xylitol and sorbitol). These are often found in sugar-free products. Avoid milk and milk products if they seem to make diarrhea worse. Ask your healthcare team and/or registered dietitian if you might benefit from taking a probiotic supplement. Probiotics are good bacteria that help with digestion. Do not take any supplements without talking to your healthcare team first. If changes to your foods do not help, your doctor may prescribe medication. Do not take medications without talking to your healthcare team first. Take care of your skin. Frequent watery stools can damage the skin around your anal area. After a bowel movement, wash with warm water or use bathroom wipes to clean the area. Be sure to gently dry the area too. On the clean, dry skin, apply a water-repellent ointment, such as one that contains petroleum jelly, to help prevent skin irritation.

The severity of diarrhea or constipation varies among patients and depends on the type of treatment you receive. Sometimes side effects improve as you adjust to treatment. Most side effects go away when treatment ends. Managing side effects, called palliative (supportive) care, is an important part of cancer treatment.

Exercise and physical activity can help with constipation. Ask your healthcare team for an exercise program. Ask your healthcare team and/or registered dietitian if you may benefit from taking a fiber supplement. Do not take any supplements without first talking to your doctor.

Malnutrition occurs when a person does not eat or absorb enough calories or key nutrients needed for healthy body function. Dehydration occurs when a person does not drink or absorb enough liquids for healthy body function. Even mild dehydration can drain your energy and make you tired. Signs of dehydration include Extreme thirst Dark-colored urine (pee) Less frequent urination Fatigue Dizziness Confusion Reduced sweating Dry mouthYour fluid intake is probably adequate if You rarely feel thirsty Your urine is colorless or light yellow Good nutrition is important for health, energy and quality of life. Cancer patients who are malnourished or dehydrated are at greater risk for health complications, hospitalization, infections, loss of muscle strength and poor quality of life. These patients may need to delay, change or stop cancer treatment. Any side effect that can make eating or drinking difficult increases the risk for health complications and poor quality of life.
