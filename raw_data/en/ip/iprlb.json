Understanding how materials introduced into the body react over the short- and long-term, empowers us to make smart decisions for our health. What are non-toxic and biocompatible dental materials? Non-toxic dental materials are non-reactive. They are designed to work with the body's natural systems. Non-toxic materials are tested and proven. They do to not cause: - Allergic reactions - Biodegradation - Carcinogens - The release of substances into the circulatory system When we speak of biocompatible materials, we are referring to dental materials that function as part of your living tissues. If the body accepts materials, and doesn't reject a foreign material, it is biocompatible. Biocompatible dental materials work with the teeth, jaws and gums. They replace your body's damaged natural materials, like tooth enamel, to enhance oral health and function. As a holistic dentist, [Dr. Frahm](https://sarahfrahmdds.com/meet-dr-frahm/) only uses non-toxic and biocompatible materials. In lieu of metals and plastics for fillings and crowns, porcelain and composite are used for dental treatments. Porcelain is durable, non-toxic and yes, biocompatible. It naturally adheres to your DNA. Porcelain forms an actual bond with your body that is five times stronger than your natural teeth. It's the perfect material for fillings, crowns and veneers. Porcelain causes no harmful side effects. And best of all, it can be matched to the exact color of your teeth. Dr. Frahm uses [CEREC](https://sarahfrahmdds.com/dental-technology/) for porcelain crowns. This state-of-the-art innovation uses CAD/CAM technology to create custom, tooth-colored, porcelain crowns in a single visit. CEREC porcelain crowns are an exact match complimenting your bite function. And, they have a high aesthetic appeal to make your smile look natural and vibrant. Composite is made from resin, a non-toxic material. [Composite is used to add structure to teeth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19025349/). Dr. Frahm uses composite materials for dental fillings and the bonding of teeth to reshape tooth structure, close gaps, fill in black triangles, and correct chips in teeth. Composite materials resemble natural tooth enamel. For minor restorative dental care treatment, Dr. Frahm will likely recommend using a composite solution. A note about the materials used in old fillings and crowns Like everything else in the technology, dental tech continues to advance rapidly. If you had a cavity filled twenty or more years ago, chances are it's a mercury amalgam filling. The mercury is safe if the filling was placed correctly and remains intact. But, as time goes on there is potential that mercury can leak from your restoration. Mercury is harmful to the body. Dentists have learned that mercury fillings can cause toxicity, inflammation, and even tissue damage in some people. If your tooth was compromised by a crack or a large cavity, you probably have a crown to restore your tooth's appearance and preserve your natural tooth structure. But, the gold, nickel and resins used in crowns can cause allergic reactions and other adverse effects for some. If you think you have an old filling or crown and are concerned about the materials used, or you have current dental health needs, we're here for you. Dr. Frahm always discusses your options with you before treatment begins. Our holistic approach to dental care keeps your long-term wellness in mind.
