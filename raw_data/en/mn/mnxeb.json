Tools, heat-sinks, andwindows are theprincipal CVDdiamond products currently being CVDdiamond arealso being applied toprovide wear resistance forsuch products discussed. 1.Introduction Thefour years Applied Diamond Conference have seen tremendous advances inunderstanding the science ofCVDdiamond growth andthetechnology of effecting itathigh rates uniformly over large areas. Various publications atthetime ofthefirst ADC indicate norms for1991 andJapan ledtotherealisation that here was a product with almost unlimited potential. For atime almost every research paper onCVDdiamond began with a listing ofthesuperlative physical properties ofthe material asjustification fortheresearch. Themedia inflated thepossibilities beyond economic reason. Wewere intheclassic situation of 4 writers predicting thefuture, where itisnottoo toforecast howexisting technology will develop, By1991 much hadbeen great successes, butalso therealisa- there were some distinctly intractable prob- tobefaced. Financial sponsors were beginning toaskquestions about thepay-back. Thefounders of theADCconferences amongst many others realised that some very practical questions needed tobeaddressed. Theearly euphoria CVDdiamond wasfading, either returned bytheJapanese post office orare unlikely tohave reached their destinations because of theKobe earthquake, which occurred just after Iwrote theletter. arecutting tools (8 companies), heat-sinks (5companies), infrared windows (4companies), wear resistant parts (4companies), (2companies). of tools, there' arealready major markets served by natural andhigh pressure synthetic diamond tools, PCD diamond tools, andcemented carbide andnitride tools, inorder ofincreasing sales volume. Natural diamond tools serve markets ranging from dresser tools contain- ingunshaped diamonds ofrelatively lowquality (used forshaping anddressing conventional abrasive grinding wheels), toprecisely shaped single crystal diamond tools used fortheaccurate generation ofsurfaces to 5 tolerances inthemicrometre tonanometre range, e.g. theturning ofcomputer hard from high-pressure, high-temperature synthetic diamond cryst- alsarealso used forhigh milling, anddrilling ofavariety ofnon- ferrous metal, ceramic, andwood components pistons) andinmining and to improve wear lifetimes. CVDdiamond tools Inboth cases thecutting edge ispoly- crystalline diamond with material properties which one might atfirst sight think arenottoodifferent from those ofconventional PCD. Itturns out, however, that there arevery significant performance differences. The reasons probably lieinoneormore ofthefollowing factors: absence ofmetal binder, different crystallite size andtexture, better thermal conductivity, better thermal stability andcorrosion resistance. Published case studies from atleast 5tool manufao- turers show that insome cases much larger product runs canbeobtained with CVDdiamond tools than with PCD tools. Thepublished improvements range from 25%to more than afactor of40. Significantly thebest- established improvements seem tobewith highly non- uniform materials such ashigh-silicon aluminum casting alloys, fiber-reinforced composites, andgreen ceramics, though improvements have also been obtained with more uniform materials such asgraphite, soft non-ferrous metals, andsimple plastics. Both thick andthin film CVDdiamond tools show advan- butobviously thick film tools will bethemore expensive andthus inthemore difficult position as regards competition with PCD. Thin film coated cut- ting tool inserts arealready making substantial inroads onanestablished market andlook like being asuccess forCVDdiamond inthevery short Aworld- wide market fordiamond-coated cutting-tool inserts in excess of$25million annually seems imminent andcould 6 grow substantially, especially astheproduction costs andthus competitive stance are afairly strong function ofproduction volume. Thus inmany applications CVDdiamond gives better cut- ting than PCD. Ontheother hand, PCDdoes have oneadvantage against CVDdiamond, namely its greater fracture toughness \u2014thecobalt binder seems to provide acushioning effect reducing crack propagation. PCDwill probably remain thematerial ofchoice forthe heavy duty applications which segments onoilandgasindustry drill crowns. Itisinteresting tonote though that PCDonly holds avery part drilling market, inthefact that intricate shapes canbecoated. Twist drills are a good example (especially small drills forfiber-rein- forced circuit boards). Cutting tools with chip- breaker geometries areanother. Onalarger scale rotary milling cutters offer opportunities forCVD diamond coating. Inthepast adhesion anduniformity have been major problems forCVDdiamond coatings. Though great progress hasbeen made andthese problems seem tohave been solved inregard tosmall products, they maystill restrict expansion into themarkets for larger area products.

Also, applications involve wafer-scale processing, there areproblems of dicing thepatterned wafers damaging themetal layers mechanically. Thecurrent substrate market is difficult todetermine since devices gothrough long development cycles involving co-operation ofdiamond supplier andelectronics house attheresearch and development stage, design andqualification andfinally cycles which maybeshort part ofamuch larger program, thedemand canfluctuate wildly over quite short time frames.

What maybeundesirable there iswelcome inbrazing alloys for diamond etc. where small additions ofsuch metals to otherwise inert brazing alloys provoke chemical redox re- actions onthesurface ofthehard materials, whereby un- saturated chemical compounds areformed. These partially bonded tothelattice ofthehard material and inpart tothelattice ofthebraze metal generating a strong diffusion zone. Such brazing alloys arecalled active brazes. Thechemical mixing eutectic with finely ground this wasthemost successful active braze intheproduction ofgramophone styli. However, for other applications such powder mixtures proved tobe largely unsuitable, particularly when brazing tungsten carbide inmodern Byandbyitbecame evident that case specific active brazes hadtobesearched for. With their availability, active brazing grew toavery interesting technology offering carbide for has opened aneweraoftopquality tools. Tungsten carbide isanoutstanding material foritsform- stability anditsproperty ofvibration absorption. All- carbide tools with amonocrystalline cutting edge find an increasing useinmachining plexiglas, plastic lenses, dental devices, jewelry, watch cases andmany other pro- ducts where amirror finish isrequested. Carbide compacts fitted with cutting inserts ofmonocrystalline diamond or with solid CBNarefinding afastly growing demand because oftheir obvious advantage andmillers. theshaping oftheinsert containment onthe tool shaft orthecompact andthebrazing operation under high vacuum maybesomewhat more expensive than thetra- ditional tool fabrication, such higher costs areregularly overcompensated bythemuch smaller diamond inserts needed andtheconsiderable quality increase ofthebrazed tools. Themost astounding quality increase stems from thesuper- iorheat dissipation from brazed diamonds inallthose applications where theinteraction ofthediamond with the workpiece generates heat. This wasfirst noticed when wear ingtests were made with grinding tools forreinforced con Crete. Thegrinding tools fabricated bybrazing thediamond grit forthesame amount wear asthe very best tool inthetest series with nickel-embedded 504 diamond grains. Asimilar observation wasmade with dressers forgrinding wheels: vacuum brazed natural crystals outlasted bynearly twotimes other dressers fitted with twice asheavy stones mounted tra- ditionally andcooling cycle, opens unconventional solutions formany demands with materials where uptonowonlymarginally satisfying methods were available.

The firstofthese is where ahighpower component operates under very transient conditions. Ifthe device only requires high power levels forshort periods oftime, then a thermoelectric cooler mustbekept atamuch lower temperature than alltherestoftheelectrical components. This could occur with theuseofsilicon carbide forthemajority of components, while acouple ofsilicon orgallium used. forthelowtemperature components, cooling device.

Taking intoaccount content and samples, the sharp peak oftheoriginal GO shifts toward lower angle, which indicates the increiise incarbon theHDOG surface. These 1-7Tsukagoshi, Saiwai-ku, Kawasaki 210.Japan Keywords ;diamond coating, inserts, drills, end mills, cutting tools Abstract Current status ofCVDdiamond fortheapplication tocutting toolswas briefly summarized, focused onmicrostructures, adhesion performance. Diamond-coated cemented carbide andend millswere tested against forexpanding fornon-ferrous materials asAl-Si alloys, carbon andCu etc. Most companies firsttargeted tocoatCVDdiamond on cemented carbide inserts, butfewcompanies have succeeded drillsandend Automotive challenges. Therefore, thedevelopment mills isstrong enough forAl-Si alloys. Further, recent status and problems forcommercializing CVD diamond cutting tools are briefly 928 discussed. 2.MICROSTRUCTURE OFDIAMOND FILM The cutting performance ofdiamond-coated tools should depend notonly onadhesion strength boundaries is weak orfilmsdonotconsist ofwell-crystallized diamond Few reports have analyzed grain boundaries ofCVD ofmechanical properties offilms various synthetic methods. Thegrain size isgenerally 0.2-1 and randomly oriented. Itisnotclear whether oriented- orrandomly oriented- particles show better cutting performance. Electron diffraction pattern was taken from the<110>direction where multiple twins were seen, together with streaks inthe<111>directions. Figure 1(b) isanenlarged and boundaries. Thecoherent boundaries such asthetwinboundary(I3 boundary) would notinduce adetrimental but notcertain forincoherent boundaries. 3.ADHESION STRENGTH WITHCEMENTED CARBIDE The difficulties associated with poor adhesion strength withcemented carbide have prevented activities It thefollowing factors diamond filmsandcemented carbide substrates. a)surface treatment before deposition b)Cocontent 929 c)kinds carbide substrates(grain size, impurities etc.) d)synthetic factor the sintered-WC inserts circumstance to etchcarbon atoms around thesurface. Thetungsten atoms leftonthe surface were recrystallized while carbon atoms were etched away this process, smallWC grains were formed and thesurface roughness was enhanced. The results ofcutting performance willbe shown insection 4.1. Itiswellaccepted thatCoatoms tocoat from the turning tests with diamond-coated WC-Co showed great performance as inFigOtb)The rapid increase WC-Co inserts upto1h. 930 4.2Drills Most thatthehot-filament method is since inthickness were tested usingA390 by wear Figure 4(a)shows ascanning electron micrograph ofdiamond-coated aftermaking holes microstructure inFig.4(b)showed wellfaceted particles and indicated noweareven aftersevere cutting millsthan that indiamond-coated twist drills, sosurface roughness ofCVD diamond becomes serious problems. Further, thecoating area ofCVD diamond ismuch longer that that ofdrills, which have prevented the development andcommercialization ofdiamond-coated end mills. Figure 5shows schematic illustration mills. Figure end mills after indicate workpiece which is often leftaround thesurface after cutting tests. The microstructure of diamond particles, shown inFig.6(b), indicates nowear even after severe cutting tests. Thus, when theworkpiece isA390, diamond-coated end mills shows great cutting performance unless thefilms peel offthecemented carbide. 5.POTENTIAL USEOFTHICK DIAMOND FILM >0.5mm)havebeen studied purposes withthedevelopment SinceCVD diamond films donotcontain CoorNi,thewear resistance should be 931 greater than that ofPCD.
