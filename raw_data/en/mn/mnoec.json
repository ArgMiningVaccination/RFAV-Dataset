For some, it may mean waking up feeling refreshed, having more energy to do things with loved ones and having the ability to be more focused. Being in balance is highly personal, and we need to find our own path that is right for us. Naturopathic doctor can help to support an individual's unique needs. It gently shifts our body to restore balance through various modalities, from acupuncture to botanical herbs. Naturopathic medicine can help improve common skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis and rosacea. Naturopathic doctors utilize a holistic, whole-body approach to these skin conditions. This means that the entirety of the individual will be examined to identify and address the root cause of the issue instead of just alleviating the symptomatic area of concern. I can help you understand why skin issues occur to get the solutions you seek. Some recommendations to improve your skin may include lifestyle modification, herbal tincture or tea, supplementation, topical products and/or aesthetic services such as natural skincare and facials or light therapy. Please note that any aesthetic services are not covered by extended health insurance; therefore will be billed separately from your naturopathic appointment. Digestive health refers to the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract, including breaking down foods and liquids into nutrient forms that our body can absorb. It also includes the delicate balance of bacteria and the production and secretion of specific immune cells, neurotransmitters and enzymes, which significantly impact our overall health. A healthy gut contributes to healthy skin, a robust immune system, cardiovascular health, brain health, improved mood, better sleep, and good digestion. Therefore, it is often the first system I address and treat. Perhaps there's a significant delay to your morning commute, you are having a stressful day at work, or you are planning the wedding of your dream. When stress mounts and anxiety occurs daily, it can interfere with our ability to enjoy social situations, be productive at work or school, impair digestion or even worse, keep us up at night. During stressful times, our body sends \"fight or flight\" signals such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. However, as soon as the event passes, our body should find balance and go on with our day. We can work together to find the root cause of your anxiety, low mood or sleep concerns so you can live a more fully functional life. As we become more mature and wiser, it can bring different health challenges such as forgetfulness, joint stiffness and pain or decreased energy and stamina. Therefore, we need to recognize the different healthcare needs early to prevent chronic conditions. Naturopathic doctors can help you make better lifestyle choices that improve biological aging and enhance the quality of life while providing essential building blocks for long-term health. Each treatment plan and approach is tailored to you, the individual, to enjoy maximum health and vitality. Working together, it can be possible to achieve your health goals, whether it be lowering cholesterol, losing weight, improving your energy or having your mind sharper. Hormones are like messengers. They tell your body what to do and when to do it. For example, estrogen and progesterone are engaged to keep our periods regular. Cortisol and adrenaline keep us alert and energized. Thyroid hormones maintain metabolism. And these are to name a few of the fifty human hormones that keep us in a state of well-being. When a single hormone is imbalanced, it can create a cascade effect of widespread health problems. For example, when a woman's hormones are imbalanced, it could cause irregular periods, painful periods, amenorrhea, acne, excess hair or thinning of hair. It can also throw off insulin metabolism causing excess weight gain, which can increase inflammation in our body. Often, hormonal imbalance can occur due to inappropriate diet, lack of sleep, toxin exposure, chronic stress, and synthetic hormone use. Naturopathic doctors target underlying issues of the condition and promote balance in the body by supporting a healthy inflammatory response. Students juggle many responsibilities - academically, socially, financially, etc.- and it becomes more challenging to live a healthy lifestyle. These issues can lead to stress, physical inactivity, poor sleeping habits, over-consumption of alcohol and drugs, and poor nutrition. I can work with you and show you how you can maintain a balance through healthy living to improve learning and thrive in the classroom and beyond.
