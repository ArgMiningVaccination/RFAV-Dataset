Face Masks The University of Iowa strongly encourages face masks in all classroom settings and during in-person office hours. University policy continues to require masks in health care settings and on CAMBUS. These protocols apply to visitors as well as to faculty, staff, and students, and are in accordance with federal law and [Board of Regents, State of Iowa guidelines](https://www.iowaregents.edu/news/board-news/statement-from-president-mike-richards-lifting-regents-state-of-emergency). Forgot your mask? No problem, you can find disposable masks and hand sanitizer in all campus buildings. Self-reporting You can also help keep our campus safe by self-reporting if you test positive for COVID-19 or are identified as having close contact with someone else who tested positive. These numbers can help us monitor the virus on our campus and take action, including [requesting cleaning](https://login.uiowa.edu/uip/login.page?service=https://bizhub.facilities.uiowa.edu/bizhub/hawkid/login?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbizhub.facilities.uiowa.edu%2Fbizhub%2Ffmservice) through Facilities Management, when appropriate. So please self-report [using this form](https://apps.its.uiowa.edu/forms/self-report). Campus operations update Following last week's reminder about self-reporting, the university recorded an increase in the number of recent and previous cases reported. It's great to see individuals following university guidance and reporting their illness. The actual number of active cases on campus currently remains steady. University of Iowa self-reported COVID-19 testing The University of Iowa has published an updated snapshot of self-reported positive COVID-19 tests from faculty, staff, and students. These data reflect new cases since Aug. 11, 2021 and total cases since Aug. 18, 2020. Number of self-reported cases of COVID-19: Students - New cases: 17 - Total cases: 3,213 Employees - New cases: 15 - Total cases: 527 These data will not match data reported by UI Hospitals & Clinics or by the Iowa Department of Public Health for several reasons, including different testing time intervals and geographic scope. Students who also are employees of the university are only reported in the student number to avoid double counting. The UI has more than 30,000 students and nearly 30,000 employees. Many employees continue to work remotely but have self-reported to authorize sick leave. Number of residence hall students in quarantine: 0* Number of residence hall students in self-isolation: 0** *Quarantine: Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. **Self-isolation: Isolation is used to separate people infected.
