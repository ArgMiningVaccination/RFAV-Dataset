New Accidents and Injuries Anyone that has been involved in an accident should be professionally evaluated at the center as soon as possible. This is true whether you are experiencing pain or are currently without symptoms. Our chiropractic physicians are trained to identify injuries that are oftentimes missed or otherwise overlooked in an emergency room or primary care setting. Untreated Injuries One of the conditions that we often see is post traumatic dysfunction. These are conditions that result from unresolved traumas, which occurred months, years or even decades earlier. Most patients suffering from posttraumatic dysfunction, are not even aware of what the original cause of the condition was. Only through careful examination and a detailed history are we able to make the connection between their current condition and a past trauma. In these cases the original trauma may have caused little or no immediate symptoms. To make matters worse, often times the person was told at the time of the accident, by well-meaning but ill-informed healthcare professionals, that there was no injury or that their symptoms were unimportant and should be ignored. In time, original symptoms did disappear, but the body did not properly heal. If you or someone you know has been involved in an automobile accident or other type of personal injury, past or present, you need to be aware that symptoms are not always reliable indicators of the actual level of injury. Injuries can occur at the time of the trauma, which may not be obvious for days, weeks, months or even years later. Injuries that have gone untreated will commonly cause a variety of health problems. Some of these symptoms may include; migraine headaches, muscle spasms or tightness, weak muscles, poor posture, scoliosis, joint pain and stiffness, nerve pain, circulatory problems or fatigue, to name but a few. Chronic Conditions and Disorders Chronic and recurrent conditions and disorders can have a devastating effect on a person's psychological well-being, interpersonal relationships, income earning capacity, or any aspect of life. The chronic pain, dysfunction and disability associated with these conditions can make a person feel like life is just not worth living. Thousands of people, suffering from a wide variety of chronic conditions, have been helped at our center with chiropractic and alternative medicine methods. Can we automatically \"cure\" any person suffering from any kind of condition? Unfortunately not, but we are able to help the vast majority of our patients significantly improve the state of their health. As health is restored, conditions improve and symptoms are reduced or eliminated. Many people come to us after other methods have failed. They have been told that no help is available, or worse yet, that there conditions are imaginary and self-induced. One of the most unfortunate aspects of suffering from a chronic health condition is the associated emotional stress that can result from it. Fear, anger, hopelessness, insecurity and indecisiveness can limit the person's ability to persevere until the right kind of help is found. We hope that you find the information contained in these pages helpful and hopeful, and we encourage you to follow up by writing, calling and consulting with us personally. - Our whole person, Functional Medicine approach to health care emphasizes the body's ability to heal itself. - We provide effective alternative and complementary health care options to the pharmaceutically based system in which we live.
