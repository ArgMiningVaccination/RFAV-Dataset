Major topics include general principles, pharmacokinetics, and principles of toxicology . Measurable Course Objectives The American Osteopathic Association has identified osteopathic core competencies (OCC) essential for your practice as a future osteopathic physician ( reference ). These are embedded throughout our programmatic objectives and curriculum. Our curricular structure also encourages your proficiency in the Core Entrustrable Professional Activities (EPAs) for Entering Residency as defined by the Association of American Medical Colleges to help you build toward that future phase of your journey toward medical practice ( reference ). By the end of this specific course, you should be able to achieve the following objectives within each domain indicated Medical Knowledge 1. Describe the mechanism of action, indications , contraindications, adverse interactions, and immune response of drugs, vaccines, and nutritional factors used in the prevention, management, and treatment of medical conditions. (Biomedical Science - Pharmacology) 2. Review the structural, developmental, an d regulatory mechanisms of cells, tissues, and organs as pertinent to pharmacological mechanisms of action. (Biomedical Science - Molecular/Biochemical) 3. Recall pathogen/host interactions and immune responses at the organismal, systemic, tissue, and cellular levels through selected clinical presentations and pharmacological interventions. (Biomedical Science - Microbiology/Immunology) 4. Examine the physiologic basis of health and the pathophysiologic basis of disease through selected clinical presentations and pharmacological interventions. (Biomedical Science - Pathology/Pathophysiology) Osteopathic Principles, Practice, and OMM 1. Recognize that some individuals and patient groups may respond differently to certain specific drug classes. (OPP Principles/Integration, Cultural Competency/Humility) Patient Care and Procedural Skills 1. Discuss pharmacological interventions as part of evidence -based, cost -effective, patient- centered care plans for common clinical presentations. (Treatment/Management - EPA 4) 3 Professionalism 1. Revisit scientific and ethical principles of basic, clinical, an d translational research, specifically as related to pharmacological research, drug development, and clinical drug use. (Ethical Research, Clinical/Translational Research) Professional Development and Reflection Skills Additionally, the American Osteopath ic Association indicates several other competencies on which professional development and reflection across time will foster effective medical practice. These include the ability to work effectively as part of an interprofessional team; the maintenance of an inquisitive and scientific approach to learning and medical practice; and the adoption of self- directed skills in lifelong learning and clinical decision -making. This course will contribute to the development of these longitudinal competencies as indicated : Scientific Method Knowledge of the scientific method in the medical domain includes topics such as ethical data collection, hypothesis testing, and conducting and/or evaluating the significance of clinical/translational research to inform evidence -based patient care. It can involve decision -making tools and procedures along with the ability to communicate with lay audiences to gain informed consent or explain research processes and findings. In this course, we foster scientific competency as you : 1. Revisit scientific and ethical principles of basic, clinical, and translational research, specifically as related to pharmacological research, drug development, and clinical drug use. (Ethical Research, Clinical/Translational Research) Self-Directed and Li felong Learning Self-directed learning is a 4 -step process that occurs within an encapsulated timeframe. The goal of self - directed learning is to help foster self- direction in your lifelong learning and clinical decision -making. In this course, one way you will see the 4 steps of self -directed learning take shape is as follows : 1. Self-Assessment of Learning Needs - Students are provided learning materials to prepare for upcoming, case -based sessions. They are asked to reflect on individual learning needs rela ted to these materials by considering level of efficacy or confidence with identified learning objectives and by completing a formative assessment quiz. 2. Identification, Analysis, & Synthesis of Information - Based on these reflections and quiz results, stu dents have an opportunity to seek further or clarifying information on content to achieve learning objectives. This may include re -engaging with course materials or seeking supplemental information through sources such as Internet or database research, pee r discussion, or discussion with faculty . 3. Appraisal of Information Source Credibility - During case -based sessions, students apply and critique synthesized knowledge through guided questions and group discussion. This also allows 4 time for students to appra ise the credibility of information sources and learning within the context of specific, varied patient cases . 4. Feedback on Information- Seeking Skills - Faculty facilitators of case -based sessions provide feedback on information -seeking skills through use of both probing questions and direct responses. Additionally, students receive another point of feedback to inform study through completion of a summative assessment or unit exam .
