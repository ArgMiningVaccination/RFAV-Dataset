H. Mason, as a Pentecostalchurch after Mason's baptism in the Holy Spirit with the experience of tongue-speaking. The denomina-tion is predominantly but not exclusively AfricanAmerican. COGIC is \"Holiness Pentecostal,\" influ-enced by both the Holiness and the Pentecostalmovements, focusing on a three-phase crisis experi-ence of conversion, sanctification, and baptism in theHoly Spirit. Because of its rich and varied history,COG IC is known by other names, such as \"Holiness church,\" \"Sanctified church,\" and, more recently, \"Pentecostal church.\" Though the denomination doesnot trace its origins to the Reformation of the 16thcentury, it shares in common with other Protestantbodies the basic conviction that the Bible is the prin- cipal source of authority in all matters of belief andpractice. COG IC embraces traditional Protestant beliefs but, from its perspective on Scripture, gives specialemphasis to belief in original sin, atonement, conver- sion, entire sanctification (holiness) in this life, bap- tism in the Spirit, speaking in tongues (glossolalia), Christ's second coming (premillennialism), miracles , and divine healing .

Other important rites performed by ordainedministers include wedding ceremonies, funerals,and burials. COG IC's immediate origin is traced to the Holiness movement that flourished in the 1890samong congregations in the General Associationof Baptist Churches in the south central states,along the lower Mississippi River Valley betweenMemphis and New Orleans. After expulsionfrom the Baptist Association for overzealouslypropagating Holiness teachings, C. P. Jones, J. E.Jeter, W. S. Pleasant, and C. H. Mason organized a new group under the name \"Church of God.\"Mason claimed later that the name \"Church ofGod in Christ\" had been revealed to him and was confirmed in his reading of the New Testa-ment, for example, in 1 Thess. 2:14. The newchurch unanimously accepted the name pro- posed by Mason. Their first permanent place ofmeeting was a cotton-gin house in Lexington,Mississippi. COG IC is present throughout the United States and in 56 other countries. COGIC'sworldwide membership is estimated at nearly5.5 million persons, worshipping in 15,300 con-gregations, which are divided into approximately 175 jurisdictions and served by a clergy num- bered at 28,988 persons. 1Each jurisdiction is overseen by a bishop who is elected by ordained ministers within his jurisdiction and consecrated(installed officially) by the General Board, actingwith the approval of the denomination's GeneralAssembly. Jurisdictions are subdivided into dis-tricts, which are smaller fellowships of localchurches overseen by superintendents appointed by jurisdictional bishops. The General Board,the highest executive body of the denomination,consists of 12 persons elected quadrenniallyfrom the college of jurisdictional bishops by theGeneral Assembly. The General Assembly is composed of delegates (mostly ordained minis-ters) from all jurisdictions. It is the highestdecision-making authority and doctrine-establishing body within COGIC. The General Assembly meets in April andNovember of each year. COGIC's \"Holy Convo- cation,\" its international and largest convention,is held each November in Memphis. This con-vocation draws about 50,000 persons to the city.COG IC holds other very large conventions. The denomination's Missions, Evangelism, SundaySchool, Music, and Youth Departments hold ajoint annual meeting in July of each year. TheWomen's Department, the largest and most pow- erful department in COGIC, holds its own annu-al meeting each May. COG IC is headquartered in Memphis. The denomination's office complex is located in theDowntown area of the city. The denominationstill maintains facilities at its historic 400-acresite in Lexington, Mississippi. In Memphis,COG IC operates a publishing company that prints official church documents; books ondenominational history; ministerial and depart-mental handbooks; and educational materialsfor its Sunday School, Youth, Missions, andWomen's Departments. The Whole Truth , pub- lished quarterly, is COGIC's official news maga-zine. These publications and church suppliesare available through the denomination's down-town Memphis bookstore. The ordained ministry is restricted to males and organized hierarchically, starting at the low-est rank of licensed ministers (local preachers)and continuing to ordained ministers (elders);pastors; superintendents; jurisdictional bishops;and, at the highest rank, bishops on the GeneralBoard. Most ministers become pastors by start- ing their own congregations. Familial relations,charisma, relationships with authority figures, and financial reports to district, jurisdictional,and national divisions of COGIC influenceappointment and promotion within the hierarchy. Because women's call to ministry is not vali- dated through ordination, the Women's Depart-ment represents an alternative path for involve-ment, recognition, and leadership. Women min-isters are licensed through the Women's Depart-ment either as \"deaconess missionaries\" or as\"evangelist areorganized hierarchically. The evangelist mis- 2sionary, who may work within several local churches or outside of the local church where she is a member, has a higher status than thedeaconess missionary, who is restricted to serv-ice within the local church of her declaredmembership. District missionaries, jurisdiction-al supervisors, and international supervisors forwomen's work oversee the activities of mission-aries. Women of exemplary leadership andmoral integrity in the denomination are respect-ed highly and called \"mothers.\" COG IC's Education Department comprises several schools: Saints Academy in Lexington;All Saints Bible College in Memphis; C. H.Mason Theological Seminary (a member institu-tion of the Interdenominational TheologicalCenter) in Atlanta; a system of Bible Institutesin nearly 40 jurisdictions; and learning centersin Haiti and Belize. Prior to 1975, COGICoperated a junior college at the Lexington site. COG IC's history can be divided into five peri- ods or movements, some running concurrently.The first period is the formative years, from 1897 to 1907. During this period the Church ofGod in Christ was a Holiness church that was organized by ministers from the General Associ-ation of Baptist Churches, an unincorporatedfellowship of black Baptist churches in Ten-nessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The second period, from 1907 to 1925, is COG IC's reconstitution as an interracial, inter- denominational Pentecostal church. BecauseCOG IC was the only legally recognized Pente- costal church, white Pentecostal ministerssought and were given credentials from COGIC.In 1914, several of these ministers founded theAssemblies of God. COGIC also operated mis-sions among Mexican, Indian, and Hispanicpopulations in the southwestern, western, andpacific states of North America. In addition toattracting persons from various races and ethnicgroups, COGIC drew into its membership per- sons from other Christian denominations, mostlyfrom Baptist and Methodist churches. A third significant movement is COGIC's dra- matic growth, through urban expansion andnorthern and westward migration, from 1910 to 1970. As COGIC's members left the south cen-tral states and moved north and west, theyestablished new churches in the cities wherethey settled. COGIC members remaining in theSouth would grow the denomination as theymoved from rural areas and planted newchurches in southern cities. In addition to this internal migration within the United States,COG IC members would expand their denomina- tion as they traveled overseas either for militaryservice or for work opportunities. Migration,travel, and, more recently, urban demographicshifts resulting in the creation of megachurchesand proliferation of small congregations haveexpanded the church at a rate greater than thedeliberately planned efforts of the denomina-tion's Evangelism and Missions Departments. COG IC's fourth movement is marked by the significant administrative and polity changesthat occurred from 1951 to 1968. In the 1926Constitution of the Church of God in Christ, C.H. Mason was given authority, as Senior Bishop,to appoint bishops, create jurisdictions, repre-sent the denomination in religious and civicmatters, and establish its doctrine. The churchdeclared that Mason would retain this authorityuntil his death, whereupon a board of bishopswas to be elected and empowered to oversee thedenomination. In 1951, recognizing hisadvanced age and declining health, Mason creat-ed an executive commission to carry out alladministrative duties that he had formerly per-formed. Mason died ten years later, in 1961, atthe age of 95. His tenure of 64 years and hisabsolute authority are unparalleled in Americandenominational history. From 1964 to 1967, a great deal of debate in the denomination centered on the question ofwhether anyone could succeed Mason and thushold the title and exercise the authority that hehad as Senior Bishop. In January 1968, COGICheld a constitutional convention. Delegatesadopted bylaws that would have far-reachingconsequences. They abolished the office ofSenior Bishop, created a new constitution, and 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER4 THECHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSrestructured the denomination as it now is. At the same time, oral and written histories of Mason's life, experiences, and teachings haveremained crucial for interpreting COGIC theolo-gy and doctrine. These histories recount his personal spiritual pilgrimage (i.e., how he wasconverted, sanctified, and baptized in the HolySpirit); his being healed of life-threatening ill-nesses; and his charisma, piety, humility, moralintegrity, evangelism, and organizational andadministrative skill. In addition to Mason'sheroism and each person's own inner witness ofthe Holy Spirit, COGIC members look to vari-ous authority figures and charismatic personali-ties for the interpretation and application ofdoctrine. The authority figures, some of whommay also be regarded as charismatic, includebishops, superintendents, women's supervisors,pastors, elders (ordained ministers), women mis-sionaries, deacons, and church mothers. COG IC's current period, its history from November 1968 to the present, is marked by itsefforts to function as a major Christian denomi-nation. Through a strict moral code and workethic, many church members have moved intothe middle class. COGIC is negotiating its placein the mainstream of American religious life. Itsestimated membership now ranks second amongthe seven historic black Christian denomina-tions and fifth among all major Christiandenominations in the United States. 2 COG IC's current leadership faces many com- plex challenges, such as ministering to moreaffluent and educated members while fostering asense of solidarity with the less privileged, main-taining headquarters and national operationscomparable to those of other major mainlineChristian denominations in the United States,interpreting the Holiness Pentecostal messagefor the present generation, speaking out withclarity and conviction and leading with actionon the controversial issues of our time, address-ing problems of members living in U.S. innercities and third world countries, developing uni-form educational and training standards for cler-gy, including women in the ordained ministry,and engaging other Christians and persons of other faiths in dialogue and cooperation. WhileCOG IC participates in such organizations as the Pentecostal and Charismatic Churches of North America and the Congress of National BlackChurches, it has yet to join larger, more inclu-sive ecumenical organizations such as the WorldCouncil of Churches and National Council ofthe Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. COGIC'sSeptember 2003 Constitutional Convention willaddress several of these challenges. BELIEFS IN MIRACLES AND DIVINE HEALING COG IC has an Arminian concept of faith. COG IC stresses that Jesus Christ did not die for a select few, but for all persons. God's offer ofsalvation is for everyone. The power of Christ'satonement is available to all. By faith\u2014exercis-ing faith or putting faith in Jesus Christ\u2014a per-son can affect her own situation. The individualis not helpless and hopeless against sin, evil, orsickness. She can act, through faith, to changeher own condition. The human will, corruptedby transgression and concupiscence, is impotentto achieve God's standard and blessings forhuman life but becomes functional when itturns to Jesus Christ, accepts and obeys him,and receives baptism in the Holy Spirit. Sanctification (holiness) and Spirit baptism are therefore means of accessing and exercisingpower over evil. It is believed that God's divinepower is greater than any force of evil, includingsickness. The divinely desired standard andquality of life includes the following marks ofholiness and the life: worship (pri-vate marriage and fornication, adultery, domesticviolence, separation, and divorce); abstinencefrom alcoholic beverages, narcotics, and tobaccoproducts; advocacy for civil and human rights;and pacifism. 35 THEPARKRIDGE CENTEREvil is a term that encompasses all negative, inexplicable (senseless or meaningless), andunmanageable suffering in human life. Evil isall that is injurious, hurtful, unfortunate, andcalamitous, and all that impedes our success,happiness, and well-being. Evil may be classi-fied as natural evil and moral evil. In COGICtheology and doctrine, there is nothing \"natu-ral\" about evil, if natural means \"normal\" andimplies that human beings should not expectanything better and therefore may acquiesce toevil. Evil is rather to be avoided and/or over-come. Natural evil refers to those events innature that cause suffering in human life, suchas sickness, disease, drought, tornados, earth-quakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, and death.Moral evil is suffering caused by human beingsthemselves; it is the harm that we do to eachother and that diminishes our quality of life.Moral evil is synonymous with sin. The originalstate of humanity is life without evil and sin. In COGIC theology and doctrine, illness may be the consequence of sin. Sin originates from three sources: (1) Satan and demons, (2) the sinof Adam, and (3) human will. 4The denomina- tion acknowledges that there are forces and pur-poses in the universe that oppose God's will andwork against human life. Satan and demons area supernatural explanation of sin. Here sin is arebellion that is vanquished and banished fromthe divine realm, and enters the human realm todestroy human life and lure human beings awayfrom God's will. Satan and demons are defeatedfoes of God and the believer is granted authorityfrom Jesus Christ to \"cast out devils.\" In Genesis 3, the sin of Adam is imputed to all subsequent generations. His fall initiates human-ity's estrangement from God. The sin committedwas Adam's act but we, as he did, bear the conse-quences that followed from that act. When sin is discussed as something that indi- viduals actually do, then attention is placed onvolition. Humans have free will and thereforethe capacity of freedom, the ability to perceiveand pursue a course of action chosen fromamong one or more alternatives. Willful disre-gard or violation of justlaw, whether it is civil law, social mores, or commandments of God,constitutes sin. Here sin is transgression. Sinalso occurs when humans desire anything otherthan what is good or right. Here the root of sinis in concupiscence. The problem is not withdesire per se but rather with the fact of notdesiring, wanting, or striving for the good, per-haps even desiring, wanting, or enjoying some-thing that is evil. The origin of moral evil in Satan, demons, the sin of Adam, the misuse of human freedom,or the misdirection of effort and desire locatessin apart from God. God's nature contains nosin. And God is not the direct cause of sin.God condemns sin, opposes it, and exercises a power far greater than sin. God's power is demonstrated through God's creation and providence (care and oversight) ofthe world, and through miracles, healing, andsigns. Signs are phenomena that God uses toreveal something about God's character, being,and/or will for humankind. Signs and wondersattest to God's glory and are indications of JesusChrist's second coming. Illness may be indica-tive of God's wrath against sinful humanity,whereas healing may be indicative of God'smercy. Miracles are not a violation of God's ownlaws of the physical universe. Rather, miraclesdemonstrate which laws are basic to the uni-verse. Miracles are extraordinary with respect to defying the pattern, cycles, power, and hold ofnatural evil and sin (moral evil) in the world.Acts of deliverance from sickness, sin, trouble, and ruin are miracles but sometimes these eventsare discussed separately to emphasize their dis-tinctive character. For example, release fromsickness is discussed within the topic of healing,release from sin within the topic of salvation, andrelease from forms of trouble and ruin not cov-ered in the former topics may be discussed with-in the general topic of deliverance. Miraclesprove that evil and sin are not the supremepower in the universe; God is. Fundamental tothe universe is life, not death; good, not evil.Miracles are samples or displays of God's power to overcome natural and moral evil and thereby\"save\"\u2014rescue\u2014human beings from peril andsummon them to obedience and faith. 5 By the exercise of faith, a person may be delivered from evil and sin and healed of sick-ness. This faith healing is performed throughvarious means, such as prayer, fasting, physicaltouching (laying of hands), anointing with oil,use of symbols of faith, reading or quoting theBible, and exorcism. The sick individual may behealed by the exercise of his own faith orthrough the exercise of another Spirit-filledbeliever's faith. COGIC recommends that its members' first response to illness be to exercisefaith and follow the pastoral advice of James5:14-15, which reads: \"If there be any sickamong you, let him call on the elders of thechurch and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and theprayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lordshall raise him up; and if he have committedany sins, they shall be forgiven him.\" 6 Believing that illness is attributable to the devil and that it is not anything to which wemust acquiesce, persons may, during the act ofprayer, \"rebuke,\" \"bind,\" or \"cast out\" the devil.If the illness is thought to be the result of theperson's having sinned, prayer may be offeredfor God's forgiveness or mercy. Prayer isthought to be further efficacious through fasting. The oil used in anointing may be plain orscented olive oil. The normal practice is to dab, smear, or rub a small amount onto the skin.Large quantities of oil are not used. It is not theamount of oil, but rather faith in God and obe-dience to the word of God, that results in heal-ing. The oil is not to be ingested. However,some persons have been known to ingest smallamounts of plain olive oil. Believing that faith results in healing, persons may symbolize or show that they have faith bythe use of various objects. For example, a cloth,Bible, cross, letter of correspondence, and othersymbols of faith may be held or placed near thepatient. The piece of cloth may have beenprayed over by a minister, missionary, or fellowbeliever. The cloth could be a piece of unused fabric or material cut from a vestment or othergarment worn by the minister or missionary. THE CARE OF SOULS (PASTORAL CARE ) In addition to the pastor, persons in other roleswithin the church are involved in the spiritualcare of the patient. Visitation is not done by thepastor only. Missionaries (female ministers),church mothers, associate ministers (local preachers and elders), deacons, and other mem-bers of the congregation will visit the patient and offer prayer and perform other acts to pro-mote divine healing. 7 6 THECHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIP In health care, patients are required to be active participants in their care by choosing providers, procedures, and often the therapythey believe is best for their body. Patients havethe right to be informed of procedures, and oftheir risks and benefits, when consideringhealthcare options. They also have the legalright to assign someone to make decisions on their behalf in the event that they are unable tomake those decisions themselves. In the midstof these decisions, patients should know that their decisions are confidential. 8COGIC does not have an official stance on patients' rights togive informed consent, execute advance direc- tives, or expect confidentiality. The denomina-tion does affirm that its members must receiveequitable treatment that respects their civil andhuman rights. COGIC encourages members toseek knowledge necessary for the nurture ofbody, soul, and spirit. 97 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERFamilies are networks for care and nurture. In COGIC doctrine, heterosexual marriage is fundamental to the development and stability ofthese networks. \"The opposite sexes created byGod, male and female, were created for each other to procreate in the institution of mar-riage.\" 10The denomination does not in any way accept homosexuality as normal or accept it as away of life that is consistent with the Christianfaith. 11According to the denomination's doc- trine, sex within the boundaries of heterosexualmarriage is viewed as the only means for pro-creation of the earth and the only appropriateform of sexual expression. 12The denomination discourages any public display of the body thatmay be perceived as sensual or sexuallyprovocative. 13 CLINICAL I SSUES Contraception While COGIC doctrine recognizes procreation as a central purpose of sexual expression withinmarriage, no statements have been issued onthe use of contraceptives. Abortion and the status of the fetus Although the term \"abortion\" can have various meanings, abortions are best grouped into twocategories: spontaneous (miscarriages) andinduced. 14Miscarriages typically occur withoutapparent cause. The death of a fetus under these circumstances is believed to be part of theinevitability and uncertainty of physical death.The deliberate ending of a human life, as through induced abortion, is forbidden accord-ing to the denomination's faith: The Church of God in Christ does not accept abor- tion due to the scriptures' stand on taking of inno-cent life which is murder or the denying of life inany form . . . the denial of even a fetus to form intoa human being, is interfering with human life andwe see it interfering with the seed of intent. TheChurch of God in Christ has a very sacred view onhuman life. It has a definite conviction about tam-pering with what God has proclaimed as life. Wecannot accept any philosophy or rationale, con-cerning the aborting of that life, even the fetus inthe womb. We believe only God can give life, andthat only God can deny life and we should not tryto abort it. 15 COG IC provides specialized ministries to meet the social needs of its members and theirfamilies. Social services and counseling servicesare available to COGIC members who havemarital problems or need information onPlanned Parenthood, medical services, or servic-es for unwed mothers. 16FAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATION GENETICS The church has yet to take an official stance regarding cloning or genetic selection.8 THECHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSThere is no official stance on organ or tissue donation. In our society, people are considered mentallyhealthy if they have adjusted to life in such a way that they are comfortable with their life sit-uation and, at the same, are able to live so thattheir behavior does not create conflict with thepeople close to them or with society. 17COGIC's position is compatible with this societal view ofmental health. The denomination is very con-cerned about the mental health of its members. COG IC denounces the use of alcohol or illegal drugs, or engagement in any behavior that isdetrimental to the mind and body. The churchsupports institutions that seek to preserve andmaintain the social, psychological, and emotion-al well-being of the individual and family. 18ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION MENTAL HEALTH DEATH AND DYING Death may be defined as the cessation of life and its related clinical signs.19COGIC views death as a state of sleep in which the souland spirit leave the physical body and lie dor-mant until the final resurrection of God'ssaints. 20When any death occurs, the family must receive supportive care. Death is not illu-sory but very real, as are heaven and hell. Thebeliever must be ready to face his or her own physical mortality and eternal fate in addition tothe coming of Jesus Christ, an event that mayoccur in this life before physical death and is atime when the wicked are punished and therighteous rewarded. The believer must there- fore live in a constant state of readiness. Ultimate questions about death, immortality, punishment, and reward are answered throughCOG IC's eschatological vision of the end of the world. 21However, the denomination discourages debate over doctrines of millennialism andurges believers to embrace the commonly recog-nized truth that Christ will return for his churchand God's total redemption of the universe from all evil will be realized. CLINICAL I SSUES Forgoing life-sustaining treatment and hastening death COG IC has no stated position on end-of-life decisions. However, one may observe as a ten-dency that some church members are opposedto euthanasia, when \"euthanasia\" is defined aschange in or cessation of medical care in order to hasten the death of persons who are termi-nally ill. Families are reluctant to discontinuelife support unless it is clear that the patient isdead in an absolute sense, that is to say, when(1) medical personnel have exhausted all med-ically indicated means of treatment and (2)there is no heartbeat or no brain activity. Life isprolonged in order to give the patient everychance, no matter how small, at recovery. Fami-9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERlies of strong belief pray and hope for miracles. Church members (clergy and lay) may be pres-ent with the family or consult with them inmaking decisions about care for the terminallyill patient. Last rites, burial, and mourning customs COG IC has no ritual that could be described as last rites. COGIC members may request thatchurch elders or other members be present for prayer with and/or for the dying patient.Patients and their families may request that sacraments or other important rituals be per-formed. Only ordained ministers can administerthe Lord's Supper. Baptism by full immersion(see \"Baptism,\" below) may not be possible,given the medical condition of certain patients. BAPTISM COG IC does not recognize \"sprinkling\" as bap- tism. In order for baptism to be efficacious, per-sons must be immersed fully in a body ofwater. 22In the United States, because of urban- ization, most baptisms in COGIC are performedin indoor baptismal pools or tanks. Rarely doCOG IC members use rivers, streams, ponds, and so forth. In rural areas and in other countries, itmay be that bodies of water found in nature areused with some frequency. Baptism is adminis-tered only for persons who make a profession offaith in Jesus Christ. It is therefore not adminis- tered to infants. 23The denomination recognizes that it is through faith in Christ more than theperformance of any ritual that persons receivesalvation and the gift of eternal life. Baptism isregarded as a \"symbol\" of regeneration, a per-son's experiencing a renewal of life in Christ. 24 A person's not having been baptized, for reasonsbeyond his control, will not affect his salvation, provided that he has undergone the fundamen-tal experience of rebirth in Christ.

Increasingly,healthcare workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practi-cal information about the values and beliefs ofdifferent religious traditions. It should assistnurses, physicians, chaplains, social workers, andadministrators in their decision making and caregiving. It can also serve as a reference for believ- ers who desire to learn more about their own tra-ditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should notsubstitute for discussion of patients' own reli- gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
