The sources may include: undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommen dation, personal statements, samples of academic work, portfolios, audi tions, professional experience r elated to proposed graduate study, as well as nationally known, standardized t est scores. It is the responsi bility of each graduate program to select admissions criteria that best predict succe ss in their specific field and to determine the weight given to each measure. None of the sources of information, particularly standardized t est scores, should be used in isolation nor should such scores be used in combinati on or separately to establish m inimum or \"cut off\" scores. Program specific guidelines for the use of standa rdized test scores should be de veloped based on the experience of a given department with its pool of applicants.1 1 Adapted from the GRE \"Guide to the Use of Scores\" 2003-2003 USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 4 Graduate Admissio ns 17 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Admission Requirements Each applicant to a graduate program at the University of South Florida is required to meet the following minimum requirements: 1.

Transient Student Form : http://www.registrar.usf.edu/forms/TSF2008 0407_16_17_06.pdf Graduate Assistantships (GA), esearch Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantships (TA): Graduate Assistantships are intended to recruit quality student s to graduate study at USF and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist wit hin academic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assist ants may teach, conduct resea rch, or perform other tasks that contribute to the student's professional development. Graduate students may be cl assified as Graduate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GT As), Graduate Instructional A ssistants (GIAs), and/or Graduate Research Assistants/Associates (GRAs). All graduate assistants at USF wo rk under a contract negotiated by the Graduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduate assistants at USF. To receive an assistantship, the graduate student must meet the following eligibility requirements: Accepted in a graduate degree program; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and degree program GPA of 3.00; Enrolled fulltime during the se mester(s) appointed as a gradua te assistant; For teaching assistantships, demonstrate proficiency in spoken English (if student is not from an English speaking country). Fulltime enrollment is considered nine (9) graduate credit hou rs in the fall semester, nine (9) graduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the fulltime requirement . Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate Studies enrollment requirements to retain their a ssistantship as stated in the Gra duate Catalog. The TA Training offered by ATLE as a requirement of training fo r all new Teaching Assistants (9183/9184 job codes) is designed in two parts to deliver blended instruction on the essentials of teaching at USF. First, TAs complete a set of seven mediarich and inte ractive modules that comprises an 8hour online course intended to equip USF Teaching Assistants with the sk ills needed to effectively plan and deliver compelling co urses that will ensure student success. Second, this online knowledge base is compleme nted by either an 8 hour oneday facetoface session or an 8 week course that is ideal for any graduate student teaching at the college level, either while here with us at USF or in their future career. The focus of this com ponent is on teaching colle ge classes, and doing it well, which examines best practices in a number of topics relat ed to course design and course delivery, so that by the end of the program, Teaching Assistants feel like they are wellequipped to build and deliver a collegelevel class on their own and will receive a certificate. Those who el ect the 8week course will focus on instruction that is heavily tilted toward discussions , participation, and individua l presentations called microteaching. Further, the USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 5 Registration and General Information 36 http://www.grad.usf.edu / microteaching lab will give eac h student the opportunity to pr esent a short (710 minute) lecture from their discipline to fellow classmates, and receive informal feedback on their delivery. These students will also receive co curricular transcript cre dit and a certificate.

Copies of the University's student records policy, USF 2.0021, may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar or the General Counsel. Academic Record The student's academic record shall not be changed after the st udent has graduated. Except in cases of administrative error, the student 's academic record shall not b e changed once the semester has rolled. Release of Student Information Pursuant to requirements of the Family Educational Rights and P r i v a c y A c t ( F E R P A ) , t h e f o l l o w i n g t y p e s o f information, designated by law a s \"directory information,\" may be released via official media of USF (according to USF policy): Student name, local and permanent addresses, telephone listing, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, full and parttime status, and th e most recent previous educational agency or institution attended, and o ther similar information. The University Directory, publish ed annually by the University, contains only the following information, however: student name, local and permanent address, telephone listing, USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 5 Registration and General Information 37 http://www.grad.usf.edu / classification, and major field of study. The Directory and other listings of \"directory information\" are circulated in the course of University business and, therefore, are accessibl e to the public, as well as to students, faculty, and staff. Students must inform the USF Office of the Registrar in writing (forms available for that purpose), if they wish directory information to be wit hheld. Such requests must be rec eived within the first two (2) weeks of the semester and will remain in effect until the student has not be en enrolled at USF for three (3) consecutive terms. Notification to the University of refusal to permit release of \"directory information\" via the University Directory must be received no later than the end of the first week of cla sses in the Fall Semester. Exclusions Members or former members of the faculty who hold or have held the rank of Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor are not eligible to be granted degrees from USF, exce pt upon prior authorization of the Office of Graduate Studies and the Provost. In cases where a member of th e immediate family of a faculty member is enrolled in a graduate degree program, the faculty member may n ot serve on any advisory or examination committee or be involved in any de termination of academic or fi nancial status of that individual. Course Information Academic Credit hours Reference - USF Policy 10065 http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policiesandprocedures/pdfs /policy10065.pdf Florida Statute 6A10.033 credit provides the b asis for quantifying the amount o f engaged learning time expected of a typical student enrolled in traditional classroom settings, laboratorie s, studios, internships and other forms of experiential learning, and distance and correspondence education. Credit hou rs are a measure of learning, and support a wide range of activities, including the transfer of students from on e institution to another, awarding financial aid, and credentialing for employment. Because of the significance of aw arding credit hours, an institution is obligated to ensure that credit hours for courses and programs conform to th e commonly accepted standards of higher education, as stated in the Southern Association of College s and Schools Commission on Coll eges (SACSCOC) Federal Requirements 4.9 (Definition of Credit Hour) (http://sacscoc.org/pdf/081705/Credit%20Hours.pdf ) and the SACSCOC Credit Hours Policy Statement. This Policy is inten ded to ensure that all creditbearing courses and programs offered by the University of South Florida System (USF System) meet the requirements of the Federal definition of a credit hour and the Credit Hours Policy Stateme nt issued by th e SACSCOC. In determining the max imum number of credits that may be assign ed to a course, the follow ing guidelines apply. For courses taught in a \"traditional\" classroom format in a 15 week semester, the maximum number of credits to be assigned is limited to the weekly number of 50mi nute contact periods (or their equivalent) with the instructor. Underlying this statement is an assumption that each 50minute contact period requires a minimum additional two hours of student work outside of the c lass involving readin g, exercises, etc. Where this assumption does not ho ld true (as may be the case wi th some laboratories, for example), then the maximum number of credits may be significantly less than th e weekly number of 50minute contact periods. o For a lecture class, one unit is considered to be one hour of l ecture class time and two hours per week of homework. For the typica l threeunit class, a student s pends three hours per week in class and should do six hours per week of homework. The total n umber of class contact hours per semester equals the credit hou rs multiplied by 15 weeks. o For a laboratory class, the hours per week are considered to be all in class with no outside assignments. Thus, one unit is th ree hours per week of laborato ry time. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 5 Registration and General Information 38 http://www.grad.usf.edu / o Where a course includes \"by arrangement lab hours,\" these gener ally take the place of the hours assigned to homework, since the student is required to use supe rvised college facilities to do assignments related to homework. An example might be a 3unit l ecture course which requires the student also to work two hours per week in the computer lab . There would be only four hours per week of additional homework required. In all cases, but particularly in cases such as online learning where seat time is nonverifiable, credit hours are awarded on the basis of docum ented student learning outcome s t h a t r e f l e c t t h e a m o u n t o f academically engaged time for a typical student in a traditiona l format, and on the basis of documentation of the amount and type of work a typical student is expected to complete within a specified period of academically engaged time. The number of credit hours awarded is based on the number and/or rigor of student learning outcomes, with the higher number of credit hou rs awarded yielding gr eater number and/or rigor of outcomes . Availability of Courses USF does not commit itself to of fer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this catalog unless there is sufficient demand to justify them. Some courses may be offered only in alternate semesters or years, or even less frequently if there is little demand. Mandatory FirstDay Attendance Policy All students are required to atte nd class the first day a class meets, for both online and oncampus courses. Students unable to attend must contact the instructor prior to the first day to ensure th ey are not dropped from the course. This policy is not a pplicable to courses in the fol lowing categories: Educa tional FEEDS Program, Community Experiential Learning (CEL), Cooperative Edu cation Training, and courses that do not have regularly scheduled meeting days/times (such as, directed readi ng/research or study, individual research, thesis, dissertation, internshi p, practica, etc.). Students are responsible for dropping undesired courses in thes e categories by the 5th day of c lasses to avoid fee liability and academic penalty. (See USF Regulation - Registration 4.0101, http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf4.0101.pdf ) Attendance Policy for the Observ ance of Religious Days by Stude nts In accordance with Sections 1006.53 and 1001.74(10) (g) Florida Statutes and Board of Governors Regulation 6C 6.0115, the University of South F lorida (University/USF) has es tablished the http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policiesandprocedures/pdfs /policy10045.pdf . Crosslisting 4000/6000 Courses It is expected that the 4000 an d 6000 courses will have distinc t syllabi demonstrating di fferent depth and breadth of the subject matter as reflected in the course requirements. The courses presuppose different audiences, and the intention is to offer them at distinct levels. Course Currency All courses, with the exception of those approved for transfer of credit, should meet the time limit specified for the degree and be academically relev ant as determined by the facult y in the graduate degree program. Courses used for the graduate degree requirements can be no more than ten ye ars old at the time the degree is conferred. Course Descriptions For a listing of the most current , approved course descriptions refer to the USF Course Inventory Database available online at http://ugs.usf.edu/courseinventory or in the course description listing in the Graduate Catalog. Adds After a student has completed his/her registration on the date assigned, he/she may add a course(s) during the drop/add week (i.e. through the fifth day of classes) through t he OASIS system. Courses may be added with instructor approval and verificat ion up to the last day to with draw without academic penalty. See Academic USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 5 Registration and General Information 39 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Calendar for deadlines. Courses may not be added after the dea dline to withdraw without academic penalty or retroactively except in cases of University Administrative erro r. Drops/Withdrawals Drop A student may drop a course(s) during the drop/add periods (fir st five days of classes) in order for the course(s) not to appear on any permanent academic records. No t uition or fees will be assessed for course(s) dropped within that period. Courses may not be dropped after t he last day of classes except in cases of University Administrative error. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from a course(s) between the second a nd tenth week of the semester (except for summer sessions see the Summer Schedule of Classe s for dates). However, tuition and fees will be assessed for any course(s) withdrawn by the student after th e first week. The stud ent's academic record will reflect a \"W\" grade for any course(s) withdrawal between t he second and tenth week of the semester. Under specific conditions, consid eration for refund of tuition and fees may be requested if a Fee Adjustment Request form accompanied by verifiable supporting documentation is submitted to the Office of the Registrar within six (6) months from the e nd of the semester to which any refund would be applicable. Students who withdraw may not conti nue to attend classes. Effective Fall 2016, all graduate students will be limited to a total of two course withdrawals while enrolled as a degreeseeking or a nondegree seeking taking graduate course s at USF. Only in extenuating circumstances will approval be granted for more than two course withdrawals. Appeals for additional course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Offic e of Graduate Studies via the Graduate Petition process. Fee Adjustment Options Students who receive approval to drop a course during the secon d through tenth week of classes are liable for tuition and fees. However, the student may apply for a Fee Adju stment through the Registrar's Office if the student has any of the exceptional circumstances noted above in item 3. The Fee Adjustment form may be submitted after the petition to drop is approved and processed. The Registrar will determine if a fee/tuition refund is applicable. Deletes A \"delete\" completely removes the course from the record with n o history that it was ever part of the record. Courses will not be deleted from a student's record except in c ases of University Administrative error. Requests for course deletions must be submitted only during the semester in which the error has oc curred and only with written explanation from college faculty verifying the error. Such requests must be submitted by the last day of classes and approved by the College Dean or designee and the Of fice of Graduate Studies Dean or designee. Retroactive requests for course deletions will not be approved. Faculty and students are encouraged to review c o u r s e e n r o l l m e n t t o v e r i f y a c c u r a c y o f r e g i s t r a t i o n . I n t h e e v ent of extenuating circumstances such as documented medical emergencies, military leave or University er ror, students may request special consideration for deletions or retroactive deletions in writing to the Dean o f the Office of Graduate Studies. Retroactive Actions Requests for retroactive actio ns will no longer be considered / approved. Also see Academic Record. Auditing Privileges and Fees A student who wishes to sit in on a class to review the course material may do so; however, the student is not allowed to take exams, earn grades, or receive credit. The stud ent's status for that cla ss is an audit and his/her presence in the classroom is as a listener. Audit status must b e obtained only during the first five days of the term by filing an Audit Form and a datestamped permit from the coll ege/department on the campus where the course USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 5 Registration and General Information 40 http://www.grad.usf.edu / is being offered, with the Regist rar's Office. INSTATE fees ar e assessed for all audit courses. Procedure and forms for requesting to audit are ava ilable on the Registrar's websit e. Cancellation of Registration before First Class Meeting Students may cancel their regist ration by notifying the Office of the Registrar in writing p rior to the first day of classes. If fees have already been paid, the student may reques t a full refund of fees and tuition from the Office of Purchasing and Financial Services. Voluntary Withdrawal ( from the program) A student may voluntarily withdraw from their graduate degree p rogram. A Voluntary Withdrawal cannot be retroactive. The effective date of the withdrawal will be enter ed into the student's record by the Office of the Registrar as the first business day after the end of the semest er. Students who wish to withdraw must submit a Voluntary Withdrawal Form , available from the Office of Graduate Studies ( www.grad.usf.edu ). Once processed, the student's status will be chang ed from Graduate Degree Seeki ng to NonDegree Seeking. A change to Non Degree Seeking status could adversely impact financial aid. Que stions regarding this sh ould be directed to the Financial Aid Department at (813) 9744700. The student will re main financially and academ ically responsible for any course(s) they have registered for. The student may request to drop or delete courses they are registered for by submitting a Office of Graduate Studies Petition. Academic Dismissal Students may be academically d ismissed from their graduate degr ee program for a variety of reasons. Once processed, the student's status will be changed from Graduate D egree Seeking to NonDegree Seeking. A change to NonDegree Seeking status cou ld adversely impact financial a id. Dismissal cannot be retroactive. The effective date will be entered into the st udent's record by the Office of the Registrar as the First Business Day after the end of the Semester, except in cases of academic dismissal due to a cademic dishonesty or d isruption of academic process. Some of the reasons f or academic dismissal include*: Failure to successfully satisfy requirements to meet Conditiona l Admission by the dea dline established by the program. Receiving an \"FF\" grade Failure to maintain \"good standing\" Failure to make satisfactory progress *students may be dismissed for other reasons, such as violation s of student conduct. Refer to the USF Policy - 6.0021 ( http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf6.0021.pdf ) for more information.

While advisors, directors, d epartment chairpersons, and deans are available to assist the student meet these requirements, it is ultimately th e responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements. If requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. The informa tion presented here represents the University Academic Policies. Colleges and departments may have additional requirements. Check with your College Graduate Coordinator or your Department Program Director for more inform ation. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the Catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the Board of Trustees. For a l ist of current course descriptions, refer to the USF Course Inventory database online at http://ugs.usf.edu/courseinventory Student Conduct Members of the University community support high standards of i ndividual conduct and human relations. Responsibility for one's own conduct and respect for the rights of others are essential conditions for academic and personal freedom within the University. USF reserves the right to deny admission or refuse enrollment to students whose actions are contrary to the purposes of the University or impair the welfare or freedom of other members of the University community. Disciplinary procedures are follo wed when a student fails to exercise responsibility in an acceptable manner or commits an offense as outlined in th e Student Conduct Code. Refer to the USF 6.0021, Student Code of Conduct at http://regulationspolicies.usf.ed u/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf6.0021.pdf Responsible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Effective Spring 2013, the Office of Graduate Studies requires all new doctoral students to have basic RCR training by completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiati ve (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introd uce researchers to various elements of research conduct ranging from research m isconduct to data management to mentoring. As this is a minimum requirement, specific doctoral programs may r equire training that goes beyon d the basic components introduced in this module. Graduate Programs that have received Office of Graduate Studies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 43 http://www.grad.usf.edu / with disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their stud ents from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Program Director and Office of Graduate Studies, in the first semester enrolled in a doctor al program. Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to reg ister for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of this RC R requirement. Once the train ing is completed, the Registra tion hold will be lifted. Intellectual and Scho larship Integrity Shared Authorship and Research Education Policy USF contains a broad range of academic programs in diverse disc iplines, and the USF facu lty recognize that the conventions on shared authorship and credit for scholarship var y among disciplines. I n general, sharing in authorship implies both substant ive intellectual contributions to the work and also approval of the work as it appears in public. Right to authorship credit is not automatica lly conveyed by being the instructor of a course, being a student's major professor, or being a research assistan t working with faculty and professional researchers; neither is credit automatically prohibited because of such stat us. Each college/program that includes research education shall inc lude an explicit discussion of shared authorship issues and disciplinary conventions as part of the formal curri culum addressing research methods and ethics, including the conventions of the discipline's publications. I n addition, each college or program shall have a formal statement about shared authorship made available to students (s uch as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about oth er program and college expectations. Each college/program shall also have a written procedure for re solving questions or conflicts about shared authorship where students are involved. The college and program may use the same procedure for resolving questions for nonstudent employees, but the procedure for reso lving questions or conflicts involving students must address the educational need s of students (e.g., explicitl y asking about the nature of the research methods and ethics education as experien ced by a student involved in th e case at hand). This written procedure must be made available to students (such as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about other program and university expectations.

Each Catalog is published and in effect for the academic term (s) noted on the title page. Student's Program Degree Requirements In order to graduate, students must meet all requirements speci fied in the USF Catalog of their choice, except as noted below. As the University is dynamic, changes and updates to the catalog are anticipated. In contract to program requirements, which are tied to a specific catalog, all students must comply with University policies and procedures that come into effect each catalog year. Students cannot choose a USF Ca talog published prior to admissi on (or readmission) or during an academic year in which they did not complete at least two terms . If a student is dropped from the system and must be reinstated, the student's choice of Catalog is limited to the USF Catalog in effect at the time of readmission or any one Catalog published during the ir continuous reenrollment. If state law or certification requirements change, the student must comply with the most current standard or criteria. If the College or Department makes fundamental changes to the p rogram that necessitates changes in the degree requirements of enrolled students, the needs of thos e students will be exp licitly addressed in the proposal for change and scrutinized by the Office of Gradua te Studies. USF policies and procedures not related to degree requirements such as academic grievance procedures, student conduct code and other procedural processes and definitions may be updated each year and the student w ill be held to the most current catalog a nd procedures available. USF does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this Catalog. If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specifie d in the Catalog of choice as a result of decisions and changes made by th e University, appropriate subst itutions will be determined by the program to ensure that the student is not penalized. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 45 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Student/Advisor Relationship Although it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policie s and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements, the Advisor's role is to guide students in all aspects of their academic program and to monitor and evalu ate students' progress toward t heir degrees. He/she should be aware of any difficulties that students may be facing in their coursework or research experiences and should work with students in resolving these issues. It is recommended that the advisor a nd student understand each other's expectations and that effective means of communication are established. The advisor and student are encouraged to meet at appropriate intervals to critica lly evaluate the student's prog ress. These meetings may be requested by the student or the advisor. The advisor also has the obligation to express to the student any concerns he/she may have regarding the student's performance, to stipulate the level and quality of work expected, and to offer suggestions leading to student success. As su ch, the advisor neither gives the student excessive guidance nor allows the student to struggle needlessly. The goal of this relationship i s to foster student independence, which results in successful completion of t he program of study. Student's Program of Study In addition to the graduate degree program requirements as spec ified in the Graduate Catalog, each student should have a written, flexible program of study that includes the student's choice of Catalog year, choice of concentration, cognate, or other options available in the degre e program, and a tentative identification of other appropriate choices available to the student in the program, wh ich may (but does not need to) include specific courses. A program of study is no t a guarantee that specific co urses will be available in a specific semester or that statutory and regulatory requirements will not change during th e student's enrollment in the program. As required or appropriate, the program of st udy should be revisited and mo dified by the student and the student's advisor/major professor(s). Electronic Signatures Where procedures described in this catalog require signatures, requirements for original sig natures may b e satisfied by Universityapproved electronic signatures or other secure metho ds of verifying approval by advisors, major professors, committee members, or other Univer sity administrators, faculty, and staff. Assistantships Graduate Assistantships (GA), R esearch Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantshi ps (TA) Graduate Assistantships are intended to rec ruit quality students to grad uate study at USF and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist within acade mic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assistants may t each, condu ct research, or per form other tasks that contribute to the student's professional development. Gradua te students may be classified a s Graduate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GTAs), Gra duate Instruct ional Assistants ( G I A s ) , a n d / o r G r a d u a t e R e s e a r c h Assistants/Associates (GRAs). All graduate assistants at USF wo rk under a contract negotiated by the Graduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for gra duate assistants at USF. Eligibility To receive an assistantship, the g raduate student must meet the following eligibilit y requirements: Accepted in a graduate degree program; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and degree program GPA of 3.00; Enrolled fulltime during the se mester(s) appointed as a gradua te assistant. For Teaching Assistants, demonstr ate proficiency in spoken Engl ish (if student is no t from an English speaking country) USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 46 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Appointments Graduate Assistants may be appointed up to a maximum of 0.50 FT E for a single assistantship. Programs who desire to appoint a Graduate Stu dent, in any classification, mo re than 0.50 FTE up to 0.75 FTE, for single or multiple appointments, must subm it justification to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. Students hired in nonGA positions on campus must also not exceed 0.75 FTE for th e combined position and assistantship appointments. It is preferred that students refrain from employ ment outside of the assistantship appointment. Departments may determine the maximum number of semesters for t eaching assistantshi p appointments. Enrollment Fulltime enrollment is considered nine (9) graduate credit hou rs in the fall semester, nine (9) graduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the fulltime requirement . Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate Studies enrollment requirements to retain their assistantship as stated in the Gra duate Catalog. For specifics regarding Graduate Assistantship requirements, guidelines, and policies, refer to the Graduate Assistants Po licies and Guidelines Handbook Note Criminal History Background Checks may be required depen ding on the appointment reference USF Policy 0615 http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policiesandprocedures/pdfs /policy0615.pdf Enrollment Requirements Students receiving Veterans' Administration benefits should con firm their enrollment requirements with the Office of Veterans' Services or Veterans' Coordinator. Minimum University Regulations USF FullTime Student Definition Students taking a minimum of nine (9) hours toward their degree in the fall or spring semester, or taking a minimum of six (6) hours in the summer semester, will be classi fied as FullTime students for academic purposes. Students may take a maximum of eighteen (18) hours in any given semester; exceeding eighteen (18) hours requires a signed program of study or written approval from the College. For financial aid enrollment requirements, refer to the Office of Financial Aid http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/enrollment.aspx . Continuous Enrollment for All Graduate Students All graduate degreeseeking stud ents must be continuously enrol led. Continuous enrollment is defined as completing, with grades assigned, a minimum of 6 hours of gradu ate credit every three continuous semesters. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Student s on an approved leave of absence are not subject to the enrollment requirement for the time approved for the leave. Students who have been admitted to Doctoral Candidacy must follow the Dissertation Hour Enrollment in place of the Continuous Enrollment requirement as specified here for all graduate students (not in candidacy). See also the T ime Limitations Policy. Readmission Following Nonenrollment A graduate student who is not registered and enrolled for a min imum of six (6) credits in a 12month period is automatically placed in nondegree seeking (i.e. inactive) stat us. Students must be readmitted to the degree program to continue their studi es. Readmission is at the discr etion of the program and is not guaranteed. Refer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for m ore information. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 47 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Enrollment during Comprehensive Exams and Admission to Candidac y During the term in which students take the comprehensive exams, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or f ollowing the exam. Students must also be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate work in the semester of admission to doc toral candidacy. Dissertation Hours Students working on a dissertatio n must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of dissertation every semester, starting with the semester following Admission to Doctoral Cand idacy, up to and including the semester the dissertation is submitted to and approved by the Office of Grad uate Studies. Dissertation hours may apply to the Continuous Enrollment Requirement. Colleges and programs may h ave additional requirements. Students who are dropped from degreeseeking status and formally readmitted to the program must enroll in a minimum of 5 dissertation hours in the semester that the readmission is effe ctive. Ref er t o th e R eadmissi on Policy in th e Graduate Admissions Section for more information. Enrollment during Semester of Thesis Submission Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) thesis hours during the semester that the thesis is submitted and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies, usually the sem ester of graduation. Students not enrolled for the minimum requirement will not ha ve the thesis/dissertation appro ved and therefore may not be certified for graduation. Enrollment during Sem ester of Graduation Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) graduate hou rs during the semester of graduation. Enrollment for Graduate Teach ing and Research Assistants Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants should be fulltime s tudents. Exceptions must be approved by the College Dean and the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. Leaves of Absence (LOA) Leaves of absence may be granted to students under exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. Students requesting a LOA must specify the reasons for the leave, as wel l as the duration. Requested LOA may be approved for up to two years. Students requiring less than three (3) con secutive terms of absence do not need an approved LOA if they meet the continuous enrollment requirement. Students with an approved LOA must be enrolled in the first sem ester after the leave expires. To request an LOA, the student must complete the form available from the Office of Graduate Studies website. The LOA must be approved by the Major Professor, the Program, the College, and the Office of Graduate Studies, and is noted in the student's record. If the LOA is granted, the time absent does n ot count against the stude nt's time limit to obtain the degree. Students returning from an approved LOA must reactivate their s tatus by contacting the Office of Graduate Studies for procedures. Doctoral candidates returning from a LOA must a lso have their candidacy status reactivated. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 48 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) For Academic Purposes Satisfactory Academic Progress fo r academic purposes is determi ned by the progress the student has made in the Program towards degree completion, taking into account the curr iculum requirements, as well as the time to degree allocations. This is a separate assessment from the Sat isfactory Academic Progress requirement for financial aid. For Financial Aid Recipients Reference: http://www.usf.edu/financialaid/sap/index.aspx Reference: http://www.ifap.ed.gov/qaho me/qaassessments/sap.html Federal regulations re quire all schools part icipating in Title IV federal financial aid progr ams to have a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy th at conforms to specific grade based and timebased requirements. These requirements apply to all studen ts as one determinant of eligib ility for financial aid and in clude three components: GPA Pace Maximum Time Refer to the Financial Aid websites for information and require ments. Academic Standards and Grades Minimum University Requirements In Good Standing To be considered a \"student in good standing,\" graduate student s must Maintain an overall minimum grad e point average (GPA) of 3.00 ( on a 4.00 scale) in a ll courses taken as a graduate student, and Maintain an overall minimum grad e point average (GPA) of 3.00 ( on a 4.00 scale) in a ll courses taken in each of the student's de greeseeking programs. Only courses with grades of \"C\" (2.00) or better will be accept ed toward a graduate degree; no grade of C or below will be accepted . Students must meet the requirements to be in good standing to graduate. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades must be cleared for graduation to be certified. Students who fail to maintain good standing may be placed on probation or acad emically dismissed. Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality poi nts by the total number of graded ( AF) hours completed. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. The GPA is truncated to two decimals (3.48) and is not rounded up. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W, Z and grades which are preceded by T (Transfer) are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Graduate students are not eligible for grade forgiveness. All grades earned, regardless of course leve l, will be posted on the tra nscript. If a student retakes a course, both grades will be used in the determination of the GPA. Courses taken at USF as nondegree seeking are not computed in the GPA unless the courses are tran sferred in and applied to the degree requirements. The program and the college must approve such act ions. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 49 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Grades for transfer credits accepted toward the degree program will not be counted in the GPA unless the coursework in question was taken as a nondegreeseeking studen t at USF and meets the requirements stated above (see Institution Based Cre dit/Transfer of Credit section) . Graduate Grading System Plus/Minus Grading: Effective fall semester 2000, graduate and undergraduate grades will be assigned quality points in the Grade Point Average (GPA) grading syst em.

USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 50 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Satisfactory (S)/ Unsatisfactory (U) Graduate students may not take courses in the major on an S/U ( satisfactory / unsatisfactory) basis unless courses are specifically designated S/U in the Catalog. Student s may take courses outside of the major on an S/U basis with prior approval of the course professor, major pr ofessor or advisor, and the Dean of the College in which the student is seeking a degree. The student may apply a maximum of six (6) hours of such credit (excluding those courses for which S/U is designated in the Cat alog) toward a master's degree. Directed Research, Thesis, and Dissertatio n courses are designated as va riable credit and are graded on an S/U basis o n l y . B e f o r e a s t u d e n t b e g i n s w o r k u n d e r D i r e c t e d R e s e a r c h , a w ritten agreement must be completed between the student and the professor concerned, setting forth in detail the requirem ents of the course. Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and grante d at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illn ess or other circums tances beyond their control. This applies to all grad able courses, including pass/f ail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: the majority of the student's work for a course has been comple ted before the end of the semester the work that has been completed must be qualitatively satisfac tory the student has request ed consideration for an \"I\" grade as soo n as possible but no later than the last day of finals week. The student must request consider ation for an Incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the elig ibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decision on gran ting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Gr ade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student wou ld earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by stu dent/instructor as long as it does not exceed one semester from the original date grades were due for that course. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the department that offered the cours e and the Office of Graduate Studies by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students t o either reregister for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade. Students may registe r to audit the course, with the instructor's approval, but cannot retake the course for credit until the \"I \" grade is cleared. The instructor will be required to complete the IGrade Contract online when posting the semest er grade at the end of the term, identifying the remaining coursework to be completed, the student's last da y of attendance, and the percent of work accomplished to this point. Th is online contract will be autom atically copied to the student's email and to the Registrar. An \"I\" grade not cleared within the next academic semester (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. \" I\" grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course was taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. When the fin al grade is assigned, if applic able, the student will be placed on academic probation or academically dismisse d (refer to Automated Academi c Probation Procedures for information). Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or certified for graduation with an \" I\" grade. Example: student has a \"B\" in the course, not including the grade fo r the missing assignment, therefore is eligible for an \"I\" student's grade, including a zero for the missed work, woul d be an \"D\" student and instructor complete the \"I\" Grade Contract, ass igning an \"ID\" (Incomplete +D grade) USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 7 Academic Policies a nd Regulations 51 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Deadline Agreed Upon in Contract (e.g. two weeks):* If the student completes the work as agreed upon in the Contrac t by the noted deadline the instructor of record will submit a change of grade in e grades student earns final grade comprised of all completed course work If the student does not complete the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the noted deadline \"I\" automatically drops off and the grade of \"D\" remains. GPA is recalculated for the current semester and retroactiv ely recalculated for the semester in which the \"I\" was granted. *Although the instructor establishes the deadline for completio n of the work, the deadline may only extend through the end of the subsequent semester. Missing (M) The University policy is to issue an M grade automatically when the instructor does not submit any gr ade for a graduate student. Until it is removed, the M is not computed in the GPA. T o resolve the missing grade, students receiving an M grade must contact their instructor. If the instructor is not available, the student must contact the instructor's department chair. Courses with an M grade may not be applied to the degree program requirements. Students with an M grade will not be admitted to d octoral candidacy until the M grade is resolved. Continuing Registration Grades (Z) The Z grade shall be used to indicate c ontinuing registration in mul tisemester internship or thesis/dissertation courses where the final grade to be assigned will indicate the complete sequence of courses or satisfactory completion of the thesis/dissertation. Upon satisfactory comple tion of a multisemester internship or thesis/dissertation, the fin al grade assigned will be an S. The Office of Graduate Studies submits the change of grade for the last registration o f thesis/dissertation courses once the thesis/dissertation has been accepted for publication. Note: Graduation will not be certified until all courses have b een satisfactorily completed. No grade changes will be processed after the st udent has graduated except in the case of university error. Procedures requiring petitions are processed throu gh the Office of Graduate Studies. Probation Any student who is not in good sta nding at the end of a semeste r shall be considered on probation as of the following semester. The college or program may also place stude nts on probation for other reasons as designated by the college or program. Notification of probation shall be m ade to the student in writing by the department, with a copy to the College Dean. At the end of each probationar y semester, the department shall recommend, in writing, to the College De an one of the following: 1. Removal of probation 2. Continued probation; OR 3. Dismissal from the degree program. Students on probation may only enroll in graduate courses (5000 7000 level) that are part of the approved degree program requirements as specified in the Graduate Catalog. St udents with a GPA below 3.00 for two consecutive semesters will be prevented from registering for courses withou t the permission of the Co llege Dean. The College Dean will notify the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies in cases of academic dismissal. To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply fo r admission, meet ing the admissi on criteria in place at the time.

The guidelines must then be submitted and approved by the Polic y Committee of the Graduate Council. These guidelines are used in the devel opment of a new Accelerated Pro gram. For Departments Developing an Accelerated Program: Proposed Programs must meet the Accelerated Program Requirements , as well as follow the best practices listed below: Programs have a choice of confe rring degrees simultaneously or sequentially, but it is recommended that undergraduate degrees are to be c onferred in a timely manner as soon as undergraduate requirements are fulfilled. Programs must complete a Program of Study, develop a plan for a cademic advising, and tracking of students, including not ation of potential financial aid impact. Typically, up to twelve (12) hours of graduate credit may be sh ared between the graduate and undergraduate degree. Although, w ith Graduate Council and Offic e of Graduate Studies approval, programs may offer accelerated programs with more shared credits.* Typically, a minimum undergraduate GPA of at least 3.33 overall and a minimum GPA of 3.50 in the major, having taken a minimum of 15 hour s in the undergraduate major a re required for students to be admitted to an accelerated program. With Graduate Council and Office of Graduate Studies approval, programs may offer accelerated programs with different GPA requirements. Stu dents must have a minimum of a \"B\" (3.00) in each graduate course. Consequences for not obtaining a \"B\" in each graduate course must be noted in the Departmental Accelera ted Program requirements. Following completion of a minimum of 15 hours in the undergradu ate major, the student may be considered for acceptance into the Accelerated Degree program i n one of two ways: faculty nomination or student selfnomination, via submission of the Accelerated Graduate Program Nomination Form. Programs will review the applicat ions and approve the nominatio n. Programs will submit the required paperwork ( Accelerated Graduate Program Admission Form ) to officially convert the student to graduate standing, no later than when th e student has reached 90 hours or Bachelor's degree has been con ferred. The application requires approval from the Graduate Program, College, and Office of Graduate Studies. *Note: Due to SACSCOC requirement s, the total combined hours af ter sharing must be a minimum of 150 credit hours (30 credit hours for the maste r's and 120 credit hours for the bachelors) What Departments will submit fo r Curriculum Approval and catalo g copy: ACADEMIC INFORMATION (Catalog Copy): Accelerated Program Requirements Accelerated Programs allow academ ically qualified students to c omplete an undergradua te Bachelor's degree and a graduate master's degree on an accelerated timeline, grad uating sooner than in traditional programs.

A s soon as the student completes the undergraduate degree requirements, the student is converted to graduate status, where the remaining graduate requirements are fulfilled. Students interested in pursuing an Accelerated Program must complete an Accelerated Program Application ( http://www.grad.usf.edu/inc/linke dfiles/Accelerated_Program_Ap plication.pdf ). Editor's Note: Although students may in an Accelerated Program, pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's Degree at the same time, they cannot be in two levels at once. Dual Degree Programs A student may pursue two graduate degrees at USF through a form al, approved Dual Degree Program. The goal is for a student to earn two graduate degrees. Students interested in a Dual Degree Programs: Must apply for admission to the f irst program and validate admi ssion through enrollment. In the semester following that enrollment, the student must apply for dual degree program approval May share between 0% and 15% of th e total combined minimum prog ram credit hours. Only structured graduate coursework may be shared. Will meet all other separate deg ree requirements (e.g. two diss ertations, one thesis/one dissertation, projects, exams, etc.), unless th e Dual Degree Program was appr oved with a combined requirement by Graduate Council through the formal Dual Degree Program Curricu lum Approval. Must have a minimum of 60 total combined graduate hours after t he shared hours are applied for dual master's programs, or a minimum of 102 total combined graduate hours for a dual master's/doctorate program Degrees may be conferred sequentially or concurrently, as speci fied in the approved Program requirements. Both Degrees must be conferred within the timelimit for the first d egree to which the student is admitted.

USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 57 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Section 8 University Degree Requirements Degree Requirements The following sections describe the University requirements est ablished by the Office of Graduate Studies for the Master's, Education Specialist, a nd Doctoral degrees. However, individual programs and colleges may establish additional or more stringent requirements. Student Responsibilities The University of South Florida and all colleges, departments a nd programs therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Faculty and graduate program directors are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requireme nts, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if all require ments for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important fo r students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throughout their college caree rs. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion o f the University and the USF B oard of Trustees. Graduate Faculty Definition The University of South Florida recognizes Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty. Only Graduate Faculty, and Affiliate Graduate Faculty app roved for such purposes, may serve as the Instructor of Record for graduate level courses. Graduate Faculty is defined to consist of all tenu retrack or tenured faculty a ppointed at the A ssistant, Associate, or Professor rank, who holds a terminal degree or equivalent in their discipline. Graduate Faculty members are eligible to teach graduate courses and may direct and serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees. To chair a doctoral level committee, a Graduate Faculty member must engage in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities, such as publications, performances, exhibitions, patents, inventions and research grants. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership may be granted by the Office of Graduate Studies De an to individuals whose skills or expertise meet criteria established by the Coll ege. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership is in effect for a specified period of time and specific purposes. Af filiate members may be eligible to serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees, to direct master's a nd specialist's level committees, and to codirect doctoral level committees, at the discretion of the College. Af filiate Graduate Faculty can only serve as the Instructor of Record when they have a terminal degree in the di scipline and are approved to teach graduate courses in that field. Emeritus Professors and retired or rece ntly resigned professors may also be appointed as Affiliate Graduate Faculty with the approval of the College and Office of Graduate Studies Dean. Graduate Faculty Approval - Graduate faculty is defined as noted above; Colleges and Dep artments may have additional requirements. The O ffice of Graduate Studies will ma intain a list of Graduate Faculty along with approval guidelines from the Colleges and Departments. Also reference USF Policy 10 115 - Faculty Credentials for USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 58 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Teaching Undergraduate and Graduate Courses http://regulationspolicies.usf.e du/policiesandprocedures/pdfs /policy10 115.pdf For a current list of Graduate F aculty and Affiliate Graduate F aculty in any program contact the program director or coordinator. Master's Degree Requirements Minimum Hours A minimum of thirty (30) hours is required for a master's degre e, at least sixteen (16) hours of which must be at the 6000 level or above; the rema ining hours must be at the 500 0 level or above. A t l e a s t t w e n t y ( 2 0 ) h o u r s m u s t b e i n f o r m a l , r e g u l a r l y s c h e d u l e d s t r u c t u r e d c o u r s e w o r k . L o w e r l e v e l undergraduate courses may not be used to satisfy master's cours e requirements but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degr ee. Graduate students may not enroll for more than 18 hours in any semester without written permission from t he College Dean. The minimum number of credit hours required for each individual master's program is noted in the degree requirements section of the Graduate Catalog for that program listing. Programs with formally appro ved concentrations must have core major requirements that all students mu st successfully complete. Institutional Enrollment Requirement At least 50% of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota Manatee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degre e refer to the degree requirements in the program listing. Students are re sponsible for consulting with their degree program coordinator for information on courses that may be taken outside their graduate degree program , as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course transfer eligibility requi rements. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions (including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requirements. Time Limitations Master's and Ed.S. degrees must be completed within five (5) ye ars from the student's date of admission for graduate study. Courses taken pr ior to admission to the USF gra duate program, for example as nondegree seeking or from other institutions, must be transferred in prior to gra duation (preferably before the end of the student's second semester; see Course Currency Link). Master and Ed.S. de grees (including dual degree programs) that require course work in excess of 5 0 credit hours may be granted a longer time limit by the University Graduate Council. Time Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitatio n as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request f or an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.e du/studentforms.php Requests must include: the reasons for the de lay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, endorsements from the graduate f aculty advisor, graduate progra m, and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study denoting the pathway to completion and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 59 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Note \u2014 for the time limit extension procedures, if the time lim it extension will cause courses taken within the degree program to be older than 10 years, then a request for co urse concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirements, per the time limit policy. If approved, the timelimit ext ension applies to courses applie d toward the degree, with the exception of those transferred in or from completed degree programs. However, prog rams may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condit ion of the timelimit extension . For requests exceeding a year of additional time, the Office of Gradua te Studies will audit the student's progres s each semester to ensure that the plan of study is adhered to and that progress towards degree completion is occur ring. Students who exceed the time limit ations may have their registr ation placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one tim elimit extension request is per mitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave for up to t wo years (see the section on Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section.) Note Time Limit Extensions ar e valid for a maximum period of two (2) years from the date of request. For more information and guidance, conta ct the Office of Graduate Studie s. Enrollment Requirements Refer to the Academi c Policies Section Major Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the Department (or equivalent) to confirm the internal process and timeline for th e selection and appointmen t of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor from the student's Department (or equivalent) and receive that person's agreement to serve as major professor. The selection o f the Major Professor must be approved and appointed by the Department as soon as possible, but no later t han the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a major professor in order to m aintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a major professor cannot be identified or in the event a maj or professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committ ee, the student is responsible for finding another major professor from the Department (or equivalent). Students who are unable to find a r eplacement major professor should confer with the Program Director for available options (including convertin g to a nonthesis program if available.) If no other options exist, the student may be requested to voluntarily with draw from the program or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and major prof essor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, must be maintained in the student's department file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be from the student's home Department (or serves as a comajor professor with someone from the Department) Be graduate faculty*, as defined by the University, from the st udent's academic area. Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or res earch activities and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements Have been approved by the student's Department Chair (or equiva lent) to serve as a Major Professor or CoMajor Professor Affiliate Graduate Faculty may se rve as a CoMajor Professor wi th a graduate faculty from the student's department. CoMajor Professors may be two graduate faculty or one graduate faculty and one approved Graduate Affiliate Faculty USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 60 http://www.grad.usf.edu / The membership of graduate facul ty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria mu st be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e., for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing and able t o continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a CoMajor Professor on the Commit tee and another graduate faculty from the student's Department is appointed as the other CoMajor Profess or. In the event that the other CoMajor is Affiliate Graduate Faculty, the faculty leaving the University may remain as a member, with another graduate faculty from within the student's Department appointed as the o ther CoMajor Professor. To ensure that the student can make satisfactory pro gress, one of the CoMajor Pro fessors must be accessible on the University campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the the sis/dissertation. In the even t a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordinate w ith the Program Director to facilitate the needs of the st udent. In some instances, a st udent may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"CoMajor Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently, both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pert aining to the student's processing (i.e., committee form, change of committee form, etc.) (Co) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Co mmittee Responsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php Thesis Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit o f a committee of members of the graduate faculty.

Thesis Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements fo r submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the Thesis and Dissertation website http://www.grad.usf.e du/ETDresmain.php . Students who fail to submit the final copy of a t hesis by the posted submission d eadline will be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for graduation by t he posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 63 http://www.grad.usf.edu / two (2) thesis hours for that subs equent semester, and meet the submission requirements as posted on the Thesis/Dissertation website. Only after the Office of Graduate Studies has approved the manuscript can the student be certified for the degree. Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the thesis in an electronic for mat (ETD). Requirements and procedures are available at the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETDresmain.php Submission for Official Publication and Archiving All theses/dissertations will be submitted to the Office of Gra duate Studies designated System for official publication and archiving. Changes after Publication Once a thesis is approved and acce pted by the Office of Graduat e Studies for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Thesis Publications The University recognizes the ben efits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of con flicts of interest in the disc losure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure s hould be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public an d the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Polic y Regarding Inventions and Work s\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's i nterests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disc losure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preserv ing patent rights...\"4 To protect the University's primary goal from undue compromise , the University has ad opted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of resea rch results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Theses will be released for worldwide a ccess once submitted to and app roved by the USF Office of Graduate Studies. In the event that a patent or copyright appli cation provides reason to delay the release of the Thesis, a petition to request a oneyear delay m ay be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for consideratio n. Such requests must be rece ived by the format check of the thesis. 3. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their th eses by agreements involving publication delays. 4 April Burke, \"University Policie s on Conflict of Interest and D elay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on Universit y Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, Febru ary, 1985.

Thesis Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received , reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submi ts the change of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of thesis courses to the office of the regist rar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. Education Specialist Degr ee (Ed.S.) Requirements Ed.S. Thesis Students who are required to s ubmit an Ed.S. Thesis must meet a ll of the requirements for the thesis, as specified in the Master's Degree section o f this publication. For specifi c degree program information, refer to the College of Education. Ed.S. Project Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. NonThesis project must meet all of the requirements as specified by the College of Education. A project does not need to meet the r equirements of a thesis and is not submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies f or approval and archiving. Doctoral Degree Requirements The doctoral degree is granted i n recognition of high attainmen t in a specific field of knowledge. It is a research degree and is not conferred solely upon the earning of credit, the completion of courses, or the acquiring of a number of terms of residency, but also the successful completio n of scholarly work. The length of residency and the requirements below are minimu ms; programs/colleges may elec t to establish more rigorous requirements. The degree will be granted after the student has shown proficiency and distinctive achievement in a specified field, has demonstrated the ability to do or iginal, independent investigat ion, and has presented these findings with a high degree of literary skill in a dissertation. A major professor w ill be appointed as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. The advi sor will advise on any specific subject matter deficiencies and assist in the ch oice of a major professor and area of research. Responsible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF ha s information about RCR availa ble online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Effective Spring 2013, Office of Graduate Studies requires all new doctoral students to have basic RCR training by completing the Collaborative Ins titutional Training Initiative (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introduce rese archers to various elements of research conduct ranging from research misconduct to data management to mentorin g. As this is a minimum requirement, specific doctoral programs may require training that goes beyond the bas ic components introd uced in this module. Graduate Programs that have received Office of Graduate Studies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent with disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their stud ents from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Program Director and Office USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 65 http://www.grad.usf.edu / of Graduate Studies, in the first semester enrolled in a doctor al program. Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to reg ister for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of this RC R requirement. Once the train ing is completed, the Registra tion hold will be lifted. Doctoral Minimum Hours The doctoral degree is earned on the basis of advancement to do ctoral candidacy status and satisfactory completion of the dissertation. The minimum number of credit h ours to earn the doctorate is 72, postbachelors, including dissertation. The min imum number of credit hours re quired for each individual doctorate program is noted in the degree requirements section of the Graduate Catalo g for that program listing. Some graduate programs may require more than 72 hours. Programs with formall y approved concentrations must have core major requirements that all stude nts must successf ully complete . Students must comply with general enrollment requirements and a lso institutional residen cy requirements. All doctoral students must have at least one gradable (AF) graduat e course taken at USF to satisfy the GPA minimum requirements. No undergraduate course may be used to satisfy th e gradable minimal course requirement for the doctoral degree. Lower level undergraduate courses may not be u sed to satisfy doctoral degree program requirements, but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the ov erall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. Time Limitations Doctoral degrees must be completed within seven (7) years from the student's original date of admission for doctoral study. All courses applied to the doctoral degree must be completed within seven (7) years, including courses taken 1) prior to admission to the U SF doctoral program, 2) taken as nondegree seeking, or 3) transferred in from other institutions. There is no time limitation for courses from a completed master 's degree used toward a doctoral degree. For students who are readmitted, see Readmission Policy. Typically, a student w ill reach candidacy within four years, but this may vary p er discipline. Time Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitatio n as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request f or an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.e du/studentforms.php . Requests must include the reasons for the de lay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate pr ogram, and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study denoting the pathway to completion and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree Note \u2014 for the time limit extension procedures, if the time lim it extension will cause courses taken within the degree program to be older than 10 years, then a request for co urse concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirements, per the time limit policy. If approved, the timelimit extension applies to courses applie d toward the degree, with the exception of those USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 66 http://www.grad.usf.edu / transferred in or from completed degree programs. However, prog rams may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the timelimit extension . For requests exceeding a year of additional time, the Office of Graduate Studies will audit the student's progres s each semester to ensure that the plan of study is adhered to and that progress towards degree completion is occur ring. Students who exceed the time limitations may have their registr ation placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one timelimit extension request is per mitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave for up to two years (see the section on Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section.) Note Time Limit Extensions ar e valid for a maximum period of two (2) years from the date of request. For more information and guidance, conta ct the Office of Graduate Studie s. Enrollment Requirements See Academic Policies Section Institutional Enrollment Requirement The majority of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota Manatee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degre e refer to the degree requirements in the program listing. Students are re sponsible for consulting with their degree program coordinator for information on courses that may be taken outside their graduate degree program , as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course transfer eligibility requi rements. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions (including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requirements. Major Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the Department (equivalent) to confirm the internal process and timeline for t he selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor student' s from the Department (or equivalent) and receive that person's agreement to serve as major professor. The select ion of the Major Professor must be approved and appointed by the department as soon as possible, but no later t han the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a ma jor professor in order to maint ain Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a Major Professor cannot be identified or in the event a Maj or Professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committ ee, the student is responsible for finding another Major Professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement Major Professor should confer with the Program Director for available options. If no other options exist the student may be requested to voluntar ily withdraw from the program or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and Major Professor should p lan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements spe cified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, should be m aintained in the student's de partment file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be from the student's home Department (or serves as a comajor professor with someone from the Department) Be graduate faculty*, as defined by the University, from the st udent's academic area Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or res earch activities and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements Be active in scholarly pursuits as evidenced by at least one re fereed publication in the last three years. Have been approved by the student 's Department Chair (or equiva lent) to serve as a Major Professor or CoMajor Professor. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 67 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Affiliate Graduate Faculty may se rve as a CoMajor Professor wi th a graduate faculty from the student's department. CoMajor Professors may be two graduate faculty or one graduate faculty and one approved Graduate Affiliate Faculty The membership of graduate facul ty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria mu st be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e., for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing and able t o continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a CoMajor Professor on the Commit tee and another graduate faculty from the student's Department is appointed as the other CoMajor Profess or. In the event that the other CoMajor is Affiliate Graduate Faculty, the faculty leaving the University may remain as a member, with another graduate faculty from within the student's Department appointed as the o ther CoMajor Professor. It is important that one of the CoMajor Professors be accessible on the university camp us for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis/dissertation. In the e vent a Major Professor is on t emporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Program Director to f acilitate the needs of the student. In some instances, a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this sit uation the faculty are approved as \"CoMajor Professors\" and jointly serve in that rol e. Consequently, both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committe e form, change of committee form, admission to candidacy, etc.) (Co) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Co mmittee Responsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php Doctoral Committees Some Colleges have a Program Committee comprised of graduate fa culty, who advise the s tudent from admission up to doctoral candidacy, when th e formal Doctoral Dissertation Committee is formed. As soon as an area of research is determined and a major professor is selected, a Doc toral Dissertation Committee will be appointed and approved for the student. The Department will request approval of the Doctoral Committee from the Dean of the College and, as needed, the Dean of the Office of Graduate Stud ies. Role of Doctoral Committees Depending on the College, either the Program Committee or the D octoral Dissertation Committee is responsible for approving the student's course of study grading the written comprehe nsive qualifying examination Doctoral Dissertation Committee Doctoral Dissertation Committees will, approve the plan for research supervise the research read and approve the dissertation, and conduct the dissertation defense. Member Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the University and the Coll ege/Department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate S tudies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a doctoral committee. Persons desiring to serv e on a committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) b y the University and the College/Department USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 68 http://www.grad.usf.edu / must submit a curriculum vitae and be approved by the Departmen t, College, and Office of Graduate Studies, for each committee. Committee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate graduate facu lty, as defined by the Un iversity Have the background and expertise that contributes to the succe ss of the student. In addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Facul ty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria mus t be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. Composition The Doctoral Dissertation Committ ee will consist of at least fo ur members the Major Professor must be from the student's department and a cademic area two additional members must come from the academic area (i.e. d iscipline) of the student at least one external member (from outside the Department, Scho ol, or equivalent, hosting the doctoral program, but may be w ithin the academ ic discipline) A minimum of two members, including the Major Professor, must b e from the student's Department and graduate faculty by definition Faculty holding joint or adjunct appointments in the degreegra nting academic unit (i.e. Department or equivalent) cannot be external members on a stude nt's committee. Approval Once a committee has been determined, a Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for origi nal signature. Check with the College for instructions and forms. To i nsure uniformity of excellence across the colleges, the (Co)Major Professor(s) of Doctoral Dissertation Committees will need to s ubmit a current curriculum vita (equivalent to an NIH Bio, approximately two pages long with the last three (3) years of scholarly activity included) with the committee appointment form to the College Dean or desi gnee. This approval is in addition to the approval from their department chairperson. (Colleges and depar tments may institute additional requirements for membership on Doctoral Dissertation Committees .) Once approved, the original form and the approved Curriculum Vitae (CV) are placed in the studen t's file. An approved and current Form must be on file in the program/college before graduation may be c e r t i f i e d . Doctoral Dissertation Committee Forms need to be processed as early i n the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. Changes to Committee Changes to a Doctoral Dissertatio n Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form . Check with the College for instruction s and forms. Original signature s of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co) Major Professor( s), must be on the for m. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co) Major Professor(s ) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as ack nowledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any nonf aculty being added to a committ ee must submit a CV for approval. If a faculty member is being added as a CoMajor Professor, or if th ere is an appointment change to the Major Professor position, a CV must be included for the faculty membe r who is being added to that position. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 69 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Change of Committee Forms should b e submitted for approval as s oon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. An approved and current Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form must be on file before graduation may be certified. Doctoral Qualifying Examination As soon as the substantial majority of the course work is compl eted, the student must pass a written qualifying examination covering the subject matter in the major and relate d fields. This examination may be supplemented by an oral examination. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in their discipline at the time they take the qualifying examination. If the exam is taken between semesters, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit i n the semester before or following the exam. Admission to Candidacy In order to be admitted to doctoral candidacy, students must me et the following requirements at USF: 1. admission to a doctoral program 2. appointment of a Doctoral Committee, 3. attainment of an overall and degr ee program Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidacy. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades , including \"IF\" and \"MF\", mus t be cleared before candidacy may be finalized. 4. successful completion of a qualifying examination 5. certification by the Doctoral Committee that the above qualific ations have been suc cessfully completed. The Admission to Candidacy form sh ould be submitted for approva l during the semester that the qualifying exams were completed, but no later than the semester following the su ccessful completion of the exam. The form will be approved by the Dean of the College and forwarded to the Dean o f the Office of Graduate Studies for final approval. Doctoral Candidacy is effective as of the day that t he Office of Graduate Studies approves of the request and changes the student's status to 6C. For procedures and proc essing deadlines refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website at www.grad.usf.edu . Once candidacy status is approved, students with approved candi dacy are eligible to enroll in dissertation hours (7980) in the semester that immediately follows the last busine ss day of the approval window. For example, students approved during the Fall approval window may enroll in the Spring. Students approved during the Spring approval window may enroll in the summer and students approved during the Summer approval window may enroll in the Fall. Students may NOT enroll in dissertation hours prior to being ad mitted to doctoral candidacy . Each degree program has a required number of dissertation hours for completion of the degree. Departments may, with College approval, apply Directed Research hours towar d the total number of dissertation hours required. Directed Research hours shall not exceed 50% of the d issertation hour requirement.

More information is available on the website at http://www.grad.usf.e du/ETDresmain.php Doctoral Dissertation Defense After the Doctoral Dissertation Committee has determined that t he final draft of the dissertation is suitable for presentation; the Committee will request the sched uling and announcement of the Dissertation Defense (also called Final Oral Examination or Ora l Defense.) Check with the College and Program for college and program specific procedures for this pr ocess. A copy of the announcement should be sent to the Office of Graduate Studies, preferably tw o weeks in advance of the defense date. The announcement must also be posted in a public forum for a mi nimum of twentyfour hours to comply with statute requirements for a public meeting. The student an d the Major Professor (or, if CoMajor Professors, at least one) must b e physically present at the def ense. The student must successfully defend the dissertation to be able to pr oceed and complete the final s ubmission process. Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair The Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) shal l be presided by an external committee member from outside the Department, Schoo l, or equivalent, hosting the doctoral program, but may be w ithin the academ ic discipline. OR, a noncommittee member (a.k.a. Outside Chair), (Refer to the in dividual Program's Degree Requirements in the Graduate Catalog for information). If the Chair is from another institution, this individual must be approved for Affiliate Graduate Faculty stat us. The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair's role includes oversee ing the proceedings as well as serving as the student's advocate, by ens uring fairness of the process. F aculty holding joint, courtesy, or adjunct appointments in the degreegranti ng academic unit (i.e. Departm ent or equivalent) cannot serve as the Defense Chair. Procedures for Conducting the Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Fi nal Oral Examination) 1. The Doctoral Dissertation defense (final oral examination) s hould be conducted within a timeline to allow for the student t o m a k e a n y n e c e s s a r y c o r r e c t ions following the defense and still meet the final copy deadline for turning in t he Dissertation to the Office of Graduate Studies. 2. The presentation should be co nsidered an important function in the Department and all graduate students and faculty be encouraged to attend. 3. The presentation and defense are open to the public and as s uch, must meet the requirements of the Sunshine Laws for the State of Florida. The Doctoral Dissertation Committee deliberation is not public. 4. The room selected for the exam ination should have adequate s eating with an alternate room selected in case of problems. 5. It is required that all members of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee be present for the examination unless an absence is approved prior to the defe nse taking place by the Office of Graduate Studies Dean. In the event that a member can not attend in person, participation is permissible via s peakerphone or video conferen ce. A minimum of three USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 8 University Degree R equirements 72 http://www.grad.usf.edu / members, including the Major Professor is required to proceed w ith the defense. If a noncommittee member (Outside Chair) chairs the Defense, this i ndividual does not count as one of the three required members in attendance. If a n unforeseeable situation arises that would prevent compliance with this requir ement the Major Professor or Doctoral Dissertatio n Defense Chair should contact the Office of Graduate Studies for guidance and approval to proceed with the defense. 6. The length of the examination period will generally not exce ed three hours. Throughout this time the Doctoral Dissertat ion Defense Chair is to be in c harge of all proceedings and, ideally, is expected to play a balancing role between advo cacy and contention. 7. The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair, at any time during the course of the examination, may request all visitors to leave. 8. Presentation The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair should open the proceed ings by introducing the candi date and the Do ctoral Dissertation Committ ee. The examination should begin wit h a presentation by the candida te designed to summarize the dissertation. 9.

Each degree program will be assigned a CIP code and included in the State University System Academic Degree Program Inventory. Example: Doctor o f Philosophy (Ph.D.) Graduate Program (Major) Reference: BOG Regulation 6C8.011 http://www.flbog.edu/documents_re gulations/regulations/8_011New %20Program%20Auth_reg%20final%20clea n.pdf An organized curriculum offered as a major area of study that i s part of an existing or proposed degree program and does not constitute sufficie nt distinct coursework, faculty , and instructional resources to be considered a separate degree program. A Program Major must be reasonably ass ociated with the degree program under which it is offered and share common core or prerequisite courses wit h other majors within the same degree program. A Program Major will not be assigned a CIP Code, will not be incl uded in the State University System Academic Degree Program Inventory, and w ill not be recognized as a stand alone degree program at the University. The number of credit hours for a Program Major will be established by the University for each degree level. Example: Curriculum and Instruction Concentration (approved by Graduate Council 3/15/10) A Concentration is a coordinated set of courses in conjunction with examinations, thesis and/or dissertation, sub curriculum that is applicable to one or more existing graduate programs. The total number of credit hours must not equal or exceed the number of credit hours established for the Degree Program(s). Concentrations must be approved by the Department (or equivalent), College, and Gradua te Council. Concentra tions are listed on a student's transcript, but not on the diploma.

Women's and Gender Studies * Partially online **Fully online Graduate Certificate Policies The areas of study for the Graduate Certificates are created wi thin the mission of graduate education. Students will be awarded certificates upon completion of specific course work, which has been approved by the Graduate Council. The Graduate Certificate is not defined as a degree by the Office of Graduate Studies; rather, it is a focused collection of courses that, when completed, affords the s t u d e n t s o m e r e c o r d o f d i s t i n c t a c a d e m i c accomplishment in a given discipline or set of related discipli nes. Moreover, the Graduate Certificate is not viewed as a guaranteed means of entry into a graduate degree program. While the courses comprising a graduate certificate may be used as evide nce in support of a student's a pplication for admission to a degree program, the certificate itself is not con sidered to be a prerequisite. Process of Approval for New Graduate Certificates Proposals for new areas of study for graduate certificates are created and submitted by the academic unit that wishes to offer such a certificate. Proposals must be accompan ied by endorsement from the department heads and deans of the colleges/schools in which the contributing cou rse work is offered as well as from the academic unit or units whose students or degree programs could be impact ed by the creation of the graduate certificate. The Graduate Council will consider all the proposals for new gr aduate certificates to assu re proposal guidelines have been followed and that repetition and redundancy across ar eas of study for certificates are not evident. Those meeting the criteria set f orth by the Graduate Council wi ll then be recommended to the Provost for approval. Criteria for Approval The general principles applied to the assessment of the academi c quality of proposals for new graduate areas of study for certificates include: 1. The proposed sequence of course work must offer a clear and app ropriate educational objective at the postbaccalaureate level. 2. The proposed curriculu m will achieve its ed ucational objective in an efficient and welldefined manner. 3. A perceived need for such a certificate should exist. This prov ision might be defined in terms of either external markets (i.e., extern al demand for the skills associat ed with such a certificate) or internal academic means (i.e., the need for a critical mass of students in a given discipline). 4. An appropriate number of credit hours must comprise the area of study for the certificate. The number of graduate credits cannot be less than nine (9) or more than one half of the credits necessary for a related master's degree from the Office of Graduate Studies. 5. If the area of study for a certificate requires new courses, th ose courses must b e approved by the appropriate College bodies or o ffices and the Graduate Council. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 11 Graduate Certifica tes 100 http://www.grad.usf.edu / Student Eligibility and Admission Criteria Students must apply and be accept ed into the Graduate Certifica te to be eligible to receive a certificate. The prerequisites a nd general criteria of eligibility f or admission to any graduate c ertificate area of study include: 1. An earned baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from a regiona lly accredited college or unive rsity or enrollment in a USF fiveyear academic program is required. Students in fiveye ar academic programs may be admitted upon completion of 120 semester hours. 2. Each Graduate Certificate specifi es the requirements for admiss ion, including minimum grade point average, standardized test scores, and ot her similar criteria as part of the application. However, prospective nondegree seeking graduate certificate stu dents must meet University grad uate admissions grade point average requirements. Students who wish to pursue a Gra duate Certificate must apply t o the Graduate Certificate Office (http://www.usf.edu/innovativeeduc ation/programs/graduatecerti ficates/) and be admitted to the Graduate Certificate. Students are encour aged to contact the coordinator prior to applying. NonDegree Seeking Students All nondegree seeking students who wish to pursue approved gra duate certificates should apply for admission to the Certificate through the Graduate Certificate Office as s oon as possible for maximum benefit, but must apply to the Certificate and complete required coursework withi n five years of taking the first course applicable to the certificate. Students mu st submit a Completion Form for the Graduate Certificate to be awarded. Degree Seeking Students o All degree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduat e certificates must apply for admission to the Graduate Certificate through the Graduate Certificate Offic e. The application must be received prior to conferral of the degr ee that includes the same coursework. Students who have completed all coursework must apply for admis sion to the certificate and submit a Completion Form prior to the deadline to apply for graduation b y the fourth week of the semester in which the student plans to graduate. o Degree seeking students who are pursuing a Graduate Certificate in a discipline outside of their graduate degree program (major) must appl y for admission to the Graduate C e r t i f i c a t e t h r o u g h t h e G r a d u a t e Certificate Office). The application must be received prior to the deadline to apply for graduation (by the fourth week of the s emest er) in which the student plans to grad uate. Required coursework for the certificate must be completed within five years of taking the f irst course applicable to the certificate. Students must submit a Completion Form for the certificate to b e awarded. 3. Certificateseekingstudents not currently enrolled in a degree granting graduate program, will be admitted into a separate classification within th e University, and will be clas sified as \"Graduate Certifica te Students.\" This separate classification will permit the University to monitor statistica l and enrollment data for certi ficate areas of study, and will allow inclusion of such eff orts in the annual reports and academic planning. The Gradua te Certificate Office will note successful completion of a c ertificate on the student's tr anscript upon completion. 4. Students pursuing a graduate cer tificate are required to meet t he same academic requirements as those defined for degreeseeking students to r emain in \"good standing\". 5. All graduate certificate student s may apply one graduate course to two graduate certificates. 6. All graduate certificate student s must meet all prerequisites f or courses in which they wish to enroll. 7. Should a graduate certificate st udent subsequently apply and be accepted to a degreegranting program, the University's Transfer of Credit Policy applies. It is up to th e Program to determine the number of credits that may be transferred in from the Graduate Certificate into the Graduate Program, up to the 49% limit s specified in the transfer of credit policy. Any applicatio n of such credit must be approv ed by the degreegranting college and must be appropriate to the program. See the Transfer of Credit Policy for more information.

Mission Statement : The College of Arts and Sciences is a community of scholars dedicated to the idea that educated people are the basis of a just and free society. The essences of education are a capacity for the appreciation of social change within a context of prior human achievement. The faculty of the Arts and Sciences strive to instill in their students a history of human ideas, a love of learning, and an understanding of the means that scholars have used in their search for beauty and order in the natural world. The education provided by the disciplines of the Arts and Sciences is the foundation upon which the lives and professions of our students are built, and the basis from which personal growth occurs. The College of Arts and Sciences takes as its goal a melding of the natural, humanistic and social philosophies into a comprehensive whole that encourages the development of new ideas and new approaches to the understanding of our universe. It is the responsibility of scholars to share their discoveries for the betterment of society. Thus, the Arts and Sciences embrace the disciplines that strive to make immediate use of knowledge in the service of social goals as well as the disciplines whose discoveries contribute to the fund of basic information that is the stepping stone of applied knowledge.

USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 12 College of Arts and Sciences 108 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ About the Catalog The University of South Florida Graduate Catalog is organized with the degree programs offered listed in the section of the College that offers them. For example, the Master of Science degree with a \"program\" (also known as major) in Biology is listed in the College of Arts and Sciences section. Some colleges offer areas of specialization, or \"concentrations\" within a degree program. PROGRAMS BIOLOGY PROGRAM Master of Science (M.S.) Degree DEGREE INFORMATION CONCENTRATIONS Concentration Requirements are listed separately under each Program. The Program and Concentration are listed on the official transcript. Other areas, such as application tracks, are not listed on the transcript.

Faculty at USF specialize in various areas, including medical anthropology, biological anthropology, urban policy and community development, education, archaeology, cultural resource management (CRM), economic development, immigration, media, and issues pertaining to race, gender, and ethnicity. Geographic specializations emphasize the Caribbean, Latin America, SubSaharan Africa, Europe, and the United States. More than 240 graduates have received an education in anthropology and its practical uses, leading to employment in government and private sector agencies and organizations. For many, the MA is a terminal degree that qualifies them for professional careers in administration, program evaluation, planning, research, and cultural resource management. Others have gone on to earn doctoral degrees and have gained employment in academic or higher level nonacademic positions. Students entering the Master's program in Applied Anthropology at USF choose from one of four tracks: Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, or Medical Anthropology. Although these four tracks share some common requirements, and are bound by general rules of the USF Office of Graduate Studies, they have different curricula and employment trajectories. Archaeology Track graduates typically enter careers in contract archaeology, or public and private agencies and museums responsible for managing archaeological resources. The Cultural Anthropology Track is designed to lead to employment in diverse areas that include education, urban planning, human services, private sector consulting and research, and nongovernmental community organizations. Museum and heritage programming represent an area of overlap between the two emphases. Students who wish to pursue these kinds of specialties will develop curricula that draw from both applied and public archaeology requirements in consultation with their advisors. Biological Anthropology students are trained to work in law enforcement, private sector consulting and research, and nongovernmental organizations. The Medical Anthropology track prepares students to conduct research, evaluation, and consulting in a variety of settings, including community based organizations, county and state health departments, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition to following the curriculum of a track, M.A. students can select elective courses to fulfill one of four concentrations in Archaeological and Forensic Sciences, Bio cultural Medical Anthropology, Cultural Resource Management, or Heritage Studies.

For the doctoral/master's combination, students develop individual programs of study in consultation with an interdisciplinary academic advisory committee. The committee must approve the plan of study as well as the proposal to fulfill the thesis and dissertation requirements or dissertation and special project requirements through a single project. The two programs review applicants independently. After admission to both programs, the Graduate Admissions office instructs the Registrar's Office to classify the student as dually enrolled in Anthropology and Public Health. In choosing which program to apply to first, students should take into consideration the following: requirements in Anthropology for admission are different than in Public Health; admission to one program does not guarantee admission to the other; and of course, the student's interests and career plans. Upon completion of all requirements for the dual degree program, the student submits separate applications for graduation to Anthropology and Public Health, and is certified for graduation by both programs and receives two diplomas. Dual degree students can also select elective courses to fulfill a concentration in Biocultural Medical Anthropology.

Each Department has its own Chair and Graduate Director and offers students a Master of Science in Biology with a specific concentration associated with either CMMB or IB. There is no general Biology MS degree program. The CMMB and IB Departments are located in modern, wellequipped buildings. Research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in Interdisciplinary Science Building and the BioScience Faculty building (BSF), and most of the research within the IB Department is conducted by faculty housed in the Science Center building (SCA). Because of the interdisciplinary aspect of most research projects, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad training research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty within CMMB and IB are involved in cooperative research with their colleagues in Chemistry, Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often CMMB and IB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require handson experimental laboratories, both CMMB and IB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB and IB values high quality teaching at all levels of instruction. Research Assistant positions also are available to support research with specific faculty members depending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Office of Graduate Studies. Application to the Biology Program is through one of the two departments, with students selecting a formal Concentration. Refer to the Concentration listing in the Catalog for specific information and requirements.

Nonnative English speaking graduate students must score a minimum of at least 570 on the paper based test or a minimum total score of 79 on the internet based test on the TOEFL and at least 50 on the TSE to be eligible for a teaching assistantship. For acceptance into the IB Department, acceptance by a faculty member in IB is MANDATORY. IB encourages applicants to contact faculty via email to indicate an interest in the research being conducted in their laboratory. IB will make every effort to pair potential graduate students with appropriate faculty; however, it is recommended that applicants make direct contact with individual faculty. It is expected that candidates for the M.S. degrees will have completed courses equivalent to those required for the B.S. in Biology at U.S.F. Applying to the Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Students interested in attending graduate studies within the CMMB Department should visit the CMMB website that can be accessed from the main USF site and review the current CMMB faculty. It is recommended that potential students consider at least 23 CMMB faculty that they would be interested in working with and communicate this information in their letter of application. It is also recommended that potential students contact the CMMB Graduate Director as well as the individual faculty members they are interested in working with via email. Such communication will facilitate the assignment of the laboratory rotations that CMMB students will participate in during their first semester of residency and also allow the applicant to determine whether the desired faculty member has positions available in the laboratory. All students admitted to the Masters concentration in Cell Biology and Molecular Biology must establish a Graduate Supervisory Committee. The Graduate Committee shall constitute the major professor and at least two additional credentialed faculty. At least one of the committee members must be a faculty member at USF. Supervisory committee must be formed within two semesters after matriculation. Refer to Committee information in the University Requirements Section of the Catalog for more information. The CMMB Graduate Director, CMMB Chair, and the College Associate Dean (or designee) must approve the Graduate Committee. Once a major professor has been assigned and/or a student occupies or utilizes significant space or facilities for research or analogous scholarly activity directly pertinent to the generation of a thesis, the student shall enroll for two (2) hours of research credit each semester (other than summer semester), until eligible to enroll in thesis credits. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Biology (M.S.) 123 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Applying to the Department of Integrative Biology Students interested in attending graduate studies within the IB Department should contact potential major professors to communicate their research ideas and establish that the professor will consider the student's application.

This will prepare students to enter the emerging new technological workforce required to implement biomedical advances that will have a key impact on global health and yield significant societal advantages. The Program is a joint endeavor between the Moffitt Cancer Center and the University of South Florida. Tremendous advances in the detection and treatment of cancer has occurred through basic research and translational medicine, yet cancer continues to adversely affect millions of people worldwide in terms of quality of life, life span, and economic burden. The Moffitt Cancer Center located at the University of South Florida is a leading institution of basic research, clinical research, and patient treatment with a focused mission \"to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.\" The Moffitt Cancer Center is officially designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The Cancer Biology Ph.D. Program's goal is to train the next generation of cancer researchers. Studies of cancer require specific knowledge in multiple fields that have traditionally been independent. Our Cancer Biology Ph.D. program emulates the Moffitt Cancer Center and eliminates these boundaries. Students receive cancer oriented training in multiple areas include: molecular biology, immunology, functional genomics, bioinformatics, drug discovery & development, cancer genetics, cancer prevention & control, cancer therapeutics, cell biology, biochemistry, and proteomics.

No CRW courses will be allowed in the literature track. Only one practicum will be allowed to satisfy degree requirements (including ENC 6745). One Directed Study may be used to substitute for degree requirement with the approval of the Graduate Director. Portfolio and Defense 3 credits Three directed study hours to prepare portfolio. In their fourth and final semester (excluding summer terms), MA students will submit a portfolio for review to a twomember faculty committee six weeks prior to the Office of Graduate Studies deadline for thesis/dissertation submission. Upon submission, the student and chair of the committee will establish a defense date with the Graduate Program Specialist. The portfolio will contain the following: An introductory firstperson essay in which the student offers a selfevaluation of the contents of the portfolio and how it reflects his or her own process of revision, intellectual growth, plans for publication/dissemination, and professional development (minimum five pages, not to exceed fifteen). Two revised seminar papers 50006000 words in length, including appropriate MLA or Chicago Style documentation. o Papers should be developed under the direction of two different faculty members from the English Department, who then will form the committee for the defense. One member of the committee will serve as the chair, who will coordinate the circulation of the portfolio, the scheduling of the defense, and the submission of evaluation forms to the graduate director within specified deadlines. The portfolio will be reviewed and evaluated by this twomember faculty committee using the published assessment rubric. Members of the portfolio committee will be asked to work with the student to revise the papers she/he wrote for class. The goal is to get the papers into a form that might reasonably be published. Because this option is not a thesis, it does not have to be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies, and so it does not need to adhere to the Office of Graduate Studies deadlines. Defenses should be concluded two weeks before the end of classes. The whole portfolio, along with the revised papers and the introductory essay, should be circulated two weeks prior to the defense, to give committee members an opportunity to read it through. Oral Defense The committee chair convenes a meeting with the committee and student for 30 minutes; this oral examination provides the opportunity for faculty to question the student on various aspects of the portfolio, and it gives the student the opportunity to expand upon and refine ideas represented in writing. The defense also provides an opportunity for further suggestions on publication and revision. After 30 minutes, the committee will convene without the student to discuss a final assessment for the portfolio using the published rubric.

PROGRAM INFORMATION Geography is the study of the humanenvironment relationship either in a global or more regional context. Human Geography studies the construction of space, place, and power. It encompasses the study of economic geographies (e.g. globalization and development), political geographies (e.g. geopolitical struggles and new social movements), and social and cultural geographies (e.g. identities and exclusions). Human geography is key to providing insights into contemporary spatial arrangements, including the role of cities within the global economy, locating urbanrural intersections in the production of uneven development, and how class, gender, and race shape struggles for social justice. Environmental Geography links the study of nature and society and considers the ways in which conventional divisions between human and nonhuman (natural) worlds are bridged through the production of socionatures. This understanding is crucial to explaining and ameliorating contemporary environmental problems, including the privatization of natural resources, inequalities in access to food and water, injustices associated with environmental hazards and undesirable land uses, and the role of human activities in spurring largescale environmental change GI Science and Spatial Analysis concentrates on the use of advanced geospatial technologies, and the development and use of spatial analysis methodologies, to applied research problems in human and environmental geography. A thorough understanding of such geospatial technologies as Remote Sensing, GIS, and GPS, as well as modern methods of spatial statistical analysis and emerging spatial analytical techniques such as agentbased modeling, is a critical aspect of developing appropriate approaches to the analysis of geographic data.

EVR 7980 Doctoral Dissertation GEO 7980 Doctoral Dissertation GEO 6918 Directed Research Other Requirements and Information: Advising When a student is admitted to the Program, the student, with the assistance of the Graduate Director, will have an initial advisor based upon mutual interests of the student and faculty member. The role of the advisor is to guide the student in selecting appropriate coursework for his/her program of study and to work with the student in developing research ideas and an eventual dissertation topic. In consultation with his/her advisor, the student will select a committee that will serve not only as the student's dissertation committee, but as the qualifying exam committee as well (See procedures for Academic Progress for SGS PhD students). Policy for Taking Graduate Courses outside USF and the Tampa campus Graduate courses offered at other universities or other USF campuses can have a different focus than those offered on the USF Tampa campus. Students must get approval from their advisors and the Graduate Director prior to taking any outside courses to verify that these courses will count toward their degrees. Additionally, only faculty at the School of Geosciences Tampa campus can serve as the major professor/advisor for graduate students enrolled on the Tampa campus.

The core seminars, directed by a faculty member from one of the participating departments, will familiarize students with the literature, existing knowledge, and research approaches of the various fields of area studies and invited to acquaint students with faculty and their research. The purposes of the seminars are: to provide an interdisciplinary graduate experience to foster a community of scholars and learners focused on Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino experiences Students will also take a three (3) hour methodology course that acquaints them with particular research relevant to their major field of study and when possible, Latin America and/or the Caribbean. This includes special approaches to finding documentation from Latin America and the Caribbean; newlyavailable search tools available on the internet; and an overview of how disciplines utilize different research materials. Major With the concurrence of the ISLAC advisor, students will elect major and minor fields during their first semester. These fields will draw heavily on participating departments (e.g. Anthropology, History, Government and International Affairs, Art History). At that time the student will constitute a supervisory committee, made up of two professors from the major field and one from the minor field. The committee members will counsel the student and serve as members of the exam or thesis committees. A large number of courses are available to fulfill the major and minor field requirements. These are listed separately and change somewhat from year to year. Departments who frequently work with ISLAC are Anthropology, Government and International Affairs, Sociology, Mass Communication, Geography, Social Work, Women's and Gender Studies, Global Health, Philosophy, Economics, History, World Languages, Humanities and American Studies, Art History, Africana Studies and Education. Students may also request to have courses from other departments count toward major or minor fields. Electives Students can take one elective from outside the major and minor fields, in order to complement their core studies. These might be technical courses, study abroad courses, internships, math and science courses, methodology, or another unrelated field. In all cases, students must justify their elective hours and receive approval from their committees. In addition, students opting for the nonthesis track must take one more course in each of their major and minor fields (2 courses total). Students considering teaching in community colleges are encouraged to take more classes in their major field. Comprehensive Exam All nonthesis candidates must pass a six (6) hour comprehensive written exam of three questions, which will be composed and graded by the committee. The Thesis serves in lieu of the comps for thesis students.

Code: BIO Program (Major/College): MIC AS Approved: 1973 Also offered as an Accelerated Program (BS/MS) in Microbiology CONTACT INFORMATION College: Arts and Sciences Department: Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology (CMMB) Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu PROGRAM INFORMATION The M.S. in microbiology degree is administered by the Department of Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Microbiology (CMMB). Most research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in the BioScience Facility building (BSF). Due to the interdisciplinary aspect of most Research projects, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad ranging research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty within CMMB are involved in cooperative research with their colleagues in Chemistry, Integrative Biology, Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often CMMB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require handson experimental laboratories, CMMB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB values high quality teaching at all levels of support. Research Assistant positions may also be available to support research with specific faculty members depending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Office of Graduate Studies. Applying to the Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Students interested in attending graduate studies within the CMMB Department should visit the CMMB website that can be accessed from the main USF site and review the current CMMB faculty. It is recommended that potential students consider at least 23 CMMB faculty that they would be interested in working with and communicate this information in their letter of USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Microbiology (M.S.) 231 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ application. It is also recommended that potential students contact the CMMB Graduate Director as well as the individual faculty members they are interested in working with via email. Such communication will facilitate the assignment of the laboratory rotations that CMMB students will participate in during their first semester of residency and also allow the applicant to determine whether the desired faculty member has positions available in the laboratory. All students admitted to the Masters in Microbiology must establish a supervisory committee. The supervisory committee shall constitute the major professor and at least two additional credentialed faculty. At least one of the committee members must be a faculty member at USF. Supervisory committee must be formed within two semesters after matriculation. The CMMB Graduate Director and CMMB Chair must approve the Supervisory Committee. Once a major professor has been assigned and/or a student occupies or utilizes significant space or facilities for research or analogous scholarly activity directly pertinent to the generation of a thesis, the student shall enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of research credit each semester (other than summer semester), until eligible to enroll in thesis credits.

USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Microbiology (M.S.) 234 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Accelerated nonthesis BS/MS program in Microbiology This program allows B.S. majors in Microbiology to take graduate courses for the elective part of the Microbiology degree and apply them to a nonthesis M.S. degree in Microbiology. Successful students will be able to earn the M.S. degree in two additional semesters beyond the completion of the B.S. degree. This accelerated program shares 12 credits between already existing degrees/concentrations: B.S. in Microbiology M.S in Microbiology (NT) Target students and expected outcomes This program will appeal to the more competitive Microbiology majors who would benefit professionally from having the M.S. when they enter the job market but do not want to commit to the longer time a thesis M.S. or a Ph.D. program takes to complete. Professions that do not require bench laboratory experience but desire the broadened knowledge base are targeted. Graduates from this program would be ideally suited for health professions, technology based industry, education and government. We also expect that some students will be interested in doctoral education in the biological or biomedical areas. Description and Requirements Microbiology majors who have completed the following courses may apply to this program: PCB 3023 Cell Biology PCB 3063 Graduate Degree Requirements Students admitted into the M.S. portion of the program must complete all the requirements for the M.S. degree (nonthesis) within three semesters of admission. The requirement is 30 hours of graduate work with at least 16 of these hours completed at the 6000 level; 26 hours must be formally structured courses; and at least 15 hours must be in CMMB courses. Students will be required to take 3 core courses from the list below as part of these 26 hours. Of the required 26 hours, 9 hours will be derived from the coreCMMB graduate courses listed below (see associated curriculum). These requirements can be partially met by up to 12 hours of graduate courses taken as undergraduates. Any graduate class taken outside of CMMB must be approved by the CMMB Graduate Director. Students should be aware that a B grade or better is required for every graduate class applied to the MS portion of their degree. In addition, students will be required to pass an oral qualifying exam based on a review paper submitted in their final semester. Students must form a committee as part of their action plan to complete their graduate work. This committee will be comprised of at least 3 CMMB faculty, and will serve as the examination committee for the review paper required as part of the MS portion of their degree. Upon approval of that paper, students must successfully complete a comprehensive oral exam by their committee. Timeline and benchmarks: 1. Completion of prerequisite upper division courses and application to the accelerated program. Typically, students will be in their junior year. 2. Acceptance into the program and an action plan within a semester of application. 3. Students will take up to 12 credits of graduate credit in CMMB courses following acceptance into the program. Typically, these courses will be taken in the latter half of the junior year and in the senior year. BioAdvise will monitor the progress of the students and ensure they follow their action plan. Students who do not complete at least 9 hours of graduate work by graduation will be dropped from the accelerated M.S. program. 4. GRE exams will be taken in a timely manner so scores will be available for admission to the M.S. portion of the program. Students who do not complete the GRE in time will not be admitted to the accelerated M.S. program. 5. Students must apply for admission to the M.S. portion of the program in a timely manner (Fall admission deadline is February 15, Spring deadline is August 1). 6. Students admitted to the accelerated program must form a committee prior to the beginning of their first semester in the M.S. portion of the program and must continue to follow the action plan which will be monitored by BioAdvise. 7.

MPA Concentration PROGRAM INFORMATION The Public Administration Program offers a multidisciplinary course of study leading to the Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.). The M.P.A. degree is designed primarily to prepare students for successful leadership roles and management careers in the public (i.e., governmental and quasigovernmental organizations) and nonprofit sectors. Students enrolled in the M.P.A. Program pursue careers in local, state, or federal agencies of government, nonprofit organizations, and special service districts. Additionally, the M.P.A. degree prepares individuals for further academic study leading to a doctorate in Public Administration, a Ph.D. in Public Policy and Administration, as well as a variety of other disciplines. Those employed in public management positions may wish to pursue the M.P.A. in order to broaden educational backgrounds to prepare for increased job responsibilities, or to change career paths. Such inservice students currently make up the majority of the M.P.A. student body. The Public Administration Program also offers courses of study leading to a Graduate Certificate in Public Management (G.C.P.M.), and Graduate Certificate in Nonprofit Management (G.C.N.M.). These programs are designed for individuals who wish to acquire knowledge of public and nonprofit management theory and practices, but who do not find it necessary or feasible to pursue the M.P.A. degree. The M.P.A. Program also serves preservice students who have recently completed a bachelor's degree, who wish to gain entry to a professional career track. Students admitted to the M.P.A. are not eligible for the Graduate Certificate in Public Management. Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools; the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA).

A letter from the major professor is required to remove a student from probation after he/she regains a 3.00 average. Department may waive some of the course requirements for those students who have taken equivalent course work at another institution. Comprehensive Examination Graduation from the Master's program also requires the completion of both written and oral examinations. For the nonthesis option, there is no language or thesis requirement for the M.A. degree. Written Comprehensive Examination The written exam is designed to cover material presented during the first year of graduate work. The purpose of the exam is to make sure the students have reviewed their first year's work before starting the second year and to point out weaknesses which should be overcome during their second year in order to graduate. Students are expected to pass this exam in at most two attempts. More specifically, the material for the above examination will be taken primarily from the following sequences of courses Semester 1: STA 5166 Statistical Methods I and STA 5326 Mathematical Statistics I; Semester 2: STA 6167 Statistical Methods II and MAT 6326 Mathematical Statistics II, and STA 6208 Linear Statistical Models. A. Nonthesis Option At least 30 hours of Statistics and Mathematics graduate courses. Specifically: (A) The Statistics and Mathematics graduate courses of 5000 level or higher, offered regularly for statistics and mathematics majors from our department are counted towards the 30 hours requirement. (B) Up to 6 hours of 4000 level or higher courses, taken from our department or other departments at USF, may be counted towards the 30 hours requirement with approval by the Statistics Faculty. (C) Completing at least 3 hours of Research Project work which is counted towards the 30 credithours requirement. Taking the course MAT 5912 - Research Project (NonThesis Option) and presenting a paper exemplifying the creative component of the degree program. This may be, but is not restricted to, a literature review, a report of independent research, design and (or) analysis of a sample survey or experiment, a report on consulting with research workers outside the department, or a report on the construction of a computer program requiring statistical numerical analysis. Taking the sequences Statistical Methods and Mathematical Statistics with at least a \"B\" average for each sequence. Passing one Qualifying Exam on Statistical Methods or Math Statistics at master's level. Under this degree option, the student is required to present a paper representing the creative component of the degree program. This may be, but is not restricted to, a literature review, a report of independent research, the design and (or) analysis of a sample survey or experiment, a report on consulting with research workers outside the department, or a report on the construction of a computer program requiring statistical numerical analysis. B. Thesis Option Student's Graduate Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty, appointed by the program director/departmental chairperson and approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Statistics (M.A.) 279 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ At least 30 hours of stat and math graduate courses (see above for details). Taking the sequences Statistics Methods and Mathematical Statistics with at least a \"B\" average for each sequence. At least 6 hours in MAT 6971, Master's Thesis, only 6 hours of which are counted in the 30 hours requirement. Oral Defense of the Thesis Final Submission of Approved Thesis. Under this degree option, six (6) research credits may be applied to the total of 30 required on the student's program of study. These reductions are made to allow the student sufficient time to complete a formal master's thesis. A master's thesis is a scholarly composition that demonstrates the ability of the author to do independent and creative work. It explores in some depth a problem or issue related to the major field of study. Although considerable variations in format and style are acceptable, precise expression, logical construction, and meticulous attention to detail are essential. A thesis in statistics should deal with some aspect of statistical methodology or theory, or the development of statistical models for a class of problems related to a scientific question. While most theses will include a case study or example that involves scientific data, the analysis of a particular data set does not, alone, constitute the level of scholarly accomplishment required for a thesis.

ABA provides an approach for developing, implementing, and evaluating practical strategies to produce changes in socially significant behaviors of individuals in the context of community settings. Three important features characterize the scientific basis upon which ABA is built: a) it focuses upon objectively measurable behavior of individuals; b) it studies environmental influences upon the targeted behaviors; and c) it places a premium upon singlesubject research designs to analyze the effects of different environmental variables. The 41credithour master's degree in ABA is in the department of Child and Family Studies in the College of Behavioral and Community Sciences is fully online. Students demonstrate knowledge of behavioral principles and procedures in courses that constitute a core curriculum, demonstrate applied behavior analysis skills through supervised practicum experiences, and complete a data based casestudy. The master's degree program is designed to prepare students to meet the standards to be Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs). It will prepare them for employment in a variety of fields where there are growing demands for competent professionals with expertise in applied behavior analysis. Philosophy The systematic analysis and application of behavioral principles is an extensive repertoire of professional behaviors. In the USF ABA program, these skills are acquired as students move through the sequenced curriculum of coursework and practicum experiences. The curriculum requires application of behavior analytic principles, with direct supervision by faculty and BCBA supervisors. Students participate in practicum training in community agencies under the supervision of BCBAs. In addition to the 1025 hours of behavior analysis practice they complete in their practicum sites each week, students also participate in practicum seminars each semester. In these seminars, the instructor discusses important practice issues and facilitates student discussion of their applied work. The supervision of the students' case study research rests in the hands of the onsite supervisor and designated core faculty member. Onsite supervisors and ABA faculty serve as mentors for the students by closely supervising their case study research and their progress through the program. Therefore, as students are mentored by their onsite supervisor and USF professors during the program, a meaningful supervisor student relationship is essential.

Degree (Thesis Program) DEGREE INFORMATION Program Admission Deadlines: Fall: February 15 Spring: n/a BC 2000 CONTACT INFORMATION College: Behavioral & Community Sciences Department: Child and Family Studies (CFS) Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu PROGRAM INFORMATION The master's degree program in applied behavior analysis (ABA) is designed to meet growing needs in Florida and nationally for practitioners who can work effectively in the fields of developmental disabilities, autism, education, child protective services, child behavior disorders, rehabilitation, mental health, and business and technology. ABA provides an approach for developing, implementing, and evaluating practical strategies to produce changes in socially significant behaviors of individuals in the context of community settings. Three important features characterize the scientific basis upon which ABA is built: a) it focuses upon objectively measurable behavior of individuals; b) it studies environmental influences upon the targeted behaviors; and c) it places a premium upon singlesubject research designs to analyze the effects of different environmental variables. The 44credithour master's degree in ABA is in the department of Child and Family Studies in the College of Behavioral and Community Sciences. Students demonstrate knowledge of behavioral principles and procedures in courses that constitute a core curriculum, demonstrate applied behavior analysis skills through supervised practicum experiences, and complete a data based thesis. The master's degree program is designed to prepare students to meet the standards to be Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs). It will prepare them for employment in a variety of fields where there are growing demands for competent professionals with expertise in applied behavior analysis. Philosophy The systematic analysis and application of behavioral principles is an extensive repertoire of professional behaviors. In the USF ABA program, these skills are acquired as students move through the sequenced curriculum of coursework and practicum experiences. The curriculum requires application of behavior analytic principles, with direct supervision by faculty and BCBA supervisors. Students participate in practicum training in community agencies under the supervision of BCBAs. In addition to the 1025 hours of behavior analysis practice they complete in their practicum sites each week, students also participate in practicum seminars each semester. In these seminars, the Practicum Coordinator discusses important practice issues and facilitates student discussion of their applied work. The supervision of the students' research theses rests in the hands of designated core faculty members (i.e., \"major professors\"). Major Professors serve as mentors for the students by closely supervising their research and their progress through the program. Therefore, as students are mentored by their major professors during the program, a meaningful major professor student relationship is essential.

GRE Scores on the general subtests Specific Procedures The primary assumption underlying admission to the M.A. program is that every student accepted is capable (a) of successfully completing his or her respective program and (b) of performing competently in the field as an Applied Behavior Analyst. Applicants are selected based on their potential to benefit from the program and their potential to contribute both to the Program and the field of Applied Behavior Analysis. Within the admissions process, a culturally diverse student body is actively recruited, and applicants of academic and professional promise are not systematically excluded on the basis of race, ethnic origin, gender, age, religion, lifestyle, sexual orientation, or physical handicap. The admissions process is selective, but flexibleall pertinent data submitted for consideration will be evaluated as an entire package. The evaluation process, however, does involve both academic and interpersonal considerations. The profession of Applied Behavior Analysis requires that the practitioner possess personal characteristics as well as academic and technical competencies, and the admissions process attempts to evaluate both these areas. Admission to the program is based on past academic work; coursework in ABA, a CV outlining relevant work, volunteer, and extracurricular experience in applied behavior analysis; letters of recommendation; and a statement of ABA interests, and professional goals. Students may apply, after conferral or anticipated conferral of their Bachelor's degree. Applications should be submitted by February 15 to be considered for application in the following fall term. Late applications will be considered if space in the program is available. For further Admissions Information, please visit Graduate Admissions.

CONTACT INFORMATION College: Behavioral & Community Sciences Department: School of Social Work (SOK) Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu PROGRAM INFORMATION The School of Social Work offers a program leading to a Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) degree. The program is fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. A dualdegree program is available with Public Health/Maternal and Child Health or Behavioral Health. The primary objective of the program is preparation of the graduate for professional social work practice through acquisition of specialized knowledge and skills necessary for clinical practice with individuals, families, and groups. The secondary objectives of the M.S.W. program are: 1. to prepare students academically for pursuit of doctoral education in social work or related human service disciplines or professions; 2. to contribute to the needed supply of professionally educated clinical social workers in the Tampa Bay area, the state, the region, and the nation. The M.S.W. program offers a specialized course of study in direct clinical practice. The program offers students a core curriculum, plus electives, and a supervised field experience designed to produce professionals with individual, family, and group practice skills. M.S.W. graduates are prepared to engage in advanced clinical social work practice. As such, it is our goal that by completion of the program, students will be prepared: 1. To become advanced social work practitioners who integrate the knowledge, skills , and values of the profession so they are able to conduct evidenceinformed practice effectively and ethically with individuals, groups, families, organizations, and communities ranging from local to global levels. 2. To engage in addressing the needs of vulnerable, oppressed, and underserved populations and to promote university community partnerships that strengthen communities and further social and economic justice. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 20162017 Social Work (MSW) 334 http://www.usf.edu/cbcs/ 3. To further the development of social policies and social service delivery systems that are effective in meeting the needs of individuals and communities at localglobal levels and that are in concert with values of the social work profession. 4. To contribute to the body of knowledge regarding theory and skills that is critical to the practice of effective social work and the vitality of the profession. 5. To engage in the pursuit of professional lifelong learning, which may include advanced education preparation necessary to sustain professional competency. The M.S.W. program places great emphasis on standards of professional behavior and ethics in the practice of social work. Entrance into the M.S.W. program does not guarantee graduation from the program. Students admitted to the M.S.W. program must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0, in all social work courses, with no grade below \"B\" counting toward graduation. Failure to maintain the specified GPA or to exhibit responsible professional behavior determined by the School may result in suspension or dismissal from the program. Courses with grades below \"B\" must be repeated before progressing to the next sequence. Students must pass the comprehensive paper during the last semester in order to graduate from the program. Students may pursue the M.S.W. program on either a full or parttime basis. Both programs consist of 60 semester hours of study. Students should check directly with the School of Social Work for applications and timelines. The fulltime program takes four semesters to complete; the parttime program lasts for 8 consecutive semesters. The program offers graduates from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited BSW program (within 5 years) the option of applying for advanced standing. Students qualify by receiving \"B\" or better grades in the undergraduate social work courses that equate to the MSW foundation courses. (Students do not qualify with \"B\" grades in these courses). Both the full and parttime programs are heavily sequenced and students must stay in sequence.

Code: DEA Program (Major/College): BUD BA Effective date Summer 2014 CONTACT INFORMATION College: Business Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu PROGRAM INFORMATION The DBA program offered by the Muma College of Business provides its graduates with the skills needed to conduct rigorous research with the objective of applying the findings to realworld decisionmaking in industry and government. The Program provides for intellectual growth as students work closely with faculty in seminars, research projects, and other assignments that develop their research skills and ability to communicate their findings to a broad audience of both practitioners and researchers. It also offers students the opportunity to develop a portfolio of skills that, when combined with the extensive experience that they bring into the program, uniquely qualifies them to serve in clinical faculty positions. The curriculum is designed to build upon the breadth of business understanding that they have previously achieved as successful executives. This is achieved by offering substantive coverage of a broad variety of qualitative and quantitative research techniques and by allowing students the flexibility to focus more deeply on their personal areas of interest during the dissertation phases of the program. The degree conferred is a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), a terminal degree sonamed to differentiate it from the Ph.D. degree that specifically focuses on preparing students for an academic research career within a specific discipline. Students will complete the 3year program in a cohort with other executives. Classes are scheduled all day for two consecutive days approximately one weekend a month for six 5month semesters. Each semester is divided into 2 quarters, with a one month break between semesters. Facetoface classes are heavily supplemented by online activities between facetoface classes. The weekend format allows participants to continue carrying their careers while they master a range of applied research skills.

They fall into three categories. The first are designed to develop the student's quantitative and qualitative research skills, and to provide opportunities to practice these skills in real world contexts. These required courses consist of: GEB 7557 Research and Writing Skills for Doctoral Students 3 credits QMB 6375 Applied Linear Statistical Models 3 credits QMB 7565 Introduction to Research Methods 3 credits QMB 7566 Applied Multivariate Statistical Methods 3 credits GEB 7911 Qualitative Research Methods in Business 3 credits The second category is intended to provide students with exposure to research in the multidisciplinary topics that represent the current areas of focus of the Muma College of Business. These required courses consist of: MAN 6726 Strategic Business Analysis 3 credits ISM 7406 Business Analytics 3 credits GEB 7XXX Creativity and Innovation 3 credits GEB 6457 Ethics, Law and Sustainable Business Practices 3 credits The final category is proposed by faculty members based upon their areas of interest and expertise as well as student interests. Two of the following courses would be offered so as to provide exposure to a variety of researchrelated topics and activities. ACG 7936 Seminar on Special Topics in Accounting 3 credits FIN 7930 Selected Topics in Finance 3 credits ISM 7930 Selected Topics in MIS 3 credits MAN 6930 Selected Topics 3 credits MAR 7931 Seminar on Selected Marketing Topics 3 credits Publication Courses 9 Credits These courses are offered during the first three semesters of the program and have a substantial distance learning and collaboration component between class meetings, with members of the cohort being required to peer review each other's work and make revisions. They represent an extension of previous courses, and require the students to create publishable documents, such as journal, conference and book chapter submissions. Depending upon the particular publication project, each course will have one of the following designations: ACG 6915 Directed Research 3 credits GEB 6930 Selected Topics 3 credits FIN 7915 Directed Research 3 credits ISM 7931 Directed Research 3 credits MAN 6911 Directed Research 3 credits MAR 6916 Directed Research 3 credits Issues Courses 10 Credits These courses are offered starting in the fourth semester of the Program, and are intended to run in parallel with proposal and dissertation activities. Although meeting according to the same schedule as regular courses, issues courses offer fewer credits than regular or publication courses, and therefore have commensurately reduced outside workloads to avoid interfering with the dissertation process. Members of the cohort select the topics from a list of proposals made by faculty members and other members of the cohort. Students may also elect to facilitate issues courses under the direction of a faculty supervisor, who acts as the instructor of record. Depending on the topic being taught, these courses may be any of the following: USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Business Administration (D.B.A.) 364http://www.coba.usf.edu ACG 7939 Executive Issues in Accounting 2 credits FIN 7939 Executive Issues in Finance 2 credits GEB 7939 Executive Issues in Business 2 credits ISM 7939 Executive Issues in MIS 2 credits MAN 7939 Executive Issues in Management 2 credits MAR 7939 Executive Issues in Marketing 2 credits QMB 7939 Executive Issues in Operations Research and Operations Management 2 credits With the approval of the DBA Program Committee, students may be permitted to substitute up to four (4) credits of independent study/directed research (e.g., ACG 7905, MAR 7910) for selected issues courses during their final year of the program. Dissertation Proposal Course 4 Credits The proposal course is offered during the student's fourth semester. It requires the student be matched to a four (4) person Dissertation Committee and submit a dissertation proposal for approval by the Committee. For the purpose of the DBA program, the course requirements for both dissertation and doctoral project proposals are the same. Prior to the proposal course, students will take the university mandated qualifying exam, whose results will be assessed by the DBA Committee. Proposal courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. GEB 7981 Dissertation Preparation 4 credits Qualifying Exam and Doctoral Candidacy Per University Policy, students must be enrolled in a minimum of 2 graduate credit hours in the semester of the exam. For DBA students, this requirement will be met as part of the normal course load. Before a student enrolled in the DBA program can be admitted to doctoral candidacy, the following University requirements must be met: appointment of a Dissertation Committee, attainment of an overall and degree program Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidacy. (All \"I\" and \"M\" grades, including \"IF\" and \"MF\", must be cleared before candidacy may be finalized.) successful completion of a qualifying examination certification by the Dissertation Committee that the above qualifications have been successfully completed. Dissertation/Doctoral Project 16 Credits Students are required to complete a dissertation or doctoral project, as approved by his or her committee. Dissertation Dissertation courses are offered every quarter throughout the student's last year, upon satisfactory completion of at least 44 course credits, four (4) proposal credits, and Admission to Doctoral Candidacy. These courses require the student to work towards the completion of the Dissertation approved by his or her committee. Because the DBA degree is designed to be responsive to the needs of the Candidate, there is some flexibility in the form that the Dissertation can take\u2014subject to approval by the Committee. University policy allows for two variations in the format: 1. A traditional research dissertation 2. Collection of articles/papers The Candidate will meet with members of the Committee during each residency of the final year of the program, and will present his or her dissertation to the Committee in the final semester of the Program. Upon successful completion of the dissertation defense presentation, the Dissertation Committee will then approve the awarding of the Degree, subject to all remaining program requirements being met, including submission of the Dissertation to the Office of Graduate Studies.

This includes 21 hours of dissertation. A minimum of 45 hours of coursework must be completed at the University of South Florida. Foundation Courses These courses are designed to develop an appreciation of the institution of business and to help students see how their areas of specialization fit into this general picture. With the approval of the student's program committee, a student may satisfy these requirements in any of the following ways: A. By completing an undergraduate degree in business at an AACSB accredited institution, with an average of \"B\" or better in the last 60 hours, no more than 5 years prior to admission to the Ph.D. program. B. By completing an M.B.A. degree at an AACSB accredited institution, no more than 5 years prior to admission to the Ph.D. program C. By completing one approved course with a grade of \"B\" or better in each of the functional areas: Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Management, and Marketing. All graduatelevel courses at the 6000 level or above, with the exception of specific \"tool\" courses (e.g. statistics), will count toward this requirement. D. By successfully petitioning the doctoral Program Committee to accept previous academic work (e.g., specialized Masters programs in business, degrees granted more than 5 years ago, etc.) in fulfillment of all or part of this requirement. Such a petition must be initiated during the first semester of the program. CORE REQUIREMENTS The core courses are designed to provide a strong background in Economics and to develop the student's quantitative and statistical research skills. These courses are required of all students in the program. The College will waive a course only if the student has passed the same or equivalent course with a grade of \"B\" or better within the preceding five years. The Economics requirement can be met by completing two graduate level economics courses that have been approved by the student's program committee. Students are required to take a one credit hour research skills course, QMB 7555, Research and Writing Wkills for Doctoral students, in the first semester of the Program. Following this introductory course, the quantitative and statistical coursework is to be determined by the student's program committee in consultation with the student. A three course series is required. An appropriate sequence should be chosen from the following: ECO 6424 Econometrics I 3 ECO 6425 Econometrics II 3 ECO 7426 Econometrics III 3 ECO 7427 Econometrics IV 3 QMB 6375 Applied Linear Statistical Models 3 QMB 7565 Introduction to Research Methods 3 QMB 7566 Applied Multivariate Statistical Methods 3 Any substitution of appropriate mathematics, statistical and quantitative coursework must be approved by the Doctoral Program Committee, preferably at the time of acceptance, or definitely before the student takes a substitute course. In addition, students are required to take an additional research elective approved by their advisory committee. Should a student earn a grade of \"C\" or lower in the core courses, the case will be brought before the Doctoral Program Committee for review. After reviewing the case, the Committee will take one of the following steps: a. Require the student to pass an examination that covers the material relevant to the subject. A student who fails the exam on the first attempt may retake it within one year. A student who fails the exam on the second attempt will be subject to dismissal. b. Require the student to retake the course. If the student retakes the course and fails to receive a grade of \"B\" or better, the student is subject to dismissal.

The student's performance on these \"exams\" should reflect familiarity with the literature, as well as with current issues and problems related to these fields. A student who fails either of the examss may retake it within one year. A second failure disqualifies the student from continuing the Ph.D. program. If the degree is not conferred within 5 calendar years of the comprehensive qualifying examination, a second and different examination must be taken. Students passing the qualifying examination are eligible for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. program. The decision to administer a separate comprehensive exam for a support area will be made by the department in which the support area is taken. In the event that an interdisciplinary support area is selected, any department represented by six (6) or more semester hours may require a qualifying examination. In the event that no single department represents six semester hours or more, the student's program committee will solicit input from the faculty teaching the courses in the support area. If a majority of those polled take the position that a separate comprehensive examination in the support area is not appropriate, the exam will not be administered. If a separate comprehensive examination is not administered in a support area, material from the support area will be integrated into the comprehensive exam in the concentration area. Dissertation : 21 hours of dissertation are required for the degree. Residency Requirement : Ph.D. students in the College are required to complete a minimum of 15 hours per calendar year. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the student being placed on conditional status.

COURSES See http://ugs.usf.edu/course inventory USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Business Analytics and Information Systems (M.S.) 390http://www.coba.usf.edu Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program The goal of the USF Muma College of Business integrated undergraduate graduate program in BAIS is to provide outstanding undergraduate students an option to complete the B.S. undergraduate degree in BAIS and the M.S. graduate degree in BAIS in five years (141 total hours). The integrated B.S./M.S. program is a 141 hour undergraduate graduate option that allows eligible students to work towards the M.S. in BAIS degree requirements while completing their undergraduate B.S. degree. Students interested in this option will work closely with an advisor and a faculty member to develop an integrated plan of study. General Guidelines Time of admission to the program: Students will be eligible for admission to the integrated degree program at the beginning of their Senior year in BAIS. Students must apply for admission consideration during their Junior year. Students will start taking courses in the graduate program in their Senior year. Joint admission: Students must apply to and meet admission requirements of the M.S. in BAIS graduate program. Plan of study: In consultation with an advisor and a faculty member, students will be required to prepare a Graduate Degree Action Plan. The plan will cover the entire time period of the program and it will be periodically reviewed with an advisor. Advising: Students will present their portfolio (see below for details and a plan of study in person to the integrated program committee prior to being admitted to the program. Tuition charges: Students will be required to pay graduate tuition rates when taking graduate courses. Admission Requirements 1. Students with at least a Junior standing in their undergraduate degree program may apply for admission consideration into the integrated B.S./M.S. undergraduate/graduate program Students will submit an Accelerated Program Interest Form that must be signed by the Graduate Program. 2. Students must have a minimum 3.25 GPA. 3. Interested students will be required to present a \"portfolio\" of the following credentials: a. Three letters of recommendation, at least two from faculty b. Statement of intent\u2014a personal statement about why the student wishes to apply for the integrated program. c. Undergraduate transcripts. d. Other supporting documents (e.g., projects and papers, software, work experience, internships, etc.) should be included where possible. 4. The GMAT or GRE should be taken sometime before or during the Fall semester of the Junior year of study. 5. All applicants will need to meet any other admission requirements established for the M.S. in BAIS program. 6. The application to the integrated program will be considered as a complete package and therefore obtaining a high undergraduate GPA is not a guarantee of admission. Grades in the undergraduate BAIS core courses will be taken in consideration and will have a significant impact on the M.S./BAIS acceptance decision. Degree Requirements 5Year Plan of Study for Integrated B.S./M.S. Undergraduate Graduate Program: With appropriate planning, a total of 12 hours of graduate credit may be taken that can be applied to both the B.S. and M.S. degrees. This will reduce the minimum total credits required for both programs from 153 (120 for B.S., 33 for M.S.) to 141 credits. Specifically: 9 hours of graduate credit can be taken in place of the 9 hours of elective undergraduate credits. The student must earn a minimum grade of B in each graduate course that is to be counted for both degrees. The graduate level Operations and Supply Chain Processes course ISM 6436 can be taken in place of the comparable undergraduate course ISM 3431. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Business Analytics and Information Systems (M.S.) 391http://www.coba.usf.edu A comprehensive plan of study to complete the integrated B.S./M.S. program will be developed with the guidance of an advisor and a faculty member.

The M.A. degree is primarily designed to increase competence in a teaching specialization or to provide professional preparation in one of the service areas of education. For most programs, two plans of study are available depending on the student's background and professional goals. College of Education Requirements for the Master of Arts (M.A.) Degree A minimum of 30 semester hours is required for the master's degree, at least 16 hours of which must be at the 6000 level. Courses at the 7000 level are advanced graduate level courses and thus are not approved to be part of the master's degree program.

Approved 2011 CONTACT INFORMATION College: Education Department: Teaching and Learning Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu PROGRAM INFORMATION Program Description The purpose of this online Master's program is to prepare teachers to be highly qualified and provide access to the general curriculum in least restrictive school environments to students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (InD). Accreditation: The Master of Arts in ASD and InD meets the accreditation standards required by the College of Education, University of South Florida. The proposed curriculum in the program is aligned with the conceptual framework of the College of Education and will meet the specific standards of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Major Research Areas The program benefits the university, local community and the state can be summarized in two ways. In a quantitative way, the program meets the need of preparing effective teachers to work with the growing number of students in general and special education who are identified as having ASD and/or InD labels. This is demonstrated through the critical shortage of data at a national and state level and also in the surveys of local school districts to USF. In a qualitative way, the program meets the need to prepare effective teachers to work with this group of students that represents a paradigmatic shift in where and how these students learn. Students with ASD and/or InD labels need meaningful access to general education curriculum and their typically developing peers and this program meets this need. ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements An earned baccalaureate degree in education or a related field that has a relationship with autism and/or intellectual disabilities from a regionally accredited college of university.

At least two (2) letters of recommendation from persons who have seen the candidate teach and/or work with children and youth who have labels of ASD and/or InD. Graduation Requirements: Portfolio System The Master's Portfolio System is a means through which each master's level student demonstrates his/her competency in the \"best practices\" of special education. Commensurate with the belief that the merging of research and practice is desirable and beneficial; the Department of Teaching and Learning has identified eight areas in which students are required to demonstrate their competency: Professional and personal selfawareness Assessment of exception students Behavior management Classroom instruction Collaboration Knowledge of the professional literature Research in critical areas such as child development, learning and teaching Professional development The department has also developed a list of suggested artifacts through which students can document their competency in each area. Students should meet with their advisor to discuss and plan their individualized portfolio. A copy of the Master's Portfolio System complete with policies and procedures, as well as suggested artifacts, is available with the Program Coordinator. Each student will be required to present his/her individualized portfolio to the Portfolio Review Committee in the Department of Teaching and Learning upon completion of their program. This presentation will be the master's comprehensive exam. A comprehensive exam is required of all master's level students in the College of Education.

For University requirements refer to the Office of Graduate Studies Policies and Procedures. College requirements are listed below. Refer to the degree program sections for other requirements. Master's Degree Programs The Master's degree is awarded for advanced study beyond the baccalaureate degree within an area of specialty. The College of Engineering offers several programs leading to degrees at the master's level. Master of Science in Designated Engineering Field This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who holds a Bachelor's degree in the designated field. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) nonthesis option (30 credits). Master of Science in Engineering Science This program is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to pursue an interdisciplinary course of study and research. This degree is individually tailored to student needs. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) non thesis option (30 credits). Master of Designated Discipline This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who has an undergraduate degree in the discipline and who follows an all coursework program or a project program. College of Engineering Requirements for Master's Degree 1. A thesis program must contain a minimum of 24 credit hours of coursework and a minimum of 6 credit hours of thesis. (If a student transfers from a thesis program to an all coursework program, no thesis hours may be transferred, converted or counted toward the degree.) 2. Nonthesis program requirements vary according to department but must contain a minimum of 30 credits of approved coursework. 3. Students must maintain an overall grade point average of 3.00. No grade below \"C\" will be accepted in a graduate program. If a student's average falls below 3.00, the student will be placed on probation. 4. Most programs require students to pass a final oral or written comprehensive examination prior to receiving the degree. These examinations are arranged and administered by the student's department. Accelerated Programs Leading to Accelerated Bachelor's and Master's Degrees Students who are clearly interested in graduate study are invited to pursue an accelerated program leading to a Bachelor's Degree and Master's degree in the College of Engineering. Students in the Accelerated Program may apply up to 12 credit hours of coursework, which must be approved by the Graduate Program Coordinator, to count towards both degrees. Students apply for admission to this program through their advisors, who should be consulted regarding additional requirements. Several factors, which vary by academic department, are considered for admission. However, all applicants must have a minimum GPA of at least 3.00. Doctoral Degree Programs The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded in recognition of demonstrated scholarly competence and ability to conduct and report original and significant research. Unlike the baccalaureate and Master's degrees, the Ph.D. degree cannot be earned by an accumulation of course credits over a period of residence alone. After adequate fundamental preparation to gain competence, the student must USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 16 College of Engineering 552 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ demonstrate research capability through completion of an authoritative investigation in the chosen engineering field, culminating in a written dissertation. The dissertation must demonstrate that the student possesses the ability to reason logically, the talent for engaging in significant and original research, and the ability to organize and present conclusions in a professional manner. Doctor of Philosophy in Designated Engineering Field This degree is awarded to students pursuing a program in one of the following Engineering disciplines: Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Students receiving this degree must demonstrate a thorough foundation in the designated discipline. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Science This program is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to pursue doctoral studies in interdisciplinary areas closely related to engineering. College of Engineering Requirements for Doctoral Degrees 1. Supervisory Committee. An advisor will be appointed by the chair of the appropriate department or program for each student during the first semester of registration at the University of South Florida. The advisor will help determine the student's area of research interest and will delineate preliminary course assignments. At the earliest possible date, a major professor will be appointed and a supervisory committee formed. This committee will monitor the student's program of studies and has full responsibility for conducting the student's qualifying examination. The Supervisory Committee consists of a minimum of five members. One member of the committee must be outside the College of Engineering. (The requirement may be waived if special reasons exist and prior approval is obtained from the Engineering Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.) A majority of the committee will be from the College of Engineering, with at least two departments of the College represented. 2. Credit Hours. A minimum of 72 hours beyond the baccalaureate degree, including a minimum of 20 hours of dissertation, and a minimum of 30 hours of coursework (excluding independent study and directed research) is required by the College. Further requirements may be imposed by the candidate's doctoral program and supervisory committee. See individual programs for specific requirements. 3. Learning Focus. Throughout the student's program of study, independent learning will be emphasized. For the first time in the participant's career, in most cases, the student will be responsible for mastering a new domain of knowledge without the aid of organized lectures and textbooks. The principal information source will be current literature. Such experience is a necessary preparation for a meaningful career in engineering and other fields where the professional must keep pace with a large, everchanging body of knowledge. 4. Qualifying Examination. A written and oral qualifying examination, conducted by the supervisory committee, will be taken by each Ph.D. student as soon as a substantial majority of coursework is completed. 5. Admission to Candidacy. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they register for dissertation. Before admission to candidacy, students must have officially formed a Ph.D. Supervisory Committee and passed the qualifying examination of paragraph 4. Once admitted to candidacy students must enroll for a minimum of 2 credit hours each semester of the academic year until completion of program. USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 16 College of Engineering 553 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ 6. Dissertation Research. The student must carry out an investigation resulting in an original and significant contribution to the knowledge in the field of research. The requirement of uniqueness means that the dissertation research will provide an important creative experience for the student. As the final stage of the student's program, the candidate must prepare a written dissertation covering the research. Students in the Ph.D. program must take an appropriate number of doctoral dissertation credits, but not less than 20 hours; the exact number is determined by department and/or individual requirements. The defense of the dissertation will conform to Office of Graduate Studies general rules. 7. Residency. Minimum residency requirements may be satisfied by completing the University's minimal requirement at the University of South Florida. Any graduate work counted toward the fulfillment of the requirement for the Ph.D. degree after admission to candidacy must be accomplished within 5 calendar years. Collaboration with Other Colleges and Departments Advanced study and research challenges exist at the interfaces between engineering and other academic disciplines. Examples include surface physics and chemistry applied to semiconductor processing technology; semiconductor physics applied to VLSI and analog integrated circuit design, manufacture and quality control; chemical processing and its relation to chemical principles; environmental engineering and chemical identification of minute impurities; environmental and transportation engineering and its relation to public health and public administration; water resources engineering and geohydrology; and biomedical engineering, to name only a few. The College collaborates with other academic units of the University in research activities and selectively educates students to become proficient in such interdisciplinary fields.

In order to accomplish the first objective, advances in health care increasingly involves the application of emerging science and technology (I.E., Engineering) to clinical problems, including problems in diagnostics treatment and the health care system itself. Unlike more basic research that often aims to increase science and technology knowledge in itself, translational research seeks to specifically address the science and technology needed to solve problems with the end product an actual application or product (of course, adding new significant knowledge in the process). In order to conduct effective biomedical translational research, the investigator must be trained in both clinical science (i.e. the MD Degree) and Engineering (Specifically Biomedical Engineering). This need has been delineated by both academics and industry and is validated by the growing number of MD/PH.D. (BME) programs nationally. USF has the necessary educational components and research infrastructure for this endeavor; both degrees are currently available. The proposed program seeks to provide an integrated experience where the student really fells a part of both the medical/clinical and engineering worlds simultaneously, hence the need for an integrated dual degree program.

USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 19 College of Marine Science 647 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ University of South Florida College of Marine Science 140 7th Avenue S, MSL119 St. Dean: Gary Mitchum, Ph.D David F. Naar, Ph.D. Accreditation: The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools College Structure and Location: The College of Marine Science (CMS) was formed during 2000 from the previous Department of Marine Science, initiated in 1967 with three founding faculty members. The Florida Board of Regents declared it a University Center of Excellence in 1978 and approved the Marine Science Ph.D. program in 1982. The CMS at the University of South Florida is constituted as a graduatelevel research program that forms the basis for educational opportunities at the Ph.D. and M.S. degree levels and for public service to the State of Florida. Located on the beautiful waterfront of Tampa Bay adjacent to the USF St. Petersburg campus, CMS is administratively part of the USF Tampa campus and reports to the Provost of USF. The College is focused on interdisciplinary research in marine science. Our ranked faculty, support personnel, and graduate students work together toward a vision of understanding the unified global ocean system. The College seeks to build new interdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with our local marine science research partners, including the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, the U.S. Geological Survery, NOAA, SRI St. Petersburg, and Mote Marine Lab. Mission Statement: The primary mission of the College is to conduct basic and applied research in ocean science. Here, ocean science is defined by application of the traditional fields of science to the biology, chemistry, geology, and physics of the marine environment and the interactions between the marine environment and the adjoining atmosphere and land systems - presently and throughout earth's history. Included in the primary ocean science mission is the development of new technologies and tools for exploring the coupled ocean atmosphere land systems. The College expects its faculty to develop research programs of outstanding caliber and to fully engage the national and international scientific communities, through the reporting of research results in the most respected oral and written venues, and by professional service. Integral to the ocean science research mission is the education of graduate students. The College recruits, trains, and graduates productive, creative scientists at the Ph.D. and M.S. levels that are prepared to make independent contributions to ocean science. The faculty are expected to develop outstanding graduate education programs that will afford students the opportunity to participate in all aspects of research. The College recognizes that graduate education requires strong mentoring along with traditional USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 19 College of Marine Science 648 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ classroom instruction. An ancillary but important mission of the College is education outreach for students at all levels and for the public at large. Our outreach programs have significantly expanded our educational responsibilities, and they are intended to motivate all generations to become scientifically literate citizens and to understand the environment in which they live. The College pursues innovative avenues for educational outreach. Efforts are made to attract more junior and senior level undergraduates into both the ocean science core courses and into advanced courses for which they have prerequisites. Historically, this is a way in which students have made career decisions to engage in ocean science. In this manner the College maintains close ties with the student body in other University of South Florida colleges and campuses. Research Facilities: The College facilities include specilaized laboratories equipped for studies in: Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Trace metal analysis; Water quality; Organic and isotope the complex includes the Center for Ocean Technology, which provides instrumental manufacturing and prototyping support to the faculty and students. The College's students and faculty have conducted research in the Antarctic, Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Bering, Mediterranean, and Caribbean Seas. The College has access to 5 research vessels in conjunction with the Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO) and the U.S. geological Survey: The RV Weatherbird II (115 ft), the RV Bellows (71 ft), the RV Gilbert (42 ft), the RV Fish Hawk (38 ft), and the RV Price (24 ft).

Students in the Master's program may elect a concenetration in biological, chemical, geological, or physical oceanography, or Marine Resource Assessment through course work and thesis research. CMS graduates are well prepared for positions in academia, industry, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations at local to international levels. Biological Oceanography Biological Oceanographers seek to understand the life histories and population dynamics of marine organisms and how they interact with their environment over space and time. Scientists in the College of Marine Science study the full breadth of biological oceanography including microbiology, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, coral reefs, fishes, and marine mammals. Our biological oceanographers utilize a variety of techniques including SCUBA, shipboard samplers, acoustics, molecular biology, and mathematical modeling to understand the oceans and their inhabitants. Scientists in our college also use the latest in remote sensing technology to study vast regions of the Earth's oceans, and have developed new technology, capable of identifying and quantifying harmful algal blooms and related processes. Chemical Oceanography Chemical oceanographers seek to understand the ways in which various chemical forms are cycled within the oceans, and the reactions that influence biogeochemical cycles. Ocean chemists improve our understanding of the basic conditions under which ocean life thrives in seawater, and help predict the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on ocean composition. Research programs in the College of Marine Science include wide ranging topics such as the role and USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Marine Science (M.S.) 651 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ variability of nutrients in seawater, the distribution and cycling of both biologically essential and toxic trace metals, the oceans' CO2 system, dissolved organic matter, molecular organic compounds, radionuclides and stable isotopes, and the distribution of chemical pollutants and their interactions with marine organisms and ecosystems. Faculty and students utilize a wide variety of stateoftheart instrumentation and technology for conducting this research. Geological Oceanography Geological oceanographers in the College of Marine Science conduct research from the continental margins to the deepocean seafloor. Their work extends from modern environments to millions of years before present to understand and predict Earth surface and interior processes. Primary research themes include: (1) paleoceanography and paleoclimatology; (2) coastline and continental shelf development and processes including effects of storms and sealevel fluctuations; (3) the health of modern coral reefs; (4) carbonate depositional processes; (5) anthropogenic influences on estuaries; (6) mathematical descriptions of geologic phenomena; and (7) plate tectonics. Our geological oceanography group has a variety of modern wellequipped laboratories and field equipment, including one of the best seafloor mapping capabilities in the US. Fully integrated with these field instruments is the computational capability to generate stateoftheart data depictions and imagery. Our group also works closely with scientists from the US Geological Survey's Center for Coastal and Marine Science Center, a major federal laboratory located nearby. Physical Oceanography Physical oceanography involves the study of water movement in the ocean. Energy is introduced to the ocean through wind and solar heating, and these combine with the rotation of the Earth and gravitational effects to drive ocean circulation, tides, and waves. Our physical oceanographers also investigate how the Earth's oceans are directly coupled with the atmosphere, from local weather patterns to the global climate system. Physical oceanographers in the CMS carry out research on a variety of topics using the latest technology. Computer models, real time data, satellite remote sensing, and in situ data from moored arrays, coastal tide gauges, and research cruises are used to study a wide range of research problems. Topics include tide and current prediction in Tampa Bay, circulation on the West Florida Shelf and in the Gulf of Mexico, El Ni\u00f1o phenomena, and the potential for global climate change. Marine Resource Assessment The College of Marine Science offers an interdisciplinary concentration in Marine Resource Assessment (MRA) as part of its M.S. and Ph.D. programs. This concentration provides training in the emerging field of ecosystem based management. Its mission is to train a new generation of scientists that can effectively address issues concerning the sustainability of the world's living natural resources. The MRA concentration addresses the national shortage of graduates possessing the skills required for managing living marine resources by teaching a quantitative approach to ecosystem analysis and living resource assessment.

Primary research themes include: (1) paleoceanography and paleoclimatology; (2) coastline and continental shelf development and processes including effects of storms and sealevel fluctuations; (3) the health of modern coral reefs(4) carbonate depositional processes; (5) anthropogenic influences on estuaries; (6) mathematical descriptions of geologic phenomena; and (7) plate tectonics. Our geological oceanography group has a variety of modern wellequipped laboratories and field equipment, including one of the best seafloor mapping capabilities in the US. Fully integrated with these field instruments is the computational capability to generate stateofthe art data depictions and imagery. Our group also works closely with scientists from the US Geological Survey's Center for Coastal and Marine Science Center, a major federal laboratory located nearby. Physical Oceanography Physical oceanography involves the study of water movement in the ocean. Energy is introduced to the ocean through wind and solar heating, and these combine with the rotation of the Earth and gravitational effects to drive ocean circulation, tides, and waves. Our physical oceanographers also investigate how the Earth's oceans are directly coupled with the atmosphere, from local weather patterns to the global climate system. Physical oceanographers in the CMS carry out research on a variety of topics using the latest technology. Computer models, real time data, satellite remote sensing, and in situ data from moored arrays, coastal tide gauges, and research cruises are used to study a wide range of research problems. Topics include tide and current prediction in Tampa Bay, circulation on the West Florida Shelf and in the Gulf of Mexico, El Ni\u00f1o phenomena, and the potential for global climate change. Marine Resource Assessment The College of Marine Science offers an interdisciplinary concentration in Marine Resource Assessment (MRA) as part of its M.S. and Ph.D. programs. This concentration provides training in the emerging field of ecosystem based management. Its mission is to train a new generation of scientists that can effectively address issues concerning the sustainability of the world's living natural resources. The MRA concentration addresses the national shortage of graduates possessing the skills required for managing living marine resources by teaching a quantitative approach to ecosystem analysis and living resource assessment. The MRA concentration is designed to produce resource assessment scientists who can introduce relevant ecosystem level variables into the traditional, singlespecies assessment process, complementing and enhancing the development of the sciencebased management policies that protect living marine resources.

ELECTIVE REQUIREMENTS Electives are taken within each concentration area (see above) 4. COMPREHENSIVE QUALIFYING EXAM REQUIREMENTS There will be an Integrated Marine Science Exam (IMSE) administered early each Fall semester. The exam aims to judge a student's ability, upon successful completion of the four core classes (B or better), to integrate the concepts covered in these classes. All students will take the same exam, at the same time, and questions will be determined by a committee to be appointed by the Dean. All Ph.D. students are expected to take this exam no later than the beginning of their third year (to allow for students who take 2 years to finish the core classes because of other course requirements or if they do not start in the fall term). M.S. students who anticipate continuing in the program to obtain their Ph.D. are encouraged to take this exam, which will fulfill this requirement as long as they enter the PhD program within 7 years of successfully completing the exam. The IMSE is a written exam, followed by optional oral exam if the student does not perform satisfactorily on the written exam. If the student fails the exam, he/she has a second chance to pass the exam in the following year. If a student fails the exam twice, he/she may not proceed in the Ph.D. program. After passing the IMSE, students are expected to form their dissertation committee, have their research proposal approved by the committee, and to take and pass a Ph.D. Candidacy Exam (PCE) administered by the dissertation committee. The qualifying exam is meant to test the students' indepth knowledge in their area of concentration and/or dissertation research. The PCE must consist of a 24 hour oral exam, with an optional written exam (which could be prior to or after the oral exam) at the discretion of the student's major advisor. The student is expected to take and pass the PCE no later than the start of their fourth year. A student has two chances to pass the PCE in order to become a Ph.D. candidate and must do so prior to beginning their fifth year. Students failing the first time must take the exam again within one year of the first try. If a student fails the exam twice, he/she may not proceed in the Ph.D. program. 5.

In some concentrations, the concentration director will develop the program plan with the student and forward the program plan to the professional advisor. Once a program plan is determined, students are expected to adhere to this plan unless special permission is obtained. As not all courses are offered each semester, a student who deviates from the program plan understands that delay in graduation can be expected Priority is given to students who maintain initial degree plans. Clinical and/or site placements are based on preceptor and/or site availability. While every effort is made to assign students to preceptor/clinical sites near their residence, it is not always possible, and thus, students will need to be flexible. Students may find it useful to meet with the concentration director to understand speciality course focus and/or clinicla course demands and plan accordingly.

Dual Degree 801 http://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ PROGRAM INFORMATION The core functions of public health include assessment, policy development, and assurance. Public health professionals can better perform these functions through not only obtaining the prerequisite knowledge but also through partnering with welltrained professionals in other fields such as law to develop and implement society's responses to public health needs. However, lawyers' effectiveness is often limited by their inadequate knowledge of public health and its scientific disciplines. The joint degree program is intended to supply this knowledge by giving public health and Stetson Law School graduates a sound education in both law and public health. A related goal is to increase the opportunities for interdisciplinary research, teaching, and advocacy for the faculties at the College of Public Health and Stetson University College of Law. The College's five departments are: Community and Family Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Global Health, and Health Policy and Management. In addition, Public Health Practice is a collegewide program. Core content is directly related to addressing and meeting public health issues. The College accommodates the working professional as well as the fulltime student by offering late afternoon and evening classes, online course delivery, partnerships with international schools to expand options, a variety of graduate certificates, and a professional M.P.H. for experienced health care professionals. Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools. The College is fully accredited by the Council on Education in Public Health.

ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements Students will need to be accepted to both institutions and follow the admission standards of each setting. Students must complete the GRE and the LSAT for acceptance into this dual program. Refer to the M.P.H. listing for specific USF admission requirements. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS College of Public Health Students : Students in the College of Public Health will enroll in the J.D./M.P.H. program, complete the M.P.H. degree, and meet the admission requirements of Stetson which includes taking the LSAT, and then enroll in the Stetson College of Law to complete the JD. Students in the dual degree program will be permitted to count nine hours of credit from the M.P.H. program toward satisfaction of JD credit requirements, and up to nine hours of credit from the JD program toward satisfaction of M.P.H. credit requirements. All students in the dual degree program must complete a field experience requirement. Students in Stetson Law must do mandatory pro bono work (20 hours). Some of these hours may qualify for the field experience however these must be done in a public health setting. This will be determined by the student's public health advisor and department. Credit hours for the M.P.H. may be more than 42 hours (i.e. 46 hours) depending on the concentration program. Stetson Law Students : Students already enrolled in Stetson College of Law will normally apply for the dual degree program in their first or second year. Students in the program will usually complete either one or two years of law school, after which they will spend a year completing the M.P.H. program in the College of Public Health. Students will have the ability to choose whichever concentration within the College that best meets their interests and needs and which they are formally accepted to by the College and Department. After completing their M.P.H., students will return to Stetson to complete their JD and prepare for the bar exam. The virtue of this study plan is that students will commence M.P.H. study with a sound foundation in law and legal process, and students will complete the elective portion of their legal study with a sound foundation in public health.

The courses and number of credit hours required are defined by the department and the doctoral committee and include coursework from another department or college. Generally, the doctoral degree requires a minimum of 90 credits beyond the bachelor's degree. Departments determine the number of credits accepted from previous master(s) degree. There is a mandatory doctoral student orientation that all new doctoral students must attend in the fall semester of their first academic year. Tools of Research Departmental Guidelines will address whether tools of research are required for doctoral students within that department (consistency within the department required). The student must complete a minimum of two of the \"Tools of Research\" options designated by the Department, and approved by the doctoral committee before the student is eligible to take the doctoral qualifying examination. Teaching All doctoral students will demonstrate or document proficiency in teaching academic courses at the university level. Qualifying Exam When all required coursework is satisfactorily completed (including tools of research and prerequisites), the student must pass a comprehensive qualifying examination covering the subject matter in the major and related fields. The Department will set the specific criteria. The qualifying exam will comprise of a written portion and may include an oral component. The exam will cover at least three major areas including: a) Broad area of public health; b) Focus area of study; c) Research methods. The student may have no longer than 10 weeks to complete the exam upon receipt of the exam from the Doctoral Supervisory Committee. The format and duration of the qualifying exam is the responsibility of the Doctoral Supervisory Committee following consultation with the student and consistent with departmental, college and university guidelines. The Doctoral Supervisory Committee will have up to three weeks to review the exam and determine the outcome of either Pass or Fail. No more than two attempts will be allowed for the student to take the qualifying exam and earn a Pass. If the student reeives a Fail on the qualifying exam on the first attempt and the Doctoral Supervisory Committee recommends that the USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Public Health (Ph.D.) 824 http://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ student complete remedial work, the second attempt at the qualifying exam must be initation within three months of completion of remedial work. If the student earns a Fail on the first attempt, and the Commttee dtermines that no remedial work is needed, the student will have a second attempt to pass which must be initiated within threemonths. If the student does not earn a Pass on the qualifying exam on his/her second attempt, the student will not be admitted into doctoral candidacy. After successful completion of the qualfying exam and appropraite paperwork is submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies, the student is admitted to candidacy and may register for dissertation hours. Dissertation All students must follow the University's \"Guidelines for Dissertations and Theses\" found at http://www.grad.usf.edu/thesis.php . The Dissertation must conform to one of the following two available options per USF degree requirements. For details, consult the USF Graduate Catalog Degree Requirements Section.

USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Public Health (Dr.P.H.) 837 http://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ PreDissertation Committee All Dr.P.H. students are admitted into the College of Public Health Dr.P.H. will be assigned a faculty advisor (see above) and a Dr.P.H. practicebased Mentor who will work with the student in forming a predissertation committee. The roles of the predissertation committee are as follows: 1. Meet with the student to discuss plan of study, practicebase specialized study, and academic progress. The Program of Study should include proposed time schedule to complete each course, and copies shall be given to each committee member and to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. 2. Facilitate opportunities for strengthening leadership and management skills, applied research skills and scholarly growth. 3. Administer and evaluate the qualifying exam. Dissertation Committee Successful completion of the preliminary examination advances the doctoral student to a doctoral candidate. At that time, the student will convene a Dr.P.H. Dissertation Committee. The PreDissertation Committee may continue to serve as the Dissertation Committee, although this not necessary. At this time, the student may desire to change Faculty Advisor and/or committee members. This may occur when practice, professional or research interests are more closely matched with another faculty member, the student and faculty member mutually agree that another person is more appropriate, or a faculty member is leaving the University. This action is to be approved by the Department Chair, the Dean of Academic and Student Affairs, and the Office of Graduate Studies. The Dissertation Committee must have a minimum of four members, which includes at least two faculty members from the College of Public Health and a public health professional or practitioner. Refer to Office of Graduate Studies guidelines for information on the chair appointed for the dissertation defense. A minimum of 9 dissertation credits is required. The roles of the dissertation committee are as follows: 1. Guide student throughout practicebased dissertation. 2. Approve written dissertation proposal through a formal oral presentation process. 3. Provide guidance and support during dissertation 4. Evaluate dissertation through dissertation defense process. 5. Recommend an appropriate chair for the dissertation defense. Use of \"c\" in Degree Acronyms for Degree Candidates The College of Public Health does not permit students who are pursuing masters or doctoral degrees to use the degree acronym after their names and a small \"c\" for candidate. In other words students are not permitted to use MPHc, MSPHc, MHA, PhDc, or DrPHc. If students, after successfully completing all comprehensive exams (core and concentration) for the master degrees or the qualifying exam for the doctoral degree wish to put after their name the words \"master degree candidate\" or \"doctoral degree candidate*\" - we allow this. The use of the degree acronym and small \"c\" creates confusion for faculty, employers, and other individuals who are reviewing students' CVS and other materials. It creates a situation wherein a student appears to have earned a degree when such is not the case. As a degreegranting College, we do not allow this. *Editor's note: the use of \"doctoral degree candidates\" should only be done after Admission to Doctoral Candidacy has been processed and approved through the Office of Graduate Studies.

The studio is the primary place for the exchange of design ideas, critique, and synthesis, and the Architecture faculty believes that the student's regular presence in the studio is critical for maximizing her or his architectural design learning. The notebook system is required in lieu of a desktop in order to address the limited design studio space available to each student. The mobility of the notebook allows the student to easily and quickly transform a relatively small desk space into a variety of configurations suitable for physical modelmaking, handdrawing, handdrafting, design research, and design writing as well as digital drawing, modeling, and graphic design. The batterypowered notebook allows for maximum computer use within environments with limited electrical power outlets. The School will continue to maintain highpowered computer systems in the laboratory for intensive computing required for manipulating large digital models, renderings, etc. Students may begin their digital work on their laptops and, if needed, use removable storage and network connections to transfer files to the lab systems for final development. The School provides black and white printers, color and black and white plotters, and scanners in the computer laboratory. Because the notebook computer system is an educational requirement of the School, the cost of a new computer purchase can be factored in determining a student's financial need. The student must contact the USF Office of Financial Aid (8139744700) to request additional information and a \"Budget Adjustment for Computer Purchase\" form prior to ordering a computer. The decision regarding a student's budget adjustment may take 68 weeks, so students are strongly encouraged to plan ahead. Only one financial aid budget adjustment up to $2,500 for a new computer can be issued during a three year period. Portfolios The faculty requires the submission of portfolios of academic work by each student at two formal portfolio reviews. Students must pass these portfolio reviews in order to advance in the program. The portfolio policy can be found on the School's website. Students are advised to prepare their design work for inclusion in their portfolios at the end of each design semester, instead of waiting until just before the portfolio due dates. Some expense, varying widely according to reproduction technique and/or ambition, should be anticipated. Field Trips Each year students in the fall term beginning students in take a field trip to Savannah, GA. Transportation, lodging and meals ($200300) are paid by the students. Students in design studios take field trips to such cities as New York, Boston and Chicago in the spring. The cost of these trips may be $200600 per student. Student Work Student work, submitted to the School in satisfaction of course or degree requirements, becomes the physical property of the School. This work may include papers, drawings, models, and other materials in either physical or electronic form. The School assumes no responsibility for safeguarding such materials. At its discretion, this School may retain, return, or discard such materials. The School will not normally discard the materials of currently enrolled students without giving the student a chance to reclaim them. GPA of 3.00 in Design In addition to the statewide requirement that students maintain an overall grade point average(GPA) of 3.00 or better, the Architecture faculty also requires that students maintain a GPA of 3.00 or better in all design courses.

USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Art History (M.A.) 852 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Total Minimum Hours 38 Qualifying Paper Option Course Requirements: ARH 6798 (4) Seminar in Art History Students take eight critical studies seminars in art history 32 Electives (determined by individual consultation with Graduate Coordinator) 8 ARH 6055 (2) Art History (Writing the Qualifying Paper) Total Credit Hours 42 Thesis Option Course Requirements: ARH 6798 (4) Seminar in Art History Students take six critical studies seminars in art history 24 Electives (determined by individual consultation with Graduate Coordinator) 8 ARH 6971 (6) Thesis (Thesis Writing) Total Credit Hours 38 To learn about a range of arthistorical methods, graduate students are required to take the critical studies seminars in a variety of historical periods and taught by different faculty. A student should, if possible, have at least one graduate class in these three areas: 1) Ancient/Medieval 2) Early Modern (15th18th centuries) 3) Modern (1921st centuries). Museum experience is encouraged for all students, but course credit for museum internships is limited to those seeking a Certificate in Museum Studies. Thesis and Qualifying paper options Students either write a qualifying paper or thesis to complete the requirements of the M.A. program. Students should consult with the Coordinator of the Graduate Program and the faculty to determine which option is the best for them; the final decision rests with the faculty. For either option, a B+ average or above is required in courses taken to fulfill Program graduate credits, for students to move on to this final phase of their graduate studies. The M.A. in Art History is a twoyear program for students who attend full time, but the thesis option often takes longer to complete. Qualifying paper option Requires 8 seminars in art history (32 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 2 hours for preparing the qualifying paper (in the fourth and final semester). The qualifying paper should demonstrate the student's ability to do significant arthistorical research, to persuade by effective use of evidence and argument, and to write fluently and clearly. The qualifying paper will usually be a substantially revised seminar paper and should be about 1520 typed pages in length, excluding endnotes, bibliography, illustrations or other materials. Students choosing this option should form a qualifying paper committee by the end of the second semester of their first year. The Committee is composed of a major professor and a second faculty member. Members of the Committee are faculty in the School of Art and Art History, of which one must be tenured or tenureearning. The major professor will usually be the professor who oversaw the writing of the original seminar paper. Students pursuing this option download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/ab solutenm/articlefiles/20 GradComApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collecting committee members' signatures. The M.A. Program Coordinator must authorize all committee assignments with his/her signature When submitting drafts of the qualifying paper to committee members, students must allow faculty members two weeks to read any given version. Remember that first drafts usually have to be extensively revised, often several times, before the qualifying paper is accepted. Faculty are not normally available during the summer to read qualifying paper drafts. The qualifying paper committee must approve the qualifying paper before the student can graduate. Qualifying papers must be submitted two weeks before the last day of classes of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. The major professor, in consultation with the other faculty member, notifies the Academic Advisor of the School of Art and Art USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Art History (M.A.) 853 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ History of approval of the paper before the end of the semester. If a paper is not approved, the student may revise and resubmit it a second time. It is the student's responsibility to stay abreast of Office of Graduate Studies deadlines and registration requirements in the final semester, which are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu . Thesis option Requires six seminars in art history (24 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 6 hours of thesis writing (4 hours in the third semester and 2 hours in the fourth and final semester). Students writing the thesis should work with faculty during the second semester to begin developing potential topics. By the end of the first year, students who wish to write the thesis should decide on a thesis topic with a major professor from the art history faculty. The topic is usually related to research done in a seminar. During the following summer students prepare the thesis proposal. The proposal should define a significant research problem and explain how the topic has the potential to contribute to scholarship in the field; it must include a research plan and a critical review of the scholarly literature on the subject area. Thesis proposals will be presented to faculty and fellow graduate students in a public forum at the beginning of the third semester. Each presentation is followed by discussion, which provides an opportunity for students to receive suggestions and recommendations from faculty and peers. If the proposal is declined, the student will be eligible to pursue a Qualifying Paper. If the art history faculty approves the thesis topic, the student should form a thesis committee by the end of the semester in which they have successfully proposed a thesis topic, and have thereby achieved thesis candidacy. The committee is composed of at least two members and the major professor. The major professor and at least one other committee member must be chosen from tenured or tenureearning art history faculty, or otherwise as approved by the Coordinator of the M.A. program. Students forming the thesis committee download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/ab solutenm/articlefiles/20 GradComApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collecting committee members' signatures. The M.A. Program Coordinator must authorize all committee assignments with his/her signature. While moderate in length and considerably more limited in scope than a doctoral dissertation, the M.A. thesis must demonstrate the student's ability to do original, independent research of publishable quality. The thesis should be approximately 3540 typed pages of text - the usual length of a journal article excluding notes, bibliography, illustrations or other materials. When submitting drafts of the thesis to committee members, students must allow faculty members two weeks to read any given version. Remember that first drafts will have to be extensively revised several times before the thesis is accepted. Faculty are not normally available during the summer to read thesis drafts. The thesis committee must approve the final thesis before the student may schedule a date for the M.A. thesis defense. The examining committee will consist of the thesis committee and at least two additional questioners who are chosen by the student in consultation with the thesis committee. Students should keep in mind that the questioners must also be allowed two weeks to read the draft of the thesis after it is accepted for the defense by the thesis committee. The oral defense is open to the public. No defenses are scheduled during the summer. Immediately after the orals, the examining committee meets to determine whether the student has passed the oral examination and whether the thesis is acceptable in its current form. NOTE: It is usually necessary to make some changes in the thesis after the oral defense. Allow at least one week between the oral exam and the Office of Graduate Studies deadline so that you will be able to make the changes. Ideally, the student will complete the thesis and submit it in the fourth semester. It is the student's responsibility to stay abreast of Office of Graduate Studies deadlines and registration requirements in the final semester. Check with the USF Office of Graduate Studies for specific deadlines and requirements for the M.A. thesis and graduation. These are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp. All theses must be submitted electronically. Transfer of Credit There is no automatic transfer of special student credit or graduate credit earned at other institutions or from other graduate program in the university towards M.A. degree requirements. The School of Art and Art History has designated a six hour limit on all credit taken as special student status. Any transfer of credit or special student hours to be used toward M.A. degree requirements are only granted after a faculty review at the time the student has been accepted into the M.A. program.

They are listed with the Program or College that offers them. Courses are numbered based on content, rather than by department or program. This means that a single program may have courses in several different disciplines and may consist of courses having several different prefixes. The University reserves the right to substitute, not offer, and add courses and programs that are listed in this catalog. Course Levels 0 PSAV, college prep, vocational prep 12 Lowerlevel undergraduate 34 Upperlevel undergraduate 59 Graduate and Professional USF Graduate Course Level Variance Definitions It is expected that the 500060007000 courses will have distinct syllabi demonstrating different depth and breadth of the subject matter as reflected in the course requirements.

This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating nonpublic institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online SCNS to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This information is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org . Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated courses is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code Century Digit Decade Digit Unit Digit Lab Code (first digit) (second digit) (third digit) (fourth digit) ENC 1 1 0 1 English Lower (Freshman) Freshman Freshman Freshman No laboratory Composition Level at this Composition Composition Composition component in institution Skills Skills I this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency . For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 84 different public and nonpublic postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means \"English Composition,\" the the decade digit \"0\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at a Florida College System institution is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to USF Graduate Catalog 20162017 Section 26 - Course Information and Course Descriptions 871 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ 871 the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE : Credit generated at institutions on the quarterterm system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on the semester term system. For example, 4.0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. The Course Prefix The course prefix is a threeletter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or subcategory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. B. For courses at nonregionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. C. Courses in the _900999 series are not automatically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Theses, and Dissertations. D. Applied academics for adult education courses. E. Graduate courses. F. Internships, apprenticeships, practica, clinical experiences, and study abroad courses with numbers other than those ranging from 900999. G. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music, and Theatre) and skills courses in Criminal Justice (academy certificate courses) are not guaranteed as transferable. These courses need evidence of achievement (e.g., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions The SCNS makes available on its home page (http://scns.fldoe.org) a report entitled \"Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions\" that contains a comprehensive listing of all nonpublic institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course's transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly.
