Here you will find nothing but reliable and easy-to-understand information from the world's leading medical experts about the ways of integrating CAM into your life and treatments for a truly holistic approach to health and well - ness. Read ers are informed that CAM is becoming accepted by the medical community and an increasing number of once \"fringe\" practices are being incorporated into conventional med - icine. The book de scribes twenty-five so-called \"alternative therapies\" and fif - ty-nine commonly used herbs, vitamins, and minerals, the majority of which are recom mended by the authors for treat - ing hundreds of medical conditions. A typical SI reader should feel a kind of resentment at this point. The word \"holistic\" alone, which appears throughout the book (often sans quotes), is enough to make many skeptics scoff. On the other hand, the Mayo Clinic is a respected medical institution, and all of the nine authors have real medical degrees and back up their claims with scientific evidence, so the book cannot be dismissed out of hand. Does this mean that perhaps we skeptics have been unfair to \"alternative medicine\" and that there is more to it than just placebo, self-delusion, quackery, or, at best, some outdated healing techniques? Perhaps not. True, of the twenty-five CAM ther - apies, fourteen are recommended as safe and effective for \"treating\" various diseases. However, a closer look reveals that the word treatment commonly denotes only a temporary relief of some generic symptoms. Moreover, about 90 percent of the symptoms mentioned in the book can be classified in just six cat - egories: pain (mostly nonspecific pain), nausea, stress, anxiety, depression, and high blood pressure. The remaining 10 percent include, among other things, insomnia, bad mood, and lack of con - centration. It doesn't take a doctor to realize that all these symptoms have a strong psychological factor, which makes them highly susceptible to the placebo effect. Therefore, only dou - ble-blind studies can tell whether these \"therapies\" have any real effect. How - ever, for each of the fourteen therapies, such studies are very difficult if not impossible to design. In any case, none of the twenty-five is shown to cure, prevent, or even signifi - cantly affect any organic disease\u2014with perhaps just two exceptions. One is mas - sage therapy, claimed to stimulate the immune system in HIV positive patients (p. 117). Ironically, a more recent study suggests that increased immune activity actually speeds up the development of AIDS. Another is spirituality, for which the book proclaims that \"some studies of people with cancer report a change in the progression of the disease when prayer was used\" (p. 98). For such a bold statement, the evidence is pretty weak, however. There are very few studies on personal prayer (none are double-blind, of course), and their results are mixed even for treating purely psychological symptoms. More disturbing is the fact that the book doesn't make a distinc - tion between personal and intercessory prayer, even though the latter is known to have no effect according to well-de - signed studies (including one by the Mayo Clinic itself). None of these facts is ever mentioned. In summary, the evi - dence of the effectiveness of these \"ther - apies\" against any real disease is either dubious or non-existent. Of course, controlling such factors as stress and depression is important for your health, but there is no indication that any of the twenty-five treatments (many of which can be quite expensive) are better at it than simple relaxation or minor life-style changes. Not surprisingly, herbs and supple - ments fare better. After all, chemistry is chemistry. However, of the twen - ty-seven recommended supplements, only eight show the potential of treating or preventing anything more serious than superficial symptoms, and all of them appear to be less effective than conventional treatments. Only arthritis pain is said to be treated just as effec - tively with herbs as with medications, but the effect becomes significant only after a month. That doesn't sound too encouraging. But what of the claim that alternative practices are being incorporated into conventional medicine? Well, the book gives only one unambiguous example for this: chiropractic treatment for mild lower back pain is said to be \"no longer considered alternative\" (p. 122). How - ever, all the other sources, including the Mayo Clinic's own Web site and even this very book (p. 143), still list chiropractic treatment for lower back pain under \"complementary and alter - native.\" \"Busted,\" a relentless skeptic would exclaim, but wait\u2014the authors The Beginner's Guide to 'Holistic' Wellness DIMITRY ROTSTEIN Mayo Clinic Book of Alternative Medicine.

From pedestrian traf - fic flows to the humiliation of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers, it is not the behavior of the individual but the patterns of individual behavior that will give us insight into why events unfold the way that they do. The biggest barrier to thinking \"patterns not people\" is getting past what Buchanan terms \"the human problem,\" which basically stated is the belief that social science is complicated because people are complicated, and the unending variability of individuals makes it nigh impossible to perform predictions about a group that will \"do things that make the human world unpredictable\u2014 if even just to prove it is unpredictable.\" However, just because something is diffi - cult doesn't mean we shouldn't try. According to Buchanan, most social-science research relies more on arguments and plausible stories than on finding patterns. Because of this ten - dency, it could be regarded as \"largely a 'storytelling' science.\" He elaborates, \"It is hard to find any example of social research of the recipe for good sci - ence as illustrated by Brahe, Kepler, and Newton,\" that is, to \"gather data, iden - tify patterns, then find a mechanism to explain them.\" Buchanan doesn't think that all current social science is worth - less, just that it is not being approached with the same rigor as other sciences, and that needs to change. Enter physics. Although treated as an exact science, \"the strength of physics always rests on the art of making approx - imations.\" Buchanan believes that social science should learn, like physics, \"to ignore details that don't really matter, and to focus only on those that do.\" Using this method will help social scien - tists see the patterns of human behavior and hopefully allow them to take the next step and find the mechanisms to explain them. Buchanan discusses in detail some of the work that has already been done along these lines. One of the most practical of these was for the State of Illinois. It used com - puter modeling to simulate what would happen when the state deregulated its electricity market. (Illinois wanted to avoid the mistakes of Cali fornia's dereg - ulation that resulted in the misappropri - ation of billions of public dollars.) The model used agents to represent consum - ers and regulators with each agent using a strategy to achieve the best results for itself\u2014for a consumer to pay the least amount possible and for regulators to get the best profit. During the simulation, agents were able to learn and adopt new strategies to improve their performance. What the model identified was that some agents were able to manipulate the system to create pocket monopolies, something the state definitely wanted to avoid. This information gave the State of Illinois a greater understanding of the likely outcomes of its deregulation, which could be used to improve its deregulation rollout. To Buchanan, the success of this model was in its approximations. The model ignored the complexity (and sup - posed unpredictability) of individual con - sumers and regulators and focused on what mattered: the strategies that each agent would use in pursuit of its goals and the continual search for better strategies. In addition to computer modeling, Buchanan also relates studies on existing social science data that have highlighted some interestingly universal patterns called power laws. A study of the five million commercial enterprises in the United States revealed that the number of companies with sales X is propor - tional to 1/X2, which means that there are four times as many companies with sales of $1 million as there are with $2 million. Another power law appears when those same entities are examined on rate of growth. The distribution of wealth, long known to follow the Pareto, or 80/20, prudently explain that \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" are two different things (p. 10), so the above statement is still technically correct. While the book contains nothing but the truth, the authors display a clear pref - erence for CAM, trying to draw a rosier picture than warranted by the available data. That's quite illuminating if you think about it. The authors can hardly be accused of being too skeptical. They even entertain the possibility that acupuncture and the like work via \"putative life ener - gies\" unknown to science (pp. 105, 110, 119). And yet, not even a single cure for anything is offered, not a single viable alter - native to existing conventional treatments. Perhaps it's an indication that being \"open-minded\" isn't enough to prove the amazing purported effectiveness of \"alternative medicine.\" But, if you aren't a skeptic, fear not\u2014the book isn't a total loss. It does describe one \"therapy\" that can treat and prevent hundreds of medical con - ditions, even \"slow the aging process\" (p. 24), and no skeptic will be able to debunk it.
