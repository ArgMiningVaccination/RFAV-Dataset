Favored in alternate therapies for their expansive benefits, essential oils are incredibly versatile, and can be an eco-friendly alternative to artificial fragrance. Around since Biblical times, essential oils are potent compounds that have been distilled or expressed from plants. Essentially, they capture the essence of herbs, trees, flowers, and other denizens of the plant world. Extremely powerful, essential oils need to be used with caution. The right way to use an essential oil is to dilute it with a carrier oil before you apply it to your hair and skin (after a patch test). If you have a medical condition, do consult with a doctor before using it. Essential oils can be toxic if ingested, so avoid swallowing them unless under medical supervision. So, dive deep into our list of the best organic essential oils for your well-being.

Frequently Asked Questions How do you use essential oils? You can use essential oils for their mood-enhancing properties in aromatherapy, blend them with other oils for a massage, or add them to a diffuser to send their scent wafting through your home and creating a sanctuary of calm. Many people use them as an ingredient in DIY cleaning products. Are organic essential oils better for the environment? Producing a tiny, potent bottle of essential oil is extremely resource intensive. It requires a staggering volume of raw materials to extract just a few ounces of oil. For instance, did you know it takes 10,000 pounds of rose petals to produce just a pound of rose essential oil?Also, some tree species are threatened by the insatiable demand of the industry, such as frankincense, where ancestral forests are being tapped out for their precious resin. Given this, opt for transparent producers who use ethically or wild-harvested herbs, trees, plants and flowers, and products which are certified organic (certified by reputed independent companies). Does an organic certification mean the oil is pure? An organic certification on an essential oil indicates that it is made almost entirely of organic ingredients and is free of pesticides and fertilizers. But it is not indicative of the quality of the essential oil. For that, a Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry test is necessary, which throws light on the chemicals that constitute the essential oil. Thus, before you buy an oil, do check for this on the company's website. So that you know what you are buying is actually authentic, rather than a bottle of filler with just trace amounts of pure oil. It is essential to do your research beforehand. What essential oils are the most useful to keep on hand? It's great to keep a small kit of essential oils at home, since they come so handy. Whether you want to massage yourself (pick a soothing lavender). Or are fighting off the sniffles (bring out the eucalyptus oil).
