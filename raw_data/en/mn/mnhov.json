Though shehas never advertised for her work and hasretained privacy in her life and practice,she is recognized and highly respected asa \"healer's healer\" among Ann Arbor'sholistic community. I interviewed Merri on a cold, snowy day in January in her light-filledSpring Street home, the house where shegrew up and where she now lives with herhusband, Robin, and eight children, whorange in age from five to twenty-two. We spoke in the purple office where she does her healing sessions. Likethe rest of the house, the room is filled withbeautiful, unique objects that seem to havetheir own characters and histories. Wornbooks about flower essences and herbs sitatop antique bureaus filled with homeo-pathic remedies. Fresh daffodils, sprawl-ing crystals, and water-worn rocks createa peaceful and colorful atmosphere. Merri herself is a lovely woman of forty-nine with long, straight blonde hairand a warm, gentle face and demeanor.Her clients include all kinds of people inneed of healing, including those who arespiritually-oriented and those who havehad little or no exposure to spiritualframeworks or concepts. Merri's path into healing work has wound through various vocations,including social work and weaving, andher practice has evolved in an organicway informed more by her own intuitionand spiritual guidance than from books orexoteric learning. She brings to her worka grounded connection to spiritual forcesas well as a compassion learned from longperiods of intense physical illness. At one point in the interview, I looked up and saw in Merri a trulyawesome strength. She carries thisstrength quietly, never aggrandizing herself or attemptingto awe or impress anyone. This quiet humility allows herto share her profound spiritual gifts with people from allwalks of life, and she does so with abundant generosity. The interview illuminates some of the abilities and life experiences that have informed her practice andgarnered her reputation as a truly gifted healer. Claire Crevey: Could you give me a brief title or descrip- tion of your profession?Merri Walters: That's possibly the hardest thing because I don't really have a \"title,\" because I'm not authorized, or Ihaven't gone through any courses of study where theywould give me a diploma in this or that. So much of what Ido has evolved through my own work with the Spirit, withmy clients, my body, my children, my extended family, withanimals, with Nature herself. There isn't a title that I have.I've gotten to where when I fill out a form for the kids I justsay \"healer\" to make it simple.I use a lot of different combinations of techniques. I'vedrawn upon a lot of the history of healing, so I may bemuscle testing something through myself, I may be askingspiritually the questions that I need to know the answers tofor a particular person, but it's really a study of energy andhow that all works in its many manifestations both withinour human electrical systems and within our outer aurasand then with the things that affect us. When someonecomes into my office, I have to look at them uniquely anddraw upon things I know, but I don't assume anything. Ilisten to their story because that's very important, to heartheir story, and I think it's not even so important for me, butit's important for them to speak it. But then I really startfresh. I just go and start asking the body a lot of questions and allow the body itself and their own spiritual energy todirect me as to what I'm going to do next and where we'regoing to go with that.I do start with the physical body, usually, because I havefound that the physical energies are much denser, and soyou can balance a person's spiritual energies over and overagain, but the physical body, because it's denser, is holdingonto these older energies. Even though those energies maybe cleared on that spiritual level or ethereal level, someonemay still be experiencing physical issues. It takes a longtime for that energy, that spiritual energy to really penetratein and heal the body. It's not that it can't be done. It's just alittle harder and takes longer, so I want to stabilize theirphysical bodies first, and then I work out into the emotionaland spiritual bodies as a progression.Sometimes I can do that all in a first two-hour session, andsometimes it's a progress of working with them longer, andthat can be for a couple different reasons. One is thatthey're really not ready to handle that much at once. I willpush a person, though. I will push their comfort zone tohave some sort of a transformation, of either their conceptsof what is possible, or their knowledge base of certainthings, be that herbs or homeopathic remedies, floweressences, all of which I use extensively, or just the fact thatthe physical body and physical illness could be related toemotions or crisis in their lives.It's kind of wherever they're coming from, because I seepeople from just an incredible range of life experience. Itcan be very different from who comes in to where we go ina session. I've really been, I think, fortunate to be able towork with so many different life experiences in my own lifeand so to be able to have that compassion when I workwith people from all these different places. I see many, many people from outside of AnnArbor, people who work at the motorcompanies, people who really, when theywalk in here, they've had no frame ofreference for any of this work, and this maybe the first time they've seen someone otherthan a medical doctor. To me that's excitingbecause they can really experience this otherpart of themselves and open up in manyways. But it does change the type of work orhow far I can take them.Also seeing people from a whole range oflife phases. Certainly I've seen lots ofbabies, and I've had lots of babies, so that'san easy one. But also teenagers, youngadults, a full range right into clients in theirnineties. I think my oldest client who walkedin, she was about ninety-six, ninety-eight,and it's very interesting because she wasjust right there. These older adults\u2014what Ifind is they really have grown up in adifferent time period where maybe they werebrought into this world by a midwife, andthey have experience with herbs from theirmothers, and they've been using them, andsome of them even having had naturalchildbirth with their children, so that theyreally have this sort of richness, andsometimes they're more comfortable withthis type of medicine than people who'vebeen more indoctrinated by the currentmedical system.Claire Crevey: Did your healing or intuitive abilities manifest in your childhood?Merri Walters: Yes, but in different ways. I was too sensitive, definitely. I was toosensitive to everything, too sensitiveemotionally for sure. My father, who's avery, very sweet man, I remember the onething he would always tell me as a child was,\"You're going to have to get a tougher skinthan that, young lady.\" That was hismessage to me, because I would cry reallyeasily, I would cry for other people's pain, Iwould cry... I really remember seeing animalsthat had been run over and that just hurtingme so deeply, and I made a pact with God, Iremember. I was raised in a Lutheran church, and one of the concepts of Christianity, especially at thattime, was that animals didn't have souls. I think that'smoved in some churches now, but when I found this out, Imade this pact with God that I would trade my soul if theanimals could have souls, that that would be okay with me.And even as a very young child, I recognized the enormityof that. I recognized what I was doing and what that reallymeant.Claire Crevey: How old were you then? Merri Walters: Oh, probably about five. And I really, I knew that this wasn't something to just do. I knew that thiswas a huge, huge thing that I was doing. But I knew that that just wasn't right, and every single animal ... and actually, it still passes when I see an animal. My heart justopens. The prayer still goes out. So there was always avery deep connection with Nature, with the natural realm.I was ill a lot. A lot, a lot. I remember lots of fevers, lots of The Crazy Wisdom Interview ~ Merri Walters on Healing, Flower Essences and Spiritual Timing I think there have been manyopportunities for me to leave here.Because I have always recognizedthat I wasn't going to have an easylife or an easy task here, an easymission. But I'm a fighter, I think. what they called tonsillitis, maybe seven times a year, so lots of antibiotics. And things like migraine headaches fromthe time I was four, where I was getting headaches weekly,sometimes several times a week, not always migraines, but Ihad a lot of head pain. I had lots of colds. I was at one ofthe first vaccinations for the measles and nearly died fromit. I went into fever, perhaps coma. I'm not really sure.That's not really clear, whether I was in a coma, but I wasout for quite a while and kind of remember coming in andout of consciousness for a couple weeks.During all of this, I had lots of spiritual contact, lots of talkswith angels and those from the other realms. They werealways right there. They were always speaking to me, and itwas profound. It was a profound piece of my childhood. Itruly believe that I have this access to these very wise oneswho are always speaking to me. I was raised in theLutheran church, and my parents were very religious. Wewent to everything in the church, and that was verycomfortable for me. But I was always challenging myteachers. It was interesting. When I think of the concepts Iwas talking with them about ... and they weren't quiteready for that, I think.Claire Crevey: How old were you during that period of illness?Merri Walters: I was very ill right into my early twenties, very ill all the time. As a teenager, I had mono, which wentinto hepatitis, for I think probably six months of illness. Theheadaches were so bad in my early twenties and late teensthat I literally had a headache every day. I remember oneday of not having a headache in my early twenties and justfeeling this immense freedom of being in a body that wasnot in pain and how wonderful that was, being outside, andjust so many prayers of thanks, and the next day havingthe worst headache.So lots of that, and when I was either twenty or twenty-oneI had probably gall stones, but I was diagnosed as havingulcers, so they put me on a high-fat diet. What they wantedme to do was drink milk or cream every half an hour, which Iguess was common at that time for ulcers, and what endedup happening was that I ruptured my gall bladder. So I wentin for emergency surgery, and I was luckily living with afriend who, she knew to rush me to the hospital. And thiswas after they had put me in the hospital for a whole weekof tests and ended up sending me home. I had no insur-ance, which I still don't have (laughs). I think they didn'twant to think they needed to operate or anything duringthat week because of that. Every doctor who came in to seeme, the first thing they said to me was, \"You don't haveinsurance.\" I'd say, \"No,\" and they'd go, \"Mm hmm\"(laughs). And then they'd talk to me. So I thought that waskind of interesting.So, I think there have been many opportunities for me toleave here. Because I have always recognized that I wasn'tgoing to have an easy life or an easy task here, an easymission. But I'm a fighter, I think. And some of that I attribute to\u2014this is actually the house I was raised in, right here, and when I was raised here in the fifties and sixties, itwas a pretty tough neighborhood. So I grew up, eventhough being very sensitive, having to go out in the worldand kind of face that tough place where there were fights,and always there were things going on on the way backand forth to school, and I've actually accredited that tobeing a really good thing for me. That was a good place for me to be born and a good thing for me to learn right away,how to deal with these energies.What I have found in my life is that when I really face theseadverse challenges, my instincts are to fight, and theinstincts are to just draw upon this strength, and to justmove through it. And I think more than fright, what Iexperience is anger, but not like anger at a particular personor anything like that, but it's that power, that anger that canhelp you really move through something in a loving, goodway. It's a very heartfelt impulse or emotion. And it's aninteresting thing to attach anger to the heart, but I thinkthat if you look at the life of Martin Luther King, or Christ,you can see that, you can see that there's a real powerthere that can really do something good andthat anger can be very appropriate whenyou're facing something that is wrong or dark.Claire Crevey: Are you speaking about your illnesses then, that you faced them with anger?Merri Walters: I have at times. Yes, at times, because I've seen times when I have beenchallenged, that there was really an energythere that was trying to just take me out ofhere. It wasn't like I was choosing to leave.And there have been times, yes, when I havehad to very clearly say, \"I'm staying. I'm here,and I'm going to do whatever I need to do.\"What brought me to where I am in the healingarts ... I really didn't intend to do this. It wasnot even my thought that I would go in thisdirection. I was very much into social work,doing something in humanities for otherpeople, and art. Those are passions and loves.My history in work is I worked at St. Joe's inthe kitchen and as a dietary aide, and I workedin nursing homes when I was very young, andthen in my early twenties I worked in socialwork. I was a youth program director in aninner-city neighborhood for three years. Iworked as a needs assessor for the elderly inWashtenaw County. I did home visits. And Ienjoyed all of that. I worked as a weaver andas a seamstress for a while. I enjoyed all ofthat, but my illnesses were always the chal-lenge, and I was checking out so much,especially with the headaches, that all of myjobs really had to be jobs where I could workmy own hours so that when I was well I wasworking, and when I was not well I was able tobe home.The headaches got so bad in my mid-twentiesthat ... I actually had this one headache thatwas a three-day headache, and afterwards Iwas so debilitated I basically couldn't move. Itwas like my nervous system was close toparalyzed. My arms and my hands (Merri cupsher hands together)\u2014I couldn't do this sort ofa motion where you hold things with yourhands. I couldn't pick up anything with onehand. I had to hold both hands together, andmy hands would shake and tremble and thenactually involuntarily open, so things wouldspring out of my hands and fly across theroom. And I remember sitting in a chair forthree days and kind of going in and out ofconsciousness, and it was at that point in my life that I feltmyself really giving up my own will. I recognized that untilthat point, what had carried me through was will. Eventhough I was facing all these health issues in my life, I hadsuch a strong and tenacious will under it all that I wasgoing to make it no matter what, and I was not only goingto make it, I was going to serve, I was going to do all thesethings with my life that were way beyond just making it.So, when I got to this point and recognized that the vesselbeneath me was not making it, was not going to support meanymore, I just had this conversation with God and said,\"Okay. I don't care anymore. If it is my time to leave, takeme, because I can't fight like this anymore. But if there issomething you need me to do, please just open that up anddirect me in, and whatever it is, whatever I need to do, I'lldo it.\" It was a simple prayer, and there were no flashes oflight, nothing that came in, but it was very honest andprofound. About three days later, things really started to change. I got a phone call from someone who I had called six monthsearlier who became a teacher, and it was the time in my lifethat I recognized that I had to really shift and instead of behealed, I had to become a healer. Before that time, not onlyhad it never really occurred to me that that was what I wasgoing to do, in most ways I had been pushing it away, thatresponsibility. I had never taken even a class in biology.At one point I can remember, when I was working as anurse's aide, a lot of the elderly people were telling me,\"You really need to be a nurse, Merri. You'd be such agood nurse,\" and I turned around and said, \"That's the last thing I'd do. I never want to go into medical care. It is the one thing I am not interested in.\" I was very clear that I wasnot interested in it, and I wasn't. My body hurt. It hurt allthe time. Why would I want to do anything connected withlearning about bodies? (Laughs). Of course, in retrospect,knowing everything I know now, it seems silly, but at thetime, it was true. I didn't want to connect with my body. Ithurt. It hurt a lot.So I guess that was the start. And you don't just become ahealer. I mean, it's such an integration of so much, and Idon't even say that I'm there now. It's just my whole life...Everything that happens to you becomes part of yourlearning process, the good and the bad, and I think especially the bad. The bad really, really teaches you. There's no doubt about it that we are here to experience, tobecome fuller, stronger, clearer spiritual beings, and in orderto do that, we have to process through all of this negative,all of these negative pieces of this plane and all of thethings that maybe in other lifetimes we haven't been able towork with well or in some way have run against and justhave not worked out for us.Claire Crevey: You were talking about negative forces trying to take you out of your body or end your life, andalso talking about God and angels. How do you conceptu-alize or perceive these forces or beings or voices? How dothey manifest?Merri Walters: I think manifestation of spiritual energy in our lives is something that can be hard if you're notrecognizing it in your life, to say, \"Well, what is that?\" Imean, does that mean that glorious angels of light comeand shimmer before you and give you directions? All of us would like that. It does happen sometimes, and I have seen it in my life, but most of the time, that is not what is goingon for any of us, including me. What we are doing islearning to read subtle energy and to recognize the angelicin the subtle around us. We are surrounded, in everyinstance of our life, no matter where we are, with thatenergy, and we have the choice whether or not we're goingto recognize that. In general, the status quo, or the worldwe are being brought up in, the very technological andhard fact-driven world, is pulling us away from this.To give an example, if we were still being raised in more I recognized that until that point, what hadcarried me through was will. When Irecognized that the vessel beneath me wasnot going to support me anymore, I had thisconversation with God and said, \"Okay. Idon't care anymore. If it is my time to leave,take me, because I can't fight like thisanymore. But if there is something you needme to do, please just open that up and directme in, and whatever it is, whatever I need todo, I'll do it.\"The Crazy Wisdom Interviewwith Merri Walters (continued)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2004 Page 18 Merri Walters and her husband, Robin Grosshuesch, live with their eight childrenon Spring Street. indigenous cultures, in Nature, the culture of Nature, we would be surrounded by these energies all the time andtaught to recognize them, taught to recognize just how wereceive messages from the clouds, how we receive mes-sages from weather patterns, how we receive messagesfrom the birds and the animals around us, the way stonesmay be lying on the ground. Those messages are still therenow, are still arriving through Nature and sometimesthrough manmade things.License plates on cars I think are an interesting one. I findthis frequently that I'm driving and having a particularconversation with a Spirit, and I look to the license plate onthe car in front of me or the car that's just pulled up next tome, and the license plate says exactly what we were talkingabout or gives me a confirmation immediately, and it is sointeresting to see that kind of work of Spirit, where thetiming is just coming together that instant. And we cancertainly acknowledge where that would happen where abird would come up because the birdwould be so in tune with that, but whatmakes this car drive up right then, orwhat makes the billboard appear intoyour sight the moment the prayer iscoming through?These things are still happening, thesynchronization of all of that timing stillhappening, and we have to startrecognizing that those messages arethere and asking for them, asking forconfirmation. I often hear from clients,\"How do I know? How do I know if Ishould go this way or that way in mylife, or if I'm really right about what I'mfeeling?\" And I always say, \"Well, ask.Ask for confirmation. And when youstart seeing signs come in, if you're stillunsure, ask for more. It's okay. Youdon't have to be embarrassed to ask for the spiritual worldto give you more confirmation that you're doing the rightthing. They will. We have so much support here. Every-thing we ask for manifests. It may not manifest in the waythat we are expecting it to. It will manifest, though.\"There are times when we ask for something, and seeminglysomething negative comes into our life right away afterwe've asked for it, and we can cry out, \"Oh, I wanted thisgreat thing. I needed riches to support this great missionthat I want to go on, which is a great, spiritual, wonderfulthing that I want to do with my life, and wouldn't thespiritual world support that? Here I am, God. I'm ready todo this work.\" And then something tragic happens thatseemingly takes us away from what we want to do. Seem-ingly. What is really happening is our prayers are beinganswered. What is really happening is that the spiritualworld is saying, \"Yes. But first you have to clear up this, and here's your opportunity todo it quickly, because we're giving you adramatic situation in which, if you can take thisaccumulated energy from probably dozens oflifetimes and probably this huge piece that youhaven't cleared up in your life, and we'll giveyou the tragedy, come and clear it up now sothat you can move into what you're openingyourself to.\"And so the challenge is a good thing, and wehave to start recognizing that, that justbecause we don't want to do it, just because itseems like it's a hard thing, just because all ofmy illness was no fun, and I, like anybody,hate to hurt and hate to go through all thatstuff, it was what I needed to do, and Irecognize that still when I go through illness. Irecognize the value in what I am doing andwhat I am processing, and the compassion I'velearned from it is just enormous. I don't thinkthere's any other way that you can really learnthat but to go through it. Everyone who comesin, it doesn't matter what they have to sharewith me, there's a place I can meet them andunderstand it and hold that with them here. Toresonate with that\u2014it's a powerful thing.CC: You spoke of having a conversation with a Spirit in the car. Do you experience thataurally? Is it like a conversation that you mighthave with another person?Merri Walters: Yes. I'm in a conversation all the time with Spirit. I really feel like that'ssomething that has been steady in my life, thatit is always going on. I feel like I'm alwaysthere, no matter what I'm doing. As far asvoices, yes, I hear voices. I believe that tosome degree, everyone does. Sometimespeople think it's their own mind. Sometimes itis. Your mind can be nervous and chatteringand afraid, but those are mind voices. Spirit is benevolent. Spirit is clear. When you get those really clearvoices, the voices that are coming more from your heartthan from your mind, that's when you can know that theSpirit really is talking to you and that you don't have toquestion that.I do believe that people's minds get the better of them mostof the time, and they do start to question that. They dostart to go, \"Well, that is what I'd really want to do, but ...\" And a huge thing for people is monetary things. \"I don'thave enough money to go to Bali, even though that's whatI keep hearing over and over again, that I need to do that.\"\"I can't really just quit my job and do what my heart'sdesire is because I have all this responsibility, and I'll losemy pension,\" and whatever. All those chattering voices doget in there and get in the way, and those are not the voicesof Spirit. Those are the voices of fear. And that's the waywe can distinguish what we're listening to pretty easily.Does this come from a fear base, or does this come from aloving space? Sometimes we are given warnings. I have been given warnings, and I ask, does a warning come in a fearful way,or does it just come as a warning? \"Don't go there today,\"or \"It's a good day to stay in. It's a good day to go dothis.\" Or, \"Turn left instead of right\" (laughs). I find the warnings come calmly. They don't come as a sense of fear or foreboding. They come calmly, and they come more asdirective: \"Do this to be safe.\"As far as visual things, I have always had visions. I havealways been incredibly visual. As a matter of fact, I didn'treally realize that other people weren't. It's been for mesince I was very, very young, and the visuals can be withmy eyes open. I can see other Spirits in a room, not all thetime, but I can at times, in Nature. But certainly when Iclose my eyes, it's unending (laughs) visuals, very clear,and when I was young, and I talked about them, they werereferred to as my cartoons. \"Merri has cartoons in her head\" (laughs). \"Oh, you see cartoons.\" Which I was finewith. I was never really made to feel bad. I learned fairlyearly what I should be talking about and what I shouldn't. Idid announce certain things to my classes in school atearly ages which were not poorly received, but there wassilence, dead silence, even from the teachers (laughs).CC: What's an example of that? Merri Walters: Oh gosh, when I was in fifth grade, and my fifth grade teacher was unable to control the class, sodiscussions would just break out. Something once brokeout about God, and there was a discussion going on, and Iremember just jumping up and going to the blackboard. Iwas a very, very shy kid, so I didn't speak out much at all.But I drew this circle on the blackboard and this arrow andjust started talking about energy and how God was timelessand how energy could do this, how God could do this, howit could work like a circle, and there wouldn't have to be abeginning or an end, that it could work in this dimension,and I remember going on about it for quite some time, myteacher not stopping me, and no one saying anything whenI was done.Another time, it was also in fifth grade, when I saw a UFO, Iguess you would call it. I was walking up on Sunset, and Iwas going to\u2014I don't want to reveal this\u2014I was going to abaton-twirling lesson (laughs). I was quite the baton-twirleras a young lady. My dad always said I'd be the first femalemajorette for the U of M football team.CC: Alas. Merri Walters: (Laughs). Yeah, I guess there has been one now too, so I can't even still aspire to it. I still have a batonin the basement I get out every once in a while and wow mykids (laughs). But, I was going to this lesson and walkingup on Sunset, and suddenly I stopped right by that AnnArbor water treatment plant and saw a UFO going acrossthe sky there. It was broad daylight, and a car stopped atthe same time, and they got out, and they looked, and I waswatching, and they were watching it, and neither of us saidanything to each other. They were grownups; I wouldn'thave talked to them unless they talked to me. And it was afull, I would say three minutes, but it's hard to judge timewhen you're watching that.And so I remember going to school, just, this was soexciting, and telling my class, and once again, drawing onthe blackboard what I had seen (laughs). You know, I guessthat's so funny. And once again, no one saying anything,and then somebody coming up to me at recess and saying,\"Merri, what you said today wasn't really true, right?\"(Laughs). And I was amazed that somebody would eventhink of not believing. I was really an innocent there,thinking, \"Doesn't everybody want to know?\" and \"It's agood thing,\" and of course, no (laughs). So that was alearning piece for sure, which came up many other times,when I was sort of innocently revealing something. Butthose are two rather remembered times.CC: The first time that I met you, you knew things about me, said things about me that I hadn't told you and thatanyone else I know wouldn't have known just from mewalking into the room. How do you know? How do you getthat information? Merri Walters: I just listen. I'm a great listener. I listen to your Spirit, I listen towhat I'm being told, I see certainenergies, and maybe a gift I have is thatI believe it, and that I'm not afraid tojust say that, because I know it's true. Iknow I'm not just speculating orcoming up with something because Ithink it might be true or something. Iknow that. It's so great now, the wordsI'm speaking ... I didn't have to thinkabout what I was going to talk to youabout. As a matter of fact, I didn't at all.I have allowed the Spirit to speakthrough me. And I do that witheveryone I see. A lot of times I'll findmyself doing what I would call maybecounseling, but it's not me. I say things that me as a person wouldn't say because I wouldn'tmaybe be that hard on a person. I would want to be nice. Igrew up in an era of really being nice. You had to be verynice to everybody. You wouldn't really say what youthought. But sometimes, when someone is sitting there, they really do need to hear something that's fairly critical, but it'sdirect and to the point of what is going on, and the Spiritwill say that without any buffers on it. And I just allow thatto come through, and half the time me as Merri, or theperson here, is sitting there going, \"Wow, that's kindaharsh\" (laughs), or \"I wouldn't have ever come at it fromthat direction.\" Because I have worked in various occupa-tions where I had to do counseling work with teenagersand adults and families and the elderly in many differentways. As a counselor, you wouldn't have been trained to I often hear from clients, \"How do I know? How do Iknow if I should go this way or that way in my life, or ifI'm really right about what I'm feeling?\" And I always say,\"Well, ask. Ask for confirmation. And when you startseeing signs come in, if you're still unsure, ask for more.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2004 Page 19 come through in those ways. You would have maybe sat back and let them figure it out or something, and sometimesthe Spirit does, and sometimes the Spirit is like, \"Actually,something needs to be said here, and it won't be said byanyone else, and we've been saying it to them for a long time, but they're not listening\" (laughs), and so it'll comethrough and be said. So the medicine then is not comingout of a bottle. It's coming through words. So, it's a matterof listening and then responding and allowing that to flowthrough.CC: What different kinds of healing modalities have you studied and do you prefer?Merri Walters: Herbs... I love working with the plants and with herbs, would be one. Homeopathy, flower essences,these are all things I've used. I rely on acupuncture pointsin the body, where I may touch the points to get certain information from a person. To an extent, kinesiology. I have to say I learned everything backwards in that I did notstudy it in terms of, like, plowing through books andmemorizing. Everything has been hands-on. Everything hasbeen a learning by being directed, by being told this is theremedy to use, and then we look and we find out what it'sfor.At this point, I've been doing this so long that I do know afair amount about all of those things, but I didn't when Istarted. I didn't know any of the rules of homeopathy,which allowed me to not have to follow them (laughs). In away, it's been very freeing just to get the directions fromthe Spirit and not have to use the old mold. It's a luxury, Ithink, that I've been given the opportunity to work thatway, because it's very free in that I'm not stuck in oldpatterns.I think there's a veryimportant reason for that.At this time period, we'rereally in a change herethat's been predicted bymany, many different seersand prophets\u2014that wewould come to this time ofevolution of our Spirits.We're really acceleratingour vibration rates andchanging, and the medicineis changing too now, andthe way we use themedicine is changing. It's atime, I believe, that we needto listen to that and becurrent with these newways and use them so wecan really get the most outof these vibrationalmedicines. That's not tosay that all the peoplewho've come before andthe old frameworks werenot important. I do believethat they were and am verygrateful for them, and thepeople who work in thoseframeworks still are veryimportant, that they're here,still, and that they can workwith those frameworks. It's just not my gift. It is not the place where I am supposedto be working or how I amsupposed to be working.And that's been made very clear to me, that I need to sortof be on this new learning curve or be in this place.I've learned from everybody. I truly have had wonderfulteachers. Sometimes just a client, a person who walked intomy life, it could just be very brief, what I learned from them.A child, animals, Nature, everyone teaches me, and thepoint is to be listening. I think everyone has these gifts. Wejust have to open our ears back up and accept them so wecan recognize that everything in our lives is a teaching.CC: Does your healing mix into your family life a lot? You have how many children?Merri Walters: Eight. CC: Wow. Merri Walters: (Laughs). Of course. Yes, my kids are ages five to twenty-two, all at home. Ihave one stepdaughter, and the other sevenwere all born here in the house, home births,beautiful births every one. Yes, the kids arevery much integrated into what I do, and inyears past, I mean, most of them were raisedhere in this office. There used to be a babyperambulator, you know, one of those old cribsor buggies, sitting over here in the corner, and the babies were always either asleep in there,or I was holding them in one arm and workingwith the other arm, and then they'd go frommy arms to the floor over there in the corner,where they would be for the next two years...I had three girls who were close together inage, so there was a time period when all threeof them were at home and in and out and inand out, so there was always some sort ofdynamic going on there while I was working.What I have found is that the kids are part ofthe healing, and the kids have always hadsomething to offer to people I see. It's alwaysbeen very interesting to see what turns upduring the course of a session. Havingchildren, and having a lot of children, teaches you that you really need to give up this need for control. That's certainly some-thing that I've had to do in all of this. What isgoing on with the kids, whether it is pleasantor seemingly disruptive, you have to recognizeas part of the session.Sometimes the kids are playing out somethingthat's going on for the client. Frequently I findthat's happening. I could give you many instances of that,and I think it's always been an important part of the healingwork to have children here and to recognize that they're allhealers, they're doing something too, and to really evokethat from them so that their presence will really be a healingpresence, and then you just watch whatever unfolds. It willbe the right thing. Maybe something calls me out of herebecause a client needs to sit here and get talked to without me here in the room or pick up a book or do something that would happen only because I left the room. Or they need tosee nurturing, or they need to remember a stage of theirown development and reconnect with that or remember atime when they really weren't given what they needed andto see what that should have been like so they can healthat piece.It was common for me to be holding a baby and nursing thebaby and sitting here and listening, and then standing up with this nursing baby and going through and findingremedies and doing this whole thing, you know... Ideveloped my upper body pretty well (laughs). And what'shappening for the client is just this whole spectrum ofhealing energy way beyond what might go down on paperor what herbs they might start to take. There's somethinghappening in their consciousness that really is transform- ing, and possibly it's nottangible, but it's really real.I've never tried to separate myhealing and my children orwhatever's going on in mybusy house because Irecognize that it's all part ofthat.I think an interesting piece isthat you can say, well, kids, ofcourse they're healers, andanimals coming in and out,they can certainly have thathealing influence for people,but other things that youdon't have control over, orlimited control over, may beworking for you too, kind of toyour advantage. I have foundthat sometimes there's workgoing on outside in the streetthat's loud and noisy andseemingly invasive. You know,I don't have any New Agemusic going on (both laugh). Isay, \"Don't come to my housefor that.\" But, I have been ableto see a lot of that sort ofenergy that comes in with theclient go out into that seem-ingly harsh and loud sensoryenergy. It can actually beworking for you, can actuallybe dissipating something or just really digging into an old problem and opening it so itcan be repaired, and alsoteaching us how to center in the middle of the confusion and noisiness and disruptiveenergy that is so present and prevalent in our modern lives.When I've been asked to do truly important things and Iprepare for them, I will find that time after time, as I getready for them, something will come in to try to stop or tryto confuse the issue or try to create an energy that couldreally send you off in a direction that will keep you awayfrom doing what you need to do. Our job is essentially to A Brief Introduction to Flower Essences Flower essences heal emotional imbalances by flooding our systems with the energy vibrations of particular archetypal Soul qualities. Bach flower essence theory divides humanbeings into three parts: the Soul, the Personality, and the Higher Self. The Soul is our immortal,true Self, the Personality is our mortal manifestation or Ego during this lifetime, and the HigherSelf mediates between the Soul and the Personality. The Soul knows the mission we aresupposed to fulfill on Earth, but we may misunderstand or not hear its directions because ofblockages between the Personality and the Higher Self. Flower essences help reestablish the connection between the Personality and the Higher Self. Each flower essence embodies an archetypal Soul quality that is already inherentin our own Souls. For example, a person who has lost touch with the Soul quality of hope maybenefit from Gorse flower essence, as it embodies hope. Just as surrounding ourselves withpeople of high spiritual attainment, eating foods with high vibrational qualities, and contemplat-ing beautiful artwork can uplift us, so flower essences raise our spirits to the vibrational es-sences of specific flowers. Edward Bach, the forefather of flower essences, was an English medical doctor who sought a harmless type of healing more natural and simple than the Western and homeopathicmethods he had studied. In 1930, he abandoned his profitable medical practice in London tospend the last six years of his life studying plants in the Welsh countryside, where he identifiedthirty-eight plants of a \"higher order.\" Since Bach's time, subsequent seekers have discovered additional essences from plants around the world. The traditional method of extracting flower essences is to place theblossoms in a crystal bowl of spring water and leave them in sunlight for three to four hours. Ifpossible, the flowers are bent into the bowl instead of plucked so as not to damage the plants. Flower essences cannot cause harm. If a person takes an inappropriate essence, there are no negative side effects; there is simply no effect at all. The proper essences,however, can have subtle to stunningly profound effects. Flower essences are gentle, simplehealers. They are gifts from Nature.We have so much support here.Everything we ask for manifests.It may not manifest in the waythat we are expecting it to. Itwill manifest, though.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2004 Page 20 ignore that and essentially get more centered, more grounded, more clear, more directed, and just really do what we need to do, no matter how that disruptive energymight try to engage us and take us off into a place wherewe shouldn't be, or take us into our fears, our fears that wecan't do it, that we're falling apart, that we're confused,that we can't handle this.And I think that gets back to that piece I was speaking ofabout maybe anger, but it's not so much anger, but it'spower and that clarity that can come through, just beingable to really harness that kind of power and say, \"I need todo this. This is clear. And there really isn't any dark energyout there that is stronger than this energy I'm harnessing,and so I will do this.\" Once we pull in that energy and wereally believe that and move with it, that other energy can'taffect us. It has no power. Its only power is to attach to ourfears, and if we don't have any fear (laughs), it has noability to take a hold in us, and we will be able to do whatwe're here to do.CC: You said you have a lot of people coming here from outsideAnn Arbor, and I think you once toldme that you've never had to adver-tise. What do you make of that? Howhas that happened, that people hearabout you?Merri Walters: Well, I'm sure word of mouth, which ... I believe I'mgrounding a very strong spiritualforce here, and ... I don't want to saythat that way maybe, even if it maybe what I believe. Yes, I think it's justword of mouth, and if somethingreally needs to go out into the world,it does. I feel like it's a good thingbecause then the people who reallyneed to connect here will connecthere, and do.It means that everybody who crossesthe threshold here is someone I can trustand someone with whom I can build thisrelationship and somebody for whom Ihave something, that I am not solicitingthem. Some other power has brought ustogether, and so we do have a purposealready, and neither of us may know whatthat purpose is, and it's very interestingbecause some people walk through, theyjust like come into my purple office(laughs), and they're like, \"Where am I? Ijust walked out of Ford Motor Company,and here I am in Merri's office with abunch of crystals\" (both laugh).Yeah, and grandmothers, people'smothers, people from small towns and farms... And the funthing for me is often someone will come in and go, \"Oh, myhusband's really skeptical,\" and I'll say, \"Well, bring himin.\" say, \"Is that okay?\" I say, \"Of course.\" Andso their husbands walk in, and always they cross theirarms, and they do this stance over there (Merri crosses herarms over her chest, leans back, and lifts her chin. I laugh).And I watch them, and they're kind of looking around theroom, and they're like, \"Uh huh, uh huh,\" and I just seethem sort of gathering things from the room, like, \"Okay,when I get back in the car with my wife, I could talk aboutthis phooey stuff,\" and whatever they want to kind of putthere, whatever their perceptions might be.So we just do our session, but I talk not only to their wivesbut to them, and what I see is that these spiritual conceptsare something that can resonate in everyone, that there is away of speaking about them that is not confrontational, isnot hokey. There is a way of speaking of them that iscommon to everybody and is something that we all experience and all know, and that's the place I like to come at. I like to find that in everybody. Where are we the same?Where can I bring this out in you? I don't want to wow youwith experiences of other realms and mystify you oranything like that. I want to find our common Spirit and thehealing piece that we all know and experience in our lives.And that's exciting, because what happens then is when you wake that up in someone, they come alive. And yousee them, they become children. You see their faces changefrom this skeptical, worried look to this childlike innocenceand joy, and they can't wait to tell me their stories sud-denly. It's like they've been waiting their whole lives to tellme something, and it starts to come out, and they justbubble, and it's always hard to move 'em out so I can getsome lunch (both laugh) because they have so much tosay. They really connect, and that's really fun.I see this also with people who come in of their own freewill from, like I said, the motor companies, and they reallydon't know where they landed. They're going, \"Oh, mysister-in-law told me to come, and here I am. What's goingon?\" And that's been very exciting work, because whenthey recognize what these medicines are and how they maybenefit from them and what they can speak of and thesupport that's here for them, they're just a lot of fun.CC: Is this kind of work tiring for you? Merri Walters: It can be. Certainly it can be day and night. I can go fromworking with clients to working with neighbors to workingwith emergencies to working with my family to workingwith my animals to, I mean, to getting up in the middle ofthe night to working with the Spirit, working with myself,to... It can just be constant. When you start to recognizethat everything you do is a spiritual experience and isimportant, then you can't really just slough any of it off.In general, when things are that high-energy, the energy isthere for me. If I'm unbalanced, if I'm not listening to all ofthe messages about taking care of myself, if I'm just notkeeping myself balanced, which, you know, I'm human, andit certainly happens, frequently, then yeah, it can be. But if Ican stay with frequencies and stay grounded, it can beenergizing. It is energizing. And yeah, there's always thatenergy to do whatever.I'm still working with a body that is challenged, to say theleast. All my health issues of my younger days\u2014and I guess having seven babies has probably taken some energy from me, but I don't feel like I feel that that much\u2014but there are challenges just in my physical makeup that Ialways have to be working with. It's not as though I'vehealed everything permanently within me. It'd be nice. Nottrue at all. It is constant upkeep. I have to listen to my ownadvice to other people about taking care of myself and making sure that I stay current with remedies and medicinesand food and sleep and joy and fun and all of those thingsin my life.Working with the energies I work with is very complex.There's such a grid of energies going on at any givenmoment. It's which ones you focus your attention on. It's achallenge to always be where you should be. Sitting in myoffice and working with one person, that's relatively easyand clear for me at this point, but then I can leave here andmake dinner and find what mess my daughters made, andthere are just all of these other types of responsibilities ...to be a mother to so many different ages, and checking outyour children, where they are, and what sorts of lifeexperiences they're in right now or emotional develop-ments, and all of their needs have to be looked at, and so itcan get really complicated.CC: Was there anything you were hoping to talk about in the interview?Merri Walters: Yes. I'd like to talk about sort of the exciting piece of my life that's going on right now, and that is, well, I've used flower essencesextensively with my clients and withmyself for many, many years andhave had all these different relation-ships with them. I have two thousandflower essences or something likethat, and my experiences have beenso profound.And in the past, there have beenmany times when I was asked tomake an essence here or there, whichI did, but it was mostly\u2014those werejust not really for the public but forpersonal, not so much personal work,but for more Earth work, or spiritual prayer work that was beingdone on other realms or otherlevels. And I had, onceagain\u2014I think back to thetimes when I said, well, Iwasn't going to go intohealing work, and I was clearabout that\u2014I've been sort ofclear that I was not going tobe a flower essence makerbecause lots of other peopledid that, and I really respected the work that they do. And I'mbusy. I'm so busy. I said, \"Idon't have the time for this,and I will use all of thesegifts.\"Then this summer I went toAlaska and studied with SteveJohnson, who makes Alaskan flower essences, and Jane Bell, and in my conversationswith them and in the work we did together had this recogni-tion or this clarity. Well, what Steve said to me was thatwhen I did the channeling work from the essences that wemade together, he said, \"I have never ever seen such clearmessages from the flowers as what you've written.\"And it was interesting to me because I'm pretty dyslexic,and I can't write. Like, if you just asked me, if I weresupposed to write my life story or write something like that,unless the Spirit were right there holding my pen, I couldn'tdo it, which the Spirit is when I do these essences. And Iwas really taken aback because I didn't really realize that ...I always thought that what I was reading in books werevery direct messages, that they hadn't been worked on,they hadn't been edited. And he said, \"Well, you know, ittook me ten years to put my book together and to writethose things.\" They were worked on, and I didn't knowthat. So that was a real surprise. And he said, \"This is yourwork.\"So I came back to Michigan knowing this. And like I said, itwasn't as though I hadn't made them in the past, but Ireally hadn't thought that this was any kind of a calling. Ihad pretty much negated that whole idea. So what hap-pened was as soon as I opened myself to it and asked forthe help from a spiritual plane for that, it started to happenso rapidly, not only for me but my husband too, Robin,who, we work together, and it's been just a really amazingprocess.So far, it's been many essences, maybe twenty-eight orsomething since August. But what's been interesting iswhat has come through. It's not been what I would haveguessed at all, because we don't go out and say, \"Well, thisplant's blooming, and that plant's blooming. Let's do this.\"As a matter of fact, I didn't make any flower essences allsummer. We made environmental essences all summer thatwe were asked to make.When it came to late September, it was the first time I was When you get those really clear voices, the voices that arecoming more from your heart than from your mind, that'swhen you can know that the Spirit really is talking to you andthat you don't have to question that.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2004 Page 21 Merri's thyme (to the left)was growing in thewinter, under thesnow, and wasfull of flowers. Merri's crab apple tree (to the right)was blossomingwith crab apples on it, at the end of September. asked to make a flower essence, and I thought, well, there wasn't a whole lot out. First of all, I was back in town,where I had been up on the lake, which is where I wouldhave thought that you needed to make essences, in remoteplaces, not in the middle of a city. And the first thing thathappened was they asked me to make this flower essence,and I said, \"Well, what do you want? There's astors andmums out here, you know (laughs). Just tell me...\" And thenext day I was sitting outside with my husband, we werehaving a prayer, and I looked up, and we had a cherry treein our yard that had died, and I looked up, and it was full ofblossoms and green leaves in September. I'll show yousome pictures. (Merri opens a three-ring binder and showsme a picture of the cherry tree in blossom).This is the cherry tree. The tree blossomed for a month,from September 13 th, which was the first day I saw the blossoms, all the way through to the end of October, it wasstill blossoming, putting out lots of blossoms. Of course,cherry trees don't blossom in September to begin with, anddead cherry trees don't blossom at all (both laugh). So thiswas the first one.(Merri shows me pictures of more plants). Then we hadstrawberries. Lots of strawberries blossomed in September.Yeah, this was the end of September. They blossomed for awhole month. Now, there was no cold weather in Septem-ber. Nothing like that would make the plants think that ithad been winter.Then this is a crab apple tree that was blossoming with thecrab apples on it, and that was the end of September. Itblossomed for a week. And this is feverfew that wasblossoming in November, and very, very cold out there. Ithad frosted several times, and feverfew is a July plant. Itblooms in the heat of summer.Lavender. You can't really tell what season this is; it's kindof a crummy picture. I'm no photographer, but anyway, thiswas lavender on the eighth of November. And this here isphlox. Now, phlox is such a delicate flower. There wereprobably twenty-five phlox blooming out there. You cansee the ice, and snow was flying in the air, and the phloxwas blooming. So that was the fifteenth of November. Thisis primrose blooming, and you can see the ice in the bucketright there in the yard on the same day, and it was eightdegrees, ten degrees, it was very, very cold and had beenfor two weeks.And then on the winter solstice, I went out there and dugunder the snow to get some thyme for the food I wasmaking. And thyme traditionally will last the winter. It'll beunder the snow, and you can always go get some, and itusually looks kind of bad and, you know, it's not likegrowing thyme, it's just your old thyme, and it's kind ofholding on there underneath the snow, and it's frozen. So Iuncovered the thyme, and it's not only been growing, it'sprolific, and it is full of flowers, everywhere I go. And Ikeep digging up, digging up, and there was like this muchsnow (Merri indicates about five inches) out there, andthere's thyme just blossoming all over the place.So when we did go to make the plant essences, they werenot just flower essences. They were these amazing flowersthat had come around. And the messages that we'regetting\u2014because it's pretty clear, that these were differentthings, different support\u2014but all of them are support forthese dramatic and changing times. The plants have reallyalready shifted their reality, where they can bloom in thewinter. And we haven't. And so they're trying to show usthis perceptual problem that we're having, that we justneed to make this transition now.CC: And you make the essences by putting them in bowls? Merri Walters: Yes, there has to be some sort of a vessel to hold\u2014and we've been taught a lot about making theessences because I don't assume anything, once again,you know, I don't assume that I do it this way just becausethat's the way it had been done, and so some of them havebeen made in nontraditional ways. You just have to listen, you have to ask what is being asked and how and allow that to ... (Merri shows me a picture of crab apple treeblossoms and crab apples floating in a bowl of water). Thecrab apple tree blossoms are in the bowl along with thecrab apples, so you have the fruit and the flower, whichwould never be happening at the same time. They'reopposite ends of the year.CC: That's wild. Merri Walters: (Laughs). When this started happening, it was just like it was too much, and when the first threehappened, I was sure that was the end of it, 'cause that wasamazing. Well, the first one was enough. And then theother two just happened within the next couple weeks, and I thought, \"Well, there are the three essences.\" I didn'teven ask or go outside or even think that more might behappening, and I really kind of got dragged out with thisfeverfew. I was told to go outside and \"We want you tomake an essence,\" and I said, \"Well, okay, what do youwant?\" (laughs), and then we find that...Yeah, I guess I just wanted to say that. And I don't knowwhere this is going, other than I recognize that this is veryimportant medicine for this time, and I've seen ways to putthis into the world in swift and effective ways for peopleand to take flower essences into this new place where theykind of come out of that mystique that they've been heldin, and that we can really access the support that's comingto us right now so that we can make it and so that we canhold all our energetic bodies together through all this quickchanging. And Nature's right there. Nature is so ready tobreak this and help us. It's totally forgiving of all theterrible and destructive things that we've done and all theways we've tried to not connect and shut out all of this. Itsays, \"I'll come right to the middle of the city. I'm here. I'll... blossom in the winter.\"CC: You said you had been asked to make some essences not for clients or not for people? What would they be forthen?Merri Walters: For spiritual transitions that need to happen, for the Earth itself... It's possible that somedaythey will be for people, but I think we as people only reallythink of everything in human terms. How will they benefitus? How will they benefit our soul development? But weneed to start recognizing, well, there's all this otherdevelopment that's going on too, for the animals, for theplants, for the Earth herself, and in other realms, in theangelic realms; that there are actually things going on, andfor those that have passed on, that they still need ourprayers, that there are things going on in these energetic realms that need assistance, that need us. We've forgotten our job here to be spiritual caretakers.That there are things that the angels can't do, that basicallythey can support us so that we can do them, but we arephysical, and we have abilities to pick up rocks and movethem or not pick them up because they need to stay there;that we have this responsibility to be able to draw what isavailable in light form from the spiritual world through ourbodies and ground it into this Earth and manifest it on a physical plane.I think I can't really speak of all this, though, and not atleast bring into this how important my family is in all of thisbecause I have incredible support in my household. Myhusband Robin is so right there with everything\u2014I don'twant to say that I do, that we do\u2014and from the beginning it's been our spiritual work together and recognized assuch, and we spend a large part of our days and livesdevoted to prayer together, prayer with the Earth, prayerwith our children. And the kids are really right there tooand just such incredible teachers, and such beautiful,beautiful shining lights. In some ways, it's a lot to take onto say \"Yeah, I'm going to raise eight kids and then doanything at all\" (laughs). I mean, it would be a life's missionin itself, but it's all been so interwoven in beautiful ways.We spend the entire month of August traveling together asa family and camping, and it's just taken us all over thecountry and Canada and many places that are ... Our tripshave always been not Self-directed but Spirit-directed, likewe actually pray to ask where we're going. Sometimes wedon't find out until we're going almost. And then we havethe daily prayers that will redefine things, like, \"Do we stayhere? Do we leave? Where are we going from here?\" Andthey have been such incredible journeys into the world,where things have happened because of the way we'reallowing the Spirit to integrate or work with us and directus, that things will certainly happen that constantly bringus to a certain place at an exact time that something isabout to happen.I remember once in Florida... I had written on a piece ofpaper in a notebook, just a random notebook, to have aprayer at one in the afternoon on a certain date. Now, thatdate was in about three years, and I just thought, \"Okay,\"(laughs) and I just put it away. So, three years later... I'dseen it occasionally, but it was so far away I just didn'tthink about it and said, \"Well, it will emerge when it needsto, if it needs to.\" And as I was packing to go to Florida,this notebook just kind of fell out of my desk, and I wastold, \"Take this one.\" I said, \"Okay,\" and I took it.Then in Florida, the day before that date, I walked into thebedroom I was staying in at my mother's house, and thenotebook was open to that page. And there was this littlenote on it, and I said, \"That's tomorrow.\" I mentioned it tomy husband, and he goes, \"Well, okay. Well, we'll do that.\"So then the next day, we had kind of forgotten, and we weregoing to go to the beach, and we're getting ready to go tothe beach, and we go to the beach, and then suddenly, justbefore one o'clock, he goes, \"We need to do a prayer now,don't we?\" And I said, \"Oh, yeah, right\" (laughs).So we open up this prayer, and the moment we opened it up, a row of eight or nine dolphins just came up to thebeach. Everyone on the beach started shouting, \"Look! Look!\" And these dolphins all came, and they lined up, and they just started dancing out there. And I was like, \"Wow.\"But that's just spiritual timing. You just listen, and whateverthe directions are, if you're right there with it, they'll giveyou your signs. They'll let you know that you're rightwhere you should be. I've seen it happen so many times. Itisn't just coincidence or something like that. It's definitely,definitely happening. ### When you start to recognize that everything you do is aspiritual experience and isimportant, then you can'treally just slough any of it off.The Crazy Wisdom Interviewwith Merri Walters (continued)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2004 Page 22 Merri Walters, breathing, in her garden.
