The mass COVID-19 vaccinate site that opened under the blue whale in April 2021 is closing Thursday, museum officials said. \"The museum is so proud to have partnered with the city on this historic and lifesaving effort,\" said Museum President Ellen V. Futter. \"It is my hope that, in years to come, images of people getting vaccinated under the iconic blue whale in the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life will be a reminder of New York and New Yorkers fighting back, caring for themselves and one another, and of the museum providing support and hope.\" Medical professionals with New York City Health + Hospitals will be at the site until 5 p.m., providing vaccinations and booster shots to all eligible New Yorkers. Free at-home COVID-19 testing kits are also available at the site. All New Yorkers that receive their shot at the museum will also get a voucher for complimentary general admission for up to a group of four. The vouchers can be redeemed online to reserve timed-entry for a future visit. Museum officials said a mobile vaccination bus will be stationed outside the museum at 77th Street and Central Park West beginning Friday to serve anyone looking for a walk-in vaccination. While the vaccination site was moved out of the Millstein Hall of Ocean Life in July 2021, the museum has kept the 6-foot-long bandage on the iconic blue whale. More than 97,000 COVID-19 vaccinations were administered at the site, according to museum officials. The closure of the vaccination site comes shortly after New York City health officials said they are planning to start administering second booster shots for those 50 and older. "}
