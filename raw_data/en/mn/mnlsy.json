At age two, most kids can walk without any help. They're also ready to run and kick a ball. But you can't expect them to play well or understand the rules of a ball game like a [6-year-old](https://motherhoodcommunity.com/toys-for-6-year-old-boys/). Many of them already recognize the ABCs, basic shapes and colors, and numbers 1-10, but usually fewer than your [preschooler](https://motherhoodcommunity.com/preschool/) or 5-year-old. Simple puzzles can be ideal for this age group. Educational toys like Montessori-based and STEM toys (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), sometimes also called STEAM toys, encourage them to learn more and improve their fine motor skills. Their problem-solving skills are better than a one-year-old, and they're likely curious about how things work. They try to use knobs, switches, buttons, etc., on toys. (1) They can build more complex structures using blocks and similar toys during playtime. Tots this age love imaginative play, so you can also pick toy sets like play kitchens, train sets, playhouses, dolls or action figures, and toy lawn mowers or similar pretend toys. You can also encourage them to spend time outdoors by offering [fun outdoor toys](https://motherhoodcommunity.com/outdoor-toys-for-1-year-old/). Yet they can still have fun and learn during bath time. How Many Toys Should A 2-Year-Old Have? There isn't a specific rule or guideline that sets how many toys a child should have. However, a 2018 Infant Behavior and Development study showed that children with fewer toys in their environment could focus more and play more creatively because they spend more time with each toy. (2) The researchers recommend letting your child play with fewer toys at a given time to support their development and promote healthy, creative play. (2) This is also in line with the Montessori method. With Montessori play, your child gets limited options during playtime, but you rotate their collection to let them explore all their toys. How Do I Keep My 2-Year-Old Entertained All Day? You might notice that your two-year-old has a shorter attention span than a much older child, such as an 8-year-old. So, keeping them entertained all day can be a challenge. Some parents set up different play areas around the house. For example, your kids can play with their train set in the living room, but blocks and puzzles are only for their room. Arts and crafts can be in their study area or bedroom. You can also assign one spot for your 2-year-old and a different spot for your 7-year-old or other older kids, especially because they probably have different interests. Your kids aren't likely to stay in one spot for more than just a few minutes, so you can also offer other options. Let them play music, run outside or play with outdoor toys (such as trikes), create art, or learn new skills with other toys (such as a balance bike). Books and wooden toys can also offer hours of entertainment for your kids. Factors To Consider In Buying The Best Gifts & Toys For 2-Year-Olds Most of the [factors to consider when choosing toys for 1-year-olds](https://motherhoodcommunity.com/toys-for-1-year-olds/) also apply to toys for 2-year-olds: - Safety - check for product recalls and unsafe parts - Materials - organic, child-safe materials are preferable - Age range - Quality and durability - Educational value - Learning resources - Activity level Dangers To Watch Out For - Choking risks - Batteries - Magnets - Magnets - Loud noises - Sharp edges - Sharp points - Small toys or those with small parts (choking risk) - Long cords and strings (suffocation risk) - Shooting toys - Flying toys - Needs electricity - Glass - Brittle plastic - Splinters - Harmful or toxic chemicals Toxic Chemicals & Materials To Avoid Studies show that the following chemicals can cause cancer, fertility problems, premature puberty, liver or kidney dysfunction, behavioral problems (such as aggressiveness and hyperactivity), or other health concerns: (3) - PVC (polyvinyl chloride) - BPA (bisphenol-A) - Phthalates - Heavy metals (such as lead and cadmium) - Formaldehyde - Polystyrene (such as Styrofoam - Polycarbonate - AZO dyes - Flame retardant chemicals - Asbestos - Radon Safer Alternatives If possible, choose organic, ethical, and sustainably sourced materials.

It depends on their interests. While parents typically choose baby dolls, kitchen sets, and other \"girly\" or feminine stuff for their little girls, there aren't absolute rules that stop them from playing with toys for 2-year-old boys. If you aren't sure, you can always observe which toys your child likes to play with, so you can choose similar items or offer them variety, depending on their needs and your observations. For example, you can let your kids use their imaginations to create stuff using the Imagine Childhood Eco-Dough ($20). It's more expensive than the Play-Doh Drizzly Ice Cream Playset ($15.99) which already has six modeling compounds and an ice cream maker toy, but it can be a safer option. Although Play-Doh maintains that its products are non-toxic, there are concerns that it might have questionable ingredients. (10) Other Learning Toys For Different Age Groups "}
