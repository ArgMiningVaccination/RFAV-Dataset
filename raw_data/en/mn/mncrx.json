The mRNA vaccines are Pfizer or Moderna. Children 6 months through 5 years may need multiple doses to be up to date. The number of updated doses a person may need varies by age, vaccine, previous COVID-19 vaccines received, and if someone is immunocompromised. At this time, there are three different vaccines available: Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax (Novavax is only authorized for children age 12 and older). The CDC does not recommend one of the vaccines over the other. Each vaccine helps protect children from getting very sick with COVID-19. Not all vaccination locations will have each vaccine available. The most important thing is not to miss an opportunity to get your child vaccinated. For more information on the vaccines visit [CDC: Overview of COVID-19 Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html). - Find Vaccine Locations at clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies near you. - Minnesota offers free vaccination through the COVID-19 Community Vaccination Program where you can make an appointment or walk in. Insurance and identification are not needed. - In-home COVID-19 vaccination is available upon request for those who may have difficulties going to a clinic or other vaccine location. Learn more about eligibility for an in-home vaccine and how to request an appointment at [In-Home Vaccination Program](/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/inhome.html). For more on how vaccines are approved or authorized, made, and tested visit [Available COVID-19 Vaccines and Safety](/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/vaxsafety.html). Who should get vaccinated Vaccination is recommended for all people 6 months of age and older. This includes people with underlying medical conditions; people who have had COVID-19, are pregnant, or are immunocompromised; and those of different ages, races, and ethnicities. People who have had a life-threatening reaction to a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine should not get that vaccine. They may want to talk to an allergy specialist. You or your family may have already received the original COVID-19 vaccine, but that one only protected you from the original strain of COVID-19. There are now variants circulating that continue to make people sick. The updated COVID-19 vaccine provides protection against the original strain and these newer variants, so it's important to make sure you have received at least one updated vaccine to be up to date. You should get vaccinated even if you already had COVID-19. People may have some protection after being infected with COVID-19, but that protection decreases quickly. Protection from vaccination lasts longer. People 6 months of age and older can get vaccinated after you have completed your isolation period and are feeling better. Refer to [If You Are Sick or Test Positive](/diseases/coronavirus/sick.html) for more information. If your illness caused you to be hospitalized, talk to your health care provider about timing of vaccination. Consider these things before vaccination: - If you or your child have been identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19, you can get vaccinated as long as you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. However, you may consider waiting until your period to wear a mask is over to help make sure that any side effects experienced after vaccination are just from the vaccine, and not COVID-19 symptoms Visit [Close Contact or Exposure to COVID-19](/diseases/coronavirus/close.html)for more information. - If you or your child has a mild illness (e.g., sore throat, stuffy nose, etc.), get tested for COVID-19 and wait until symptoms have improved and until you or your child have been fever-free for 24 hours, without using medicine that lowers fevers, before getting vaccinated. CDC recommends that people ages 6 months and older receive at least one updated (bivalent) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The mRNA vaccines are Pfizer or Moderna. The number of bivalent doses varies by age, vaccine, previous COVID-19 vaccines received, and whether the person has a weak immune system. For example, children age 6 months through 5 years may need more than one bivalent dose to be up to date. For more information on the vaccines, including recommended schedules visit [CDC: Overview of COVID-19 Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html). Parental or guardian consent is required for COVID-19 vaccination of children younger than 17 years of age, except under rare or special circumstances. (Refer to Minnesota Statutes, sections 144.341 through 144.347.) We encourage you to go with your child so you can ask questions and learn more about the vaccine.

[COVID-19 Vaccine for Youth with Special Needs or Disabilities: Information for Caregivers (PDF)](/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/vaxspecial.pdf) Includes guidance for requesting accommodations when making appointments or arriving at a vaccine site. Updated 5/15/23 COVID-19 vaccination is strongly recommended for people who are pregnant, recently pregnant, breastfeeding, and considering pregnancy in the future. - Pregnant and recently pregnant people are more likely to get very sick with COVID-19 disease compared with non-pregnant people. The data show the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can protect a pregnant person and their growing baby from severe illness from COVID-19. - A person who is breastfeeding can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. There is no reason to avoid starting or continuing breastfeeding after getting vaccinated. - There is no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines affect future fertility. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who want to get pregnant someday or are currently trying to get pregnant. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about COVID-19 vaccines. [COVID-19 Vaccines and Pregnancy (PDF)](/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/vaxpregnancy.pdf) Fact sheet for people who are pregnant or who may want to get pregnant in the future. Updated 5/16/23 Learn more at [CDC: COVID-19 Vaccines While Pregnant or Breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html). Immunocompromised means a person has a weak immune system. People with advanced or untreated HIV infection, other immunocompromising conditions, or who take medications or therapies that weaken the immune system might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. The vaccine may not work as well in immunocompromised people because they may not have a strong immune response to the vaccine (they may have less protection). Because of this, CDC recommends that people with certain immunocompromising conditions receive additional doses of vaccine. For more information visit [CDC: COVID-19 Vaccines for Moderately to Severely Immunocompromised People](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). People should talk to their health care provider about their medical condition and what vaccine doses they need. Vaccine doses All people age 6 months and older should receive at least one updated (bivalent) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The mRNA vaccines are Pfizer or Moderna. Children 6 months through 5 years may need multiple doses to be up to date. Vaccine recommendations and the number of doses you are recommended to get are different depending on your age, the vaccine you first received, and whether you have certain health conditions that weaken your immune system. For more information on recommended vaccination schedules visit [CDC: Overview of COVID-19 Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html). Your health care provider can also provide information on which vaccine you are getting and how many dose(s) you will need. To have the best protection against COVID-19, you should make sure you are up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines. Over time, the protection from a vaccine can decrease. This means you or your family may be more likely to get very sick. Staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines by making sure you've received the updated vaccine will help keep protection against COVID-19 high. The updated vaccine was made to fight the strains of COVID-19 that are more commonly circulating through our communities right now. Previous shots helped prevent serious illness and hospitalization against the original strain of COVID-19, and the updated vaccine helps protect against newer strains to prevent people from getting very sick. For more information, visit [CDC: Stay Up to Date with Your COVID-19 Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). Your health care provider can provide information on which vaccine you are getting and how many dose(s) you will need to stay up to date. Getting vaccinated - A mask. Some vaccination locations may require use of a face covering for all visitors, regardless of vaccination status. - Your health insurance information if you have it. If you do not have health insurance, that is OK. You do not need health insurance to get the vaccine. - Legal ID if you have one and feel comfortable sharing it. You do not need a legal ID to get the vaccine. - Your vaccination card if you are getting any additional dose(s). You should receive a card when you get your first COVID-19 vaccine that has the vaccine product you got and the date you were vaccinated. - The vaccine card is for your own record. - Hold on to your vaccine card and if additional dose(s) are indicated bring the card with you to your appointment so that all doses can be recorded on the same card. - Keep your card in a safe place with your other records. - Take a picture of your card on your phone. - Do not laminate your card because additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine may be recommended, and it is simpler to keep all the doses on one card. If you lose your card: - It is OK if you lose your card. If you lose it between shots, ask for a new one when you get another dose and ask them to record your previous dose(s) on it. - If you have received previous doses and need that information you can request your vaccination record from the health department to see which vaccine product you got and if you need your next dose. - Your health care provider can also look up your vaccination record to help determine if you should get another dose(s). - You can request a copy of your immunization record, which includes similar information to the vaccine card at [Find My Immunization Record](/people/immunize/miic/records.html). - If you were vaccinated in another state or country, go to [Find My Immunization Record](/people/immunize/miic/records.html)under \"What if my MIIC record is missing immunizations?\". [Lost Your Vaccine Card? (PDF)](/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/lostcard.pdf) Fact sheet with steps you can take if you lose your vaccine card. Updated 7/18/22 It is not recommended to take over-the-counter medications before getting your vaccine to prevent side effects. Taking over-the-counter medicines after getting the shot is OK if you have side effects. Take what you normally would take in that situation. If you take over-the-counter medications for a different condition/pain management, it is OK to take them on your regular schedule even when you are getting the vaccine. When you get your COVID-19 vaccine, you will be asked to share your full name, date of birth, address, phone number, and gender. You do not have to be a resident of Minnesota to get vaccinated here. You will never be asked about your immigration status when getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Getting vaccinated will not impact your eligibility to gain lawful permanent residence status (green card). You will not be identified as a public charge. The person who gives you the vaccine is required to enter vaccine data into Minnesota's immunization information system, the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC). MIIC keeps track of someone's vaccination history and makes sure they get the right vaccinations at the right time. Find more information at [About MIIC](/people/immunize/miic/about.html). MIIC collects name, date of birth, address, phone number, and various information related the vaccination itself (administration date, vaccine type, lot number, etc.). MDH shares de-identified vaccine data (general information that does not include the person's name) with the federal government (CDC) every day. This means that the data could not be traced back to a specific person. MDH does not share any information with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines (like flu vaccine). You can also receive a COVID-19 vaccine if you recently received another vaccine. All COVID-19 vaccines are free. However, health care providers can charge an administration fee to insurance companies for giving the vaccine to someone. This means that you might be asked for your insurance information when you get the COVID-19 vaccine. If you have insurance, you should provide that information when you get your vaccine. The administration fee helps cover costs of staffing, space, printing, extra supplies, and more. You can still get the COVID-19 vaccine if you do not have insurance. No one should receive a bill for the vaccine or administration fee. If you get a bill, call the place where you got your vaccine or your health insurance company. MDH and health care providers are doing some outreach to contact Minnesotans who have not been vaccinated, but they will never ask for your bank account, credit card, or Social Security number in order to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

After getting the vaccine It takes about two weeks for your body to build up initial protection after your primary vaccine series. Some people who are vaccinated will get sick, but vaccination greatly reduces the chance of hospitalization and death. Even when you are vaccinated, you should: - Wear a mask when recommended. For more information, refer to [Masks: COVID-19.](/diseases/coronavirus/facecover.html) - Wash your hands often. - Stay home if you are sick, especially if you have been around someone who has COVID-19. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested. Learn more at [CDC: Symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). - If you travel, follow CDC requirements and recommendations at [Travel During COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html). - Follow guidance specific to your workplace. Some side effects are common after vaccination. They are a result of your body responding to the vaccine (it's also OK if you don't have any side effects at all). Side effects happen within a day or two of vaccination and go away one to two days later. You may have: - Pain where you received the vaccine - Feeling tired - Headache - Achy muscles and joints - Chills - Fever - Swelling in your armpit If your symptoms don't go away or get worse, you may have been exposed to COVID-19 before your body had time to build the protection from the vaccine. Get tested if you think you may have COVID-19. Serious adverse events A serious adverse event is something that results in hospitalization or is life-threatening. Most adverse effects occur in the six weeks after getting a vaccine. If you have a severe reaction, contact your health care provider. If it is an emergency, go to a hospital or call 911. There have been reports of some serious allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, most occurring 15-30 minutes following vaccination. Allergic reactions like this are known to happen after taking medicines or getting vaccinated, but they are still very rare. Clinics are prepared to respond quickly to adverse reactions. You may be asked to wait 15-30 minutes after you have been vaccinated so that clinic staff can observe you. Learn more at [CDC: Selected Adverse Events Reported after COVID-19 Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html). Myocarditis and pericarditis Some people who have received the Pfizer, Moderna, or Novavax COVID-19 vaccines have had rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart). In most cases, symptoms began within seven days after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been in young men. The chance of having this occur is very low and is higher in people with COVID-19 disease than after vaccination. Seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving COVID-19 vaccine: - Chest pain - Shortness of breath - Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart For more information, visit [CDC: Myocarditis and Pericarditis Following mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html). Side effects can happen after vaccination and can be similar to symptoms of illnesses, like COVID-19. These side effects can include pain, swelling, or redness where the shot was given. Less common side effects can include headache, fatigue, or fever. - If you are experiencing side effects where the shot was given (such as pain, swelling, or redness), but you are otherwise well, you can return to work or school. Typically, side effects start within a day of receiving the vaccine and may last for three days. - If you are experiencing other symptoms of illness like fever, headache, or noticeable tiredness, then you should stay home. These may or may not be due to the vaccine. With any of these symptoms, stay home until your symptoms are improved and you have not had a fever for 24 hours. If symptoms worsen or last longer than three days, stay home and call your health care provider. Because the virus that causes COVID-19 is still in our communities, it is possible that you were exposed to COVID-19 before or around the same time you were vaccinated, so it may be helpful to get tested. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) or ibuprofen are effective in managing vaccine side effects including pain where the shot was given, body aches, and fever after you get vaccinated. Cool cloths may relieve the swelling or pain at the injection site. Move or exercise your arm. Take the medicine you usually take when you have pain or fever or follow the instructions of your health care provider. If you have a severe reaction, contact your health care provider. If it is an emergency, go to a hospital or call 911. Providers should report severe reactions (those that require some type of medical care) to the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/). This reporting system helps the CDC and FDA continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine breakthrough cases (where someone becomes sick with the disease after being up to date on vaccinations) are expected and normal. No vaccine works 100% of the time, but there is still a lot of value in getting vaccinated. We know these vaccines are safe and help keep people from ending up in the hospital or dying from COVID-19. If you do get sick, it is likely that your symptoms will be milder than if you didn't get vaccinated. You can learn more about breakthrough data in Minnesota at [COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Weekly Update](/diseases/coronavirus/stats/vbt.html). There are a few reasons we have started to see more vaccine breakthrough cases: - As more people are vaccinated while COVID-19 virus is still in our communities (especially when a lot of disease is circulating), more of the cases we identify will be in vaccinated people. The vaccine will never fully protect everyone from disease. - Things people choose to do may be more or less risky, such as going to large gatherings, hanging out in crowded settings, traveling, etc. It also depends on how much COVID-19 virus is currently circulating in a community and vaccination rates. Vaccination continues to be the best tool in our prevention toolbox against COVID-19. People who are vaccinated will have a less severe illness and are much less likely to be hospitalized or die than people with similar risk factors who are not vaccinated. It is still important to continue to use other tools for best protection, such as masking, frequent handwashing, getting tested when needed, and keeping physical distance from others. People who have been vaccinated should make sure they still get tested if they have symptoms of COVID-19 disease. What Are Vaccine Breakthrough Cases?

The more people who get vaccinated against COVID-19, the better it is for everyone. More people vaccinated means that there will be less disease in our communities. Vaccination will also help prevent the spread of new COVID-19 variants. Herd immunity is also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or social immunity. This is when most people in a population or group are immune to a disease. Being immune means they cannot get the disease because either they got a vaccine, or they already had the disease and cannot get it again, at least for a while. When a lot of people are immune, it helps to protect other people in the population who are not immune. Having herd immunity can stop or slow the spread of disease because it is harder for the germ to find people who are susceptible to disease and make them sick. We do not know enough about COVID-19 to be sure herd immunity is possible. This is a new disease, so there has not been enough time to fully study immunity yet. It is possible that even with most of the population vaccinated, COVID-19 will still be able to spread in the population but at a much lower level/rate. People can become very sick, be hospitalized, and or even die from COVID-19. This is why we do not want to rely on herd immunity happening by causing illness in everyone. Vaccination lets a person's body develop protection against a disease without having to actually get sick and [long COVID](/diseases/longcovid/index.html), hospitalization, or death.
