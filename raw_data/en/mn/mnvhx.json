Great news: it doesn't just taste good, it also provides a host of benefits for mind, body & soul. From green to black to herbal varieties, each tea has its own set of healing properties. We can definitely drink to that A worldwide trend Tea has been extremely popular in the East since ancient times. However, here in the West, tea is currently undergoing a bit of a renaissance. Sales of green and herbal teas have never been higher, and the emergence of tea bars suggests that people are starting to think of the drink more like coffee. Namely, that you can become a connoisseur and develop a deep appreciation for certain types. In fact, most high-end coffee houses have an extensive selection on the menu for those who would rather forgo the bean in favour of a tea bag. How tea can help heal you Depending on which type you drink, tea has significant health benefits. For example, herbal tea can help alleviate frequently occurring health problems like stomach pains and headaches. If you select a herbal tea with ginger, this stimulates circulation and can combat nausea. Ones featuring liquorice can act as a cough suppressant, soothing a sore throat. Green tea can definitely be considered a superfood, thanks to its abundance of antioxidants. It is widely acknowledged in Eastern medicine as a way to purify the body and keep the mind sharp.

A soulful tradition that started in Asia After reading about tea's various health benefits, it will come as no surprise that it originated as a medicinal drink in Southwest China. It evolved into a more recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty and wasn't exported to Europe until the 16th century. In the meantime, tea became so integral in certain Asian cultures that entire ceremonies were built around it. The Chinese gongfu tea ceremony, for example, transforms the preparation of tea into an intricate practice. Gongfu, which literally means, \"making tea with skill\" requires the perfect water temperature and many specific pieces of equipment, just to name a few aspects. Chad\u00f5, translated from Japanese as \"the way of tea\" centres around the presentation of [matcha](https://www.rituals.com/en-us/mag-food-matcha-recipes.html), or powdered green tea. The Chad\u00f5 ceremony is counted as one of the three classical Japanese arts of refinement, along with incense appreciation and flower arrangement. Creating your own tea ceremony You probably notice that when you drink tea, you feel calmer. If you savour the various sensations: the aromatics, the warmth running down your throat and the way your hands feel around a mug, it's easy to understand why. Tea, because it is served so hot, can't be gulped down in a hurry\u2014it must be sipped slowly. The physical act of slowing down can impact your thoughts and slow them down as well.
