Medically-supervised detox is the typical, first step in recovery. Start the road to recovery When people talk about [detox](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/drug-and-alcohol-detox/), they're typically referring to one of two things: the act of detoxing from a substance or a detox treatment program. Detoxing from drugs or alcohol involves clearing the body of substances and managing any withdrawal symptoms that occur. There are two main categories to withdrawal: acute withdrawal, which consists of medical withdrawal symptoms that requires immediate medical attention, and post acute withdrawal, which is more related to the psychological symptoms that take effective continuous treatment to safely manage. The entire process may take anywhere from a few days to several years depending on the multiple factors, including how long the substance has been used, frequency of use, severity of use, and physical dependence for the substance. For instance, alcohol leaves the body after a few days but detoxing from cravings may take much longer. How long the detox process lasts depends on a number of factors, including: Detox treatment programs are designed to assist individuals during the process of withdrawal. While the time it takes to detox from substances varies from person to person, detox programs are generally between 3 to 10 days long, depending on medical necessity. Detox is considered the first phase of recovery from addiction and should not be considered a substitute for any necessary treatment programming or [therapy](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/) to follow. Detoxification alone does not address the psychological, social, and behavioral problems associated with addiction and therefore does not typically produce lasting behavioral changes necessary for recovery.
