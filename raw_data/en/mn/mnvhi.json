We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones from illness. But mainstream medicine typically focuses on cure instead of prevention. So, it's no wonder that many of us turn to holistic health systems, like herbalism, for an alternative. Long before the first antibiotics were available, our ancestors used herbs to support their health and see off diseases. Of course, modern medicine has its place too. But when it comes to boosting the immune system and protecting us against illnesses, herbal remedies are an effective and safe option for everyday use. We've gathered our pick of the best herbal teas to boost your immune system this winter. While they might not stop you from getting sick ever again, these herbal tea blends help your body fight disease and recover more quickly when you do get ill. With plenty to choose from, there's sure to be something to suit every tastebud. 1. Elderberry & Echinacea A classic combination, both elderberry and echinacea are well-known for their immune-boosting properties. [Elderberry](/the-benefits-of-elderberry-6-reasons-to-take-it-this-winter/) is packed with vitamins that support the healthy function of your immune system. It is also an antiviral. Studies have found that it can reduce the symptoms of flu and even help you recover faster. Echinacea is one of the most popular herbal allies to boost our immune defences. A potent antiviral and antibacterial, it helps our bodies to fight disease-causing organisms. Echinacea also affects the immune system itself, stimulating the white blood cells responsible for detecting and destroying bacteria. The earthy flavour of the echinacea blends perfectly with fruity elderberry, making this one of our favourite combinations for the winter months. 2. Ginseng & Ginger Both ginseng and [ginger](/ginger-does-it-help-with-digestion/) are highly valued herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine. And they are also worth having on hand during the winter to boost your immune system and help you recover faster from colds and cases of flu. Ginseng helps to strengthen your immune system, making it more efficient at fighting off infections. Taking ginseng regularly can reduce your risk of getting colds and make the symptoms less severe when you do come down with one. In the meantime, ginger is one of the most popular home remedies for cold symptoms. Its warming spice is more than just a comfort - ginger has antiviral properties and is effective against viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. Ginseng has a slightly bitter flavour, but it works well when combined with ginger to create a tasty and aromatic herbal tea. 3. Lemongrass & Ginger We've already looked at the benefits of ginger for boosting your immune response. But if ginseng doesn't do it for you, combining ginger with lemongrass is a delicious alternative. Although you can enjoy it just for its lovely mild citrus flavour, lemongrass is also a great herb to choose to support you through the winter months. It has antimicrobial properties and protects against inflammation. In Ayurveda, the traditional holistic healing system originating in India, lemongrass is often used as a treatment for headaches and fever. Plus, lemongrass is packed with vitamins that help your immune system function properly. 4. NutraDefence Sometimes you need to pull out the big guns. And that means combining several immune-boosting herbs into one tea blend, so you can get all their benefits in one cup. [NutraDefence](/product/nutra-defence/) is our premium herbal tea blend dedicated to herbs that support your immune system, fight off viruses and bacteria, and relieve the symptoms of winter illnesses. You'll find elderberry, ginger, and ginseng in this blend, along with mullein and thyme for respiratory relief, astragalus for its antioxidants, and eucalyptus and calendula to soothe sore throats and coughs. 5. NutraRelax A good night's sleep can do wonders for your health, including boosting your immune system. People who don't get enough rest are more at risk of getting sick and recover more slowly too. But getting that sleep is easier said than done when you are feeling grotty. That's why the final tea on our list is aimed at helping you wind down ready for bed. Some of the herbs in our [NutraRelax blend](/product/nutra-relax/) also help to combat illness and boost your immune system. [Chamomile](/8-soothing-herbal-teas-to-ease-a-sore-throat/), for example, is known for relieving the symptoms of a cold, while hawthorn berries are packed with vitamins. The real benefit of this blend, however, is in helping you relax and unwind. It is full of calming herbs that promote sleep - perfect for when you need to give your immune system a boost. "}
