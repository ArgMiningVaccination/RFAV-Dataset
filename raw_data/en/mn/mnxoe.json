INTRODUCTION Objectives and Concepts of Materials Processing in Space (MPS) MPS might better be described as materials science and engineering using low gravity. The primary motivation of the program is to use the unique environments of space for scientific and commercial applications. The elimination of the Earth's gravity during the production of common materials affords oppor- tunities for understanding and improving ground-based methods or, where practical and economical, producing select materials in space. Large factories or mills producing huge quantities of materials, as is often the case on Earth, are not expected in space in the near future. Materials that might be produced in space, typically, would be of low-volume b~t high-v he commercial interest. In the more distant future, extraterrestrial materials may be mined and processed for use in space applications. To promote the potential corilmercial applications of low-g technology, the pr0gra.m is structured: (1) to analyze the scientific principles of gravitational effects on processes used in the production of common materials, (2) to apply the research toward the technology to control production processes (on Earth or in space, as appropriate), and (3) to establish the legal and managerial framework for commercial ventures. 11. PRESENT PKOGKAM AND STRUCTURE FOR DEVELOPING MATERIALS PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY IN SPACE A. Description of Present NASA Materials Science in Space I. Federal Funded Kesearch The low-gravity, high-vacuum environment associated with orbit- illg %ace vehicles offers unique opportunities to investigate various processes in ways that cannot be duplicated on Earth. Gravity-driven convective stirring, sedimentation, and hydrostatic pressure are virtually eliminated. (Materials can be melted, shaped, and solidified in the absence of a container. Processes that rc pire an extremely high vacuum in conjunction with large heat loads or the generation of large quantities of gas may be performed in the wake of an orbiting vehicle. The low-gravity environment offers a new dimension in process control. Since gravity-driven effects are no longer significant. diffttsion-controlled conditions may be easily realized without resorting to the severe restrictions required in Earth's gravity. Many terrestrial processes can be improved or optimized by a better understanding of flows from which better control strategies can be devised. The elimination of sedimentation in low gravity allows the study of a number of phenomena that cannot be adequately studied terrestrially. The absence of hydrostatic pressure eliminates the tendency for tna terials to sag and deform when melted and eliminates the need to contain liquids during processing. Containerless processing elirninates probleins such as container contamination and wall effects. Thermal processing and measurements can be done at temperatures well above the rnelting points of any known material or on materials that are extremely reactive in the melt. Containerless rnelting in the high vacuum, in the wake of an orbiting vehicle, could produce materials of unprecedented purity. a. Crystai i'-owth . .- - Of pdramount importance in any crystal growth system is the control of the environment at the growth interface. omp positional and/or thermal fluctuations in the fluid phase (whether it be melt, solution, or vapor) can give rise to inhomogeneities or defects in the growing crystal. Since unstable thermal gradients are virtually impossible to avoid in any growth system, some convective stirring will almost always be present in convec- tional growth techniques. Such convective stirring is generally thought to be detrimental to the control of the growth process and is often considered to be the cause of any growth problems. (1) Melt Growth - Crystal growth by solidification from the melt is the most widely used technique for production of high technology single- crystalline materials. The success of the technique depends on the control of the composition, temperature, and shape of the solidification interface. This control is often complicated by convection in the melt which affects both the heat and mass transport to the interface. This can cause compositional variations and growth fluctuations. There is reason to believe, based on Skylab and Apollo- Soyuz experiments, tmt two major advantages can be realized by growing valuable single crystals in space, i.e., the ability to establish a steady-sta te, diffusion- controlled boundary layer at the growth interface, and the ability to eliminate growth-rate fluctuations FIE-ht experiments are being developed to explore how a low-g environment might be used to overcome some of the difficulties in growing crystals. The solidifying surface is diffirult to control on Earth and the growth is susceptible to breakdown. (2) Solution Growth - One advantage of growth from a saturated solution, in which the solute is incorporated into the growing crystal inteface, is the control it provides over the temperature of growth. This makes it possible to grow cyrstals that are uristable at their melting points or that exist in several forms depending on their melting points or that exist in several forms depending on their temperature. A second advantage is the control of viscosity, thus permitting substances that tend to form glasses when cooled from their melt to be grown in crystalline form. A number of interesting systems can be grown from transparent solutions at moderate temperature which allows the detailed study of the growth process and how it is related to growth environment. Because growth from sclution requires transport of solute to the growth interface and removal of SO!!\"F.~+, it is important to understand how the growth and perfection of the crystal are in! luenced by this transport process. Since the solvent virtually always has a different density from the solute, solute-d~.~ven convection is unavoidable in terrestrial processes. In fact, forced convection or stirring is generally employed in an attempt to maintain a uniform concentration of solution. (3) Vapor Growth - Particular attentin;) has been glven in recent years to the growth of whiskers and to crystalline films from the vapor. Gravity-driven convection can play an important role in the transport of the vapor from the hot source to cold seed. Also, the growth environment In the v~cir~ity of the seed can be influenced by convective effects. There will be both thermal and compositional changes arising from the heat of sublimina tion released as the vapor deposits. These effects together with natural convection arising from temperature gradients in the container can be expected to result in nonuniform growth conditions which wou!d affect the perfection of the growing c rystdl. Advantages that are expected from the study of vapor growth in space are: the avoidance of deformation of crystals that are weak at their growth temperature, the ability to grow films under unique vacuum condi- tions, and the possibility of containerless growth. Several chemical vapor growth experiments were cc (I2) as the transport gas The experiments were conducted at various pressures a~d in the presence of an inert gas in order to investigate the transport rates in low-g environment. In space, substantial improvement in crystalline structure was obtained in terms of fewer defects by visual inspection of micrographs. The most surprising result, however, was in the transport rates, Growth rates were substantially higher than expected, indicating that some unforeseen convective effect is operating in low-g or that some gravitydriven effect is lowering the diffusive transport in the ground-based experiment. In either case, it is apparent that such iransport is not as well understood as we previously thought. Additional experiments are being planned to elucidate these transport processes and to explore the possible advantages of growing technically interesting systems such as HgCdTe by this process. 4 Float~,,g Zone Growth - Floating zone crystal growth is a variation of melt growth in which the melt does not contact a container. This is accomplished by supporting vertical polycrystalline rod at both ends and melting a portion of it with a suitable heater. This floating zone is supported along the sides solely by surface tension. By moving the heater or the rod, the hot zone can be made to move along the axis of the rod, melting the materilas ahead of it and grciwing a crystal bhenid it. Often the rod is rotated or the two portions are counter-rotated to even out any thermal variations. The primary advantage of this technique is the absence of wall effects. Many materials of practical interest are highly corrosive in the melt a?d will partially dissolve any container. Because the electronic propertier are dramaLically affected by an extremely minute trace of impurity, uncontrolled wall contamination is a serious concern. Also the absence of wall -induced stress during :he solidification process can lead to substantial improveme: . in crystalline perfection. For these reasons, f loat-zone growth is an extremely important process, especially for producing high-quali ty silicon and other electronic materials for applications in which high purity and perfectior~ are required. Floating zone growth is subjected not only to the control and stability problems at the interface that are encor~ntered by ordinary melt growth but has also a new set of problems associated with the free surface. Because the hydrostatic pressure in the molten zone must be supported by surface tension, tbr? length of the zone is limited by the material properties and the diameter of the system. Also the sagging of the melt under the hydrostatic pressure further complicates the control and, consequently, the size and shape of the growing crystal. Thermal convection in the melt is complicated by flows along the free surface of the melt. It appears that float-zone crystal growth would benefit significantly from the low-g environment in space. The absence of hydrostatic head eliminates the deformation of sag in the molten zone. Zone lengths may be increased. Finally, the use of low-g processing extends floating-zone growth to materials whose low-surface tension prohibits this technique on Earth. One of the major problems in commercially-produced float-zone silicon is the lack of chemical homogeneity. Dopant striations and radial segregation produce cbnsiderable variations in electrical properties which car1 cause problems in very large scale integration devices or in large focal plane arrays. The use of more quiescent growth conditions in space should eliminate this problem. b. Solidification of Metals and Alloys - Control of the solidifica- tion of metals and alloys is the key element in the vast field of metallurgy which provides us with the materials that are fundamental to our high technb~o~ical society. Grdvitational effects, such as buoyancy-driven convection of the melt or the sedimentation of various phases can greatly influence the structure of metals and alloys. (1) Solidification Kinetics in the Casting of Alloys - In casting of alloys, the fluid, which has a different composition from the solidifying material, often becomes trapped in the spacings between the solid dendritedtree- like structures extending into the melt). Dendrites break off as growth proceeds. They are carried by density differences or convective flows and either form new growth sites or migrate to the surface and produce mottled surfaces. This process is respor~sible for producing the fine-grained structure in the interior of a casting, as was recently shown by a series of ground-based experin. nts using a centrifuge and flight experiments using sounding rockets. This basic mformation may have application in common products such as iron engine castings. (2) Unidirectional Solidification - Highly directional pro- rerties can be ol lined with some castings by directional solidification. This technique affords a degree of control not available in normal castings in that a unidirectional thermal gradient can be imposed and the growth rate can be regulated by moving the sample relative to the thermal gradient. Convective effects can be dimin~shed on the grwnd but cannot be completely cl~minated. IJirectional solidification is often used to produce natu- ral composites with reinforcing structure in materials whose components have limited mutual solubility. The size and spacing of the rnlcrostructurc are determined by the growth rate, the higher growth rztes giv~ng rise to finer microstructures. These higher growth rates require very high thermal gradients. Low-g offers several possible advantages. First, the rediiced convection in the melt lowers the total heat transfer. Second, shapes csn be maintained in low-g with a thin oxide skin, as was demonstrated in experiments performed on Gerrnan soundirlg rockets. This allows complicated shapes, such as turbine blades to be melted and directionally resoiidified to increase aviai strength wh~le using a thin oxide skin to maintain the shape. ' Without the heavy mold reoilired on Earth to diffuse the heat, a very high thermal gradiect can be imposed c?n the sarrlple which can produce a unique structure. It has generally heen assumed that the microstructure of directiona!ly solidified composites is controlled by diffusion. However, a recent experiment on a rocket ilight obtained a finer, more regular microstructure in a maganese-bismuthlbismt~ v,(tr~b~-ijilt3i) composite sample than was obtained under identical processing conditions in Earth gravity. This indicates that residual convection may play a more significant role in such processes than was previously suspet': bed. Another advantage of low-g lies in the processing of off -normal compositions. By eliminating the convective stir::ng associated with one-g processing, it is possible to build up a layer of the rejected component until the normal composition is reached at the solidifying interface. To provide mass balance, however, it is necessary at rteady state to incorporate the same composition into the solid as is present .r the bulk melt. This results ill both matrix and intrusive material solidifying but in proportions determined by the bulk melt composites. Low gravity provides a new degree of freedom in controlling the size, shape, and spacing of the two phases (3) Miscibility Cap Alloys - Hundreds of alloys have been identified which might have useful properties if they could only be processed, but the metals forming the alloys are not miscible on Earth; i.e., they will separate into two liquids at the melt temperature. These alloys are another important class of materials that require reduced gravity for detailed study. Attempts to form alloys or fine dispersions of such material in Earth's gravity by normal freezing are doomed to fail because of this incompatibility. As the melt temperature is lowered into the two-phased region, the low-temperature phase forms solid droplets in tl?c still liquid higher-melting phase. Because these two phases invariably have different densities, they will rapidly separate as the droplets grow. The result is an almost complete stratificatior: of rhe two metals. A number of attempts has been made to prepare fine dispersions of the miscibi lit) -.gap alloy, aluminum -indium (AI-In), in space. These were generally unsuccessful until the means for con trailing capillary flow werc demonstrated. When surface tension differences were properly controlled oy selection of container materials and reduction of impurities, the predicted fine dispersion was formed during solidification of a I,ypermonotectic compos;tion in lov ~vity. The study of miscibility-gap alloys is importarit from a fundamental and ci practical viewpoint; they repreent a large class of potentially useful new al!oy s. (4) Nucleation in Undercooled Molten Metal - Nucleation and rapid solidificat~on of undercooled melts are also impcrtant phenomena that are of fundamental as well as practical interest, in the control of grain structure and, hence, mechanical properties. By containerless melting and soiidification, wall-induced nucleation (that is, points on the cold wall where freezing of crystals begins) can he eliminated. This allows the melt to be cooled substantially below the normal freeziag point before nucleation eventually occurs. Solidification under these conditions is extremely rapid and can produce unique microstructures and noncrystalline solids, such as palhdium~ilicon-copper and iron-nicke1phosphorou~- boron used in transformer hminations These materials are thought to be similar to those produced by rapid quenching of thin samples by qht cooling except a thick sampk can be processred. c. Containerkss Processing - The MPS program has kindled new interest in containerless processing, i.e., the ability to melt, solidify, or otherwise process a sarnpk without physicalcontact with a &miner. - There ark a mmbcr of reasons for wanting to do this: the ability to measure physical properties of high temperature and corrosive materials; to produce ultrapure specimens; to form unique ghsses from materials that are reluctant glass formers, either because of their corrosive nature or their tendency to crystaliize when they contact the container wall; to study nucleation and the associated time-tempera ture-transition rehtions; to study the soiidiflcation of deeply undercookd materials; and to fabricate unique shapes without sagging or physical contact, s.ch as highly concentric ghss shells for fusion research. Containerless processing may be carried out on Earth by two basic methods: free-fall faci lities and levitatim facilities. A free-fall facility, such as the drop tubes at MSFC offers true containerless and near-zero gravity conditions for a very brief time (at most a few seconds). Levitation facilities support the sample (more or lesr indefinitely) by means of a force applied withmt solid contact. Such forces may be electrostatic, electromagnetic acoustic, aerodynamic, or hydrostatic. One of the disadvantages of using levitation techniques on Earth is the fact that levitation does employ external forces which may in fact influence the experiment by inducing heating, stirring, or other undesirable effects. Also the applied forces are generally not true body forces but are applied to the surface. Therefore, the sample is still subjected to gravity- driven flows such as sedimentation and natural convection . . Containerless processing in space is essentially a free-fall technique; however, it is necessary to apply low-level levitation forces to compen- sate for microgravity accelerations and maintain the position of the sample rehtive to the furnace or experiment chamber. Although such forces may produce some of the extraneous effects encountered in levitation in one-g, the magnitude of such effects tan be reduced by several orders of magnitude because of the reduced g-levels. (1) Nucleation Studies - The elimination of container- induced nucleation has allowed very deep undercooling in excess of 500 C of small (miilirneter-sized) droplets of some molten metals such as niobium (Nb) and its alloys. In fact, earlier predictions of the degree of undercooling that was thought to be possible for droplets of this size have been exceeded. Solidification at this degree of undercooling is extremely rapid, comparable to rates obtained by spht cooling of thin samples Usually nucleation occurs at only one point, and a single crystal results. Small single crystalline silicon (Si) beads have been produced by this method, which may find applications in low-cost sobr cells. Since a melt undercooled to this degree solidifies so rapidly and under highly nonequilibrium conditions, it is possible to form unusual compounds that do not form from equilibrium melting. As mentioned previously, bulk samples of superconductors have been produced in this manner. One of the major factors in the formation of noncrys- talllne solids is the time-temperature-transition on cooling. Many substances can be chilled rapidly enough by splat cooling to form a noncrystalline phase, but whether or not such phases can be formed by slow undercooling, which would be necessary to process bulk samples, is a matter of conjecture. In normal solidification, nucleation from the container wall virtually always limits the degree of undercooling that can be achieved. The theory of nucleation is not well- established and is difficult to test. The nucleation and growth of the solid phase in the absence of the container's nucleation sites are obviously an important research area. (2) Glasses and Glassy Metals - By the elimination of nucleation associated with container walls, it should also be possible to extend the glass forming range of many materials, including some metals. This could result in some new and unique glasses with exotic properties. It may even be possible to delay nucleation long enough for 'he sample to lose sufficient heat that the latent heat of fusion is no longer capable of raising the material to the normal freezing temperature. The solidification of such undercooled samples is of theoretical as well as practical interest because of the unusual microstructures that may result. Experiments with gallia-calcia glass to control the index of refraction have been initiated. (3) Containerless Forming - The ability to process an object with very weak constraining forces in the virtual absence of buoyancy forces and hydrostatic pressure offers new techniques for forming materials without physical contact. One process that is of great current interest is a study of the centering mechanisms that operate in the formation of concentric glass shells required for inertial confinement fusion experiments by the Department of Energy. Such shells can presently be made with sufficient precision, in sizes up to several hundred microns, adequate for present research needs. However, in order to provide fusion power on a practical basis, containment shells up to a centimeter in diameter m:st be produced with a high degree of precision at a low cost. At this time, not enough .> known about the mechanisms that are responsible for causing the bubbl? inside of the glass sphere to center and produce a concentric shell. A better understanding of this process may indicate a method for scaling up the present process to produce larger size shells. On the other hand, if such a process is not fc ,sible on the ground, the shell could be manufactured in space by containeriess forming. (4) Ultrapure Materials - The elimination of crucible con- tami~tion is beneficial in the preparation of ultrapure materials. It may be possible, for example, to purify melts by containerless evaporation if the impurities have higher vapor pressure than the host material. Use of the high vacuum associated with the spacecraft wake would be an additional benefit for such a process. Preparation of oxygen-free materials is of technological interest. For example, oxygen impurities in cobalt samarium magnets may be responsible for limiting the magnetic strength of the material. The source of the oxygen is suspecad to be the crucible material; therefore, added performance might be derived from container less melting in an electromagnetic levitator. A most important application for the preparation of ultrapure material could be the production of ultrapure glass for u* in optical wave guides for high frequency communications. Although extremely high purities have been achieved with quartz using the chemical vapor deposition process currently employed for production of optical fibers, the cost is high and the types of glasses that can be produced are limited With containerless processing, it may be possible to use a broader range of glasses that are less expensive or have different optical properties but tend to pick up trace crucible contaminants because of their chemical activity. d. Fluids and Chemical Processes - Although the gravitational contribution to chemical reactions is usually negligibly small, many processes are controlled by mass and heat transport which are affected by gravity-driven convection or sedimentation. Often this occurs in complicated ways in which gravity-driven flows are coupled with nongravitational flows such as surface tension-driven convection. Experiments in low-g can simplify such problems by eliminating one set of flows so that the nongravity components may be isolated and studied with a degree of freedom not otherwise possible. In some processes, it is desirable to keep a component in suspension in order to study nucleation and growth of one phase. By eliminating convection, other transport studies can be made tractable. By eliminating the hydrostatic pressure, free and interfacial surfaces are controlled only by surface tension. This greatly simplifies the study of wetting and spreading and the measurement of contact angles, especially near critical phase transitions where interfacial tension approaches zero. Also, the usually insignificant gravitational contribution to thermodynamic properties is not negligible near a critical phase transition because many terms go to zero. Therefore, there are advantages in studying critical point phenomena in a iow-g environment. (I) Surface Tension Driven Convection - One of the major driving forces for convective flow in the absence of gravity is surface or interfacial tension. There is considerable interest in understanding this phe- nomenon. Such flows are expected to play an important role in a number of processes, For example, the thermal migration of bubbles or droplets is driven by temperature variation and surface tension. These flows may be important in getting rid of bubbles in glass or coalescing particles in phase separations. On the other hand, this could also be an unwanted mechanism that causes phase separation in the preparation of some alloys. It is also suspected that surface-tension flows play an important role in flame propagation in flammable liquids. The lower-surface tension near the flame causes fluid to \"pull away\" from the flame, resulting in a sligb' depression. The return flow feeds fresh fluid from beneath the surface into the flame. Perhaps the most compelling reason frir studying sur- face-tension convection is its importance in floating zone crystal growth. This process involves free surfaces and large temperature gradients. The convective transport in a unit gravity field is very complicated. Performing such experiments in a low-g environment provides a method for simplifying the flows by eliminating the buoyancy-driver effect, thus isolating the surface tension effects. (2) Critical and Interfacial Phenomena - Since the differ- ence between the many thermodynamic properties of two phases vanishes at the critical point? the small contribution from the difference in gravitational potential may become significant. Also since rhe density of the two phases is virtually always different, gravitational sedimentation will cause rapid phase separation. This limits tire time over which the transition can be observed on Earth. As systems that have two immiscible liquid phases approach the transition to a single liquid phase, the interfacial tension goes to zero. Theory predicts that one of the phases becomes perfectly wetting at the critical point. This is difficult to observe in the laboratory. The existence of one phase that becomes perfectly wetting may be the key to the rapid phase separation observed when attempting to form certain alloys. (3) Polymerization Phenomena - There are a variety of processes important to industrial applications that may be studied in a low-g environment for the purpose of understanding the role of gravity effects or for taking advantage of the virtual lack of buoyancy-driven convection, sedimentation, or hydrostatic pressure in order to achieve better process control. For example, seeded polymerization of latex may be used to grow monodisperscd spheres in a size range that is virtually not achievable by ground based techniques because of creaming or sedimentation effects. Such spheres would be useful as standards for calibrating counters, sizing membranes, and possiblyother biomedical applications. The absence of gravitational forces provides an oppor- tunity to study the role of chemical fining (bubble removal in glass) by eliminating buoyancy motion. Chemical fining agents certainly will become more important in the future as energy costs continue-to rise. Because glass is viscous, velocities of bubbles are extremely low, and very long, high temperature soaks are required. Chemical finers are known that help reduce the time, but the mechanism is not well understood. It is difficult to contain a bubble in a small container for study on Earth. Another endeavw that takes advantage of the absence of sedimentation is the study of Ostwald ripening used for strengthening alloys. This is a process by which secund-phase particles evolve into a distribution of sizes with the larger particles growing at the expense of smaller particles. This effect is quite important in metallurgy where the size of a precipitated second phase is altered by heat treating. A!though the phenomenon of Ostwald ripening has been known for a number of years, there is no satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment because of the difficulty of mainta' ling stable suspensions of the precipitating phase on hrth. (4) Electr~chemical Deposition - Electrochemical deposi- tion is a process that is influenced considerably by gravity because of internal heating of the bath as well as convection from concentration gradients Yet Little work has been done to understand the role of gravitydriven fows. In some cases it is desirable to incorporate inert particles of a second phase int~ an electroformed product to improve its properties Maintaining such particles in a suspension and incorporating them uniformly into the structure is difficult in the laboratory. Low- gravity electroplating experiments have been initiated. (5) Biomedical Applications - A number of processes of interest to the biomedical cornnlunity that are adversely influenced by gravity effects have been identified. These include electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, phase partitioning, suspension cell culturing, crystallization of macromolecules, and the study of blood flow. Experiments performed in space can provide valuable insight into the control of the processes on Earth, produce research quantities of unique products, and eventually develop unique separations or products on a preparative scale. A joint endeavor with an industrial firm is evidence of the potential economical benefits that can come from bioprccessing in space. (a) Separation Processes - Separation of complex material yixtures into their component parts is a goal of extreme importance in many ' :Ids but is of particular importance in the various biomedical fields Indeed, the lack of satisfactory techniques for such separations is now in many cases the limiting factor that impedes furlher research progress. The kinds of biological components in need of improved separation methods include cells, cell components, and macromolecules. Every organ of the mammalian body is made up of 3 great varie~y of functioral cell types, which can frequently be best studied in Ilomogenll,-ls populations of a single cell type. However, cells that differ :mpOr'alltAy in their functions are often so similar in their size, density, and spy**% ince that it is impossible to obtain a pure populat~on af any one cell type by CO~ ,ventional separation me thds (density gradient centrifugation, for example). In dddition to facilitating basic research into normal and abnormal cell physiology, improved cell separation methods could conceivably be used to provide purified cell populations for transplantation into individuals lacking normal cells of that type. Also purified populations of cells that secrete valuable products could be most useful in the commercial production of these substances, because cell culturing processes could be greatly simplified and their efficie~cy increased by selecting only active, producing cells for culture. The kidney cell separation experiments on Apollo-Soyuz provided a step in that direction Purifying macromolecules that have been sy nthe- sized is another application of bioprocessing separations technology. Some macro- molecules must be laboriously purified from heterogeneous medium such as blood, urine, or tissue. Other macromolecules can be obtained through cell culture, recombinant-DNA technology, or artificial peptide synthesis. In each of these cases, however, the final product is not pure but rather a complex mixture requiring extensive purification. In addition, neither recombinant-DNA technology nor laboratory peptide synthesis can be performed until the desired product has been obtained in strictly pure form in sufficient quantity to allow determination of its ~nolecular structure. For many important macromolecules (e.g., interferon, alpha-I-antitrypsin), this has been impossible to achieve in spite of the many techniques presentlg available. Methods currently employed for the ourification of complex mixtures of macromolecules include ultracentrifugation, .iltration and chromatographic (preferential adsorption) methods. One important fact to consider is that most ' current cell separation techrliques are based either on very nonspecific characteris- tics of the cell (e.g., density) or on characteristics so highly specific that the method can be used only on previously purified populations of cells. A purified cell population must first have been obtained. Because of these limitations, existing techniques are either quite nonspecific, or else they are \"circular\" in that it is necessary to possess a purified population before one is able to obtain a purified population. In contrast, both continuous-flow electrophoresis and phase partition- ing avoid this liability; with either technique, it is possible to begin with a mixed population of cells about which one knows essentially nothing and to sort them into categories which are specific as well as biologically meaningful. However, both of these methods appear to be significantly impeded by gravity-related effects. Therefore, free-flow electrophoresis and phase partitioning could conceivably provide unique advantages over other techniques if such separations were carried out without the perturbations introduced by Earth's gravity. 1. Electrophoresis - Electrophoresis is a well known technique separation of proteins and other macromolecules on an analytical scale. Such molecules acquire a specific charge when immersed in a buffer solution. An applied electric field interacts with this charge and produces a force which moves the molecuie against drag encountered in the medium. This allows materials with different mobilities to be separated. On Earth, electrophoresis is usually carried out in the presence of a gel to prevent convective mixing. This restricts the quantities that can be separated and precludes use of the technique for cells. One technique for circumventing this restriction is the use of free-column electro- phoresis, using vertical columns with a density gradient to stabilize the fluid motion. In this system, the cells migrate against gravity. Although this technique has enjoyed only limited success, it was a first choice for space where density gradients are not required. Experiments performed on Apollo-Soyuz showed some indication that kidney cells could be separated according to function. One fraction of cells, when cultured, showed a significant enhancement in the production of the valuable enzyme urakinase. Column electrophoresis can be a very valuable tool for space use for obtaining extremely high resolution separations of research quantities of material. Another means of obtaining electrophoretic separation of cells or macromolecules is the use of continuous-flow electrophoresis (CFE). By its nature, free-flow electrophoresis is associated with significant problems, many of which are gravity determined. The passage of the electric current causes heating which tends to produce unwanted thermal convection, impairing the resolution of the separation. Sedimenation of the sample material limits the concentration of the sample and thus the throughput. The CFE instruments currently in use are stabillzed by using a very thin flow channel to suppress convective flows. This limits throughput and resolution because the sample stream is subject to distortion from wall effects. To determine the benefits that may be obtained by operating in space as well as the most advantageous design for such devices, it was necessary to study the fluid dynamics of electrokinetic separation. It has now been found that most of these difficulties can be avoided in a low-g environment where the buoyant forces would be dramatically lessened. There may be other effects that limit the performance in low-g, but it does appear that there is a good rationale for a flight experiment to explore the effects that are overshadowed by convective problems on the ground. 2. Isoelectric Focusing - In isoelectric focus- ing, a pH (H + ion concentration) gradient is set up by an applied electric field upon electrolytes added to the buffer solution. The material to be separated is driven by the electric field to a region of pH known as the isoelectric point, where the electrophoretic mobility of the sample is zero. Very high resolutions are possible because the boundaries of the sample bands are self-sharpening. This is a particular advantage when dealing with proteins or other macromolecules because the focusing process counteracts diffusion. Isoelectric focusing is subject to gravity- induced convection and sedimentation pr~blems. A novel isoelectric focusing machine was recently developed as a potential space experiment. This machine is a recirculat- ing device with a number of fluid loops that come together in a common chamber. The electrolytes migrate through membranes in the chamber to form a stepped pH gradient in the various flow channels. Once the pH gradient has stabilized, the biological sample is introduced and each component migrates to the channel corresponding to its isoelectric point. A ten-channel machine has been built and demonstrated to be capable of separa :ing a number of test materials. It is believed that the membranes could be eliminated entirely by performing the separation in low-g. The device has attracted considerable attention in the biomedical com;nuni ty, and a number of reseachers have delivered samples to be separated. It has been suggested that high-resolution, high- throughput, continuous-flow isoelectric focusing would be a useful method for purifying natural or synthesized products such as polypeptide hormones, interferon, r combinant-DNA products and other macromolecules (b) Blood Rheology - Blood is a fluid with a viscosity that is strongly dependent on shear rate. This fact is due primarily to the presence of the red cells. The rheology (study of flow) is further complicated by the fact that red cells form aggregates, of varying sizes in different physiolog~cal condi- tions. Coagulation may occur in addition to rapid sedimentation of aggregates. Rheological considerations appear to be important in several disease states, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, anc! some forms of kidney disease. For example, sedimentation of red blood cells is more pronounced in a variety of pathological conditions, and it forms the basis for clinical tests. One question is raised as to whether the cellular aggregations in pathological conditions seen in the laboratory produce a different pressure drop across a blood vessel. Simultaneous sedimentation prtbcludes an answer to this question. An increase in the pressure drop merits appropriate countermeasures, whereas a decreased pressure drop would constitute a beneficial situation. Obtaining a thorough understanding of the rheology of blood is extrt:mely important. However, the examination of biological cell dispersions in laboratory viscometers is rendered problematic under terrestrial conditions by sedimentation. Research in a reduced- gravity environment to alleviate these problems has been proposed. e. Extraterrestrial Materials Processing (1) Goals - The long range goal of space materials science is to provide for the cost-effective use of extraterrestrial materials resources for both space systems and terrestrial applications This goal requires the demonstra- tion of advanced autonomous and teleoperated machinery for remote operations The machinery must have a high degree of self-sufficiency and self-replication. The remote operations include exploration, acquisition, staging, conversion, manu- facturing, assembly and construction of facilities. The goal also requires demon- stration of space-adapted techniques for acquiring and converting raw materials occurring in space into useful forms for space and terrestrial applications. (2) Development - Development of technology along sev- eral parallel fronts is required to accomplish the goals. Exploration of the moon, asteroids and planets will locate the needed mineral supply in terms of distribution and concentration and characterize it in terms of chemical and physical properties Development of technology in space systems will provide the materials, structures, machine intelligence, robotics, energy systems and transportation systems to reach the gal. Plans for coordination of activities leading to a phased development of a system demonstration are being defined. The first phase will involve project planning, resol;rce evaluation, materials analysis and materials processing experi- ments. The second phase will involve breadboard demonstrations on individual system components, such as an Earth demonstration of an automatic reducing cell to process lunar or asteroid material into aluminum and/or silicon, and an Earth orbital demonstration of elements of the space materials processing system for concept verification. The third phase will involve designing and building actual space systems hardware, testing and mission operations. A steering committee is currently working on the details of this effort. (3) Status - Currently, hardware components are being developed in biomedical applications, spacecraft remote deployment and retrievai of experiment packages, and by adaptation of remote manipulators from Surveyor and Viking planetary spacecraft. In the area of intelligence, very large scale integrated circuits are being applied with increased hierarchy to control industrial processes. These can be adapted, dir cctly. Materials nrocessing techniques are being examined for adaptivity to space systems. Fin- y, for planning parposes, self-replicating algorithms are being formulated. (4) Plans - Planning is being done to provide for automation of the deployment and opera tion of f ree-f lying materials processing payloads. Computer control of spaceflight payloads is being decentralized to enhance flexibility, changeout, learning capabilities and independent decision making on individual payloads, Research is directed toward a better understanding of materials processes, including scaling laws and nonlinear phenomena and to development of the best space processing methods for extraterrestrial materials. System engineering is being employed for analysis of competing scenarios. 2. Privately Funded Commercial Activity The ultimate goal of the MPS program is to develop a viable commercial interest in using space: (1) to perform zero-g research to improve industrial technology or to develop new products on Earth, (2) to prepare research quantities of material in zero-g t~ serve as paradigms with which to compare current Earth-based technologies and (3) to produce specific materials in space of sufficient quantity and value to stand on their own economically. It is recognized that it will be necessary for NASA to provide the impetus for demonstrating to potential industrial users that they can learn more about their process by conducting experiments in space as well as doing things in space that they cannot do on Earth. This can best be accomplished by working closely with industries to the point of understanding their problems sufficiently to identify areas in which materials science and engineering can best be utilized. It is probably not realistic to expect major commitments from industry alone until NASA has completed a sequence of spaceflight opportunities and ha: been given a chance to demonstrate the potential that space offers. Also, ways must be found to select experiments for flight, protect the proprietary rights of the customer, reduce the lead time, and lower the costs of conducting experiments in order to attract the private industrialist. An important first step is the establishment of joint projects, with varying levels of involvement, with industrial users to assist them in exploring areas where MPS can be utilized to meet their own needs. In general, these joint projects are envisioned to be \"constructive partnershipsN between NASA and industrial firms wherein the parties are seen as equals who have common objectives. Also arrangements are being worked out to leese existing NASA facilities and for cooperative development facilities Increasing commitment on the part of the user will be required as the projecL matures Tht Commercial Applications Office, MPS Projects Office, MSFC, has been created to work exclusively with commercial interests. This team forms a bridge between NASA and the commercial cornmunity, serving as a source of information and assistance for the user as well as a focal point for commercial views and a channel by which these views can be articulated to NASA. This team is also working to obtain clarification of patent protection rights, proprietary rights, liabilities, leasing policy, and pricing. It is through this effort that NASA believes it can provide a simpler interface to the private sector, develop a better understanding of the incentives needed to elicit private i~itiatives, and to stimulate the inventive genius and entrepreneurial spirit in this country to fully utilize the benefits to be derived from the MPS program. Joint projects between industry and NASA are not government procurements but rather agreements to cooperate in a defined area with specific tasks to be accomplished by each party. They are expected to evolve with increasing interest and responsibility on the part of the industrial partner. Commercial MPS has three levels of working relationships to provide for incremen- tal increase in commitment by the parties involved. They are: o Technical Exchange Agreement (TEA) - Cooperation in analysis of data and specimens from ongoing research o Industrial Guest Investigator (IGI) - Collaboration with a NASA-sponsored Principal Investi- gator (PI) of a flight experiment o JointEndeavorAgreement(JEA) - Investment by private enterprise sharing in the cost and risk of an early space venture Discussions with key people in over 150 companies, both large and small, have initiated many MPS industrial research tasks in the private sector. Private companies do not publicly announce their interests and they usually request anonymity in their initial working relationships with NASA. However, some agreements have been publicly discussed: o A TEA is being culminated by Deere and Company in the field of solidification of metals o An IC1 was formally appointed in May 1980 by TRW Equipment Division in Cleveland, Ohio, in the discipline of directional solidification o A JEA was signed in January 1980, with McDonneil Douglas Astronautics Company (MD AC), developer of the biochemical separation equipment, who is tearned with Ortho Pharmaceutical Division of the Johnson & Johnson Company. The equipment is being evaluated for isolation of materials such as hemophilic factor VlI1 for hemophilia, beta cells for diabetes, alpha-antitrypsin for emphysema, epidermal growth factor for healing burns, growth hormone for stress ulcers, immunoglobulins for hepatitis, summatomedin for meat production, transfer factor for melanoma, and urokinase for blod clotting. This initial endeavor has been the subject of testimony to congressional cornmittees in both the U.S. House and Senate. Other offers of cooperative agreements in various stages of discussion ivclude: o A TEA with a major metallurgical supplier on electrodeposi- tion o A TEA with a university research institute and a pharmaceu- tical company to evaluate purification of proteins in a new device o A TEA with a major electrical equipment supplier on disper- sions of immiscible materials o AJEAwithanonprofitresearchinstitutetogrowabiologi- cal material for assisting the repair of human tissue o A JEA with a new high technology oriented small business to develop semiconductors o A JEA with a small materials research business to provide research samples to industry Institutional Structure 1. NASA Program Management me NASA MPS program is the wsponsibility of the Associate Administrator for the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications (OSTA) and is direc*d ar?d administered by the Director, MPS Division, at NASA Headquarters (Figures 1 through 3). The Division Director is supported directly in the overall management and execution of the program by the MSFC MPS Projects Officc (Figures 4 and 5) and other NASA centers. The projects office depends upon the laboratories of MSFC, other government agencies, universities, institutions, and the private sector for technical support and program implementation. In consonance with the recommendations of the Scientific & Technological Aspects of Materials Processing in Space (STAMPS) committee, a scientific advisory comnri ttee has been formed, responsive to the MPS Division Director, to aid in future program planning and policy making relative to scientific aspects of the program. Peer groups have been empaneled to assist in the selection and periodic review of scientific experimentation and the periodic review of plans and policies. The Director, MFS Division, OSTA, determines program policy, objectives and priorities, and controls the allocation of program ritscurces. OSTA is additionally responsible for science policy, objectives, and priorities, and for soliciting, evaluating, and selecting MPS flight investigations The MPS Division maintains full visibility into project level activities through participation in milestone reviews, receipt of reguhr and special reports, control of Level I changes, and informal information exchanges with all levels. Integration and mission management activities associated with the operational implementation of MPS payloads on the STS are the responsibility of the Spacelab Mission Integration Division, Office of Space Science (OSS), in NASA Headquarters and the assigned Mission Management Center, when applic- able. The MPS Projects Office at MSFC provides the necessary interface and support to the Mission Management Off ice for initiation and execution of mission requirements. The MPS Projects Office also provides the Mission Manager with appropriate project data to assure successful integration of approved MPS payload systems into the Space Transportation System (STS) and their operation as payloads. Level IV integration requirements for MPS payloads are mutually agreed-to by both the Mission and MPS Projects Managers. The MPS Projects Office also provides the Mission Manager with the launch site and flight require- ments for MPS payload systems. The MPS Projects Office also furnishes mutually I OFFICE OF SPACE AND TERRESTRIAL APPLlCAT JNS (El I f i I I I -+ I I , ENV~AONMENTAL j MATERIALS COMMUNiCATiUhS 1 PROCiSSlhiG I / RESOURCE 1 OBSERVATiONS 1 DIVISIOAi I IN SPACE I OBSERVATtGN i I DlVlSlON I i DLVISION I DR.

Thex services will be funded by the MPS budget. NASA inhouse research is conducted in several centers, primarily the MPS Division of Space Sciences Laboratory at MXC and at several technical laboratories at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). JPL organization charts are included as Figures 6 and 7. Smaller research groups at Johnson Space Center, Lewis Research Center and Langley Research Center participate to provide specific expertise. 2. Academic Participation Proposal Process NASA relies heavily upon the scientific community, both indus- trial and university, for the generation of concepts through proposals, and direction and review through committees. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on ST AMPS provided consultation and recommendations for proceeding into the future. Peer groups made up of industrial and ~niversity scientists meet periodi- cally to review the results of research activities. Unsolicited proposals are entertained for studies, theoretical and experimental research, or minor developments carried out at the investigator's institution. These projects may include experiments which use available NASA facilities such as drop tcwers, aircraft, or sounding rockets Opportunities for ground-based research are described in Applica- tions Notices (AN'S). Proposals for ground-based research may be submitted at any time, and they are reviewed at least three times per year. Spaceflight experiments must be proposed in response to specific Announcements of Opportunities (AO's). AO's are synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily. However, prospective proposers may also request the MPS Projects Office to include their names on the A0 mailing list. Guidelines for proposing spaceflight experiments are generally similar to those for ground-based research, thwgh somewhat more elaborate. They are included in each A0 and specify not only content but the format in which the information is to !x submitted. The A0 process assumes that a substantial degree of ground-based research has been performed and that sucP work is sponsorefi through the ground-based research program or some suitable equivalent. Each proposal undergoes a peer review to determine its scientific and/or technological merit. In addition, the reputation and interest of the investigator's institution, cost, and management will be considered by the Center Projects Office. AO's indicate other specific evaluation criteria and the relative importance of all criteria used in evaluating proposals.

Lymnn 34 1 347 348 354 JPL .. . . . The scientific evaluation is performed by a proposal evaluation committee composed of scientists who are doing research in materials processing. There is at least one member who is active in each of the major disciplines of materials processing, Care is taken in the selection of committee members to avoid any type of conflict of interest concerning the proposals under consideration. Lead review responsibility for each prqosal is assigned to the member most qualified in the involved discipline. That member selects other scientists from the discipline to assist in the confidential review of the proposals for which he is responsible. These other scientists also are screened concerning potential conflicts of interest. However, the control of this distribution of the proposals is the responsibility of the designated committee member. Each committee member develops a set of recommendations concerning the proposals of his particular discipline(s). The committee then compares the relative merits of proposals between disciplines te produce an overall set of recommendations During this process, no information concerning the proposals is revealed to anyone outside the committee or re iated NASA personnel. Each proposal is then thoroughly reviewed concerning engineering, integration, management, and cost. An assessment is made of the development risks for those proposals requiring instrumentation. Evaluation of the proposals under final consideration includes worhload (present and anticipated) related to capacity and capability, past experience, and management approach and organiza- tion. This ensures that the investigation can be managed, developed, and executed with an appropriate probability of technical success within the estimated cost. The final determination made by NASA balances all of the above evaluations with respect to developing a program which maximizes the probable scientific return within a reasonable time and within budgetary constraints Therefore, judgements concerning the most promising discipline areas are made. Investigators whose proposals are not selected .ire notified of that fact together with a description of the major reason(s1 why. 5~1ch proposers may also request a detailed oral debriefing after the selection process is completed. A proposal which has not been selected under a given review may, if agreeable with the proposers, be held for later consideration and funding. Letters of not~fication are sent to those Pl's selected to partici- pate. Each letter contains a description of the PI'S investigation as selected, specifically noting substantive changes, id any, from the investigation originally proposed; an indicaticn of whether it is a final selection or a tentative selectior~ requiring additional hardware or cost definition; a description of the Pl's antici- pated role, particularly with respect to providing instrumentation; identification of areas to be negotiated; rights to be granted to use of data; and, where applicable, indication that a foreign selectee's participation in the program will be arranged between the Office of External Relations and the foreign government agency which endorsed the proposal. Experimentation in space is viewed as an extension of ground- based research, thus representing an additional research tool. As ground-based research in a particular area progresses, a point may be reached where it can be clearly identified that important unresolved questions could be answered by resorting to experimentation in space. It is at this point that definition of a flight program warrants initiation. Flight program conceptual definition will entail two parallel activities: experiment definition and hardware definition. For this purpose, science working groups (SWG's) will interact directly with a contractor regarding the definition of experiment hardware requirements and specifications. The SWC's will define the scientific aspects of experiments to be performed in space and all related requirements of the conceptual experimental hardware. These require- ments are to be ba*d on laboratory experience. SWG's should generally. a. Become cognizant of (and help generate) relevant scientific investigations and help mature these investigations into meaningful low-gravity experiments. b. Foster interactions among investigators, contractors, engi- neering, and programmatic elements so that a scientific rationale will guide each Lf PS-funded project. c. Ensure that the investigators work closely with the hardware engineers to develop the advanced technology/apparatus needed for a meaningful, evolutionary, low-cost program using a spectrum of facilities from drop towers to Shuttle-orbited payloads. d. Define science performance rcquirernents or ranges of re- quirements for proposed m icrogravi ty hardware facilities and then assist in reviewing resilts of any design study or advanced technology development activity. e. Identify any new advanced technology development or pay- load facilities needed to conduct ground or flight investigations. f. Identify new areas of scientific research and help promote proposals for microgravity experiments. g. Establish overall experiment strategies, help review readiness of hardware for proposed microgravity studies. h. Exchange information with other MPS working groups and invite representatives of these other working groups to attend meetings. i. Recommend new members invite these new people to meet- ings and serve as a forum for'exchange of ideas and research activities by periodically having all participants give presentations. When experiments are mature enough to be considered for a specific flight, an investigators' working group is established per standard NASA guidelines. This group, which may include investigators from disciplines outside of MPS, meets and interacts with the original SWG as appropriate. The membership consists of NASA employees, contractor per- sonnel, NASA-funded investigators, and a strong representation of non-NASA- sponsored investigators from industry. The latter are necessary to ensure that industrial interests are coupled to MPS objectives. The members generally are selected by the chairperson of the group and NASA. C. International Activities in MPS The relationships between the U.S. and other nations in MPS are based on the desire to cooperatively generate new science and to share limited future mission opportunities. Since the interests and capabilities of other programs are substantially different from one nation to the other, then the nature of the cooperation varies with each. To date, West German experiments have been carried on Apollo-Soyuz for Professor Hannig of the Max Planck Institute; on Space Processing Applications Rocket (SPAR) I for Dr. Heye, University of Clausthal; on SPAR I1 for Professor Loh3erg of the University of Berlin; and a French experiment flew on SPAR IX for Professor Potard of Crenoble. Cooperative ground-based research is underway with Dr. Y. Malmejac, Grenoble, France, or. the dynamics of metal alloy solidification. A joint program has been established to confirm experimentally certain fluid and interface instabil- ities due to gravitationally-induced convection. These convection effects had been predicted theoretically by U.S. workers at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). Currently, cooperative work is underway at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology (MIT) and space experiments are being planned with French hardware accommodated in U.S. facilities in the Shuttle. Furthermore, sharing of space mission opportl~nities is planned with the Germans who are developing small self- contained packa es, Ma terialwissenschaftliche Autonome Experimente Unter Schwerelosigkeit f MAUS), for the Shuttle which will fly with similar U.S. experi- ments, Materials Experiment Assembly (MEA), on both German-funded and U.S.- funded inissions. Similar sharing of spaceflight opportunities will be explored for other hardware elements on future missions, In general, foreign use of U.S. developed facilities is possible through proposals submitted and selected in response to an AO. Under these cooperative arrangements, the investigator's government sponsors the research and the U.S. funds the flight operation. An example is a blood rheoiogy experiment being developed by Dr. Dintenfass of the Clrliversity of Sidney, Australia. MPS VARIOUS WORKING GROUPS FIGURE' 8.

The German program is actively pursuing space experiments through the European Space Agency (ESA) Spacelab-1 Materials Science Double Rack. In addition, an ongoing sounding rocket program, Technologische Experimente Unter Schwerelosigkeit (TEXUS), provides a limited low-gravi ty experiment capability similar to the U.S. SPAR program. Simple packages of payload elements (MAUS) have been accommodated for flight in the Shuttle in a manner analogous to the U.S. MEA. In fact, these elements will fly together in 1983 on a pallet in the cargo bay. The Germans have also deposited earnest money for a completely reimburs- able ShuttleISpacelab flight in 1984 on which many industrial experiments will be performed. Industrial irrterest has been stimulated by initial government invest- ments in silicon crystal growth and turbine blade unidirectional solidification. More recent interest in the chemical processing of unidentified products has occurred. SWG's have been established to coordinate disciplinary activities in semiconductors, metals and fluids. The French program also includes experiments on Spacelab-1 in crystal growth with some follow-on planned for Spacelab-3. French crystal growth and solidification experiments also fly on Salyut-6, the NASA sounding rocket program, and are planned for future NASA missions as mentioned previwsly. In general, the French effort is smaller and more research directed than the German activities. No industrial involvement has been identified for reasons that are similar to the U.S. situation. Other European countries with interests in MPS are Italy, Spain, Great Britian, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The experiments from these countries center around basic fluid dynamics experiments in the fluid physics module (Spacelab-1) and small scale demonstration experiments in crystal growth and solidification. Interest at this time is strictly academic in nature with a deeper understanding of the processes being the main goal. Minor interest and inquiries have been expressed by workers in Brazil and Canada. However, no formal activities have been planned at this time. Other independent foreign programs with MPS interests are those of the Soviets, the ESA member nations, and Japan. The Soviets have been flying space experiments routinely on the Salyut-6 laboratory since the summer of 1978. During an initial 14-week period, about 40 different materials were prepared and teturned to Earth for analysis. These specimens were processed in two furnace systems, SPLAV and KRISTAL, which were designed to a standard set of require- ments common to existing terrestrial furnaces. Subsequently, some 20 to 30 additional specimens have been processed, many for Soviet block countries and France. About a dozen of these materials have been reported in the open scientific literature and have included semiconductor crystals, amorphous chalcogenides, oxide glasses, and metal alloys. Most space processing research is carried out at the Space Processing institute in Moscow where about 300 workers plan, implement and analyze space experiments. Japan is developing an interest in MPS that parallels German and U.S. activities. An A0 to participate in space experiments has been circulated in Japan and the results are being evaluated. Also, the Japanese are planning to purchase a dedicated Shu ttle/Spacelab mission in 1986 and are actively seeking ccllaborative support from other countries. Although there has been no feedback yet, it is not anticipated that there will be substantial industrial commitment at this time until precursor experiments have been performed and a knowledge base established. For the U.S., the real challenge in establishing relationships with foreign programs is the conflict that arises through the desire to cooperate in the evolution of the underpinning science and the competition that arises through the anticipated commercia! application of the knowledge derived. The U.S. has traditionally been a leader in developing new science and technology but has not been as successful in its efficient trailsfer to new goods and services in the marketplace. Recognizing this concern, NASA has arranged for early industrial participation in MPS through no-exchange-of-fund arrangements which allow intellectual property to be protected. However, in performing industrial experi- ments, assurance must be provided that full protection is available for such information. One such restriction is the inability to schedule cooperative NASAIindusrrial experiments in the Shuttle together with cooperative NASAIforeign nation experiments, since the latter require full information sharing by current NASA policies. Foreign industrial experiments are flown as fully cost reimbursable payloads (by the responsible government) and so are not subject to the requirement for information disclosure. FUTURE POTENTIAL OF MPS A. Scope of the Program Only those aspects of materials prc cessing that combine deleterious effects due to a sensitivity to gravitational force and potential econc,,?ic feasi- bility are of interest at this time. The technical aspects of low gravity that are of interest to industrial and scientific materials processing are: 1. Reduction of sedimentation and buoyancy to enable control of multiphase systerrts and the preparation of variable density solids. 2. Reduction of density gradien t-driven convection (such as thermal and solu tal convection) to enable direct assessment of the convection effects experienced in industry and research on Earth in crystal growth, solidification, chemical, and biological separation processes, and the subsequent preparation of matelials with more control over structure, composition and external surface features. 3. Reduction of hydrostatic deformation in liqtiids and semisolids enhance industrial and research activities such as floating zones, crystal growth, and solidification, study of critical point phenomena, preparation of high molecular weight crystals, and diffusion of glasses at temper3;ure above the softening temperature. 4. Development of containerless methods for position~ng, measuring, preparing and forming molten, reactive materials. B. - Terrestrial Payoffs From MPS Research and Develoment In general, the MPS program is interested in studies of process parameters to enhance process control and productivity in Earth processing, in the preparation of limited quantities of precursor materials to provide baseline or reference data, and in the dekelopment of methods unique to the space environ- ment by which materials can be prepared which are not possible on Earth. All these interests rely upon the range of process parameters being extended through the reduction of gravity. For example, electrcmagnetic levitation of some molten metals is possible on Earth; however, in space where heating and levitation can be decoupled, any molten conductive sample can be positioned and heated electromag- netically over a wide range of temperatures. In a second example, glass shells for fusion targets are currently produced up to several hundred micron size in drop towers (free-fall); scale-up to 7 to 10 mm (the projected optimum diameter) may be more easily accompr;shed in Earth orbit where longer times are possible at ;~igh temperature. In a third example, growth of solid-solutal crystals required a combination of high temperature gradients at the growth interface, but low interface migration velocities that are impossible to achieve because of the thermal and solutal convection effects; growtti rates and temperature gradients can be decoupled in low gravity, thus, extending the range of stable growth parameters. In all these examples, the first priority is to develop an understanding of the gravita tio3al iimita tions.and to develop theoretical models for one-g and zero-g behavior, followed by breadboarding sirrlple hardware and acquiring prelimi- nary data before committing to major hardware activities. The emphasis is on the informaticn developed from these experiments being a significant contribution to our body of knowledge in materials processing and the technology transfusable to the private sector. The best measure of these activities is the number of technical papers published in the scientific 1-terature. As of August 1980, frbm 61 investigations active at that time, 106 technical rapers were generated over a two- year period. Also, there was much industrial interest. The publication rate is probably comparable to that of similar National Science Foundatio~~ (NSF) funded work, but no attempt was made to develop comparisons Detailed science rtviews of the progress in each investigation are carried out on (roughly! an annual basis by a peer group of non-NASA scientists who write ancnymous reports. These repcrts are aggregated and synopsized by the program scientists and fed back to the PI'S. This peer review process conlplements the initial proposal review which is done by mail in the same manner used by NSF. The industrial i~terest is evidenced by the ground-based investigati~ns by privzre industry, IGI participation on selected investigations and the growing interest in joint NASAIindustry space processingventures. Several such arrhngements have been established through the Commercial Applications Office at MSFC. Gther less formal industrial liaisons have been established through academic institutions such as the Materials Processing Center at MIT. The following list of priorities represents the thrust of the MPS program and ~ts relation to typical areas of privale and pbblic center interest: 1. Crystal Growth Processes a. Melt growrn is t'le most w~dely used technique t'or production of highl techllologv, single-crystal materials for semiconductor chips used in large scale integrated circuits for communications and computers. The MPS program emphasis is conccrltrated on achieving chemical homogeneitv, hence, maximum electrical performance, in HgCdTe and lead-tin-telli~ri\"~ !\"':: , semiconductors. These crystals are among the most sensitive and impo. .. L . -:-ared sensors and most difficult to grow materials on Earth. The two materials brii!l;c 'he spectrum of growth conditions. In the case of PbSnTe, one component is less deli= than the bulk melt, hence the system is subiect to colute instabi!ities. The HgCdTe, on the other hand, has the opposite problem. One component is tnore dense than ttle bulk melt. Therefore, it Is subject to vlidifying interface-shape instabilities. Low-g experiments will determine how well such systems can be grown in the absence of gravity. These are two examples of several c~mmcicially va!uable crystals whose properties may be enhanced by mel' growth in a low-g environmen:. b. Float zone growth is a variation of melt growth in which the material can be melted without the deleterious contact with any cont~iner wall. Floating zone techniques are widely used to produce crystals such as doped silicon for semiconductors and sohr cells While large, efficient zrystals are g.-own commercially with this process, gravity does limit the 5ize and type of crystals that can be grown and does introduce growth rate fluctuations that cause chemical inhomogeneities that necessitate cutting the crystal into small chips for high performance applications. The MPS program emphasis is on establishing uniform growth conditions in commercially impor tan t materials such as indium-doped silicon and CdTe which is a semiconductor with a very high theoretical maximum energy conversion efficiency. c. Solution growth is an important alternative to melt growth for materials that are unstable at their melting point because the crystals can be processed at much lower temperatures The MPS prograb;l emphasis is directed toward triglycine sulphate (TGS) a room temperature, infrared detector material and gallium-arsenide (CaAs) one of the most important semiconductors for - wide range of applications from microwave devices, to computers, and solid stat asers. TGS is grown from a transparent, water base solution that permits obser\\ ation of the growth process; furthermore, the infrared detectivity of the currently available material is constrained to about 20 percent of the theoretical limit hecause of gravity influenced growth defects. Thus, this system represents a good model material that is well characterized and has the possibility of a technological breakthrough if substantial improvement can be realized. GaAs is one of the most important semiconductors with uses ranging from microwave devices to solid state lasers. It can be readily grown I bulk form but with considerable imperfections. Usually, in device fabrication, a thin film of high quality GaAs with precisely controlled additives is grown by liquid-phase epitaxy (layered growth) over a bulk melt grown crystal substrate. However, two problems arise. First, in the growth of the epitaxial layer, the solvent is less dense that the Ga/CaAs solution. Therefore, the growth system cannot be stablized against convection. Second, it is very difficult to control the saturation at the growth interface by lowering the temperature of the substrate. Although it is possible to bury the defects in the substrate, the buried defects tend to migrate with time and eventually emerge at the surface, causing premature device degradation or failure. Therefore, for certain applica- tions, it would be highly desirable to have better substrate material. For these reasons the growth of GaAs in low-g is of interest from a theoretical as well as a technological point of view. d. Vapor growth does not compete favorably with other growth techniques on Earth where large crystals are required because gravity disrupts the vapor transport nechanisms; it is a useful process for growing \"whiskersv1 or thin monocr).stalline films and for materials that do not lend themselves to other convenient techniques The absence of gravity opens new possibilities for the growth of iarge, flat, pure crystals by the vapor technique; therefore, the MPS Frogram includes the investigation of Hg12 nuclear detector crystals and HgCdTe and cnpper-indium-antimony (CuInSb) solid solution sem conductor crystals. HgIZ which is an excellent prospect for nuclear radiation detector that can be used at ambient temperature. One of the factors that is believed to limit the performance of this material is its high density and extreme weakness at the growth temperature. Because the crystal has a layer structure, self deformation during growth under one-g is believed to be an important factor in producing dislocations which degrade the performance as a nuclear energy detec tor. The growth of such a crystal in low-g could eliminate such strains at the growth temperzture. It is also anticipated that the perfection of the crystal might benefit from the more quiescent growth conditions expected in space. The solid solution semiconductor materials are being pursued not only because of interest noted earlier in the materials, but also because earlier flight experirnents indicated much higher growth rates in zero-g than those produced on Earth. 2. Solidification Processes Directional solidification is a casting process used to produce single crystals and two-phase composite materials wherein the microstructure is aligned in a particular direction such that the mechanical and physical properties differ along various axes, or wherein fine, homogeneous dispersions are achieved. Common examples of two- (or multi) phase composites might be fiberglass wherein glass filaments are suspended (either unidirectionally or randomly) in a plastic matrix to increase strength and provide anisotropic properties and dispersion hardened steel wherein small carbide particles are included in the steel matrix to improve strength. The advantage of this process is that the growth rate and, hence, the microstructure and properties can be controlled. zero-g, the tendencies for the second-phse materials, to be uncontrollably ,,lixed through convection or separated by sedimentation/buoyancy, are eliminated and sharper thermal gradients and lower growth rates are achievable. The MPS interest in directionally aligned composites is built upon the extraordinarily high magnetic coercivity measured in space-grown composites of Mn-Bi/Bi. Additional interest is based on the potential of approaching the theoretical maximum magnetic strength of materials such as samarium-cobalt (SmCo3) which is 10 timcs higher than currently realized on Earth. The second aspect of directional solidification finds application in miscibility gap alloys that defy preparation in one-g in bulk quantities because gravitydriven effects cause the materizls to segregate upon solidification. There are some 500 such combinations of materials that have a liquid phase miscibility gap. If producible, such materials might have such diverse applications as electrical contacts (as replaceme~ts for silver and gold) and self -lubricating bearings. Experiments in low-g have successfully produccd finely dispersed, homogeneous mixtures of Ga-Bi Cu-Pb-Al, Cd-Ca-Al, and transparent model waterials, are being studied in the MPS to define nongravity segregation phenomena and to establish the techniques to produce these unique materials for property evaluation. While app:ications may be specu lazed from theoretical considerations, the inability to produce bulk quantities on Earth necessitates the making of samples in one-g to verily those expectations and the application viability. Undercooled soh ' cation is the rapid quenching of molten mate- rials at temperatures well below ttluir freezing points. This process is valuable in the preparation of a.norphous (glass or glass-like) materials as well as pure single crystal and metastable phases. .Materials have a natural tendency to form uniform crystalline structures; therefore, to make a glassy material, the atoms must be \"frozen\" in a random order before the crystalline state is achieved. The common ghss materials can be chilled and solidified by common Earth-based techniques Other marerials can be solidified in the amorphous state, except that the atomic mobility is generaliy so rapid that heat (especially for molten materials that must be held in a crucible) cannot be extracted before crystal nucleation takes phce. Through elimination of the gravitational requirement for a container, a vast array of materials can be processed in the amorphous state in low-g, thus, extending che materials properties available to mechanical and optical designers The so-called \"reluctant glass forming\" materials are the basis of the MPS program effort. NASA is doing and sponsoring work on giasses such as CaO-CaO to produce such materials in bulk quantities and to confirm their improved energy transfer efficiency for applications such as laser hosts. The NASA MPS program has developed unique ground-based free fall facilities at MSFC in which extreme undercooling (hundreds of degrees centigrade in excess of existent theory) has been achieved in the nroduction of bulk quantities of pure single crystals and supercon- ducting metastable phases; these materials have not beet) made in bulk quantities by other methods. The emphasis in undercooled solidification centers on the formation of pure Nb and the super conduct in^ phase NbjCe, which has a high superconducting transition temperature (23.2 K) and offers great promise for electrical transmission and ekctrical devices By producing these compounds in samples large enough to be analyzed by neutron diffraction, the relationship between perfection of the crystalline structures and the superconducting perform- ance can be analyzed. Such studies may shed some light on methods for obtaining superconductors which work at higher temperatures Casting technology has already been advanced through zero-g experiments that unequivocally illustrate how the crystalline structure grows and is subsequently disrupted by gravitational effects leading to the pervasive occurrence of property variations from top to bottom of a casting (an engine block, for example) and shrinkage. Castings made in zero-g have un~form microstructure and properties. Therefore, the MPS program is using the zero-g environment to study the formation and resultant properties of various cast materials (both simple model materials and commercial alloys) tc establish process controls and techniques that might be adapted on Earth. Furthermore, NASA is studying the prospects of casting complex, single crystal shapes (such iis turbine blades) in space to achieve theoretic-1 maximum properties from the materials. 3. - Containerless Processing Levitation technology is being pursued to develop devices for posit,ming, melting, manipulating, and resolidifying materials in space without the constraint of containers or crucibles. In space, liquid materials will remain in a stable, spherical drop without containers; thus, small restraining forces are slifficient to keep the drop where desired. The processing of materials without the necessity of containers is an exciting and unique capability of the space environ- ment and permits the formation of pure materials without contamination from the container, permits the formation of amorphous (glass) materials that cannot be ma& on Earth, and permits the rr~easurement of physical properties of molten materials at temperatures that exceed the melting point of crucibles needed on Earth. The MPS program technology is directed toward the development of high temperature acoustic levitators (or positioning devices) for use with materials that can be processed in a gaseous environment, electromagnetic levitators for use with electrically conductive materials, in either gaseous or vacuum processing environ- ments, and electrostatic levitatws for use with dielectric materials that need to be processed in vacuum environments. Low-g flight experiments have been conducted successfully with both acoustic and electromagnetic devices, and the practical application of this technology to a vast spectrum of both scientific and commercial processes can be realized through the elimination of detrimental gravitational effects, 4. - Biological Separation Processes Bioseparation technology is being addressed because Earth4ased techniques for producing high purity materials in significant quantities from complex biological mixtures are adversely affected by gravity. In the gravity-free environment of space, separation techniques that are based on electric fields and biological material surface characteristics become highly efficient. Furthermore, such separation techniques are inherently gentle and do not damage or destroy live cells or other material. The focus of the MPS program is in developing the technology for separation techniques such as electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and phase partitioning. Substantive advances have already been made in the improvement of the Earth-based technology through the MPS program, and a venture by a private sector firm has been formalized to explore the viability of commerciali?ation of pharmaceuticals separated by such techniques in space. 5. Fluids Mechanics and Chemical Processes Fluid mechanics are critical to nearly all material processes since at some point in the process, the materials exist in either the liquid or gaseous state and are, theref ore, subject to gravitational disturbances. The MPS program has undertaken to analyze the processes and to deveiop appropriate theoretical and mathematical models for both the one-g and low-g aspects once such understanding is imperative to understanding the Earth-based property limits and the viability of low-g euperimentation. The development of adequate mathematical models (at least for simple materials) is especially important since many, if not most, commercial material processes have been developed empirically over long periods of time (dating as far back as the Bronze Age) and often involve such complex mixtures and combinations of materials that they defy analysis of the reactions and interactions taking place. Low-g offers an opportunity to isolate one of the major variabies in understanding these processes. Chemical processes are being studied to elucidate the effects of gravity in processes where particle size and geometry may affect the chemical reaction kinetics Currently, the MPS program is investigating the reaction kinetics of polymers to understand and, perhaps, overcome the current commercial size limitations in producing uniform, microscopic particles for applications such as blood cell counter and electron microscopic calibration, calibration of pore sizes in living or other membranes, and for tagging biological materials. Under one-g, as the particle size is increased, they tend to aggregate and sediment. An early low-g flight experiment may provide valuable information on chemical process controls applicable to the field of polymer chemistry. I V. RELATED SPACE CAPABILITIES A number of supporting systems have been identified to rovide the fh functional requirements of materials processing experiments. e experi- ments range from simple models for proofsfconcept to continuously operat- ing pilot plants. First, to support any MPS experiment, there must be a carrier md they range in concept from a drop tower on Earth, to aircraft, sounding rdets, Space Shuttle, Spacelab, free-f lying satellites with automated mech- anisms, and extraterrestrial apparatus with robotic devices These carriers must be specifically designed to provide a low-gravity environment, except for the last case, which range in time from four seconds for the drop tower on Earth to many months of unattendea operation or1 a free-flying satellite. MPS experiments also require large amounts of electrical energy compared to other space ver.tures, thereby requiring a large electrical power system. However, in the case of metallurgical experiments, the energy is used primarily for heating and melting, so solar furnaces have been proposed for the future. Concomitant with heating goes cooling for quenching, among other purposes, with heat exchange systems requiring fluid transfer. Also measuring systems, including data communications with controllers on Earth, are neces- sary to manage the experiment or manufacturing facility. Finally, automated mechanisms will be required ranging up to complic~ted robotics which can perform a number of mechanical functions under microprocessor control. A. Ground-Based Facilities As an economical simulation technique, ground-based facilities, namely drop tubes and drop towers, have been developed to provide lowcost, functionally flexible and readily available low-g test facilities. MSFC operates two drop tubes (one of 100-foot length and one of 300-foot length) and a 300-foot drop tower. These facilities provide between two and four seconds of low-g time. In the drop tubes, molten droplets are released into an evacuated tube and are solidified during the vertical free fall. The drop tower employs a free-falling aerodynamic container within which experiment packages are mounted for zero-g tests.. 6. Aircraft Experin-- By flying parabolic trajectories, short periods of low gravity can be achieved with a~rcraft. The NASA/Johnson Space Center KC-135 aircraft has been used for several years to obtain low-g material science data and equipment verification. This aircraft can accommodate a relatively large experiment package which may be either automated or manually operated; the KC-135 low-g operating periods are, typically, 15 to 30 seconds and are quite satisfactory for solidification studies and precursory experiments in other areas, such as containerless processing. More recently, the NASAIDryden Flight Research Center F-104 aircraft has been used for MPS precursory experiments. This aircraft accommodates small, automated ex- periments and can achieve 30 to 60 seconds of microgravity time. C. Sounding Kocket Experiment MSFC has, for several years, employed sounding rockets to provide a number of short-duration (4 to 6 minutes) flight opportunities for investigators to pursue their research in low-gravity phenomena and to develop concepts and techniques to be 11sed later in Shuttle flights. The low-gravity environment on sounding rockets was found to be an excellent interim tool for meaningful research in materials science. However, the short duration and harsh launch environment, including spin-up and spin-down, provide a real challenge for experiment design. Despite these limitations, the sounding rocket program has been beneficial for accom~oda- ting a cadre of experimentalists interested in conducting materials research under low-gravity conditions. The scientific goals have been worthy and many of the research ideas to be carried out on the Shuttle emerged from these experiments. Considerable experience has been gained in developing and testing new hardware, and a significant inventory of off-the-shelf hardware has been built up that can also be used to conduct longer duration experiments which will be flown on a space-available basis during Shuttle operations. Experience in developing low cost hardware and experiments has been a vital product of this program. The sounding rocket is expected to continue to be an important experimental c~pability 111 the MPS program for several years. D. Space Shuttle The Space Shuttle is a transportation facility or carrier providing space environmental capability for several kinds of experiment packages for nominal periods of time of, initially, five days. Experimental facilities to be carried on the Shuttle include: self-contained packages on the Orbiter middeck, MEA, Spacelab module, and Spacelab pallet (Figures 9 through 12, respectively). Alsr>, the Shuttle is the means of putting a free flyer such as the Materials Experiment Carrier (Figure 13) into orbit and resupplying it. Future Payload Requirements Physical and engineering requirements for scientific/commercia1 candidate payloads were determined, largely on the basis of interviews with materials experts from government, industry and university laboratories, including members of the NASA MPS working groups and other PI'S of NASA- sponsored MPS research. ORISISAL PAGE IS OF POOR WAllTY Review of past and current MPS projects and contacts with potential scientific and commercial users led to a grouping of MPS materials processing methods.. From these groups, sufficient interest was found in the following nine processes to provide a high probability of their becoming future payloads, so they were the ones considered in developing payload require- ments. o ASES - Advanced Solidification Expcrirrwt System o HGOS - High Gradient Directional Solidification AC - Acoustic Containerless Processing System o EMC - Electromagnetic Containerless Processing System. o ESC - Electrostatic Containerless Processing Sy s- tem o SCG - Solution Crystal Grcwth System o VCC - Vapor Crystal Growth System o \u00a3310 - Bioseparation System Composite processing requirements for- rsndichte payloads are plotted in bar chart form (Figure 14). The key parameters sh0wr-1 are temperature, time, sample diameter, and sample length. The multidiscipline character of MPS experiments to be accommodated is reflected in the wide range of processing parameters indicated in the chart. Composite payload requirements of weight, volume, power and energy are plotted in Figure 15. A standard payload envelope was defined as an engineering compromise to accommodate all of the MPS payload research objectives and commercia 1 demonstrations. It became clear from these studies that economy of spacecraft operations for materials processing ultimately requires a free-flying satellite. This automatic, unattended free flyer will provide the long duration at low-g needed for continuous processing, such as free-flow separ,ation of pharmaceu- tical product:, repetitive operations, such as growing a large number of semiconductor crystals for ~nfrared sensors. The Space Shuttle can serve as the transportation vehicle to place the free flyer into orbit, to supply it with raw material to pick up the finished product. This requires teleoperator manipulation and maneuvering of raw material and product packages ~IME (HOURS) Payload Notation -- ASES - Advanced Solidification EMC - Electromagnetic Container1 Sys tern - Electrostatic Containerlcjs HGDS - High Gradient Directional SCt - Solution Crystal Growth Sol idi fication VCS - Vapor C;j.>~al Growth FZ - Float Zone BIO - Bioprocessing AC - Acoustic Containerless FIGUPX 14. COMPOSITE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS FIGURE 15. COMPOSITE REQUIREMENTS ON MEC Also, it became clear from these studies that high levels of electrical energy will be nee&d to do materials processing for commercial development. An early example of this need has been defined by MDAC for its commercial development of a separation facility for phZW~c\u20ac?LItical materials in space. A free-flyer capability will be required according to MDAC in the mid-1980's and, therefore, it is an integral and necessary part of the MPS program planning. F. Extraterrestrial Space Materials Processing The application of the low-g research to terrestrial materials production is a primary gaal of the MPS program, as is the use of space processing of materials when transportation and processing is both technically and economically practical. There remains the ultimate step of processing materials indigenous to space--in space--for space applications. The in-situ mining, processing, and fabrication of materials entail exciting long-term prospects as well as near-term challenges in research and technology to estbalish the feasibility and practicality. Not only is it necessary to develop a unique \"space chemistry\" applicable to lunar, planetary, or asteroidal rnate- rials, it is necessary to develop a commensurate automation and robotic technology to establish feasibility and to facilitate eventual implementation. The beginning of this long range effort is discussed in Section 11. In terms of space capabilities planned or available to do extrater- restrial space materials processing, there is a base set of tools with which to start the develoment of necess-iry technology. These include m icraprocessor- controlled robots used in some manufacturing operations today (such as welding); teleopera tor maneuvering devices for exchanging boxes and samples in furnaces; and manipulators such as those used on planetary landers for digging and analyzing soil samples. These need to be developed further to be larger, more flexible and independent. Additionally, there is a need to further develop early versions of reduction cells to make aluminum, silicon and other intermediates from extra,terrestrial soils, followed by apparatus for mattend- ed extrusion of sheets and shapes, deposition of coatings, automatic cutting, stamping, brazing, welding and assembly of components. For instance, it has been proposed that a space built, solar power station may be needed to supply electrical energy to Earth and that the large volume of solar cells, collectors i nd supporting structures might be built less expensively in space. This is the challenge of extraterrestrial MPS. PROGRAM OPTIONS The MPS program is structured on gaals, objectives, and priorities to provide the rationale for selecting the implementing tasks and flight plans. These phns ultimakly derive the needed budgetary resources to accomplish the goals. They support a certain number of researchers, including in-house NASA, academic and industrial, in addition to the payload development (fiight hardware) contractors and flight operations There are a number of options for the budget, ranging from (1) going out of business on the part of the government, through (2) the current minimum level program, to (3) an augmented program that will support a practical schedule to demonstrate the oppartunities with the least delay. A decision to withdraw all government leadership and support would leave the field to private industry. Industry would then do the necessary research whenever it was convinced that profits could be realized in the short term or near future with products in its field of interest. This course of action would be an abdication of the charge contained in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to transfuse technology to the private sector, since the government controls the way to space ai?d has the most information on operations in space. The shear magnitude of the total systems problem in implementing a space venture is larger than any one company normally is willing to take on, considering a new venture with long-term payoff and high risk. By way of history, it was necessary for the government to lead the way with research and demonstrations in con. :unications satellites, jet-turbine engines for aircraft and nuclear-power reactors, &or example, until a profitable threshold was reached. It appears that the same trend is evident in MPS. Also, it should be noted that several foreign governments, who compete openly for high technology markets against American industry, have opted to support MPS. The current budgetary plan, shown in Table V-I, is considered to be the minimum required to stay in business. It is a profound reduction from previous requests which were based upon viable program plans for development and capitalization new processes. It supports a subcritlcal number of investigators and flight experimenters categorized in Table V-2. The payloads currently being developed on this budget are the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR), Fluids Experiment System (F ES), VCG system, and the Solidification Experiments System (SES). It is expected that the program will be able to grow to provide experimental facilities for a larger cadre of investigators based on the planned expansion in budgetary resources, if allowed. The figures shown include funding for the governmental and academic segments. TABLE V-1.

The Applications Research and Data Analysis (ARdcDA), Supporting Research and Technology (SRT), budget item is expected to support 70 or more scientific investigations instead of the 41 currently active. The payload development would support the 5 experiment systems listed in the note with Table V-3, and the experiment operations would provide for reflights of the apparatus cur:ently being developed While the experiment operation items include flight cperational support of commercial ventures, they do not include STS charges or the private funding required to provide commercial payloads. The future requirements in the private and international segments cannot be estimated at this time, since we do not know the depth or extent of private plans for involvement. It is expected that commercial payoffs will begin only after several flights of each of the systems listed in the note. In order for the MPS program to demonstrate feasibility to the commer- ;.ial/industrial sector, it needs many flight opportunities and experimental payloads such as the systems listed in the note to Table V-3. The MPS program cannot be expected to be fruitful in terms of commercial payoffs until there has been a krge number of investigations to address the broad scope of technologies identified. This requires expensive hardware, that is the development of new flight experiment payload systems to accomplish the tasks set forth. Table V-4 shows the steps which must be taken in sequence and, in most disciplines, the MPS program is still in the research stage. The current budget, Table V-1, does not provide for development of the needed pay load systems except the first Spacelab complement which includes the FES, VCC system, and SES. A detailed explanation of the tasks and categories covered under each budgetary line item follows. The UPN 179, \"AR&DA,\" embraces the sustaining research and technology activities fundamental and necessary to the realization of the MPS program goals.

The RTOP's represent areas wherein gravitational forces and/or other elements of the space environment are known and have been demonstrated to have a significant effect upon the process variables, and wherein significant commercial potential exists. The research program in each area is devel ?ed to systematically isolate and analyze the process variables essential for applications. The sponsored research is st-lected within the context of the existing data base in the materials science and processing disciplines, and withi; the context of work sponsored or anticipated by other sources. The areas of technology (RTOPs) under ATD are intended to provide the techniques, proof-of-concept, and breadboard activities to permit implementation of the MPS research prograrn through the necessary and incidental payload hardware development efforts. This effort is essential and complementary to the research program in that it will preclude or minimize high programmatic and, possibly, scientific impacts to the hardware development activities. The techno- logy areas are derived from the commonality of design requirements and statesf- the-art advances that permeate through all of the payload hardware developments that have been defined and forecast from the ground-based research The technology effort is anticipated to be largely based upon contracted study efforts augmented by NASA in-house expertise. The Phase A and Phase B definition studies are the natural extension of the SHT and ATD througll the predevelopment aspects of the NASA-phased project planning philosophy leading to the agency commitment for a new start or new initiative. The definition studies provide the engineering insight and industrial planning base for the hardware procurements. MPS Shuttle/Spacelab Payload Development - UPN 674 As a necessary and iqcidental adjunct to the realization of the program goal, spaceflight payloads are needed in which to conduct the research, demonstra- tions, and preparation of exemphry materials. Subsequent to a well characterized grour~j-based research program, and appropriate technology and definition studies, and upon commitment of the agency to proceed with new starts or new initiatives, the design, development, and support activities associated with MPS payloads will be accomplished under UPN 674. The payload development activities entail the following: Payload Deslgn and Development Payload Integration Support for Initial Mission Initial Mission Operations Support PI Experiment Development PI Experiment Support Relative to the Shuttle ground operations flow, UPN 674 provides for Prelevel IV integration, and the support to the Level IV-I integration that may be required from the MPS payload developer and the PI'S. Level IV-I integration expenses are to be budgeted by the appropriate Mission Management Office commensurate with payload mission assignments from other appropriate fund sources. Real time mission operations support, if required by either the MPS payload developer or the Plls, would be included in UPN 674. Payload specialist training and mission activities are to be funded from other sources through the Mission Management Office, including those specialized activities or training required in conjunction *~ith the PI experiment develrpment. The PI experiment development provides for the analyses, ground-based research, precursory experi- mentation, ground-control and flight-sample preparation, real time mission sup- port, and post-flight analyses. NASA-sponsored scientific flight experiments are selected through a peer review of responses to an AO; commercial application flight experiments originating from joint endeavors or reimbursable flight oppor- tunities are supported @'kterials Exper~ment Operationst1 PI experiment alpport essential to accommodate specla1 analyses, testing, and hardware sv9port unique to the PI'S experiment development and implementation. Opera thns associated with precursory experi- .;.lentation and with the Ground Control E~~periment Laboratory (CCEL), because of their sustaining and generalize suppwt, are funded from UPN 6xx, \"Materials Experiment operation^,'^ although the original procurement of CCEL hardware is generally a part of the developmer~ r Lontract. Currently, the MPS payloads to support the Spacelab 3 mission and a shared satellite deployment mission are being developed under UPN 674. Additional Shuttle or Spacelab MPS payload items are required and will be pursued to meet the scientific demands of the various research areas evolving from UPN 179, AKdcDA. A free-flying experiment capability is essential for MPS to achieve the low cost per sample essential for multiple sample research programs and commer- cial applications, as well as, to achieve long low-g processing times and to satisfy high power, energy, and heat rejection demands. Consistent with the advent of an interim free flyer and/or a power system and the MEC, to be developed by the Office of Space Transportation Systems, supporting payload developments will be pursued under UPN 674. Materials Experiment Opera NMI 8010.1, \"Cbssif ication of NASA Space Transportation System (STS) Payloads,\" all MPS payload hardware is intended and designed for repeated operations and economy (Chss C), and nearly all PI'S require multiple samples and multiple reflight opportunities to accomplish experimental objectives MPS microgravity experimentation, responsive to the needs of the PI'S, is accom- modated through a wide variety of test capabilities: Typical Micro- gravity Duration Drop Towers and Drop Tubes Aircraft and Parabolic Flights Sounding Rockets (SPAR) Space Shu tt le M EA Spacelab Module Spacelab Pallet M EC Space Vacuum Research 2-4 20-40 seconds 4-6 minutes 5 7days 7-30 days 7-14 days Long Duration Long Duration Much of the MPS payload equipment can and wil: be employed on a number of payload carriers; for example, the single axis acoustic levitator designed for the SPAR is to be utilized on the MEA with the addition of an automatic sample changer, potentially, on the Spacelab pallet, and, ultimately, with some modifica- tion, on the MEC. Because of the iriterchangeability of hardware, the changing pay loadhnvest igator mission manifests, and the long term, sustaining operational nature of the MPS operational activities, UPN 6xx is intended to consolidate those activities to insure proper management control, continuity of scientific support, consistency in procedures and documentation control, and elimination of duplica- tive effort.

Level IV-1 expenses are to be ou,dgeted by the appropriate Mission Management Office commensurate with payload mission assignments from other appropriate fund sources. Real-time reflight mission operations support, if required by either the MPS payload integrator or the PI's, would be included under UPN 6xx. Payload specialist training ~i~d mission activities are to be funded from other sources through the Mission Management Gffice, including those specialized activities or training required in conjunction with the PI experiment reflight work; Payload refurbishment, reconfiguration, modification, replacement, and reverification provide the overall effort associated with the hardware, software, and documentation maintenance to accommodate the scientific and operational requirements. The reflight PI experiment activity provides analyses, ground-based research, ground-control and flight-sample preparation, real-time mission support, and post-flight analyses. Reflight PI experiment support accommodates the special analyses, testing, and hard ware support unique to the PI'S experiment implementa- tion. An essential element of spaceflight experimentation is the establishment of ground-based reference data for use in post-flight analyses. To the extent possible, the reference specimens and data must be prepared under conditions which duplicate the spaceflight conditions with the exception of the gravitational environments. The GCEL is composed of experimental equipment which is functionally identical to the flight hardware in which preflight reference specimens and data are obtained. To insure functioral compatibility between CCEL and flight payload hardware, both devices must be maintained under the same configuration convol system. The sustaining operation and control of the GCEL are provided under UPN 6xx. Commercial applications entail considerable preparatory work with the private sector to find a mutually beneficial basis for cooperative- or private- funded ventures The culmination of the preparatory work is generally realized in NASA providing integration and operations support either in a reciprocal arrange- ment (joint endeavor) or on a reimbursement basis. This is due to the fact that few private-sector investigators have the experience and expertise with spaceflight hardware to assume those responsibilities initially on their own. While NASA might assist in the development of commercial payload hardware, the overall thrust of the commercial application effort is to pravide a self-supporting, sustaining operational basis for the exploitation of the space environment for the public benefit through the private sector; therefore, the multifaceted commercial appli- cations are included under UPN 6xx. In conclusion, the materials processes that can most probably be improved by operations in low gravity have been ide~tified. They are contained solidifica- tion, including single crystal growth and polycrystalline solidification of metals and alloys; containerless solidification of crystalline and new amorphous materials; and new bioseparation techniques, among other fluid and chemical processes. Research has been initiated in each of these disciplines and some flight experiments have been defined. Table V-5 shows the evolution of the MPS program which is necessary to accomplish the essential next steps toward potential commercial applications, of which there are many.
