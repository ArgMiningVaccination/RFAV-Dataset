This course approaches methods and strategies for creating herbal formulas.This workshop-style class engages participants to use several philosophical tools and constructs for creating herbal formulas and provide a platform for discussion, inquiry, practice and sharing.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00Traditional Medicines from the GreatlandPresenter: Gary Ferguson, NDOriginal Date: May 18, 2019Many of our natural healing approaches have a deep connection to indigenous cultures around the world. As we examine the cultural roots of these modalities, as we deepen our understanding of the contexts from which our medicines come, we deepen both our understanding and practice of these healing agents and techniques. In this workshop, we share dialogue around the healing plants along with the stories and ceremonies that go with them from the indigenous cultures of the North.We cover the origins of blockbuster drugs like Tamoxifen, whose analog is from Taxus brevifolia (Pacific Yew), and how intellectual property in the future of medicines from plants is being handled differently than in the past.2.0 cultural competency CEUs approved by OBNM - Herbs and Annah Shapiro, NDOriginal Date: May 18, 2019This interactive workshop addresses using herbal and pharmaceutical medicine to support trans and gender-diverse people, with a focus on common health issues that arise in the first year of physical transition with hormones. Participants learn tools and resources, with a focus on herbal interventions, for treating common issues that come up with folks using hormones to transition and maintaining the optimal wellbeing of patients. We also talk about basic language guidelines, consent, trauma-informed care, and many more topics that address how to affirm trans and gender-diverse populations.This presentation reviews the possible effects or interactions of pharmaceuticals such as estradiol and testosterone. It also covers the ethical guidelines and cultural considerations of working with trans and gender-diverse populations.2.0 CEUs (0.5 pharmacy and 1.5 cultural competency) approved by OBNM - Bitter Herbs and Mucosal Immunity: The Role of Taste Receptors in the AirwayPresenter: Guido Mas\u00e9, RH (AHG)Original Date: May 18, 2019Using chronic sinus infections as a jumping-off point, we explore how the use of herbs topically and through inhalation can impact allergies, asthma, and chronic infection through a range of mechanisms. We won't cover the use of bitters in gut health: this is a well-described link already. But we do talk about practical strategies for engaging with the bitter taste receptors in our airways, GI tract, and liver for relieving chronic infection and congestion.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Rue, Resin and Rose: A Sacred and Medicinal Trilogy of Latin American Materia MedicaPresenter: Mimi Hernandez, RH (AHG)Original Date: May 18, 2019Weaving tradition and science, we journey to the grandmother's altar and explore the old world protections of rue, the medicinal resins of copal and sangre de drago, and the healing enchantments of rose while digging deeply in the study of clinical applications and materia medica of these sacred plant medicines. We dive into a system of Latin American folk healing as a response to the collective health of a culture affected by envy, trauma and fear. Participants will gain a better understanding of how these concepts show up in a clinical setting and how to work with these plant allies.2.0 cultural competency CEUs approved by OBNM - Cost: Hop Mimi (AHG)Original Date: May 19, 2019This introduction to phytochemistry as it relates to herbal medicine is taught in simple and friendly terminology. Topics include polysaccharides, polyphenols, alkaloids, tannins, resins, glycosides, volatile oils, and many more! Participants learn how to recognize various chemical structures and how the nature of these structures plays a role in the activity of the medicinal constituent in the body. The information is also utilized to inform our medicine making practices with information relevant to solvencies.2.0 general CEUs approved by May 19, 2019Traditional, holistic systems of medicine understand that in order to offer remedies and true paths to healing we must be able to not only know their actions, but their qualities and what areas of the body they affect. Today, evidence-based medicine values data in the form of clinical trials. We gather data in the form of organoleptic learning, find patterns through sipping tea and doing a plant proving. Plant sits often are used to help understand the spirit of the plant, but in this workshop we dissect the physiological workings of a plant we ingest. We look at flavors, qualities, and how sort through and define actions in the body.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ Jillian Stansbury, NDOriginal Date: May 19, 2019This lecture explores some of the most commonly encountered types of pain including musculoskeletal, neuralgic, and nociceptive pain. The mechanisms of action of selected anodyne herbs are explored and sample formulas for specific conditions are presented. We also discuss topical applications with a number of exact recipes being shared, and we will detail herbs that have specific niche indications for unique types of pain such as renal colic, bone pain, metastatic pain.2.0 pain management CEUs approved by OBNM Paul BergnerOriginal Date: May 19, 2019Bitter-flavored herbs are a mainstay of therapeutics on all major systems of herbalism. Bitter substances can bind to bitter receptors in the mouth and gut to produce, through signaling, physiological changes in multiple systems. The humoral effects of bitter substances are viewed as cooling, drying, and draining. Considering both the physiological and humoral aspects, we can arrive at the appropriate use for therapeutic effects and for avoiding adverse humoral effects. Excessive or prolonged use of bitters can cause injury to the digestive process and injure the overall constitution. Understanding the general effect of the bitter flavor we will describe nuances of therapeutic applications for digestive bitters, bitter laxatives, bitter mints, bitter anodynes and bitter demulcents.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Targeted Herbs, Flower Date: May 17, 2019We know that people experience and heal from trauma differently. Have you ever wondered why herbal and other therapies that should be effective don't seem to work in some cases? The emerging field of psychogenetics offers important insights that can help us better individualize our herbal, flower-essence and nutritional therapies and to help people truly heal. We'll begin with an overview of basic genetic variances that raise the risk of developing PTSD and discuss how to identify them in practice - with or without genetic testing. Using those insights we'll differentiate among different herbs, flower essences and nutrients for each PTSD subtype.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Cost: 18, 2019Going well beyond ginkgo, we'll explore how herbs can impact our ability to think clearly, remember well, and stay focused. Emerging allies, from Chinese club moss to the bulbs of snowdrops and daffodils, can be used alongside traditional neurotonics to give protocols fast-acting, specific life-enhancing effects. We will discuss the appropriate use of entheogens, both in microdoses and at therapeutic levels, to help catalyze positive change in mind/spirit function and engagement. We will cover the clinical research around these herbs, and organize them into protocols that honor the cyclical nature of creativity and inspiration. These strategies are applicable for those caring for elders, but can play a role to support cognitive function for clients of any age.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00Nutrition the Herbal ParadigmPresenter: Paul BergnerOriginal Date: May 18, 2019Herbalists view their therapeutic agents in the paradigm of humoral and clinical actions, and therapeutic uses. In the long traditions of medical herbalism, dietetics and nutrition have been essential elements of a therapeutic plan, and individual macro and micronutrients may also be viewed as possessing actions identical to those of medicinal plants, such as tonic, adaptogenic, antispasmodic, immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory and so on. In many cases giving herbs with such actions without simultaneously replenishing the nutrient factors that support normal functions simply temporarily masks a deficiency. We will discuss macronutrients, vitamins, minerals and other special nutrients in terms of what their actions would be if they were plants.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Game Changing Botanical Medicines in Developmental PediatricsPresenter: Shehab El-Hashemy, NDOriginal Date: May 18, 2019In this 2 hour presentation Dr El-Hashemy shares his experience using botanical medicines in complex conditions in developmental pediatrics as well as pediatric psychiatry. The focus will be on game-changing, evidence-informed use of selected traditional botanicals from eastern and western traditions. In pragmatic manner, we cover indications, traditional uses, state of the evidence, dosing, concurrent use with prescription medications (safe to combine, interactions and contraindication), how to motivate compliance in a child, and my favorite getting kids to make their own formulations! Dr El-Hashemy shares practical pearls in prescribing, stocking, dispensing of common and not so common botanical medicines. This presentation focuses on the child exhibiting cognitive delay, the impulsive/inattentive child (ADHD), the anxious child, the depressed child, and the child with substance-related or addictive disorder.This presentation covers useful exemplar formulations and variations featuring Dr El-Hashemy's Mental OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00No Ingestion Required: as Scent, Soaks and MorePresenter: Missy RohsOriginal Date: May 19, 2019Teas, tinctures, and capsules are great, but what about other ways to use herbs medicinally? We'll talk about ways to achieve profound physical healing with herbs that don't require taking them orally. Engaging with plants in these other ways can be fun, creative, sensual, or deeply pragmatic. Plus, it expands the range of people who can work with herbs safely, making herbalism more accessible to all. Come expand your understanding of what constitutes 'medicine!'2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Glen Nagel, NDOriginal Date: May 19, 2019Cannabis is a plant with star power. The current greening of the USA with changing cannabis laws. Many states now have recreational cannabis which means that many of our friends, clients and patients are able to access cannabis medicine. These folks are also using other botanicals. In this talk will present an overview of the current state of cannabis medicine and discuss the energetics of cannabis. Dr Nagel will give an overview of active constituents of cannabis including THC, CBD other minor cannabinoid's as well as the various terpenes. An overview of the Cannabinoid system and its effects on human physiology. Dr Nagel will discuss the combination of cannabis with other herbs and relevant research as well as any potential cautions. Cannabis has the potential to be one of the best botanical synergists if we can understand its actions and ability to work well with other herbs.2.0 general CEUs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ MedicinePresenter: Gary Ferguson, NDOriginal Date: May 19, 2019Many of our natural healing approaches have a deep connection to indigenous cultures around the world.
