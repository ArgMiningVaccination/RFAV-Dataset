The effect of the steam along with the oils will open up pores and loosen debris and toxins they may be holding, making it easier to gently cleanse them away. You can employ this method at night to aid in your skin's ability to absorb products for about five to 10 minutes before using your face wash, and you can do the same in the a.m. to achieve the perfect canvas for flawless makeup application. Just keep in mind that skin exposed to hot water too often can lead to dryness, so be sure to alternate your steaming days so you don't overdo it. If your skin is sensitive or prone to dryness, there's an alternative way to steam. First, heat five cups of water. After it cools a bit, pour it into a bowl and add a few drops of your preferred oils (rose and jasmine are ideal when it comes to steaming sensitive skin). Place your head a few inches above the bowl, drape yourself with a towel, and let the steam work its magic. "}
