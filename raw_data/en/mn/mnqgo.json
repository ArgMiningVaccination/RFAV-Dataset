Lucy Atkins reports.", "sitename": "The Guardian", "date": "2003-12-16", "cleaned_text": "When Stephen Hall, 43, was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer, he did what many of us might and went to an alternative therapist who promised him that his condition was curable. Hall believed him. Last week, his \"wellness practitioner\", Reginald Gill, 68, from Poole, Dorset, was convicted of two offences under the Trades Descriptions Act after selling Hall an \"IFAS high frequency therapy device\" that would, he claimed, kill off the cancer cells. Gill had also advised Hall against chemotherapy, saying he would \"go home in a box\" if he did, and told him to stop taking morphine for the pain. Instead, he put him on an extreme diet, sold him an electronic device, and charged him \u00a375 for treatment sessions at home. The court heard that Gill told Hall after one treatment: \"I've got it. I've killed the bad cells; it's just the pancreas that needs more work.\" Hall died 10 weeks after the cancer was diagnosed. Last week, his mother said outside the court: \"The verdict today should go a long way towards protecting the sick and the terminally ill who, in good faith, go to bogus practitioners who make false claims... Stephen was a hostage to the treatment that the so-called clinic advocated, so depriving him of any sense of normality in the last weeks of his life.\" Gill will be sentenced in January. Clearly, the promises of complementary and alternative medicines (Cams) can be immensely seductive. About one in five of us use them regularly and millions swear that some therapies cure anything from stress to cancer. But when good sense is replaced by blind faith and a mistrust in conventional medicine, the use of Cams can backfire. Last year in Melbourne, Australia, Isabella Denley, an epileptic toddler, died after her parents ditched the anti-convulsant medication she had been prescribed by her neurologist. The drugs had terrible side effects, including sleep loss and hyperactivity, so they turned to alternative therapies, visiting a vibrational kinesiologist, a cranial osteopath and a psychic who told them Isabella was suffering from a past-life trauma. An inquest heard that when she died, the toddler was exclusively on homeopathic medication. Her parents believed they were doing their utmost. But clearly the potential pitfalls of Cams go beyond ruthless charlatans. Indeed, the real peril may be our faith that alternative therapies will inevitably reach - and cure - the parts that allopathic medicines will not. \"There is certainly evidence to show that some therapies are effective for certain conditions,\" says a spokesperson for the Research Council for Complementary Medicine (RCCM). But finding out which ones work for which conditions can be confusing. Often several studies of the same therapy will contradict each other, and since funding for research is hard to come by many studies are considered flawed. The RCCM has a database with about 85,000 citations of clinical trials and research outcomes and has just received government funding to assess the quality and outcome of twelve therapies in the four NHS priority areas - cancer, coronary heart disease, mental health and chronic conditions. But so far, few Cams have been clinically proven to work. Indeed, hardly a week goes by when a study doesn't appear to disprove some Cam or other. Last week, one in the British Medical Journal showed that evening primrose oil - until recently available on the NHS to treat eczema - doesn't help the condition after all. A couple of weeks ago, the University of Washington in Seattle published findings that echinacea is no better than a placebo when it comes to treating colds in children. Naturally, such scientific scepticism does not stop millions of us from using Cams. A recent report by Virgin money found that \"spiritual spending\" has soared in Britain to \u00a3670m a year (on yoga, acupuncture, massage and other such therapies). And, according to the Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated [Health](https://www.theguardian.com/society/health) (FIH), about 20% of British people use one of eight alternative therapies (acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, medical herbalism, osteopathy and reflexology) between 2.8 to 5.3 times a year. Many people use alternative remedies successfully for minor ailments and overall wellness. Others however turn to Cams in desperation after a devastating diagnosis, believing they have nothing to lose. Around 75% of breast cancer patients are estimated to have tried alternative therapies and many cancer specialists believe Cams do have an important role in pain management. Sarah Parkinson, wife of comedian Paul Merton, who died this year of breast cancer, turned in her last months to alternative therapies instead of chemotherapy, having decided that, for her, quality of life was paramount. But other cancer patients switch to alternative remedies believing they will be saved. Doctors warn of the dangers of \"pseudo-scientific\" cancer remedies, such as shark's cartiledge and mistletoe, which are put forward as miracle cancer cures. These, they say, are causing some patients who may benefit from conventional medicine to ditch it entirely, sometimes with dire consequences. One study this year in the European Journal of Cancer found that the death rate for cancer patients who were also users of alternative medicine was greater than for non-users. While no conclusions were reached about why this was, some doctors believe it is a misplaced faith that may lead us to eschew conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy, that could save our lives. So, do we put too much faith in alternative therapies? Many of us, when we get some new symptom, now turn to a trusted alternative therapist without first seeing our GP. Of course, most reputable therapists will immediately refer you to a doctor if your symptoms seem worrying. But what if they don't? Misdiagnosis - or failure entirely to diagnose a serious condition - can have devastating consequences. James Turner, an 11-year-old Canadian boy, was taken to a chiropractor by his parents when he developed chest pains while swimming in July 2000. The chiropractor twice adjusted his neck and back without taking x-rays. Soon after, James was rushed to a children's hospital, having lost control of his legs and bowels. He was given an MRI and neurosurgery for a benign tumour (a ganglioglioma) on his spinal cord. This type of tumour is non-cancerous and slow-growing - with proper detection and medical treatment about 75% of afflicted children escape paralysis if the spinal cord is undamaged at the time of diagnosis. James's tumour, however, had been damaged (the parents, who are suing the chiropractor, say this was caused by the chiropractor's manipulation). James is now a paraplegic. Nobody is saying that chiropractic per se is dangerous (indeed, many studies show it can be very beneficial for certain conditions). Chiropractors, and therapists from other established disciplines such as osteopathy or homeopathy state openly that they are not (necessarily) trained physicians. But still we assume they will spot any danger signs. Dr Stephen Zeitzew, chief of orthopaedic surgery at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Healthcare Centre, speaks for many doctors when he says this is a tall order: \"Often diagnosis and treatment is challenging even to physicians with particular expertise. It is clearly true that on occasion the lack of diagnosis [by Cam practitioners] puts our patients in danger\". Such concerns echo a seminal House of Lords report in 2000 which warned: \"One of the main dangers of Cam is that patients could miss out on conventional medical diagnosis and treatment because they choose only to consult a Cam practitioner\". Zeitzew also points out that if your chosen practitioner is less than above board, the risks accelerate. One alternative \"helpline\" was recently singled out by Which? magazine for giving misleading advice on prostate problems after a doctor phoned, posing as a concerned member of the public and describing symptoms of prostate cancer. The doctor was offered an expensive herbal supplement and told that his symptoms were not necessarily anything to worry about. Of the eight most popular therapies in Britain, only two (chiropractic and osteopathy) are regulated by law in the same way dentists, doctors and nurses are. Acupuncture and herbal practitioners could be about to follow suit. \"Things are changing,\" says Simon Mills, research coordinator of the University of Exeter's complementary health program. \"Practitioners are recognising their responsibility to the public, to patients, and to themselves.\" But most currently rely on self-regulation by organisational bodies to ensure high standards, safety and accountability. \"Choose an alternative therapist who belongs to a reputable professional body,\" advises Mills. If you go to a herbalist it is particularly important that the herbs come from reputable sources (The National Institute of Medical Herbalists or the Register of Traditional Chinese Medicine provide fully trained practitioners). Michael MacIntyre, chairman of the European Herbal Practitioners Association ( [www.euroherb.com](http://www.euroherb.com)) says: \"You should always ask whether they belong to a credible organisation with a code of practice and disciplinary procedure, and whether they have insurance.\" The Foundation for Integrated Health is also about to publish guidelines on how to choose a practitioner, and anyone considering alternative therapy would be wise to consult them. The bottom line is clear: the vast majority of alternative therapists are well trained and reputable. Cams themselves are rarely dangerous. But the way we use them just might be. So do they work? Herbal medicine Use of plant extracts to treat wide variety of disorders and maintain good health - physically and mentally. About 30% of the population spends about \u00a331m a year on herbal remedies. Does it work? Professor Edzard Ernst, Britain's only professor of complementary medicine, wrote in the British Medical Journal this October: \"The evidence on herbal medicines is incomplete, complex, and confusing\". A recent overview of herbal medicine included 23 systematic reviews of rigorous trials of herbal medicines. Eleven came to a positive conclusion, nine yielded promising but not convincing results, and three were negative. Dangers: Between 1968 and 1997, the World Health Organization's monitoring centre collected 8,985 reports of adverse incidents associated with herbal medicines from 55 countries. Ernst points out that this number amounts to only a tiny fraction of adverse events associated with conventional drugs held in the same database. Risks: Unreliable sources, adulteration of Chinese herbal treatments with synthetic drugs, misbranding, lack of standardisation, possible side effects (one study found that some herbs, such as St John's wort, gingko biloba and echinacea in high doses could reduce fertility). Also a possible danger of reactions with prescription drugs. Some banned herbs: Aristolochi: for \"nephrotoxicity\" (kidney damage). Kava: for causing \"heptatoxicity\" (liver damage). Ephedra: banned in the US by the International Olympic Committee, the National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, minor league baseball, and the US armed forces following some deaths from over use. Chiropractic Treats musculo-skeletal complaints by adjusting muscles, tendons and joints using manipulation and massage techniques. (as does osteopathy, said to have similar benefits to chiropractic.) Does it work? The 2000 House of Lords report states that there is \"good evidence of the efficacy of osteopathy and chiropractic. Indeed, they appear to be somewhat more effective than the manipulative techniques employed by conventional physiotherapists\" Dangers: Misdiagnosis or failure to diagnose specific conditions. See a GP for a diagnosis and/or referral. Homeopathy Treats a wide range of physical and mental complaints using minute dilutions of animal, vegetable and mineral substances that in higher doses could be harmful. This is said to stimulate the body to heal itself. According to the WHO, homeopathy is the second most commonly used form of health care in the world after herbal medicine. Does it work? Huge, ongoing scientific debate. Homeopathic solutions are diluted so many times that many scientists argue they are unlikely to contain any of the original ingredients at all. But in 2001 a study found that dissolved molecules do not simply spread out in a regular fashion in the solution but tend to clump together in bigger clusters of molecules - and then as even bigger lumps composed of these clusters. This could explain how a heavily diluted homeopathic remedy might contain more of the \"active\" ingredient than expected. Individual remedies produce varied scientific results: one hay-fever trial found a noticeable improvement in patients taking a homeopathic remedy over those in the control group. Another recent trial found that arnica does nothing to reduce pain or accelerate healing after surgery. Dangers: Misdiagnosis/failure to diagnose serious conditions. Acupuncture The House of Lords report said: \"There is also scientific evidence of the efficacy of acupuncture, notably for pain relief and the treatment "}
