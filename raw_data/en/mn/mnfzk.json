Personal Statement: Please highlight in ~1 -3 pages those accomplishments that best define your contributions to the academic mission of Geisel . Include your educational, clinical and research activities, as well as your goals. Use this space to describe activities that may benefit from a more substantive description than the entries listed in your CV. My ove rriding academic interest is in evidence- based decision- making and decision- based evidence- making. My interest in evidence- based decision- making is at both diagnostic, therapeutic, and policy level decisions and spans both my research, teaching and clinica l care roles. My interest in decision- based evidence making carries the clinical perspective into my clinical research in an effort to design and carry out pragmatic trials and other research studies that directly affect clinical care decisions and in teaching the skills necessary to translate study results into informed clinical decisions for both trainees and patients. My time is currently split 55% research and graduate teaching at TDI/Geisel and 45% clinical and administrative at DHMC. My specific accomplishments, interests, and goals are as follows: Research: 1) I have a longstanding interest in improving care and medical decision making for patients with lumbar spine disorders including low back pain, herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerativ e spondylolisthesis. As a co- investigator on the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) since its inception, I have helped to design, execute, and interpret a large multi -center pragmatic trial evaluating the comparative effectiveness of surgery com pared to usual non- operative care in randomized and concurrent observational cohorts at 13 centers across the country with Dartmouth serving as the coordinating center. Notable achievements of SPORT include: 1) enrollment of 2,505 patients in randomized and observational cohorts for IDH, DS, and SpS; 2) development of successful trial management systems and advanced informatics support; 3) retention in active follow -up of 75% of living members of the original cohorts; 4) creation of dissemination tools for the public to support preference- sensitive treatment decisions (e.g., shared decision- making videos and web- based tools); and 5) more than 54 per - reviewed publications in prominent medical journals, with extensive coverage and discussion in the lay press Name: Jon D. Lurie MD, MS 56 2) In addition to understanding the comparative effectiveness of different treatments for lumbar spinal disorders, I have pursued a specific interest in the appropriate use and interpretation of advanced imaging, particular ly MRI, in spinal disorders. Thi s work has included detailed reliability studies for the interpretation of various features on MRI, which I directed along with an interdisciplinary collaborative group including neuro- radiologists, musculoskeletal radiologists, and spine surgeons. The re liable findings were then evaluated in predictive models to identify features on MRI that best predicted response to different treatments. 3) Another area that I have actively pursued in my scientific career is shared decision- making and the understanding and measurement of patient expectations and how they affect treatment outcomes. We have looked at specific measure of expectancy, evaluated factors that predicted those expectancies, and then how those expectancies may have affected the patient self -reported outcomes with treatment. I have incorporated these findings into efforts to improve the delivery of information to patients facing a decision, such as whether or not to have spine surgery, in order to achieve informed decisions that are congruent wi th patients' values. 4) Along with the efforts described above to answer important patient level questions, I have had an interest in informed decision- making at the policy level and pursued several research projects aimed at understanding variations in c are for musculoskeletal problems. These have involved Medicare claims and other large database analyses looking at differences in the approaches to and outcomes of treatment of a variety of musculoskeletal disorders including back pain, joint replacements , and fracture care. 5) Recently, I have expanded my areas of direct interest beyond spinal disorders in particular into other common disorders that impact patient functioning. This includes fall prevention interventions and rehabilitation technology dev elopment in general in order to help identify and evaluate important new approaches to maintaining and improving physical functioning. Teaching: My major teaching focus goes hand in hand with my research interests with an emphasis on Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), outcomes research, critical appraisal and interpretation of the literature, and clinical study design and implementation. I teach EBM at both the Medical School and residency level ; have taught clinical trial design and implementation at an AAOS course on clinical trials , a TDI mini -course on Clinical Trials, and continue to teach an Introduction to Clinical Research for the CTO, an introduction to T2 translational research in the SYNERGY certificate program, co- lead the TDI Masters Research Capst one Course where students get intensive small group instruction and feedback through 3 terms on designing a research project of their choice, and am developing a course on Randomized Clinical Trials for the new SYNERGY Masters program in Clinical and Trans lational Research. I also serve as an Advisor /Mentor for many medical students , residents , and junior faculty interested clinical and outcomes research. Clinical: Name: Jon D. Lurie MD, MS 57 Clinically, I maintain an active practice in Hospital Medicine and recently became the Section Chief of Hospital Medicine. Increasing Research and Administrative demands forced me to give up my specialty practice within the Spine Center, seeing referral patients with primar ily low back and neck disorders but I continue to serve as a resource for providers with questions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with low back problems. Goals: My goals are to continue to pursue my passions in all three areas of academic medicine, with an increased focus on mentoring young faculty members and helping them develop careers to help advance the practice of medicine by having good evidence to guide decision in problems important to patients and physicians well -trained in interpreting and applying that evidence, along with the elicitation and cl arification of each patients' values, in order to achieve high quality shared decisions.
