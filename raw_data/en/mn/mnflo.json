Just over half of the dog owners surveyed, 53%, questioned the safety, efficacy and/or need to vaccinate to your beloved four-legged family members. In the study, recently published in the journal vaccinate, a nationally representative group of 2,200 US adults participated, of whom 42% (924) comprised the subgroup of dog owners analyzed. Overall, the results add to concerns that anti-vaccine stances that erupted amid the pandemic have spread widely, casting doubt on even routine childhood vaccinations. Vaccines and canine autism, what is the relationship? This point is borne out by the new study, which found that owners of dogs who were \"canine vaccine hesitant,\" or CVH (for its acronym in English canine vaccine hesitancy), were more likely to accept misinformation and falsehoods related to human vaccines. And those anti-vaccine beliefs were powerful. Responses from CVH dog owners suggested that 56% were opposed to mandatory vaccination against rabies, a 100% fatal disease. In a particularly surprising finding, the study found that 37% of all dog owners believed that vaccinations would cause their pets to develop cognitive problems, such as \"canine/feline autism.\" Just to be clear, vaccines do not cause autism. This falsehood has been debunked exhaustively and repeatedly over the years; the vast amount of information on vaccine safety indicates absolutely no relationship between vaccination and autism. Also, \"canine autism,\" which is also known online as \"canine dysfunctional behavior,\" is not a real disease. A veterinarian not involved in the new study confirmed to Ars Technica which is not an established diagnosis, although dogs can suffer from behavioral and cognitive disorders unrelated to human autism.- However, anti-vaccine ideology has caused obvious metastasis in our furry companions. The study's lead author, Matthew Motta, told ars by e-mail that he and his co-authors expected some vaccine reluctance among pet owners, but still found the results \"quite surprising.\"- Motta, a professor of Health Law, Policy and Management at Boston University School of Public Health, conducted the study with his sister, Gabriella Motta, a veterinarian at Glenolden Animal Hospital, Pennsylvania, and Dominik Stecula, a political scientist at Colorado State University. The team set out to \"put numbers on the anecdotal stories we had become familiar with over the years,\" Motta told ars. But the results astonished them in two ways: first, \"discovering the frequent what is the reluctance about the canine vaccine\"; and second, \"to observe how powerful the [actitud] CVH to explain why some people prefer not to vaccinate their pets and maintain positions that harm the universal application of the rabies vaccine. Furthermore, Motta was impressed by the responses related to the \"canine autism\", which as he also pointed out, was not a valid diagnosis. \"On one hand, perhaps this shouldn't be so surprising: These numbers are pretty much in line with our previous research, as well as other public opinion polls, comparing the number of Americans who believe the same thing about the measles, mumps, and mumps vaccine. rubella,\" he says. \"Still, to see so many dog owners mistakenly transfer concern over a human diagnosis to their pets was, in my opinion, "}
