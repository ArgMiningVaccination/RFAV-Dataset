Why do you suffer from painful blisters when your running buddy can go for miles without a pinch? Some people are simply prone to them, says Dr. Lee Cohen, a New Jersey sports medicine podiatrist, and it most often comes down to the shape of your feet. But even if your tootsies are naturally blister-prone, you can still take steps to make them blister-proof. For starters, ensure your shoes fit well and be sure to mix up your training gradually\u2014don't go from running on a completely flat [treadmill](https://www.womensrunning.com/gear/app-pretend-treadmill/ ) to tackling hills outside. Cohen notes that it's important to hydrate your feet inside and out. Drink plenty of H2O and moisturize regularly with a foot cream. When you do head out for a run, take these three simple steps to avoid painful sores that slow you down when you'd prefer to be hitting your stride. Tip #1 Cohen says you need to decide: \"Am I a sweater or not?\" If you tend to perspire, use a powder (Gold Bond Medicated Foot Powder, $10 for 10 oz., [drugstore.com)](http://www.drugstore.com/gold-bond-triple-action-medicated-foot-powder/qxp72031). If your dogs stay dry, swipe a stick on trigger zones (Dr. Scholl's Blister Defense Stick, $7, [drugstore.com](http://www.drugstore.com/dr-scholls-blister-defense-anti-friction-stick/qxp271825?catid=184117)). Tip #2 Some products you use to help blisters heal can help prevent them before they occur. If you have a hot spot that often gets tender, add a layer of protection. A liquid or spray provides a coating (New-Skin Liquid Bandage, $7, [walgreens.com](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/new-skin-liquid-bandage/ID=prod351961-product)) and a fabric bandage creates a plastic shield (Band-Aid Advanced Healing Blister for Fingers & Toes, $4, [drugstore.com](http://www.drugstore.com/band-aid-advanced-healing-blister-for-fingers-and-toes-cushions/qxp92511?catid=184117)). Tip #3 \"Friction and sheer forces cause blisters,\" explains Cohen. He recommends seamless, fitted synthetic [socks](https://www.womensrunning.com/gear/why-your-running-socks-are-just-as-important-as-your-shoes/ ) (SockGuy Channel Air, $12, [sockguy.com](http://www.sockguy.com/ProductInfo/CHVINE.aspx)) and forget the theory of doubling up\u2014one pair should do the trick. Ouch, I got a blister! Dr. Cohen says do as little as possible: \"You don't want the roof to come off!\" If you need to pop it, sterilize a needle with alcohol first, and leave as much of the skin intact as you can, so it will heal more quickly. Then use a liquid bandage (warning: it will burn!) and "}
