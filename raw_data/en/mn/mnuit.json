Local Planning Authorities are responsible for making sure that planning requirements are met. Land contamination is a \"m aterial planning consideration\". This means a planning authori ty must consider contamination when preparing development plans or c onsidering individual planning applications . The Local Authority's role Local planning authorities are responsible for ensuring land contamination is dealt with through the planning system and remediation (clean up) takes place where required. In carrying out their duties local planning authorities will consult a range of other statutory bodies on various aspects of planning applications. The Environment Agency's Role If we're consulted we will only comment on the aspects of a planning application where we have a regulatory responsibility. This means our advice is limited to the require ments of the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 for the accumulation and disposal of radioactive waste resulting from remediation (clean up) or development work on the land. We will not advise local authorities or developers on the characterisation, radiological assessment or remediation of land contaminated with radioactivity. Advice on these aspects is available from other sources [see below]. Guidance on Standards The main difference between planning and the extension of Part 2A is the latte r deals with the risks from a site in its current use, whereas the planning system considers the proposed use. This means different standards of remediation are required under the different regimes. The Health Protection Agency's Radiation Pr otection Div ision has advised 1 that changing the use of land contaminated with radioactivity may increase the exposure of users of the proposed development. This is likely to be regarded as a \"practice\" situation in radiation protection terms [see Briefing Note 8]. This means the developer's proposal needs to consider the available remedial options and ensure exposures to future occupants of the land (including the exposure of people undertaking the remedial and development work) will be as low as reasonably achievable. The proposal needs to take into account economic and social 1 NRPB, 1998, Radiological Protection Objectives for Land Contaminated with Radionuclides, Documents of the NRPB 1998, Volume 09, No. 2, ISBN 0- 85951- 416-1 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED 2 of 2 factors; and also show the excess risk to the most exposed individual(s) does not exceed the risk constraint of 1x10- 5 per year (i.e. equivalent to an annual effective dose of about 0.3 mSv). The developer is responsible for carrying out the necessary remediation to an agreed acceptable standard. Anyone accumulating or disposing of radioactive waste as part of a remediation or clean up project needs a permit under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010, unless the waste is exempt . We are responsible for regulating accumulations and disposals of radioactive waste and will advise local planning authorities and developers on the Act's implications for proposed works.
