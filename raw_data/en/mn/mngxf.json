Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (the vaccine) to produce immunity to a disease. Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate the effects of infection by a pathogen. Vaccination is considered to be the most essential and cost-effective method of preventing infectious diseases. Where the vaccination is needed? Morbidity and mortality attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases are declined. High rates of vaccination, low incidence of vaccine preventable disease and adverse events after immunization has been the matter of concern. Safety of Vaccines An extensive review of vaccine safety by Institute of medicine(IOM) found that knowledge & research capacity has been limited due to: Inadequate understanding of biologic mechanisms underlying adverse event Insufficient information from case reports and case series Inadequate size and length of follow-up many population based epidemiologic studies Limitations of existing surveillance systems to provide persuasive evidence of causation The IOM concluded if research capacity and accomplishments are not improved, future reviews of vaccine safety will be handicapped Clinical Problems in Pharmacoepidemiological Research Policy Issues Physico-chemical properties Lower risk tolerance of vaccines e.g. the event that occur at ~ 1/1000000-1/10000000 doses, such as acute encephalopathy after whole cell pertussis vaccine, GBS (Group-B Streptococcal) after swine influenza vaccine . Exposure of vaccines to large number of people by public health authorities - Mandatory vaccination Herd immunity. Exposure to vaccine universally \"first do no harm\", it applies more in public health than in clinical medicine Eg: Cutter incident - the administration of inactivated polio vaccine to about 4 lakh persons resulted in 260 polio cases. Error in production Eg:polio vaccine contaminated by simian virus 40 Exposure of high levels of ethyl mercury from thimerosal preservative in vaccine - highlights the importance of safety concerns the basis of strict regulatory control by FDA & WHO. Vaccine safety studies have narrow margins for error-high standards of accuracy & timeliness are needed Vaccines generally have few alternative strains or types-decision to withdraw a vaccine or switch between strains depends on risk benefit perspective Eg:the decision of license withdrawal of Mumps vaccines containing the Urabe strain due to the risk of vaccine associated Meningitis without an alternative in UK. Certain countries have compensation programme for persons injured by vaccination Eg: In US vaccine injury table contains vaccine which contains data necessary for the assessment of adverse events caused by specific vaccines Periodic revision of vaccine injury table leads to the manufacturers the importance of improving the quality of vaccines Recommendations for the use of vaccines depends on the balance of risk & benefits Research in vaccines safety help to distinguish true vaccine reactions from coincidental events It helps to maintain public confidence in immunization Clinical Issues Evaluation of safety & efficacy in laboratory for vaccines is equally important as other pharmaceutical products before licensure. Phase 1 trial Require subjects in tens Detect extremely common adverse events Phase 2 trial Enroll hundreds of subjects Helps in concluding The relationships between concentration of antigen No of vaccine components Phase 3 trial Sample size - larger. Based on efficacy considerations. Inferences on safety depends on sample sizes & duration of observation. Formulation techniques Effect of successive doses Profiles of common reactions Management, prevention or treatment of vaccine adverse event- rudimentary stage. Subspecialties with adequate referral base & research funds are needed Methodological Problems 1. Signal Detection Surveillance systems help in detecting the adverse events of vaccines in timely manner. Vaccine safety Surveillance system should examine multiple exposures and multiple disease outcome The sensitivity and specificity depends on the goal of surveillance. Sensitivity- detection of a previously unknown illness or syndrome Specificity- tracking a known disease 2) Standard Definitions and Evaluative Protocols - Case Definitions are used at the time of reporting or at the time of analysis to improve specificity. Application of definitions at the time of reporting: o Reduces the no of reports processed o Lowers the operating cost . o Sensitivity of surveillance -low. If the reporting form is open ended- o sensitivity of surveillance greater. o Cost will be higher. Advancement of scientific knowledge will be hindered in immunization safety due to lack of standard case definitions 3) Assessment of causality Assessment of vaccine associated adverse events is not possible unless ... o A vaccine specific clinical syndrome is observed o Recurrence upon rechallenge o Vaccine specific laboratory finding Epidemiologic studies are necessary to assess whether vaccinated persons are at higher risk than unvaccinated persons if adverse event occur in absence of vaccination. 4) EXPOSURE Documentation of exposure status is important to prevent misclassification Poor documentation due to o Substantial mobility between health care providers o Substantial difficulty may be encountered in ascertaining vaccination status- In older persons Immunization card recorder 5) OUTCOME Assessing the rare events due to vaccination is major challenge According to Institute of Medicine committee a study may be technically feasible but logistically infeasible The other difficulty in assessing the rare events in populations less frequently exposed is inadequate study power. 6) Analysis, Confounding and Bias Childhood vaccines are administered on schedule, here age is the confounding factor. Factors which are difficult to control leads to delayed vaccination or non vaccination. eg: low socio economic status. Currently Available Solutions Pre-licensure Separate, large scale, long term, randomised experimental trials-needed to better assessment of serious vaccine risks. Broadening the assessment of pre and post licensure is necessary. Data & safety monitoring boards (DSMBs) represents another area of potential improvements in the pre-licensure process. Post Licensure 1. Spontaneous Reporting Systems(SRS): Informal or formal passive surveillance or SRS have been the corner stone of most vaccine safety monitoring system due to low cost of operations. Vaccine manufacturers also maintain SRS for their products, which are usually forwarded to appropriate national regulatory authorities. Administration of vaccines healthcare providers +surveillance system/regulatory agency develops vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). To increase sensitivity VAERS form is designed & computerized to permit narrative descriptions of adverse events . Reporting forms containing check-off boxes for specific events with accompanying case definitions have been developed in certain countries. A field guidelines for implementation of monitoring of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) has recently been developed by WHO. 2) Classifications & Case Definitions Vaccine adverse events can be classified into : Frequency (common, rare) Extend (local or systemic) Severity Causality Preventability Recent classification divides adverse events after vaccinations into: 1. Vaccine-induced 2. Vaccine-potentiated 3. Programmatic error 4. Coincidental Dutch system-classification of reports: 1.Simple-a single vaccine injection & a single major reaction 2.compound-a single vaccine injection & more than one major reaction 3.Multiple->1vaccine injection in the same person & 1 major reaction 4.Compound multiple->1 vaccine injection in the same person & >1 major reaction 3) Standardized Clinical Assessment Protocols & Centers: 4 Assessment of Causality: Depends on : 1. Strength of association 2. Analytic bias 3. Biologic gradient /dose response 4. Statistical significance 5. Consistency 6. Biologic plausibility/coherence 5) Signal Detection Identifying a potential new vaccine safety problem (signal) requires a mix of clinical intuition& epidemiologic expertise. VAERS is one of the largest registries for rare vaccine adverse events in the world. Eg; bell's palsy was detected in recipients of a new Swiss intranasal influenza vaccine. Due to its ease of implementation & interpretation, the proper reporting rate ratio (PRR) method is the most widely used disproportionality measures in VAERS for prospective and retrospective signal generation. 6) Mass Immunization Campaigns Whenever a very large number of vaccine doses are administered over a well defined short time interval, results in more prominent clusters of vaccine adverse events. Surveillance of vaccine adverse events around the time of mass immunization campaigns have been extremely useful in generating signals, either positive (eg : GBS after polio vaccine) or negative ( eg: GBS after meals) VAERS type of data has helps to identify potential risk factors for vaccine adverse events. 7) Clinical Trials A) Post-licensure clinical trials Optimization of vaccine use is done by clinical trials after licensure to assess the effect of changes in Vaccine formulation Vaccine strain Age at vaccination The number and timing of vaccine doses Simultaneous administration Interchangeability of vaccines from different manufacturers B) Phase 4 Surveillance Studies Improves the ability to detect adverse events that are not detected during pre-licensure trials C)Ad-Hoc Epidemiologic Studies Assess signals of potential adverse events generated by spontaneous reporting systems, the medical literature or other mechanisms Eg of ad-hoc follow up studies to signals of vaccine safety issues are SIDS after DTP vaccination. D) Automated Large-linked Databases Development of automated large link data bases may permit improved ability to monitor the safety of such post-licensure changes in vaccine without conducting such clinical trials Methodological Approaches 1. Exposures Vaccination records: helps to find out the exposure of vaccine in each individual. The data can be easily retrieved & reviewed for any study design. Automated vaccination records : Ease the logistics of organizing the studies. Assess the accuracy of automated data in each study When persons receive the vaccination from a variety of providers, their exposure status may be misclassified. This error could be minimized if a Centralized National Vaccination Registry were implemented to track all vaccination from birth. Vaccine Identification Standards Initiative (VISI) - organized by CDC to improve the accuracy and efficiency of transfer of vaccine identification information. 2. Outcomes To ensure both high sensitivity & specificity, a sequential approach is required. E.g. for a study of neurologic illness following DTP immunization- medical records of these patients reviewed to see if they met the case definition. For outcomes with insidious onset like multiple sclerosis sources of information need to be collected & analyzed. 3) Analysis The case cross over or case series approaches are gaining popularity in vaccine safety studies 4) Bias To minimize it is best to rely on data sources that gather information on outcomes and vaccines exposure independently.
