About HRSA Our programs provide equitable health care to people who are geographically isolated and economically or medically vulnerable. This includes programs that deliver health services to people with HIV, pregnant people, mothers and their families, those with low incomes, residents of rural areas, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and those otherwise unable to access high- quality health care. Our programs also support health infrastructure, including through training of health professionals and distributing them to areas where they are needed most, providing financial support to health care providers, and advancing telehealth. In addition, we oversee programs for providing discounts on prescription drugs to safety net providers, facilitating organ, bone marrow, and cord blood transplantation, compensating individuals injured by vaccination, and maintaining data on health care malpractice payments. In Fiscal Year 2021, we provided nearly $54 billion in funding to support our mission. For more information, visit the HRSA Agency Overview page and explore data and maps on our health care programs. 1.2.

Admini strative and National Policy Requirements Successful applicants are required to comply with 45 CFR p art 75 - Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for HHS Awards (UAR) . In addition to the numerous administrative and national policy requirements imposed by regulation and HHS policies, HRSA stresses the following requirements of every award: Standards for Financial Management Recipients are required to meet the standards and requirements for financial management systems set forth in 45 CFR part 75 . The financial systems must enable the recipient to maintain records that adequately identify the sources of funds for federally assisted activities and the purposes for which the award was used, including authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and any program income. The system must also enable the recipient to compare actual expenditures or outlays with the approved budget for the award. Internal controls must be in place to ensure that costs charged to HRSA award s are allowable, allocable to the HRSA award, reasonable, necessary , and documented. For example, controls must be in place to ensure that only actual time worked on HRSA projects are charged to HRSA award s, and that the time worked has management HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 3 approval from the HRSA award recipient. There also must be internal controls in place to ensure that costs charged to HRSA award s through subawards are monitored and evaluated by the HRSA award recipient and that only allowable, allocable, reasonable, necessary , and documented costs are charged to HRSA awards. HRSA funds must retain their award-specific identity \u2014they may not be commingled with state funds or other federal funds. [\"Commingling funds\" typically means depositing or recording funds in a general account without the ability to identify each specific source of funds for any expenditure.] Accessibility Provisions and Non-D iscrimination Requirements Should you successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS will be required to complete an HHS Assurance of Compliance form (HHS 690) i n which you agree, as a condition of receiving the grant, to administer your programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex and disability, and agreeing to comply with federal conscience laws, where applicable. This includes ensuring that entities take meaningful steps to provide meaningful access to persons with limited English proficiency; and ensuring effective communication with persons with disabilities. Where applicable, Title XI and Section 1557 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and gender identity. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. See https://www.hhs.gov/civil - rights/for- providers/provider -obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil -rights/for- individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html . For guidance on meeting your legal obligation to take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to your programs or activities by limited English proficient individuals, see https://www.hhs.gov/civil -rights/for- . For information on your specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities, including providing program access, reasonable modifications, and to provide effective communication, see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html . HHS funded health and education programs must be administered in an environment free of sexual harassment, see https://www.hhs.gov/civil - rights/for- individuals/sex -discrimin ation/index.html . For guidance on administering your project in compliance with applicable federal religious nondiscrimination laws and applicable federal conscience protection and associated anti-discrimination laws, see https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/conscience- protections/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/religious - freedom/index.html . HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 4 Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws or call 1- 800-368-1019 or TDD 1- 800- 537-7697. The HRSA Office of Civil Rights, Diversity, and Inclusion (OCRDI) offers technical assistance, individual consultations, trainings, and plain language materials to supplement OCR guidance and assist HRSA recipients in meeting their civil rights obligations. Visit OCRDI's website to learn more about how federal civil rights laws and accessibility requirements apply to your programs, or contact OCRDI directly at HRSACivilRights@hrsa.gov . Acknowledgment of Federal Funding If the NOFO notes that the program is subject to the General Provisions of P.L. 117- 328, th e following statutory mandate applies: Division H, Title V, Section 505 \"When issuing statements, press releases, requests for proposals, bid solicitations and other documents describing projects or programs funded in whole or in part with f ederal money, all grantees receiving f ederal funds included in this Act, including but n ot limited to state and local governments and recipients of f ederal research grants, shall clearly state - (1) the percentage of the total costs of the program or project which will be financed with f ederal money; (2) the dollar amount of federal funds for the project or program; and (3) percentage and dollar amount of the total costs of the project or program that will be financed by non- governmental sources.\" In addition, HRSA requires recipients to use the following acknowledgment and disclaimer: \"This [project/publication/program/website] [is/was] supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of an award totaling $XX with xx percentage financed with non- governmental sources. The contents are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the official views of, nor an endorsement, by HRSA, HHS, or the U.S. Government.\" Recipients are required to use this language when issuing statements, press releases, requests for proposals, bid solicitations, and other HRSA -supported publications and forums describing projects or programs funded in whole or in part with HRSA funding. Examples of HRSA- supported publications include, but are not limited to, manuals, toolkits, resource guides, case studies and issues briefs. For more details, see HRSA's Communicat ing and Acknowledging Federal Funding webpage . Conflict of Interest HRSA has established a Federal Financial Assistance Conflict of Interest Policy (COI Policy) pur suant to 45 CFR \u00a7 75.112, which requires that awarding agencies establish HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 5 conflict of interest policies for federal awards that: 1) Address conditions under which outside activities, relationships, or financial interests are proper or improper; 2) Pro vide for advance notification of outside activities, relationships, or financial interests, and a process of review as appropriate; and 3) Outline how financial conflicts of interest may be addressed. This policy addresses such conditions; identifies when and how a non- federal entity (NFE) must provide written notification of such outside activities, relationships, or financial interests to HRSA or, in the case of grant subrecipients, to the pass -through entity, and describes a process of review of such disclosures; and discusses the means by which financial conflicts of interest may be addressed. This COI Policy, except as noted below, applies to all NFEs receiving HRSA financial assistance, either directly (from HRSA) or indirectly (i.e., through a subaward from a pass -through entity). Note: For the purposes of this COI Policy, institutions of higher education that are instrumentalities of a state under applicable state laws are subject to the requirements applicable to such entities. Healthy People 2030 Led by HHS, Healthy People 2030 is the nation's 10- year plan for addressing our most critical public health priorities and challenges. Since 1980, HHS's Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion has set measurable objectives and targets to improve the health and well -being of the nation. This decade, Healthy People 2030 features 355 core - or measurable - objectives with 10 -year targets, new objectives related to opioid use disorder and youth e- cigarette use, and resources for adapting Healthy People 2030 to emerging public health threats like COVID -19. For the first time, Healthy People 2030 also sets 10- year targets for objectives related to social determinants of health. More information about Healthy People 2030 may be found online at https://health.gov/healthypeople . Mandatory Disclosures The non- federal entity or applicant for a federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the HHS awarding agency or pass -through entity all violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the federal award ( 45 CFR \u00a7 75.113 ). Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of the remedies described in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.371 , including suspension or debarment. (See also 2 CFR parts 180 and 376, and 31 U.S.C. 3354). Submission is required for all applicants and recipients, in writing, to the awarding agency and to the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) all information related to violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the federal award. Disclosures must be sent in writing to: HRSA ( The Awarding Agency ) AND HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 6 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General ATTN: Mandatory Grant Disclosures, Intake Coordinator 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Cohen Building Room 5527 Washington, DC 20201 URL: https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/report -fraud/index.asp 205- 0604 or Email: grantdisclosures@oig.hhs.gov Prohi bition on Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment (a) As described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.216, recipients and subrecipients are prohibited to obligate or spend grant funds (to include direct and indirect expenditures as well as cost share and program) to: (1) Procure or obtain, (2) Extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain; or (3) Enter into contract (or extend or renew contract) to procure or obtain equipment, services, or systems that use covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system.

HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 7 Smoke- Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all award recipients to provide a smoke- free workplace and to promote the non- use of all tobacco products. Further, P ublic Law (P.L.) 103-227, the Pro- Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children. Trafficking in Persons Awards issued under HRSA NOFO s are subject to the requirements of Section 106(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended (22 U.S.C. 7104). For the full text of the award term, go to Trafficking Victims Protections . NOTE: The signature of the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) on the application serves as the required certification of compliance for your organization regarding the administrative and national policy requirements. 2.2. Compliance Requirements at a Glance For reference, the chart below provides compliance requirements by recipi ent and requirement type. Recipient Type Administrative Requirements Cost Principles Audit Requirements State, Local & Tribal Governments 45 CFR part 75 45 CFR part 75; subpart E 45 CFR part 75; subpart F Colleges & Universities 45 CFR part 75 45 CFR part 75; subpart part subpart 45 CFR part 75; subpart F Hospitals 45 CFR part 75 45 CFR part 75, Appendix IX 45 CFR part 75; For-Profits 45 CFR part 75 (FAR 45 CFR part 75; subpart F HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 8 Recipient Type Administrative Requirements Cost Principles Audit Requirements Foreign 45 CFR part 75 As stated above for each recipient type 45 CFR part 75 except where the HHS awarding agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the statutes or regulations of a foreign government. 2.3.

REGISTERING AND APPLYING THROUGH GRANTS.GOV USING WORKSPACE Grants.gov Application Submission and Receipt Procedures This section provides the application submission and receipt instructions for HRSA program applications. Read the following instructions carefully and completely. 3.1. Electronic Delivery HRSA is participating in the Grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single site to find and apply for funding opportunities. HRSA requires you to submit your applications online. NOTE: HRSA highly recommends that you complete the Grants.gov registration process at least 4 WEEKS before your organization's first Grants.gov submission. 3.2. How to Register to Apply through Grants.gov a. Instructions: Read the instructions below about registering to apply for HRSA funds. You should read the registration instructions carefully and prepare the information requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing and assembling the required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last -minute searches for required information. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 11 The registration process can take up to 4 weeks to complete. Therefore, registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact your ability to meet required application submission deadlines. If individual applicants are eligible to apply for this funding opportunity, refer to: Grants.gov Individual Regi stration . Organization applicants can find complete instructions here: Grants.gov Registering an Organization 1) Register with SAM : The Unique Entity Identifier ( UEI) assigned by the System for Award Management ( SAM ), has replaced the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. R egister in SAM and you will be assigned a UEI. It takes 1 day (after you enter the EBiz POC name and EBiz POC email in SAM) to receive a UEI, which will allow you to register with Grants.gov and apply for federal funding. All organizations must register with SAM in order to apply online. Failure to register with SAM will prevent your organization from applying through Grants.gov. Effective March 3, 2023, individuals assigned a SAM.gov Entity Administrator r ole must be an employee, officer, or board member, and cannot be a non- employee. This change is to ensure entities are in control of who has permission to control roles within their entity. Here's what this means: Entity Administrators assigning roles to non- employees will only be able to assign a Data Entry role or lower. Any entities assigning Entity Administrator roles using an Entity Administrator Role Request Letter (formerly called \"notarized letter\") will no longer be able to assign the Entity Administrator role to a non-employee. Entity Administrator roles assigned to non- employees will be converted to Data Entry roles. With a Data Entry role, non- employees can still create and manage entity registration data entry but cannot manage roles. If you are an entity using a non- employee or if you are a non- employee working with an entity to manage registrations, please read (and share) more about this change on the BUY.GSA.gov blog to know what to expect. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 12 Make sure you \"opt -in\" for public display of your record within SAM so HRSA can easily access and review your information. If you see the question \"Is my information available for viewing by the public?\" please answer \"Yes.\" For more detailed instructions for registering with SAM, refer to: Grants.gov: Applicant Registration . 2) Create a Grants.gov Account: The next step in the registration process is to create an account with Grants.gov. You must know your organization's UEI number to complete this process. Enter the UEI (SAM) in the data entry field labeled \"UEI\" on the Grants.gov SF- 424 form. Completing this process automatically triggers an email request for applicant roles to the organization's E -Business Point of Contact (EBiz POC) for review. The EBiz POC is a representative from your organization who is the contact listed for SAM. To apply for awards on behalf of your organization, you will need the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) role. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: Grants.gov: Add Profile. 3) Authorize Grants.gov Roles: After creating an account on Grants.gov, the EBiz POC receives an email notifying them of your registration and request for roles. The EBiz POC will then log in to Grants.gov and authorize the appropriate roles, which may include the AOR role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit your application online any time after you have been approved as an AOR. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: Grants.gov: Authenticate AOR 4) Track Role Status: To track your role request, refer to: Grants.gov: Track My Application b. Electronic Signature: When submitting applications through Grants.gov, insert the name of your organization's AOR who submits the application i nto the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize individuals who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as an AO R. Applicants often miss this step and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 13 3.2.1. Find Funding Opportunity There are three ways to search for HRSA funding opportunities on Grants.gov. 1. Enter keyword or phrase in the Search box at the top of the home page at Grants.gov . 2. Click on one of the following tabs in the middle of the home page to: Browse Newest, Browse Categories, Browse Agencies, or Browse E ligibilities. 3. Click the SEARCH GRANTS tab, enter the funding opportunity number and/or assistance listings number , and then select the funding opportunity for which you wish to apply. Refer to the NOFO for eligibility criteria. Otherwise, use the various filters to help narrow your search. Search for the funding opportunity under the APPLICANTS tab under How to Apply for Grants . E nter the NOFO number provided in the Opportunity Number . : HRSA- 22-000.) 3.2.2. Subscribing to a NOFO HRSA strongly recommends subscribing to NOFO s you are interested in by using the Subsc ribe button located next to the Apply button on the Grant Opportunity page. By subscribing and providing your email address before reviewing or preparing the workspace application package, you will receive notifications including modifications , related documents and/or republications of the NOFO on Grants.gov before its closing date. 3.3. How to Submit an Application to HRSA via Grants.gov Grants.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For each NOFO, you can create individual instances of a workspace. Below is an overview of applying on Grants.gov. For access to complete instructions on how to apply for opportunities, refer to: Grants.gov: How to Apply for Grants 1) Create a Workspace: Creating a workspace allows you to complete your application online and route it through your organization for review before submitting. 2) Complete a Workspace: Add participants to the workspace, complete all the required forms, and check for errors before submission. a. Adobe Reader : If you decide not to apply by filling out webforms you can download individual PDF forms in Workspace so that they will appear similar to other Standard or HRSA forms. You can download and save the individual PDF forms to your local device storage, network drive(s), or external drives, and then access through Adobe Reader. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 14 NOTE: Visit the Adobe Software Compatibility page on Grants.gov to download the appropriate version of the software. b. Mandatory Fields in Forms: In the forms, you will note fields marked with an asterisk and a different background color. You must complete t hese mandatory fields to successfully submit your application. c. Complete SF- 424 Fields First: The forms are designed to fill in common required fields across other forms, such as the applicant name, address, and UEI number . To trigger this feature, an applicant must complete the SF-424 information first. Once it is completed, the information will transfer to the other forms. 3) Submit a Workspace: You may submit an application through workspace by clicking the Sign and Submit button on the Manage Workspace page, under the Forms tab. Note: Your application will not be submitted until you complete this step. Grants.gov recommends submitting your application package at least 24- 48 hours (1-2 calendar days) before the close date to provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues that may disrupt the application submission. However, HRSA suggests submitting applications to Grants.gov at least 3 calendar days before the deadline to allow for any unforeseen circumstances. 4) Track a Workspace: After successfully submitting a workspace package, a Grants.gov Tracking Number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) is automatically assigned to the package. The number will be listed on the Confirmation page that is generated after submission. For additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to Grants.gov: Applicant Training. Applicant Support : Grants.gov provides applicants 24/7 support via the toll -free number 1-800-518-4726 (International callers dial 1- 606-545-5035) and email at support@grants.gov . For questions related to the specific funding opportunity, contact the number listed in the application package of the award you are applying for. If you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. The Support Center ticket number will assist HRSA with tracking and understanding the issue. 3.4. Timely Receipt Requirements and Proof of Timely Submission Online Submission. All applications must be received by 11:59 p.m. ET on the date listed in Section IV.4. Submission Dates and Times in the NOFO, unless otherwise noted. Grants.gov automatically records proof of timely submission. An electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system and sent to the AOR when Grants.gov successfully receives the application. The applicant AOR will receive an acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) from HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 15 Grants.gov with the successful transmission of their application serving as proof of their timely submission. When HRSA successfully retrieves the application from Grants.gov and acknowledges the download of submissions, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the applicant with the AOR role. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov receives your application. Applications received by Grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be considered late and HRSA will not consider the application for funding. HRSA strongly suggests that you apply at least 3 calendar days before the deadline to allow for any unforeseen circumstances. HRSA is under no obligation to accept applications that are late due to problems with computer systems at your organization or system -to-system grant submission service, failure to submit by the deadline, or failure to follow instructions in the Application Guide or instructions in the NOFO. If you are using slow internet, such as dial -up connections, be aware that transmission can take some time before Grants.gov receives your application. Again, Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received transmission in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role. The Grants.gov Support Center reports that some applicants end the transmission because they think that nothing is occurring during the transmission process. Please be patient and give the system time to process the application. 3.5. Late Applications Applications which do not meet the criteria as outlined in Section IV .4. Submission Dates and Times of the NOFO will be considered late applications and will not be reviewed. 3.6. Requesting a Waiver from the Submission Requirement HRSA requires you to apply electronically and have the application validated under the correct funding opportunity number on or before the deadline date and time. The registration and application process protects you against fraud and ensures that only authorized represent atives from an organization can submit an application. You are responsible for maintaining these registrations, which should be completed well in advance of submitting an application. You must submit your application electronically by the deadline posted on the NOFO. If you wish to request a waiver from the submission requirement, you must request an exemption in writing from ApplicationWaivers@hrsa.gov no later than 5 calendar days after the opportunity's closing date. Requests received after 5 calendar may not be considered. The request should provide details as to why you are technologically unable to submit electronically through the Grants.gov portal. If requesting a waiver from the submission requirements, include the following in the email request: HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 16 HRSA funding rganization's name A ddress T elephone number UEI number N ame, address, number of the PD Grants.gov Tracking Number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) assigned to the submission along with a copy of the \"Rejected with Errors\" notification as received from Grants.gov, if applicable If case numbers were given from calling Grants.gov, include those as well Any other details regarding the jus tification HRSA's Division of Grants Management (DGMO) in the Office of Federal Assistance Management is the only office authorized to grant waivers. HRSA is very strict on adhering to application deadlines and submission requirements. Deadline extensions will not be granted for Grants.gov verification errors, last -minute registration, or submission errors on your part. DGMO may consider an extension of published deadlines or allowance of a submission outside of the Grants.gov system, when justified by circumstances such as natural disasters (e.g., floods or hurricanes) , other disruptions of services (e.g., a prolonged blackout ), or in the rare event of a validated technical issue on the side of the government that prevented you from applying before the deadline. DGMO will determine the affected geographical area(s) or other applicant group parameters. HRSA and its Digital Services Operation (DSO) will only accept paper applications from applicants that received prior written approval. However, the application must still be validated by the deadline. 4. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION SUBMISSION HRSA requires you to apply electronically . HRSA encourages you to apply through Grants.gov using the Standard Form 424 ( SF-424) application package associated with the funding opportunity and follow the directions provided at Grants.gov . If you use an alternative electronic submission, see Grants.gov: APPLICANT SYSTEM -TO-SYSTEM . Applications must be submitted in the English language and in the terms of U.S. dollars ( 45 CFR \u00a7 75.111(a) ). The following instructions are applicable to all submissions unless otherwise noted in the relevant NOFO . Failure to follow the instructions may make your application non- responsive. HRSA will not consider non-responsive applications and will notify applicants. It is mandatory to follow the instructions provided to ensure HRSA can efficiently and consistently print your application for review, if needed. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 17 4.1. Instructions for Completing the SF- 424 i. Application Face Page Complete Application Form SF- 424 provided with the application package. Prepare according to instructions provided in the form itself . Important notes for applicants : Changes to improve grant award data accuracy have led HHS to require that applicant street addres ses (SF -424 cover page and Project/Performance Site Location Form) contain a valid 9- digit zip code. Use the following USPS.com link to find your 9- digit zip code: USPS: Look Up a Zip Code E nter the name of the Project Director in 8.f. \"Name and contact information of person to be contacted on matters involving this application.\" If, for any reason, the P roject Director will be out of the office, please ensure the email Out of Office Assistant is set so HRSA will be aware if any issues arise with the application and a timely response is required. Enter the amount requested during the first budget period in item 18. a. Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) Number Your organization (and subrecipient s of HRSA award funds) is required to have a UEI number in order to apply for a grant or cooperative agreement from the Federal Government. Include the Organizational UEI number in form SF- 424 (item 8 .c. on the application face page). Applications will not be reviewed without a UEI number. Note: A missing or incorrect UEI number is the number one reason for applications being \"Rejected for Errors\" by Grants.gov. HRSA will not extend the deadline for applications with a missing or incorrect UEI number. You should take care in entering the correct UEI number in the application. Additionally, your organization (and any subrecipient of HRSA award funds) is required to register annually with SAM in order to conduct electronic business with the Federal Government. SAM registration must be maintained with current, accurate information at all times during which an entity has an active award or an application or plan under consideration by HRSA. It is extremely important to verify that your organization's SAM registration is active and the Marketing Partner ID Number (MPIN) is current. Organizations will not be able to submit an application or accept an award i f SAM registration is not complete and accurate. Information about registering with SAM can be found at SAM.gov . Assistance Listings Number The AL number, as listed on the cover of the NOFO , is prepopulated in box 11 of the form. ii. Intergovernmental Review (Executive Order (EO) 12372) If a NOFO is subject to EO 12372, \"Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,\" it will be noted in Section IV. 5. Intergovernmental Review of the funding opportunity . Refer to section 19 on the SF- 424. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 18 If intergovernmental review applies, the following language will appear in the NOFO : Program X is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100. EO 12372 allows states the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their states for assistance under certain federal programs. Information on states that have chosen to set up such a review system and corresponding State Single Points of Contact may be obtained from the following web site: Intergovernmental Review (SPOC List as of April 20, 2020) . All applicants other than federally recognized Native American t ribes or t ribal organizations should contact their Single Point of Contact as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the state's process used under this EO . iii. Table of Contents The application should be presented in the order of the Table of Contents provided in Section 4.3 of this SF-424 Application Guide . Again, for electronic applications no table of contents is necessary as it will be generated by the system. (Note: the Table of Contents will not be counted in the page limit.) iv. Budget Note: the directions here may differ from those offered by Grants.gov. Follow the instructions included in the program -specific NOFO and the instructions below when completing the project budget forms. The Total Project o r Program Costs are the total allowable costs ( inclusive of direct and indirect costs) incurred by the recipient to carry out a HRSA- supported project or activity. Total project or program costs include costs charged to the award and costs borne by the recipient to satisfy a matching or cost -sharing 2 requirement , as applicable. Classific ation of Costs: There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect facilities and administration (F&A) under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to the federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, it is essential that each item of cost incurred for the same purpose be treated consistently in like circumstances either as a direct or an indirect F&A cost in order to avoid possible double- charging of federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and indirect F&A costs charged to federal awards are provided in 45 CFR part 75, subpart E . 2 If not a requirement per statute or regulation, voluntary matching or cost sharing is not considered during merit review. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 19 For multi -year non- construction projects: Complete Sections A - F of the SF- 424A Budget Information - Non-Construction Programs form included with the application package for each year of the period of performance. The budget period is for 1 year. However, you must submit 1-year budgets for each of the subsequent budget periods within the requested period of performance at the time of application. In Section A use rows 1- 4 to provide the budget amounts for the first 4 years of the project. Enter the amounts in the \"New or Revised Budget\" column- not the \"Estimated Unobligated Funds\" column. In Section B 6. Object Class Categories of the SF- 424A, provide the object class category breakdown (i.e., line item budget) for each year of the period of performance specified in Section A. In Section B, use column (1) to provide category amounts for year 1 and use columns (2) through (4), if applicable, for subsequent budget years. If applicable for year 5, submit a copy of Section B of the SF- 424A as an Attachment (specific attachment number will be listed in the NOFO - not counted in the page limit). Section C - Non-Federal Resources: complete only if Section III. 2. Cost Sharing/Matching of the NOFO indicates that cost sharing/matching is required. Lines 8-11 correspond to the first 4 years of the project. If applicable for year 5, submit a copy of Section C of the SF- 424A as an Attachment (specific attachment number will be listed in the NOFO ). Section D - Forecasted Cash Needs: If no cost sharing/matching is required, complete only line \"13. Federal \" in the first column titled \"Total for 1 st Year .\" If cost sharing/matching is required, complete all three lines \" 13. Federal ,\" \"14. Non- Federal ,\" and \"15.

Complete as appropriate. If the NOFO notes that the program is subject to the General Provisions of P.L. 117- 328, the following Salary Rate Limitation applies: Salary Rate Limitation: The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L. 117- 328), Division H, Section 202, provides a salary rate limitation. The law limits the salary amount that may be awarded and charged to HRSA grants and cooperative agreements . Award funds may not be used to pay the salary of an individual at a rate in excess of Executive Level II , which is $212,100 (effective January 2023 ). This amount reflects an individual's base salary exclusive of fringe and any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of the duties to your organization. This salary rate limitation also applies to subrecipients under a HRSA grant or cooperative agreement. Note HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 20 that these or other salary rate limitations will apply in the following fiscal years , as required by law. See the breakdown and examples of the limitation below: Individual's actual base full time salary: $255,000 50 percent of time will be devoted to project Direct salary $127,500 Fringe (25 percent of salary) $31,875 Total $159,375 Amount that may be claimed on the application budget due to the statutory salary rate limitation: Individual's base full time salary adjusted to Executive Level II: $212,100 50 percent of time will be devoted to the project Direct salary $106,050 Fringe (25 percent of salary) $26,512 (rounded down) Total $132,562 (rounded down) Personnel Justification Table (varied FTE percentages) Name Position Title % of FTE Base Salary Adjusted Annual Salary* Federal Amount Requested J. Smith CEO 50 $255,000 $212,100 $106,050 M. Green Dentist 100 $215,000 $212,100 $212,100 C. Moore Physician 50 $200,000 No adjustment needed $100,000 R.

Jones Data/AP Specialist 25 $50,000 No adjustment needed $12,500 TOTAL $910,000 $585,650 *used only when salary is over limitation of $212,100 Finally, remember that in order to be considered as allowable costs on your HRSA award, you need to ensure that personnel costs are supported by official records that accurately reflect the work performed and that internal controls provide reasonable assurance that the personnel costs are accurate, allowable, and allocable to the HRSA award . HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 21 Funding Restrictions (in general) You may request no more than the funding ceiling amount listed in Section II.2. Summary of Funding and Section IV. 6. Funding Restrictions of the NOFO . Awards to support projects beyond the first budget year will be contingent upon Congressional appropriation, satisfactory progress in meeting the project's objectives, and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Federal Government. Unallowable Costs The governing cost principles add ress selected items of cost. The NOFO specifies unallowable costs that apply to each funding opportunity. The following list of unallowable costs is not intended to be all -inclusive. Consult t he cost principles for the complete explanation of the allowability or unallowability of costs they address. For the full list of cost principles refer to Section 2. 2 \"Compliance Requirements at a Glance \" to see which cost principles apply to your organization and refer to Subpart E - Cost Principles at 45 CFR part 75. The al lowability of costs under individual HRSA awards also may be governed by requirements specified in the program statute, regulations, or the specific terms and conditions of the award, which will take precedence over the general information provided here and in the regulations that are referenced. Also note that a cost is not allowabl e if it is not reasonable, necessary, allocable to the award, or adequately documented ( 45 CFR \u00a7 75.403 ). Item Descrip tion Conditionally allowable. See 45 CFR \u00a7 75.421 for details. Advisory Councils Costs incurred by advisory councils or committees are unallowable unless authorized by law, the HHS awarding agency , or as an indirect cost where allocable to federal awards. See 45 CFR \u00a7 75.444, applicable to states, local governments , and Indian tribes. Alcoholic Beverages Costs of alcoholic beverages are unallowable. Bad Debts Unallowable . Entertainment Costs Conditionally unallowable. This includes the cost of amusements, social activities, and related incidental costs. 45 CFR \u00a7 75.438 clarifi es when entertainment costs may be charged to a federal award with prior approval . Fundraising Costs Unallowable . HRSA Item Descrip tion Honoraria Unallowable when the primary intent is to confer distinction on, or to symbolize respect, esteem, or admiration for, the recipient of the honorarium. A payment for services rendered, such as a speaker's fee under a conference award, is allowable. Invention, Patent, or Licensing Costs Unallowable as a direct cost unless specifically authorized in the NOA. May be allowable as indirect costs provided they are authorized under applicable cost principles and are included in the negotiation of indirect cost rates . Such costs include licensing or option fees, attorney's fees for preparing or submitting patent applications, and fees paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for patent application, patent maintenance, or recordation of patent -related information. Lobbying Generally unallowable, including costs of lobbying activities to influence the introduction, enactment, or modification of legislation by the U.S. Congress or a state legislature. Under certain circumstances, as provided in the applicable cost principles, costs associated with activities that might otherwise be considered \"lobbying\" that are directly related to the performance of a grant or cooperative agreement may be allowable. The recipient should obtain an advance understanding with the GM S if it intend s to engage in these activities. See \" Restriction on Lobbying \" below and at 45 CFR \u00a7 75.450 for additional descriptions and examples of prohibited activities. Meals Generally unallowable except for the following: Subjects and patients under study . Where specifically approved as part of the project or program activity, e.g., in programs providing children's services . When an organization customarily provides meals to employees working beyond the normal workday, as a part of a formal compensation arrangement . As part of a per diem or subsistence allowance provided in conjunction with allowable travel . Under a conference award, when meals are a necessary and integral part of a conference, provided that meal costs are not duplicated in participants' per diem or subsistence allowances. Guest meals are not allowable. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 23 Item Descrip tion Pre-award Costs Costs incurred before the effective date of the sponsored agreement, whether or not they would have been allowable thereunder if incurred after such date, are unallowable unless approved by HRSA or authorized under expanded authority. Where authorized by HRSA as an expanded authority, a recipient may, at its own risk and without HRSA prior approval, incur obligations and expenditures to cover costs up to (and including) 90 calendar days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new or competing continuation award if such costs are necessary to conduct the project or program, and would be allowable under the grant or cooperative agreement , if awarded. However, even if authorized as an expanded authority, if a specific expenditure would otherwise require prior approval, the cost or activity must meet the same tests o f allowability as if incurred after award. If not authorized as part of expanded authorities, the applicant/recipient must seek HRSA prior approval before incurring pre- award costs. HRSA prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more than 90 calendar days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new or competing continuation award. Promotional Items (SWAG ) Promotional items and memorabilia (e.g., pencils, cups, t -shirts, cookbooks, bags), gifts, and souvenirs designed to promote the recipient's organization are unallowable as advertising/public relations costs . Finally, even if a cost is not included on the above list, if there is not adequate documentation of particular costs, such as vouchers, invoices, timekeeping records, etc. with enough detail to determine if the cost is allowable, then the organization's annual audit might reflect that the costs cannot be charged to the HRSA award and a refund will be necessary if the costs remain undocumented. Funding Restrictions : If the NOFO notes that the program is subject to the General Provisions of P.L. 117 -328, the following statutory mandates are in effect and organizations should ensure that they have policies and procedures in place, and effective financial management practices, to avoid expending any HRSA funds on prohibited activities . Your organization must comply with all legal requirements and restrictions applicable to the receipt of federal funding including statutory restrictions on use of funds for lobbying, executive salaries, gun control, abortion, etc. Like all other HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 24 applicable award requirements, the effectiveness of these policies, procedures and controls is subject to audit.

This amount reflects an individual's base salary exclusive of fringe and any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of the duties to the applicant organization. This salary rate limitation also applies to subawards/subcontracts under an HRSA grant or cooperative agreement. 3. Gun Control (Section 210) \"None of the funds made available in this title may be used, in whole or in par t, to advocate or promote gun control.\" Division H , Title V 4.

Budget Narrative Provide a budget narrative that explains the amounts requested for each line of the budget in Section B. 6. Object Class Categories . The budget narrative should specifically describe how each item will support the achievement of proposed objectives. Be very careful about showing how each item in the \"other\" category is justified. For subsequent budget years, the narrative should highlight the changes from year 1 or clearly indicate that there are no substantive budget changes during the period of performance. Do NOT use the budget narrative to expand the project narrative. Budget for Multi -Year Award (periods of performance vary, maximum of 5 years) NOFO s invite applications for periods of performance of 1 to up to 5 years. Generally, awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a 1- year budget period; although the period of performance may be up to 5 years. Submission and HRSA approval of the progress report (s) and any other required submission or reports is the basis for the budget period renewal and release of subsequent year funds. Funding beyond the 1-year budget period but within the multi -year period of performance is subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the recipient , and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Federal Government. In addition to requirements included in the program -specific NOFO , include the following in the Budget N arrative: Personnel Costs: Explain personnel costs by listing each staff member who will be supported from funds, name (if possible), position title, percentage of full -time equivalency, and annual salary. If the NOFO notes that the program is subject to the General Provisions of P.L. 117- 328, the following applies: Award funds may not be used to pay the salary of an individual at a rate in excess of Executive Level II or $212,100. An individual's base salary, per se, is NOT constrained by the statutory provision for a limitation of salary. The rate limitation simply limits the amount that may be awarded and charged to HRSA grants and cooperative agree ments. Provide an individual's actual base salary if it exceeds the cap. See the Personnel Justification Table in the Budget section . Fringe Benefits: List the components that comprise the fringe benefit rate, for example health insurance, taxes, unemployment insurance, life insurance, HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 30 retirement plans, and tuition reimbursement. The fringe benefits should be directly proportional to that portion of personnel costs that are allocated for the project. If the NOFO notes that the program is subject to the General Provisions of P.L. 117- 328, the following applies: If an individual's base salary exceeds the statutory salary cap (i.e., $212,100) , adjust fringe proportionally . Travel: List travel costs according to local and long distance travel. For local travel, outline the mileage rate, number of miles, reason for travel and staff member/consumers completing the travel. The budget should also reflect the travel expenses (e.g., airfare, lodging, parking, per diem, etc.) for each person and trip associated with participating in meetings and other proposed trainings or workshops. Name the traveler(s) if possible, describe the purpose of the travel, provide number of trips involved, the destinations, and the number of individuals for whom funds are requested. Equipment : List equipment costs and provide justification for the need of the equipment to carry out the program's goals. Extensive justification and a detailed status of current equipment must be provided when requesting funds for the purchase of items that meet the definition of equipment (a unit cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of 1 or more years). For example, large items of medical equipment. Supplies : List the items that the project will use to implement the proposed project . Separate items into three categories: office supplies (e.g., paper, pencils), medical supplies (e.g., syringes, blood tubes, gloves), and educational supplies (e.g., brochures, videos). Items must be listed separately. Per 45 CFR \u00a7 75.321, property will be classifie d as supplies if the acquisition cost is under $5,000. Note that items su ch as laptops, t ablets, and de sktop comput ers are classified a s a supply if the va lue is under the $5,000 equipment threshold. Contractual /Subawards/Consortium /Consultant : Provide a clear explanation as to the purpose of each contract /subaward, how the costs were estimated, and the specific contract /subaward deliverables . You should not provide line item details on proposed contracts, rather you should provide the basis for your cost estimate for the contract. You are responsible for ensuring that your organization or institution has in place an established and adequate procurement system with fully developed written procedures for awarding and monitoring all contracts/subawards . Recipients must notify potential subrecipient s that entities receiving subawards must b e registered in SAM and provide the recipient with their UEI number (see 2 CFR part 25 ). For consultant services , list the total costs for all consultant services. In the budget narrative, identify each consul tant, the services he/she will perform, total number of days, travel costs, and total estimated costs. HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 31 For subawards to entities that will help carry out the work of the award , you should decribe how you will monitor their work to ensure the funds are being properly used. Per the Suspension and Debarment rules in the Uniform Administrative Requirements , as implemented by HRSA under 45 CFR \u00a7 75.213 n on-federal entities and contractors are subject to the non- procurement debarment and suspension regulations implementing Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, 2 CFR parts 180 and 376. These regulations restrict awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in federal assistance programs or activities. Other: Include all costs that do not fit into any other category and provide an explanation of each cost in this category (e.g., EHR provider licenses, audit, legal counsel) . In some cases, rent, utilities , and insurance fall under this category if they are not included in an approved indirect cost rate. You may include the cost of access accommodations as part of your project's budget, including sign interpreters, plain language and health litera cy print materials in alternate formats (including Braille, large print, etc.); and linguistic competence modifications (e.g., translation or interpretation services ). Indirect Costs : *Indirect costs are those costs incurred for common or joint objectives which cannot be readily and specifically identified with a particular project or program but are necessary to the operations of the organization, e.g., the cost of operating and maintaining facilities, depreciation, and administrative salaries. For some institutions, the term \"facilities and administration\" (F&A) is used to denote indirect costs. If your organization does not have an indirect cost rate, you may wish to obtain one through HHS's Program Support Center (PSC) . Visit PSC's Indirect Cost Negotiations website to learn more about rate agreements, the process for applying for them, and the regional offices which negotiate them. If indirect costs are included in the budget, attach a copy of the indirect cost rate agreement. If the indirect cost rate agreement is required per the NOFO , it will not count toward the page limit. Any non- federal entity that has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, ( except a governmental department or agency unit that receives more than $35 million in direct federal funding) may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs ( MTDC) which may be used indefinitely. If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all federal awards until such time as a non-federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non- federal entity may apply to do at any time. vi. Staffing Plan and Personnel Requirements You must present a staffing plan and provide a justification for the plan that includes education and experience qualifications and rationale for the amount of time being requested for each staff position. Position descriptions that include the roles, responsibilities, and qualifications of proposed project staff must be included in the HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 32 Attachment specifie d in the NOFO . Biographical sketches for any key employed personnel that will be assigned to work on the proposed project must be included in the Attachment specified in the NOFO . When applicable, biographical sketches should include training, language fluency and experience working with the cultural and linguistically diverse populations that are served by your programs. Finally, you should describe your method for ensuring that only actual work performed will be charged to the award and how that method meets federal cos t principle requirements under \u00a7 75.430 Compensation\u2014 personal services . vii. Assurances If research involving human subjects is anticipated, you must meet the requirements of the HHS regulations to protect human subjects from research risks as specified in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45 - Public Welfare, Part 46 - Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR part 46) , available online. If research involving human subjects is anticipated, you must hold a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) of compliance from the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) bef ore award. You must provide your Human Subject Assurance Number (from the FWA) in the application; if you do not have an assurance, you must indicate in the application that you will obtain one from OHRP before award. viii.

HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 40 4.4. Application Page Limit The total of uploaded attachment pages that count against the page limit shall be no more than the page limit specified in Section IV. 2. o f the NOFO when printed by HRSA. Forms that DO NOT count in the Page Limit Standard OMB -approved forms included in the workspace application package do not count in the page limit. The abstract is the standard form (SF) \"Project_Abstract Summary.\" It does not count in the page limit. The Indirect Cost Rate Agreement does not count in the page limit. The proof of non- profit status (if applicable) does not count in the page limit. If there are other attachments that do not count against the page limit, this will be clearly denoted in the NOFO's Section IV.2. v. or vi . Attachments. If you use an OMB -approved form that is not included in the workspace application package for your NOFO, it will count against the page limit. Therefore, we strongly recommend you use Grants.gov workspace forms associated with your NOFO to avoid exceeding the page limit. HRSA will redact any pages considered over the page limit. The redacted copy of the application will move forward to t he objective review committee. It is important to ensure your application does not exceed the specified page limit. Applications must be complete and validated by Grants.gov under the funding opportunity number before the deadline. You must follow the instructions provided in this section. HRSA recommends that you print all attachments and confirm the number of pages before submission. 4.5. Submission Dates and Times Letter of Intent to Apply (ONLY if requested on the cover and in Section IV. 7. of the NOFO ) You are eligible to apply even if no letter of intent is submitted. The letter should identify your organization and its intent to apply, and briefly describe the proposal. HRSA will not acknowledge receipt of letters of intent. This letter should be sent via email by the date listed in NOFO to: HRSA Digital Services Operation (DSO) HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 41 Use the HRSA opportunity number as email subject (HRSA -##-####) HRSADSO@hrsa.gov Application Due Date The due date for applications is 11:59 p.m. ET on the date listed in Section IV. 4. Submission Dates and Times in the NOFO , unless otherwise noted . Applications completed online are considered formally submitted when the application has been successfully transmitted electronically to the correct funding opportunity number , by the organization's AOR through Grants.gov and validated by Grants.gov under the correct funding opportunity number on or before the deadline date and time. 4.6. Correcting Mistakes If, for any reason, an application is submitted more than once before the application due date, HRSA will only accept and review your last validated electronic submission, under the correct funding opportunity number , before the Grants.gov application due date as the final and only acceptable application. Applications submitted under the wrong funding opportunity number may be deemed non- responsive; refer to section 3.6 for more guidance. If you need to correct a Grants.gov application mistake, in Box 1 of the SF-424, check \"Changed/Corrected Application,\" and submit the corrected version before the application deadline. It is incumbent on you to ensure that the AOR is available to submit the application to HRSA by the published due date. HRSA will not accept submission or re -submission of incomplete, rejected, or otherwise delayed applications after the deadline. Therefore, we urge you to submit your application at least 3 calendar days before the deadline. If an application is rejected by Grants.gov due to errors, it must be corrected and resubmitted to Grants.gov before the deadline date and time. Deadline extensions will not be provided to applicants who do not correct errors and resubmit before the posted deadline. 4.7. Tips for Writing a Strong Application HRSA has designed a TA webpage to assist you in preparing your application. Resources include help with system registration, finding and applying for funding opportunities, writing strong applications, understanding the review process, and many other topics which you will find relevant. The webpage can be accessed at HRSA Apply For A Grant . In addition, you can access a concise resource offering tips for writing proposals for HHS grants and cooperative agreements at HHS Tips for Preparing Grant Proposals . HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 42 4.8. Withdrawing an Application You may withdraw your application from consideration at any time before an award is issued. Send notification of this withdrawal via email to ApplicationWaivers@hrsa.gov with a copy sent to the PC and GMS listed in the NOFO . 5. PROCESS OVERVIEW 5.1. Competing Applications t hrough Grants.gov Using Workspace The process for submitting a competing application through Grants.gov using workspace is as follows : 1) HRSA post s all competing NOFO s on Grants.gov . 2) In order to apply for a HRSA award , you must complete the Grants.gov registration process. See Section 3 for more details. 3) Once the NOFO is available, you should search for the funding opportunity in Grants.gov by clicking the SEARCH GRANTS tab, entering the funding opportunity number (HRSA- ##-####) and then selecting the funding opportunity or clicking the APPLICANTS tab and then click ing on How to Apply for Grants . 4) Create a workspace package. The NOFO , accessible via the instructions link, contains critical application instructions. Make note of the funding opportunity number . 5) Add workspace participants, complete the workspace package, check for errors , and notify the AOR the application is ready for submission. 6) Submit the application package through Grants.gov. 7) Track the status of your submitted application using \"Track My Application\" at Grants.gov until you receive email notifications that your application has been received and validated by Grants.gov and received by HRSA. Be sure the application has been validated under the correct funding opportunity number. 8) Once Grants.gov validates your application, you may track the status of the application within HRSA by using the \" Track Your Application \" widget , now available on HRSA's website . The application tracker will let you know where your application is at every stage in the process . 5.2. Application Processing HRSA staff review each application for eligibility, responsiveness, completeness, and conformity with the requirements outlined in the relevant NOFO , including programmatic, budgetary, and grants management compliance. Applications that pass the initial HRSA completeness and eligibility screening will be reviewed and rated by a panel based on the program elements and review criteria presented in Section V. 1. Review Criteria of the relevant NOFO . HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 43 All incomplete, ineligible, or otherwise non- compliant applications, and applications determined to be non- responsive to NOFO requirements will not be considered for funding. You may withdraw your application from consideration at any time before an award is issued. For those applications that did not pass the initial screening, HRSA will advise applicants by email through the EHBs (sent to the individual signing the application on behalf of the organization) that the application will not be held for further consideration or be funded. The decision not to make an award or to make an award at a particular funding level, is discretionary and is not subject to appeal to any HRSA or HHS official or board. 5.3. Objective Review Information The Division of Independent Review is responsible for managing objective reviews within HRSA. The objective review process provides an objective evaluation of applications to the individuals responsible for making award decisions . Objective review is essential to ensuring selection of applications that best meet the needs of the program consistent with published evaluation criteria and providing assurance to the public that the evaluation process is impartial and fair. Applications competing for federal funds receive an objective and independent review performed by a committee of experts qualified by training and experience in particular fields or disciplines related to the program being reviewed. In selecting review committee members, other factors in addition to training and experience may be considered to improve the balance of the committee, e.g., geographic distribution. Each reviewer is screened to avoid conflicts of interest and is responsible for providing an objective, unbiased evaluation based on the review criteria presented in Section V. 1. Review Criteria of the NOFO . Applications that pass the initial HRSA completeness and eligibility screening will be reviewed and rated by a panel based on the program elements and review criteria presented in the NOFO . The review criteria are designed to enable the review panel to assess the quality of a proposed project and determine the likelihood of its success. The criteria are closely related to each other and are considered as a whole in judging the overall quality of an application. HRSA has p rocedures for assessing the technical merit of applications to provide for an objective review and to assist you in understanding the standards against which each application will be re viewed. HRSA has indicators for each review criterion to assist you in presenting pertinent information related to that criterion and to provide the reviewer with a standard for evaluation. See the r eview criteria outlined with specific detail and scoring points in the NOFO s. Funding factors may be applied during the objective review process or in the selection process. Funding factors are addressed in the NOFO , which will specify if you must HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 44 make an affirmative re quest to be considered for a funding factor, what information is needed to demonstrate eligibility for the funding factor, and whether objective reviewers or HRSA staff determine if you've met the funding factor. The NOFO provides a detailed explanation of preferences, priorities, or special considerations with an explicit indication of their effect (e.g., whether they result in additional points being assigned). It is HRSA policy that funding preferences, priorities, and special considerations must be published in the NOFO . You will receive written notification of the outcome of the objective review process, including a summary of the expert committee's assessment of the application's strengths and weaknesses, and whether the application was selected for funding. 5.4. Award Notification The Notice of Award ( NOA) is the legal document issued to the recipient that indicates an award has been made and funds may be requested from HRSA. Until an awarding office has issued an NOA for the initial budget period, any costs you incur for the project are incurred at your own risk. HRSA may reimburse pre -award costs onl y to the extent that they would otherwise be allowable. The NOA sets forth the amount of funds granted, the terms and conditions of the award, the effective date of the award, the budget period for which initial support will be given, the non- federal share to be provided (if applicable), and the total period of performance for which support is contemplated. Signed by the Grants Management Officer (GMO), it is sent to the recipient's AOR, and reflects the only authorizing document. Any other correspondence announcing that an application has been selected for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Generally, HRSA will issue the NOA before the start date of the award as listed in Section V. 4 of the NOFO . A revised NOA may be issued during a budget period to effect an action resulting in a change in the period or amount of support or other change in the terms and conditions of award. An awarding office generally will not issue a revised NOA to reflect a recipient's post -award rebudgeting. Applicants who are selected for funding may be required to respond in a satisfactory manner to conditions placed on their award document before funding can proceed. Letters of notification do not provide authorization to begin performan ce. Unsuccessful applicants will receive notification from HRSA's Division of Grants Management Operations . 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Successful applicants must comply with the following standard reporting and review activities , unless otherwise noted in the NOFO or NOA . Some programs require program -specific reporting; please see Section VI. 3. Reporting of the NOFO . HRSA SF -424 Application Guide 45 a.
