The main threat to the elimination of TB is the development of resistance by MTB to the currently used antibiotics and more extended treatment methods, which is a massive burden on the health care system. As a result, there is an urgent need to identify new, effective therapeutic strategies with fewer adverse effects. The traditional medicines found in South Asia and Africa have a reservoir of medicinal plants and plant-based compounds that are considered another reliable option for human beings to treat various diseases. Abundant research is available for the biotherapeutic potential of naturally occurring compounds in various diseases but has been lagging in the area of TB. Plant-based compounds, or phytoproducts, are being investigated as potential anti-mycobacterial agents by reducing bacterial burden or modulating the immune system, thereby minimizing adverse effects. The efficacy of these phytochemicals has been evaluated through drug delivery using nanoformulations. This review aims to emphasize the value of anti-TB compounds derived from plants and provide a summary of current research on phytochemicals with potential anti-mycobacterial activity against MTB. This article aims to inform readers about the numerous potential herbal treatment options available for combatting TB.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-08", "cleaned_text": "Medicinal Plants as Therapeutic Alternatives to Combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Comprehensive Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12030541](https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12030541) [Antimicrobial Chemotherapy: New Therapeutic Approaches against the Drug-Resistant and Difficult to Treat Bacterial Infections]( /journal/antibiotics/special_issues/antimicrobial_chemotherapy )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-antibiotics-12-00541)]. It then, at that point, reached pandemic proportions among the increasing population and overwhelming daily situations. In the 20th century, the TB-afflicted population started to reduce rapidly in developed countries with progress in prosperity, food, and dwelling conditions. [2](#B2-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [3](#B3-antibiotics-12-00541)]. With a yearly rate of 2,000,000 new cases, more than 40% of India's population is infected with latent TB. For about 50 years, counter-TB drugs have been depleted. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains is a significant challenge in the fight against TB [ [4](#B4-antibiotics-12-00541)]. With the emergence of COVID-19, the number of TB cases has been increasing abruptly, as it has directly impacted TB treatment and diagnosis [ [5](#B5-antibiotics-12-00541)]. With the current situation in mind, the World Health Organization (WHO) has moved the goal of eradicating TB from the world from 2025 to 2035 [ [6](#B6-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [7](#B7-antibiotics-12-00541), [8](#B8-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Phytodrugs that and have a historical pedagogy for treating TB provide an attractive and powerful alternative to conventional treatments with the least side effects [ [9](#B9-antibiotics-12-00541)]. In developing nations, 80% of the population depends on traditional medicine, as indicated [ [10](#B10-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Plants with phytochemicals exhibiting antibacterial activity provide alternatives for treating TB without compromising human health further with side effects [ [11](#B11-antibiotics-12-00541)]. 2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Overview 2.1. Etiology [12](#B12-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [13](#B13-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00541-f001)): - (1) - The pulmonary immune system rapidly eliminates the pathogen; - (2) - Infection proceeds to active TB; - (3) - The pathogen enters a dormant/latent phase; - (4) - The latent MTB can become active following endogenous reactivation, a new exogenous infection, or both; - (5) - At this stage, there is MTB spread and transmission. 2.2. Epidemiology [6](#B6-antibiotics-12-00541)]. COVID-19 virus has had a damaging effect on the treatment and diagnosis of TB. TB cases were high in number in the year 2020 as compared to 2019. America and the East Asian region witnessed a sharp fall in 2020, with a nominal recovery rate in 2021. [6](#B6-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [6](#B6-antibiotics-12-00541)]. 3. Current Antibiotic Treatments in Action 3.1. Different Antibiotics Used for TB Treatment [14](#B14-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [6](#B6-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [15](#B15-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Therefore, new drugs with a novel mechanism or less impact from adverse effects need to be explored to manage drug-resistant TB [ [16](#B16-antibiotics-12-00541)]. 3.2. Multi-Drug Resistance in Tuberculosis [17](#B17-antibiotics-12-00541)]. The treatment of RR-TB and MDR-TB is longer than 18 months and usually consists of first-line drugs and selected second-line drugs. In XDR-TB, apart from resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, there is resistance to at least one drug from the two classes of second-line drugs\u2014fluoroquinolones and injectables. This implied that there is resistance to moxifloxacin or levofloxacin among the fluoroquinolones and amikacin, injectable agents [ [18](#B18-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Multi- and extended-drug resistance have been caused by a variety of factors, including non-compliance with therapy, failure to directly observe treatment, shortage of drugs, poor quality of drugs, access to anti-TB drugs without a prescription, poor medical management, and non-adherence to national control programs [ [19](#B19-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [14](#B14-antibiotics-12-00541)]. MDR, extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and drug-resistant are the three types of drug-resistant MTB strains identified by the WHO. Isoniazid and rifampicin, the two first-line drugs, are ineffective against MDR-TB, which makes up around 3.4% of new TB cases worldwide. MDR-TB requires a lengthy, expensive course of therapy lasting 9 to 20 months, with a 56% slower success rate than unprotected TB [ [14](#B14-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Rifampicin and isoniazid are also ineffective against XDR-TB, as are fluoroquinolones and one of the three second-line injectable drugs (kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin), with a lower rate of success of 39% [ [14](#B14-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Finally, no medicine can penetrate XXDR strains. XXDR strains are resistant to all first and second-line drugs. There has been research using atomic force microscopy to study XXDR-MTB strains in the exponential phase that observed changes in cell morphology, including increased roughness and striations and tubular extensions. These alterations are likely due to drug treatment, and about 5-7% of the XXDR-MTB bacteria displayed an unusually thick cell envelope, regardless of the strain genotype [ [20](#B20-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [21](#B21-antibiotics-12-00541), [22](#B22-antibiotics-12-00541)]. In mycobacteria, the -CAs are known to play a crucial role in biofilm formation and the production of virulence factors and hence survival and tolerance of antibiotics [ [23](#B23-antibiotics-12-00541), [24](#B24-antibiotics-12-00541)]. There has been an effort to develop small molecular compounds targeting the -CAs of mycobacterium as anti-TB compounds [ [22](#B22-antibiotics-12-00541), [25](#B25-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [26](#B26-antibiotics-12-00541)]. In addition to chemically synthesized CA inhibitors, some plant-derived compounds known as coumarins ( [Table 1](#antibiotics-12-00541-t001)) have been anti-tubercular activity [ [27](#B27-antibiotics-12-00541), [28](#B28-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Coumarins inhibit the synthesis of proteins and suppress the activity of carbonic anhydrases [ [27](#B27-antibiotics-12-00541), [28](#B28-antibiotics-12-00541)]. It has recently been shown that coumarins are involved in microbial quorum sensing and biofilm formation [ [29](#B29-antibiotics-12-00541)]. 4. Drug Delivery Incorporating Nanoparticles for the Treatment of TB [30](#B30-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Nanoparticles are elegant vehicles for drug-targeted delivery because of their great stability and carrier capacity ( [Figure 2](#antibiotics-12-00541-f002)) [ [31](#B31-antibiotics-12-00541), [32](#B32-antibiotics-12-00541)]. In India, which has the greatest estimated number of TB cases, research is being performed to evaluate what role nanotechnology can play in fixing these issues [ [33](#B33-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [34](#B34-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [30](#B30-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [35](#B35-antibiotics-12-00541)]. 5. Drug Delivery Explored in TB [34](#B34-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Mice with persistent infection administered liposome-encapsulated PZA (pyrazinamide) and RFB (rifabutin) exhibited complete bacilli clearance [ [31](#B31-antibiotics-12-00541), [32](#B32-antibiotics-12-00541), [38](#B38-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [39](#B39-antibiotics-12-00541)]. SLNs have improved encapsulation efficiency, longer or higher stability, and require fewer organic solvents than polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes [ [34](#B34-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [40](#B40-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Five oral dosages of nanoparticles every ten days were sufficient to eliminate TB bacillus from the organs of mice, whereas free medicines required 46 treatments to obtain the same outcomes. [34](#B34-antibiotics-12-00541)]. The formulation provides a prolonged release in the plasma for 7-11 days and in the organs for 15 days after a single oral dose [ [41](#B41-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [42](#B42-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Using ethanol as an antisolvent, guar gum nanoparticles were created during the solvent's precipitation. The solvent's composition was changed, with the amounts of ethanol and water added in drops to the guar gum solution containing the antigen. Several formulation parameters, including polymeric concentration and solvent composition, were improved based on particle size and distribution. It was concluded that other factors were held constant, such as the type of solvent used, the rate of stirring, the temperature, and the rate of addition. It was found that the polymer concentration can significantly affect the size of the particles in a formulation. The guar gum nanoparticles triggered a potent immune response on both the systemic and mucosal levels. As a result, guar gum nanoparticles were found to be a valuable tool for delivering targeted vaccinations without needles. They can deliver oral vaccines safely and effectively [ [4](#B4-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Another study [ [43](#B43-antibiotics-12-00541)] concluded that zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) could be synthesized using the aqueous extract of L. acidissima L. leaf. These nanoparticles restrict MTB development, and the microplate alamar blue method was used to validate this. Biogenic ZnO NPs have the potential to become an innovative drug component to treat TB. In another investigation by Murali et al., Zn NPs synthesized using Canthium dicoccum (L.) plants for antibacterial, anti-tubercular, and anti-oxidant action were validated [ [44](#B44-antibiotics-12-00541)]. According to this report, the synthesis of ZnO NPs using leaf extract from C. dicoccum (L.) was successful, resulting in pure nanoparticles within the desired size range. This was confirmed through the use of several techniques, including UV-Visible spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (X-RD). It was found that the Zn NPs exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-mycobacterial activity; the data suggest the vulnerability of tuberculosis strains to ZnO NPs [ [44](#B44-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Some plants have already been used for treating MTB infection using nanoparticles ( [Table 2](#antibiotics-12-00541-t002)) [ [45](#B45-antibiotics-12-00541)]. 6. Phytoproducts: An Emerging Alternative [63](#B63-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Researchers are working on alternate medications\u2014phytoproducts\u2014to avoid such side effects. [64](#B64-antibiotics-12-00541), [65](#B65-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [66](#B66-antibiotics-12-00541)]. There is an abundance of studies available in the literature regarding the biotherapeutic purposes of these metabolites that fall into different classes of compounds, such as flavonoids, carotenoids, indoles, isothiocyanates, monoterpenes, and phenolic acids [ [67](#B67-antibiotics-12-00541)]. The regimen of the cocktail of antibiotics administered for the treatment of TB is globally known as the \"Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS)\". Its severe toxicity and side effects are established [ [68](#B68-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Infection by MTB leads to suppression of the Th1 response, leading to reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines [ [69](#B69-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Due to the reduction in protective CD4+ T cell numbers and the side effects of DOTS therapy, patients are prone to reinfection and reactivation of infection [ [70](#B70-antibiotics-12-00541)]. The overall efficacy of the anti-tubercular treatment is increased by using anti-inflammatory drugs along with the standard regimen [ [71](#B71-antibiotics-12-00541)]. However, the long-term use of these drugs results in severe side effects, making such treatments inadvisable. Therefore, researchers are exploring molecules that can immunomodulate by selectively upregulating the Th1 response and simultaneously downregulating immune response [ [72](#B72-antibiotics-12-00541)]. [73](#B73-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Bergenin, a secondary metabolite found in different parts of several plants [ [74](#B74-antibiotics-12-00541)], induces Th1 and Th17 response and inhibits bacterial replication in murine models [ [75](#B75-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Further, co-treatment of bergenin and isoniazid reduces the immune damage caused by isoniazid while promoting the generation of long-lasting, central memory T-cell responses and reducing MTB clearance duration [ [76](#B76-antibiotics-12-00541)]. Similarly, silymarin isolated from Sylibym marianum seeds induces an elevated Th1 response in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains [ plant-based Rubiaceae species, which also act as anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents [ [78](#B78-antibiotics-12-00541)]. They may be used synergistically as adjuncts to DOTS as alternatives to steroids for managing inflammation. [79](#B79-antibiotics-12-00541)]. The basic mechanism of these photoproducts [Figure 3](#antibiotics-12-00541-f003), 7. Conclusions and Future Perspectives [115](#B115-antibiotics-12-00541)].
