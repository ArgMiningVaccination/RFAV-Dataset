In order to determine how long a vaccine remains effective we use a blood titer test to monitor if there are still circulating antibodies to the virus. While titer testing is not a perfect test of immunity (a pet may still have immunity from memory B cells even if circulating antibody levels are low or undetectable), it is still considered clinically relevant. By monitoring antibody levels every 1-2 years, we can determine when or if booster vaccination is necessary. Rabies vaccination is required by law in many municipal communities. Check with your local authorities for regulations regarding rabies vaccination and pet licensing in your area. If your pet has had a past vaccine reaction or has a chronic medical condition that may put them at risk of either a vaccine reaction or worsening of their clinical condition, our doctors may choose to write a vaccination waiver letter. This letter may be presented in lieu of vaccination requirements at boarding facilities or for licensing purposes, however it is up to the regulating authority on whether or not to accept it.
