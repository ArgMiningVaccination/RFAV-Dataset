All of the exercises on this list will increase the stability of your overall system, which assists the Triple Warmer Meridian in staying balanced and capable of doing its job of directing the immune system response to ward off foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. 5 things you can do right now to boost your immune system and increase stability and resiliency: 1. This ultimately boosts your immune system by keeping key components in balance, and creates resiliency in your energy systems so that you are less likely to catch viruses, and bounce back much more quickly if you do. 2. Do the Porcupine Reactivity Exercise by Begin by imagining you are grabbing energy out of the crown chakra at the top of your head with both hands, on the inhale pull up and out to the sides of your body, arms outstretched, exhaling your hands to the floor and imagining that you are now sending that energy down into the earth below your feet. On the next inhale do the opposite - grab the energy from the earth below your feet with both hands (use your imagination here), and with outstretched arms pull it back up, and on the exhale land it on the top of your head. You have just traced the taurus of your energy field, stabilizing the field as well as stabilizing the Triple Warmer Meridian (the main player in your immune response) and its reactive tendency. 3. Get grounded! Stand with feet firmly planted on the ground, preferably barefoot and on grass or dirt. Hold your hands to your sides, so that palms face the ground. Take 2-3 deep breaths and visualize sending your energy out your feet and down into the earth. This stabilizes your field and all the interwoven energy systems, as well as discharging stale, stagnant and toxic energy and bringing in fresh, nourishing energy. 4. Quick root chakra clearing - Hold your left hand with palm facing towards your body about four inches above your pubic bone. Make circles with your hand, going from left to right, for about 8 turns. Now switch hands, and while holding your right hand, palm facing your body about four inches above the pubic bone, make circles from right to left for about 8 turns. The root chakra has the important function of discharging toxic energies collected in the chakra system, and pulling in fresh energy from the earth to revitalize that system, as well as stabilizing your overall system by keeping you well connected to the earth's energy field. 5. Power Point to Sixth Chakra Hook-Up - Place one middle finger in the Power Point, the indentation at the base of the skull/top of the spine, and the other middle finger at the center of the brow. Push in firmly with both fingers, hold and breathe for about 1 min. This connects to the nervous system, and sinks the balancing and stabilizing effect of the other exercises into your system on a deeper level, as well as locking in the balance you've created by telling your body to \"stay here\"! Finally, follow all the basics of good health - reduce stress, eat good healthy foods, drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep, and exercise often!! All of these things keep your immune system in good shape by keeping your stress level down (ie, Triple Warmer Meridian in balance), flushing out toxins, and keeping the energy moving! 2 Comments 4/21/2022 05:24:36 pm I loved how you described the use of chakras in the porcupine reactivity exercise. I've been feeling really spiritually drained over the past few months with the pandemic. I'd love to find ways to help my energy become healed and whole again this summer.
