Echinacea is not a single herb but is actually a genus, or category, of nine herbaceous flowering plants that are commonly called coneflowers and are native to North America. The different species of echinacea, as well as their different parts (flower, roots, and extracts), have different uses and varying benefits. [Three species of Echinacea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6278270/)\u2014 E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida\u2014have been used for centuries by indigenous people of North America to treat respiratory tract infections, the common cold, coughs, bronchitis, and other illnesses. Studies have found that when used swiftly after the onset of cold or upper respiratory symptoms, some kinds of echinacea extracts can help [decrease the duration and severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15035888) of those symptoms. [Echinacea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6278270/) is well known for its immune-stimulating effects. [R](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6278270/) [esearch shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6278270/) the best results for boosting immune function come from the E. purpurea form of echinacea, prepared as a tincture. Echinacea also has [anti-inflammatory properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19107735), well as [antiviral and effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6278270/). [One study showed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4058675/) that some forms of echinacea extracts can be beneficial in the treatment of viral respiratory infections (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain). [Echinacea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26009695) also contains antioxidants, making it a powerful, protective, and strengthening remedy to include in your healing kit of cold and flu remedies. Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) is a popular natural remedy found in most holistic pharmacies, apothecaries, and health food stores. European settlers learned of goldenseal from Native American tribes, who used it [for the treatment of](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249784/) gastrointestinal (GI) issues, inflammation, urinary tract infections, and other infections. [Goldenseal](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/72/2/339/4729391) has also traditionally been used as an expectorant for common respiratory infections such as pneumonia and whooping cough. Try goldenseal as a tincture, tea, powder, or capsule. As always, be sure to check with your doctor or health care practitioner to ensure that goldenseal is a good option for you. Osha root (Ligusticum porteri) is a gnarled, dark-brown root that comes with a strong earthy, medicinal scent. It grows in the [Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3990316/) and has been used [by Native Americans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27854198) for many different symptoms and ailments. Fresh osha root was traditionally used by the Apache in ceremonial tobacco blends, as well as to soothe the throat and lungs, and to loosen phlegm in the chest. [Osha root](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-959/osha) is commonly used to treat sore throat, flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, the common cold, and other conditions. Once prepared, osha has a strong and spicy flavor that, when brewed into a tea, warms and soothes the throat as it goes down. [One study has found evidence that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27854198) osha root may strengthen immunity while also protecting against oxidative damage to cells. Try boiling chopped and washed osha root into a soothing tea. You can also take osha root in a capsule, or use it cured in a tincture. In 400 BCE, the Greek physician Hippocrates described the elderberry tree as his \" [medicine chest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3056848/).\" Many classical healers of this time considered the elderberry to be one of the most healing plants found in nature. Long before modern antibiotics were available, healers considered fresh elderberry an integral ingredient in any cold or flu remedy. The dark purple berry known as elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) is known for its immune-boosting benefits. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/) has found that elderberry can significantly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms. Additionally, [one study concluded](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11399518) that elderberry has antiviral properties, which can make it a beneficial addition to your cold and flu protocol. This study also found that those participants who took elderberry experienced a significant reduction in the duration of their flu symptoms. Try elderberry in a capsule, in a tea, in a syrup, or in a tincture. You may think of oregano simply as one of the herbs you use to flavor your spaghetti and pizza sauce or marinade meat dishes, but did you know that oregano is also a powerhouse immune booster? [Oregano](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6152729/) contains potent essential oils, which are known for their antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23484421) found that oregano oil is effective in fighting clinical strains of E. coli and P. aeruginosa bacteria, supporting the use of oregano oil in treating bacterial infections. The essential oil of oregano is most safely taken in a capsule, as the flavor is intense. When taken straight, one drop (even in water) may burn the back of your throat as the oil goes down. As with any essential oil, do not ingest directly. Try using one to two drops in a large pot of soup or stew for delicious flavor and an immunity strengthener. Alternatively, take oregano essential oil as a capsule or diffuse in an aromatherapy diffuser. Astragalus, a member of the legume family, was originally grown in Asia and is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. There are many [astragalus species](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6270929/) (approximately 2,000 to 3,000). This primary medicinal species most often used is called [astragalus membranaceus.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26916911) [Astragalus is rich in saponins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6438022/), a class of chemical compounds found in many plants, which are known for their [positive effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15117556) on the immune system. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22695229) suggests that astragalus increases immune response in white blood cells. Astragalus is most often administered as a tincture, capsule, or in whole, dried slices of root that can be added to soups or teas. The three primary ways to take the aforementioned roots and herbs are in the form of a brew, tincture, or distillation. To steep a strong herbal infusion, keep the lid on while simmering, stirring the herbs frequently. Steep medicinal herbs for approximately 15-20 minutes. Strain well and drink. Store herbal tea in a glass jar in the refrigerator. For optimal potency, keep the herbal infusion for no more than 24 hours. Most health food stores, herbal apothecaries, and natural pharmacies carry wide varieties of tinctures for various medicinal needs. Many tinctures are also available online for purchase. Tinctures are not regulated by the FDA. When using [essential oils](https://chopra.com/articles/4-aromatherapy-recipes-to-boost-your-immune-system), always start with small amounts to ensure you do not ingest or apply too much at once, which can lead to skin irritation or allergies. Try adding essential oils to a carrier oil (such as coconut oil) before applying directly to the skin. Most of these herbs are easy to grow in your own backyard, which is why cultivating your own herb garden can be very beneficial. By growing herbs yourself, you can rely on having fresh herbs when cooking soups and stews, as well as herbal remedies for preventive health care and when you're under the weather. The ones listed above are just a few options - there are so many other herbs you can also grow in your own backyard or windowsill Many of today's popular herbal remedies have been used for centuries to boost immunity, diminish symptoms and duration of colds and flus, and keep the body in an optimal state of health and well-being. Exploring what works best for you and your family while gathering what you will need to do so, can have a powerful impact on how you get through the most immune-challenging time of the year. *Editor's Note: The information in this article is intended for your educational use only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
