You're not imagining things. Brain health may decline with age. These tips can help preserve your cognitive abilities before problems arise. Have you noticed that your brain health is not as sharp as it once was since you've gotten older? If so, you're probably not imagining things. - Research shows that parts of your brain shrink as you age, especially the parts that control [memory](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/mental-health/mental-focus/short-term-memory-loss/), learning, an d other mental activities. - Additionally, communication between your brain cells may not be as effective. - The aging brain is also prone to decreased blood flow and increased inflammation. All of these factors can affect your mental function, even if you're otherwise healthy. The good news is that many elders retain their brain health well into their 80s and 90s, enjoying things like a more extensive vocabulary and learning new skills. The key is to start preserving your cognitive abilities while you are still young. In this guide, our holistic health experts weigh in on how to support your brain health naturally as you age. What Is Brain Health? Currently, there is no universal definition for brain health. However, the CDC defines brain health as the ability to perform all cognitive processes, including the ability to judge, learn, use language, and remember. Meanwhile, the WHO states that brain health is a state of cognitive functioning that allows a person to realize their full potential over the course of their life. This includes sensory, social-emotional, motor, and behavioral domains, as well as the absence or presence of brain disorders. Conditions that affect the brain may emerge throughout the course of one's life. They are characterized by brain growth disruptions, damage to the brain structure, or impaired brain functioning. These may present as neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders, including: - Autism spectrum disorders [Attention [HIV](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/hiv-symptoms/), - Neuromuscular disorders such as peripheral neuropathy, muscular dystrophies, and myasthenia gravis - Traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries - Cancers of the nervous system How Does TCM View Brain Health? In [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/traditional-chinese-medicine/), when qi (passive energy) and blood circulation are disrupted, it can generate Dampness, Phlegm, Qi Stagnation, and Blood Stasis in the meridian channels. Furthermore, it can also weaken the five vital organs (Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lungs, and Kidneys) and induce a deficiency of qi, Blood, and yang (active energy). These factors can interrupt the distribution of nutrients to the brain. \"A chronic Deficiency of the Heart, Kidney, and Spleen, Blood and Qi Stasis, and turbid Phlegm affecting the mind can aggravate one's risk of declining brain health.\" TCM Physician Kong Teck Chuan. How To Support Brain Health As You Age Though some degree of memory loss and declining brain health is inevitable as we age, you can keep your brain sharp with certain lifestyle changes. Some natural herbs, concoctions, and acupoints are believed to manage qi and blood circulation disruption, hence improving brain health. Stay mentally active and exercise regularly [Exercise](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/weight-and-fitness/fitness/sore-muscles-remedies/) increases blood flow to the brain, helping to keep your memory sharp. Aim to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercises, such as brisk walking or light jogging. Indulge in mentally stimulating activities such as crossword puzzles, sudoku, and jigsaw puzzles to keep your brain active. Learning a new musical instrument or picking a new hobby are also great ways to keep memory loss at bay.
