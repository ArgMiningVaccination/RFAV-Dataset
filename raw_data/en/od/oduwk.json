Our Patients Say it Best I first saw Denise Wiesner as I was having dreadful pain issues from having both knee replacement surgery, also carpel tunnel syndrome and pain of my right thumb. I had also just lost my husband and soul mate. I entered Denise's office not knowing what to expect and was greeted with such love, kindness, and respect it blew me away. I left Denise's office that day, pain free in my thumb which was unbelievable and I was also left with a feeling of, 'Yes, I can get on with my life.' Denise and her staff have helped me through hip and 2 redo's of previously bad knee surgeries. My health in general is really good - thanks to Denise and her vast knowledge of Chinese Medicine.-T.T. I came to Denise at a point in time when I was feeling hopeless, anxious, and overwhelmed with health problems. I had a cyst in my breast, one on my thyroid, and all-consuming anxiety about my health. My endocrinologist had advised me to undergo a complete removal of my thyroid to deal with the cyst, which was not cancerous. I was desperate and needed help, guidance, kindness, and a complete overhaul of my system so that I could get back on track. Denise helped me like a friend, a medical professional, and a spiritual guru in understanding my anxiety, my fears, and my health concerns. My breast cyst is now completely gone, according to my last MRI, and my thyroid cyst is shrinking every day. I feel calmer and better able to deal with the hurdles in life, and better equipped to be proactive about my health.-S.S. Introducing Beautycounter Skin Products!
