Consistent expression of HPV gene product E6 and E7 can be only found in cervical cancer but not normal cells. E6 and E7 are functionally required to cervical cancer phenotype. Cervical cancer is an ideal model for antigen-specific vaccination therapies. Applicant demonstrated that both recombinant DNA and vaccinia constructs containing LAMP-1-targeted E7 generate significantly enhanced E7-specific helper and CTL responses relative to vaccine constructs that contain wild-type E7. Both DNA and vaccinia recombinant vaccines employing sig-E7-LAMP-1 generate dramatically increased antitumor activity relative to E7 alone. RAID P roject Approved and Initiated 08/1999 DTP made cell bank of the LAMP-1 construct. Dr. Pardoll requested a change in the DNA plasmid based on new preclinical data in which the LAMP-1 portion was replaced with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). New construct: pNGVL4a-sig/E7(detox)/HSP70. RAID Project Re-Reviewed Due to Substantial Change to Project 02/2001 Dr. Pardoll presented data indicating that the E7/HSP70 construct produced strong E7- specific CD8 T -cell responses when administered either as a DNA , vaccinia, or DNA-DNA (prime -boost) regimen. This construct also produced strong antitumor immunity against E7-expressing TC-1 tumor either as a s.c. challenge or lung metastasis. Head-to-head comparisons of the LAMP-1 vs HSP70 indicated that the latter construct was more potent. The results of the re- review were for approval to proceed with the production of the pNGVL4a-sig/E7(detox)/HSP70. Production Work Commenced Spring 2001 DNA sequencing showed it contained an extraneous 36-amino acid tail. The plasmid for this construct was sent to the Biopharmaceutical Development Program (BDP). Based on review of the preclinical data generated at Johns Hopkins University and safety considerations (concern about the 36- amino acid tail), it was decided to proceed with the pNGVL4a- sig/E7(detox)/HSP70, which had a 7-amino acid tail similar to the pcDNA3 construct used by Dr . Wu in his published tumor protection experiments.NSC 723254 ............... RECEIVED FEBRUARY 1999 ............... IRB APPROVAL Q4 2003 ...............

The DNA vaccine effort was spearheaded by T .-C. Wu, M.D., Ph.D., and Drew Pardoll, Ph.D., researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. They focused on human papillomavirus-16 (HPV-16), a strain of HPV responsible for more than 20 percent of head and neck cancers and more than half of all cervical cancers.StepPlasmid Recovered (mg)S.C.
