Naturopathic medicine has been in practice in the United States since the 1800s. But, many of the practices and techniques used in naturopathic medicine have been in place for centuries. The goal of naturopathic primary care is to identify and treat the root cause of any illness rather than the symptoms a patient is presenting. Because of this goal, naturopathic medicine focuses on developing personalized care for the whole person - physical, mental, and emotional. Naturopaths combine natural healing practices such as herbal supplements, diet, and exercise with traditional practices such as laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging to develop individualized treatment plans. Treatment plans that focus on returning patients to optimal wellness. What Is a Naturopathic Primary Care Physician? Doctors of naturopathic medicine (ND) are trained as primary care providers and learn to treat all aspects of family health and wellness. Naturopaths receive similar training as medical doctors (MD) through a [four-year doctoral education](https://bastyrcenter.org/services/naturopathic-medicine/about-naturopathy). They also have additional education in nutrition, psychology, and complementary therapies such as herbal medicine and homeopathy. [A naturopath's goal is to correct any disturbances or imbalances in the body that are leading to other symptoms or illnesses. Imbalances such as poor diet, lack of exercise, or chronic stress. To correct identified imbalances, naturopath's begin by using the most minimally invasive techniques such as diet and lifestyle changes. They then progress to techniques that promote natural healing in the body. Naturopaths follow this course of treatment adding more strenuous or invasive therapies as needed to address a patient's underlying concerns. Pharmaceutical and surgical interventions are usually the last step. ](https://bareintegrativemedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/86262610_618474535365768_31935723250647040_n-scaled.jpg) In addition to traditional medical approaches, naturopaths can offer nutritional and lifestyle support to create a well-rounded approach to wellness. Naturopaths are also trained in potential drug/herb interactions and can support a patient in reviewing and manage prescription medications. Many patients seek a naturopath's care to reduce or eliminate unnecessary pharmaceutical use. A naturopath's goal when caring for you and your family is to identify the most beneficial and least harmful course of treatment. For naturopaths, natural remedies are complementary to traditional diagnostic techniques and treatments.
