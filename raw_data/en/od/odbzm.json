After pandemic situation oxygen and ozone level has been raised. Percentage of population get decreased and once again climate started smiling with bird's sound and animal's activities. No, doubt we have compromised our so many days at home for that, but sometimes its better to sacrifices some time to save our future. When universe revise itself to self-mode then why not us? Of course, we need to think about this seriously. What is immunity? Immunity is basically mechanism of our body to fight against any disease. Body does not allow any foreign body in its system. In case of virus or bacteria entered inside the body, our body mechanism started to fight against it in the form of antibodies. These antibodies are nothing but the important part of our immunity. No, doubt it depends upon so many things like lifestyle, Exercise, Metabolism, Mental status, proper diet and genetical conditions. This kind of immunity is of two types. 1. The innate (native) system in mammalians, for example, is composed of primitive bone marrow cells that are programmed to recognise foreign substances and to react. It is divided into two types: i. Non-Specific innate immunity, a degree of resistance to all infections in general. ii. Specific innate immunity, a resistance to a particular kind of microorganism only. As a result, some races, particular individuals or breeds in agriculture do not suffer from certain infectious diseases. 2. The adaptive system is composed of more advanced lymphatic cells that are programmed to recognise self-substances and not to react. Adaptive immunity can be sub-divided depending on how the immunity was introduced in i. 'naturally acquired' through chance contact with a disease-causing agent ii. 'artificially acquired' immunity develops through deliberate actions such as vaccination. Both naturally and artificially acquired immunity can be further subdivided depending on whether the host built up immunity itself by antigen as 'active immunity' and lasts long-term, sometimes lifelong. 'Passive immunity' is acquired through transfer (injection or infusion) of antibodies or activated T-cells from an immune host; it is short lived\u2014usually lasting only a few months.
