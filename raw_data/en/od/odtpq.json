It was an eye-opening experience, as she shared simple but powerful principles for attaining and maintaining a superhealthy body. One of the most important things in the workshop was that Donna fed us breakfast and lunch. We were able to taste and experience how delicious the fermented foods were. Everyone enjoyed her way of cooking and was delighted to take her recipes and probiotic nutrition home with them. I have been a follower ever since, and at 84 am enjoying vibrant health.
