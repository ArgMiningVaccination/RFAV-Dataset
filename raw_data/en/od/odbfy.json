PA Program Handbook Page 6 of 90 Institutional and Program Accreditation The PA Program Accreditation Process PA programs are accredited through the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). The initial process for accreditation is the granting of provisional accreditation status by the ARC-PA. Provisionally accredited programs are allowed to enroll and train PAs for practice, and graduates of provisionally accredited programs are eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination offered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA) and to attain state licensure. Successful completion of the NCCPA certification examination is required for state licensing and to practice as a certified physician assistant. Full accreditation status is only granted upon follow-up review by ARC-PA after the graduation of the first class. Accreditation is maintained through regular program self-assessment and review by the ARC-PA. The accreditation status of the Rush University PA Studies Program is public information and the program will make its accreditation status known to prospective applicants, students, and the general public through appropriate program publications, the program web site, or upon request. Rush PA Program Accreditation Status The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA) has granted Accreditation-Continued status to the Physician Assistant Studies Program sponsored by Rush University. Accreditation-Continued is an accreditation status granted when a currently accredited program is in compliance with the ARC-PA Standards. Accreditation remains in effect until the program closes or withdraws from the accreditation process or until accreditation is withdrawn for failure to comply with the Standards. The approximate date for the next validation review of the program by the ARC-PA will be March 2024. The review date is contingent upon continued compliance with the Accreditation Standards and ARC-PA policy. Rush University Accreditation Rush University has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (formerly the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Institutions of Higher Education) since 1974. The commission completed its most recent accreditation review in 2008, which granted the University continuing accreditation for 10 years. The next comprehensive HLC evaluation will occur in 2018-2019. Additionally, all training programs at Rush University that offer degrees in health care practice and/or administration are accredited by their respective governing body. PA Program Handbook Page 7 of 90 General Program Information Program Curriculum The PA Program offers a 30-month, entry-level, graduate curriculum, leading to a Master of Science (MS) in Physician Assistant Studies. The curriculum is divided into three components. Phase I of the program involves 12 months of didactic course work comprised of lectures, seminars, student laboratory, hands-on clinical learning experiences, and independent study. Phase II is the initial clinical portion of the program, consisting of: two, consecutive four-week rotations in Internal Medicine and General Surgery, one four-week rotation in Family Practice, Emergency Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Long Term Care medicine; and two, four-week elective rotations in an area of medical practice of the student's choice. Rotations are intensive, hands-on learning experiences where students apply the knowledge gained in the didactic year towards actual patient care. Clinical rotations may be at inpatient, outpatient, or a combination of clinical settings. While on rotation, students are expected to work a minimum of 40-hours per week and will participate in all assigned patient care activities, which may include taking call, admitting patients, managing patients in the hospital or clinic setting, and participating all scheduled learning activities, such as Grand Rounds. Phase III is the final portion of clinical training. It consists of six months of rotations in an advanced clinical setting, which will allow students to enhance their medical knowledge and patient care skills. Opportunities for advanced clinical rotations are continuously expanding; we currently offer rotations in a variety of areas in both medical and surgical practices. Similar to second year rotations, students are expected to work a minimum of 40 hours per week in various patient care activities as assigned and depending on the service, and to participate in all scheduled student learning activities. The sequencing and site placement of rotations is made at the sole discretion of the PA faculty. Faculty will try to accommodate requests for specific a specific rotation site or sequence, however, these are not guaranteed. We consider a 90-mile or 90-minute drive, without traffic, reasonable boundaries for site placement. More information regarding rotations is provided throughout the program. As part of the master's component of the curriculum, students are expected to become proficient in reviewing, analyzing, and applying current research literature towards effective clinical decision-making. Students are introduced to research and statistical methods in the first year of the program and research analysis skills are reinforced throughout the program. To document research competency, students develop a Master's Research Project, which reflects different aspects of research, and demonstrates competency in meeting various research benchmarks. For this project, students work with a faculty mentor to identify an issue of clinical interest, and create a research study proposal. Students conduct a literature review, formulate a research question, and create study methodology and assessment tools, including analysis of population database information, to investigate their research question. For the final component of the research project, students create and present their research proposal to members of the faculty. The primary goal of this project is to help students understand the components of research through the creation of their own unique research project. A secondary goal is to help students lay the groundwork for future research through the activities associated with the capstone project.

The following regulations are either programmatic additions to other University policies, or applications of University policies to the PA program. The policies in this handbook do not supplant any University or CHS policies. Students are advised to refer to the Rush University Catalog and Student Handbook for additional applicable policies where applicable. Academic Calendar Classes and activities during the first year of the program are scheduled in accordance with the Rush academic calendar. During the second and third years of the program, required rotation activities may not adhere to the posted academic calendar, so as to not disrupt clinical training. Regardless of year of the program, students must register for courses according to the posted Rush academic calendar. Students are expected to adhere to their appropriate schedule as assigned by the program. The program will provide the didactic and clinical year schedules to students as far in advance as possible. The University calendar is available here: Rush Office of the Registrar Academic Calendars Academic Performance - Standards and Progression in the Program The PA Program is committed to providing its students a high-quality education that produces exceptional clinicians. In order to maintain our high educational standards, we adhere to the following standards of academic performance throughout all phases of the curriculum: Grading Scale: 89.5 - 100 = A 79.5 - 89.4 = B 70 - 79.4 = C Below 70 = F Satisfactory Academic Performance Satisfactory performance is defined as passing each course and maintaining a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better at all times throughout the program. As a Master's level program, attaining grades of \"B\" or above in all courses is considered passing and maintaining satisfactory performance. Obtaining a final course grade of \"B\" or above in the following didactic courses is required without exception, and regardless of your overall GPA, in order to remain in satisfactory academic standing in the program: Required \"B\" Grade Courses: PHA 511 - Human Anatomy PHA 512 - History and Physical Examination PHA 514, PHA 524, and PHA 534 - Clinical Medicine I-III (respectively) PHA 522 and PHA 532 - Clinical Diagnostic Reasoning I & II (respectively) PA Program Handbook Page 26 of 90 PHA 520 and PHA 530 - Principle of Clinical Pharmacology I & II (respectively) During clinical years, student must obtain a passing grade in all rotation activities in order to remain in satisfactory academic standing in the program. Satisfactory academic performance also includes demonstration of ethical and professional behavior at all times. Students are expected to comply with the program's professionalism policy as set forth in this handbook (see PA Professionalism and Professional Behavior Policy, Page 53). Students are also expected to adhere to the student conduct standards and maintain academic honesty as set forth in the Rush University Student Honor Code (see Appendix B), the Rush Statement on Academic Honesty (see Appendix C), and the CHS Guide for Professional Conduct (see Appendix D). Students may progress through the program only if they maintain satisfactory professional conduct and academic performance at all times. Assessment of academic performance is done continuously throughout the program. Satisfactory academic progress is assessed through the successful completion of all course related work, curricular activities, and clinical rotations. In addition to all ongoing student assessment processes, at the end of each phase of the curriculum, there is a formal evaluation process to determine the student's eligibility to progress through the program, as well as to graduate at the end of 30 months. This process is known as the Formative Evaluation at the end of the first two phases, and the Summative Evaluation at the end of the third phase. (See Cumulative Competency Assessment, page 34, for more information.) Unsatisfactory Academic Performance Unsatisfactory performance is defined as meeting any of the following criteria: Failing to obtain a final grade of a \"B\" in required didactic courses Failing to obtain a \"pass\" grade assessment in any clinical rotation activity Failing to attain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 at the end of each term throughout the program Failing to maintain an overall cumulative 3.0 GPA Failing to satisfactorily pass any component of any cumulative competency assessment activity Failing to comply with either the Program's or the University's professionalism and ethical conduct standards. The following is an outline of actions taken if a student fails to make satisfactory academic progress during the program: 1. At the initial indication of a performance issue, the student will receive a notice of academic concern (see Academic Concern and Probation, page 29). This indicates that the student has performance concerns requiring additional evaluation, intervention, and monitoring. The program faculty will convene its Progress and Promotions Committee (see Progress and Promotions Committee, page 46) to determine appropriate action. If the performance issue resolves without incidence, no further action is taken. 2. If a student has ongoing performance issues or fails to maintain satisfactory academic performance, they will be placed on academic probation, and the faculty will convene its Progress and Promotion Committee to determine further action. Academic probation means the student has a significant, serious, and ongoing issue related to maintaining the program's expected performance standards, and ongoing remediation (see Remediation, page 47) efforts are necessary to help the student meet the expected level of performance. If a student is placed on probation, they must demonstrate the capacity to consistently meet program performance standards in order to be removed from academic probation and progress through the program. PA Program Handbook Page 27 of 90 3. If a student is on academic probation and their performance issue(s) is ongoing and unresolved despite reasonable remediation efforts, the student may be denied permission to progress, and may be subject to dismissal from the program. 4. If a student has an egregious lapse in academic or professional performance, they may be placed immediately on probation for remediation, regardless of prior academic performance or cumulative GPA. If severe, a student may be denied permission to progress, and may be subject to dismissal from the program without opportunity for remediation, regardless of prior academic performance or cumulative GPA.. The faculty and program Progress and Promotion Committee will evaluate these on a case-by-case basis. For more information regarding University and CHS dismissal policies, refer to the Student Academic Appeal and Grievance Procedures policies in the 2017-2018 Rush University Catalog, available at the Office of the Registrar Website. The following are additional definitions and criteria regarding unsatisfactory academic performance: If the faculty determines that a student has failed to maintain satisfactory academic performance at any point during the curriculum, the student will receive a notice of academic concern and the Progress and Promotions Committee will be convened to determine further action. Any student at risk for receiving a final grade of below a \"B\" in any course or clinical rotation will receive a notice of academic warning, and may receive a notice of academic concern pending successful passing performance in all courses. A student is at risk for dismissal from the program, regardless of their prior performance evaluation and/or cumulative GPA, if any of the following occurs: o Their term GPA falls below a 3.0 o They receive a final course grade of \"F\" in any course o They receive a final course grade below a \"B\" in Anatomy, Clinical Medicine, History and Physical Examination, Pharmacology, Diagnostic Reasoning, or any clinical rotation. o They fail to receive a passing grade in any clinical rotation activity A student is at risk for dismissal from the program, regardless of their prior performance evaluation and/or cumulative GPA, if they violate any of the following: the PA Program's Professionalism and Professional Behavior Policy; the Rush academic honesty policy; the Rush Student Honor Code: or the Rush drug free school and workplace policy. If a student has an overall GPA above a 3.0, and receives a final course grade of \"C\" in a course other than the required \"B\" grade courses, at the first occurrence, they will receive a notice of academic concern regarding unsatisfactory academic performance. If a student has an overall GPA above a 3.0 and receives a second final course grade of \"C\" at any time during the program, they are subject to dismissal from the program, regardless of their prior performance evaluation and/or cumulative GPA in the program. If a student receives a final course grade below a \"B\" in Anatomy, Clinical Medicine, History and Physical Examination, Pharmacology, Diagnostic Reasoning, or fails to receive a passing evaluation any clinical rotation activity, they will be placed directly on academic probation, regardless of their prior performance evaluation and/or cumulative GPA. The student must remediate the course for a final grade of \"B\" or higher before progressing in the program. Failure to successfully remediate the course places the student at jeopardy for dismissal from the program. Failing more than one examination in a given course, or failing examinations in more than one course per term, constitutes unsatisfactory performance and the student will receive a PA Program Handbook Page 28 of 90 notice of academic concern, and may be directly placed on academic probation regardless of their prior academic performance, final course grade, or cumulative GPA. If a student fails an end-of-rotation exam, the student will be remediated and allowed to re-take the exam for a passing exam grade. If the student fails the re-take examination, or if a student fails more than two end-of-rotation examinations during either clinical phase of the program, they may be placed on academic probation, and may denied permission to continue through clinical rotations. Refer to the Clinical Year Handbooks for more information regarding grading and performance standards in Clinical Phases I & II of the program. If any of the above conditions occur, the Progress and Promotions Committee will be convened to determine further action. PA students are expected to maintain all academic and professional performance standards at all times. The faculty will make every effort to identify, assist, and remediate students who demonstrate difficulties in attaining expected performance standards. If all usual and reasonable remediation efforts, as outlined in this handbook, are exhausted and the student is still unable to maintain satisfactory academic performance, the recommendation will be made to dismiss the student from the program, regardless of prior academic performance, final course grade, or cumulative GPA. Students are continuously evaluated regarding their professionalism and ethical conduct by the PA faculty and staff on a pass/fail basis. Students are advised if lapses in professionalism occur, and recommendations will be made to help the student meet the expectations of PA professionalism. For more information regarding the process of professionalism evaluation, refer to the sections Professionalism and Professional Behavior, page 45, the PA Professionalism and Professional Behavior Policy, page 53, and the Professionalism Assessment form (Appendix G, page 68) in this handbook. Failure to conduct oneself in a consistently professional manner, despite remediation and counseling, or having a single, egregious lapse of professionalism, constitutes unsatisfactory academic progress, regardless of the student's course grades or grade point average. The student will receive a notice of academic concern, and may be placed directly on academic probation, and subject to dismissal from the program. Placement on academic probation for professional and/or ethical misconduct will result in convening the Progress and Promotions Committee to determine further action. For more information regarding University policies on academic honesty and student conduct, refer to Appendix C, and the Academic Resources and Polices in the University Student Handbook. Program Dismissal A recommendation for dismissal from the program may be made if a student consistently fails to demonstrate the ability to sustain the academic and/or professional performance standards of the program. This determination is taken very seriously and is done in accordance with our obligation to maintain the standards of the profession and the public's safety. Specifically, a recommendation for dismissal from the program may be made under the following circumstances: If a student is unable to maintain expected academic performance despite reasonable remediation, training, and counseling, including, but is not limited to, failing multiple examinations, failing a remediation activity, failing a preceptor evaluation, or failing to comply with professionalism standards. If a student fails other coursework while on academic probation PA Program Handbook Page 29 of 90 If the student has an egregious lapse in either academic or professional performance, or violates Rush policy regarding conduct and behavior Additionally, if a student who was on academic probation successfully remediates and is removed from probation has a subsequent incident of unsatisfactory academic performance, a recommendation for dismissal from the program may be made without further opportunity for remediation. For more information regarding University dismissal policies, refer to the Academic Appeals and Rules of Governance policies provided in the Rush University Catalog, available at the Office of the Registrar Website. Academic Concern and Probation Receiving a notification of academic concern indicates that the student did not meet a standard of satisfactory academic performance (see Satisfactory Academic Performance, page 25) and requires supplemental training and evaluation, referred to in the program as remediation, to assure proficiency in attaining the program's expected standard of satisfactory performance. If the student is successful in their remediation efforts, no further action is taken. If a student repeatedly fails to meet the standards for satisfactory academic performance, they will be placed on academic probation. A student may also be placed directly on academic probation for an egregious lapse in academic or professional performance. Being placed on academic probation indicates that the student requires remediation in order to meet and sustain the program's expected standard of satisfactory performance. Probation will be removed, at a time deemed appropriate by the faculty, once the student demonstrates the ability to consistently meet the program's expected performance standards. Failure to improve performance, despite remediation, supplemental training, and counseling, or failure to sustain satisfactory academic performance while on or once off probation, constitutes unsatisfactory program performance, and may result in a recommendation for dismissal from the program. A student will receive written notification of their status of either academic concern or academic probation, which is part of the student's program record. Receiving a program notice of either academic concern or probation does not reflect on the student's Rush University transcript. Upon receipt of the notice, the student must meet with their academic advisor as soon as possible to identify challenges and discuss possible remediation solutions to the performance challenge. The faculty will convene the PA Progress and Promotions Committee to consider a plan of remediation. At this meeting, the student's faculty advisor serves as their advocate. The Committee may request to meet with the student as well, at the committee member's discretion, to discuss and identify an appropriate plan for remediation. Recommendations for remediation are at the discretion of the Progress and Promotions Committee, and may include, but is not limited to, additional course material review assignments, additional testing of course material, recommendation to student counseling, or referral to a student testing center for further evaluation. Remediation must be completed within the time frame designated by the Progress and Promotions Committee. Depending on the situation, remediation may not be offered, and at the sole discretion of the Progress and Promotions Committee. If a student is on probation, a successful remediation effort will result in the student being taken off academic probation (at a time deemed appropriate by the faculty) and written notification of the change in academic standing placed in the student's program record. A student cannot progress from the academic to the clinical year while on probation. PA Program Handbook Page 30 of 90 If the student fails a remediation or is unable to maintain expected academic performance despite additional training and counseling, or if the student fails other coursework while on academic probation, a recommendation for dismissal from the program will be made to the Program Director. If a student successfully remediates and is removed from probation, then has a subsequent incident of unsatisfactory academic performance, a recommendation for dismissal from the program will be made, without further opportunity for remediation. Reversal of the status of academic probation is at the discretion of the PA Program and the Progress and Promotion Committee. Academic probation remains in effect until the student receives official notification in writing from the Program Director of a change to student in good academic standing in the program. Students may not progress through the program while on academic probation. Advanced Academic Standing Attendance in the program is on a full-time basis only. Students entering the PA program must complete the curriculum in its entirety. Advanced standing or transfer credit is not awarded in the program, regardless of previous professional or academic experience. Advising Each student is assigned a PA faculty advisor. During the first year of the program, students are expected to meet with their advisor for routine advising once each term. During the clinical phases of the program, students meet with their advisor at minimum once a term. Students may request to meet with their advisors as often as needed. Routine advising discussions focuses on two areas - review of the student's academic progress and counseling on professional development. Advisors are also a resource for exploring issues regarding rotations and to explore employment strategies following graduation. Either the student or the faculty advisor may initiate advising sessions. Students must comply with faculty requests to meet with their advisor in a timely manner. If a student has challenges maintaining acceptable academic performance during the program, the advisor is the student's primary resource for guidance and assistance. The advisor will work with the student to identify potential sources of academic difficulty and will assist the student in overcoming those difficulties. Advising may entail referral to other counseling and support services available through the University. Attendance Attendance and punctuality to all program related activities is expected of all students. Class attendance and punctuality are criteria within the standards of professional behavior (see PA Professional Behavior Policy, page 53). Both the volume and the pace of instruction in the program require attendance in all classes for academic success. Students are expected to arrive on time for all class activities. If lateness is unavoidable, enter the room quietly. Disruptions to class due to late arrival will not be tolerated and is considered a violation of professionalism. During the academic year, if a student must miss class due to illness or other unexpected event, the absence will be excused if reasonable effort is made to notify the program in an appropriate manner prior to the absence. If the absence involves only one class, the student should notify the appropriate Course Director before the beginning of class. If the student must miss more PA Program Handbook Page 31 of 90 than one class in a given day, the student should notify the Director of Academic Education before the start of the class day. Notification may either be by phone or email, and should include the nature of the problem and the expected number of classes to be missed. The Director of Academic Education will notify the rest of the faculty of the student's absence and accommodations may be made to provide the student with lecture information. If the absence is due to an unavoidable prescheduled event, the student is to notify the faculty as far in advance of the event as possible. If a student requires more than one day's absence due to illness or other unexpected event, they must contact the Program Director at the first possible opportunity to determine reasonable arrangements for missed classes. Documentation of cause requiring time-off is required for all extended absences, or absences occurring during examinations. Repeated absence and/or late arrival to class is unacceptable. In addition to violating the PA program's professionalism policy, each course has specific attendance requirements. Failure to adhere to the attendance policies of a course will result in percentage point deductions from the course grade, regardless of any other performance indicators in the course. For rotations, students should adhere to the policies presented in the appropriate clinical year handbook. In general, there are no excused absences from clinical practice. Each clinical rotation has a requisite number of mandatory clinical hours, as determined by the preceptor and/or the PA Program faculty. Students are required to adhere to their rotation start and end dates, and complete all required clinical hours during their assigned rotation block. Any student not completing the required clinical hours during a given rotation will not receive a passing grade for that rotation. If a student must take time off during a clinical rotation, the student must notify both the program and the preceptor, and that time must be made up within a reasonable timeframe, at the discretion of the clinical preceptor, and according to the protocol described in the clinical handbook. Clinical preceptors are not required to allow a student to make up missed days, and may do so at their discretion. If clinical absences are not made up, the student is subject to failing that rotation and being placed on academic probation. Students are expected to be prompt and arrive on time to all clinical rotations. Tardiness to rotation hampers all student assignments made for that clinical day. If assignments cannot be arranged because of lateness, the student may be required to make-up his/her tardiness with a full clinical day. Any student exceeding two (2) late arrivals or absences from any one rotation is subject to failing the rotation, regardless of other rotation performance, and may be subject to dismissal from the program. Religious Holiday Time Off Students requesting time off from the proscribed attendance schedule for religious holidays should inform the Program Director of the need as soon as possible upon admission to the program, and provide a schedule of religious holiday time off needs at the beginning of each academic year. Class and Clinical Hours The faculty consider 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday as available class time. Students should plan their schedule accordingly. Making personal appoints during normal class hours is strongly discouraged. Students who must miss class for any reason must obtain approval in advance (see Attendance, page 30) The faculty make every to provide students with an accurate schedule of classes, however, changes occur frequently in the schedule. Many of the lecturers are clinicians with busy practices. Occasionally, the responsibilities of patient care take precedence over lecturing, PA Program Handbook Page 32 of 90 necessitating changes to the lecture schedule. Rescheduling lectures may require adding classes to empty times in the schedule; therefore, not all unscheduled time is \"free time\". While every effort will be made to minimize schedule changes, the program requests that students BE FLEXIBLE regarding the class schedule! Refer to Attendance section above (page 30) regarding requests for time off before scheduling any other activities during scheduled class time. Throughout the program, course related activities may occur during non-class hours and off the main campus. These activities include occasional weekends and evenings, and may require additional travel time as well. If the activity involves the entire class, the dates and times will be posted on the class schedule and details for these activities will be presented at the start of the relevant term. If the activity involves individual or small groups of students, information regarding scheduling and other details will be provided as appropriate. If a student has a schedule conflict with any course activity, they must notify the appropriate Director of Academic or Clinical Education as soon as possible to request an excused absence and arrange a makeup session. However, not all academic activities can be made up. As a PA student, attendance at course activities has priority over personal activities. During the clinical portions of the curriculum, there are no set rotation hours. Students are expected to adhere to the clinical schedule set forth by their preceptor and to participate in all required clinical activities, which may include working nights, weekends, holidays, and during breaks. Students are expected to provide their own transportation to all clinical training sites. Class Officers The Class Officers for each class take on addition roles and responsibilities among the class group, between classes in the PA Program, and in interactions with the larger community both at Rush and beyond. The members of the class elect their Class Officers annually during the summer term. Most officer roles continue through the duration of the program. A full list of the Class Officers, their roles and responsibilities, and the terms of participation are discussed each Summer term in PHA 513 - PA Professionalism and Practice I. Any student who wishes to hold an officer position must be in good academic standing and passing all coursework at the time of elections, and for the duration of the program. In the event a class officer is unable to maintain their duties and responsibilities, the vacant seat will be filled in a manner deemed appropriate by the remaining officers and the program's Student Government faculty advisor. Clinical Rotation Assignments All clinical rotations will be assigned based on clinician availability and the student's academic performance. Details regarding clinical rotation assignments will be discussed by the Director of Clinical Education and are in the Clinical Handbook. Community Service Rush and the PA Program are committed to providing service to our community, as set forth in our Mission Statements. Throughout the program, students are expected to develop and participate in various community service activities in the University and throughout the Chicago area. The College of Health Science requires all students document completion of at least eight (8) contact hours per year of approved community and/or professional service activities. PA Program Handbook Page 33 of 90 Examples of activities that may be used to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to: participation in community health fairs or other community screening, and/or service events; participation in approved professional service and/or continuing education activities; participation in PA Program admissions recruitment or other promotional activities; assistance with the delivery of seminars, lectures, workshops and related community or professional education activities. In addition to Rush and PA Program sponsored service activities, students may participate in various medically oriented events in the Chicagoland area. Note the following criteria regarding participation in service activities: Participation in any service activity must not conflict with class or other program related activities. Requests for time off from class or rotation to participate in service activities are not permitted. For all activities not sponsored by Rush or the PA Program, students should notify the program and obtain approval to participate from the Faculty Advisor for Student Activities, prior to attending the event itself. For every service event, students should complete and submit a PA Program Professional and Service Documentation Log (see Appendix E, page 64) form. This form must be submitted within 2 weeks of completion of the service activity. Students will not receive credit for their service activity if the forms are not submitted in a timely manner. The Service Documentation Log requires two signatures. The approval signature is by the Faculty Advisor for Student Activities. This signature can be obtained at any time. The verification of participation is signed by either the Faculty Advisor for Student Activities, for Rush related activities, or the person supervising the student at a non-Rush related event. This signature should be obtained at the time of the activity itself. All questions regarding the service requirement should be directed to the Faculty Advisor for Student Activities. Copyright and Use of Materials Educational materials are distributed by the PA Program on a regular basis. These materials include, but are not limited to, course syllabi and other informational materials, lecture handouts, readings, examination materials, and learning assignments. All program materials are protected under state and federal copyright law. The materials provided by the program are for students' personal study purposes only. Copying, sharing, or distributing the materials in any manner without specific and express approval of the author and/or course director is considered an act of academic dishonesty and a violation of Rush's Academic Honesty and Student Conduct policy. This includes sharing electronic or print copies of the materials or posting materials on to websites. Students who fail to comply with this standard are liable for copyright infringement and subject to disciplinary action. Course Evaluation Procedures Evaluations for each course take place at the end of every term or rotation. Additionally, students are asked to evaluate individual guest speakers throughout all phases of the program. Student evaluations provide the program with valuable information regarding its performance, and help the faculty improve the program. Course evaluations are administered through the CHS Dean's Office using the IDEA Survey tool. Individual speaker evaluations may be administered through various platforms of the faculty choosing. Preceptor evaluations are done through the program's clinical rotation management system. PA Program Handbook Page 34 of 90 Participation in evaluation activities is part of professionalism and completion of course evaluations is an expected requirement of all students. In order to meet course and clinical rotation requirements, students are expected to complete all course, instructor, and preceptor evaluations, in a timely manner and as directed, in a professional, honest, and constructive manner. All students will be evaluated on an ongoing basis for compliance with the course evaluation requirement. An evaluation compliance report will be generated every six months to evaluate student compliance with this requirement. Compliance reports to faculty will only identify student response rates and will not contain information regarding the content of student evaluations. Students who do not complete at least 80% of their evaluations will be asked to complete all outstanding evaluations. Failure to meet the 80% compliance standard more than once constitutes a violation of professionalism and the student will be referred to the program's P&P Committee for further action. Repeated non-compliance with this standard constitutes an egregious lapse of professionalism, regardless of the student's overall GPA or standing in the program. Course Sequencing and Deceleration Students in the PA program are required to register for and complete all courses in the PA curriculum as posted and must take them as a cohort in the prescribed sequence. There is no mechanism for part-time attendance in the program. Failure to comply is cause for dismissal from the PA Program. During clinical years of the program, although rotations do not follow the academic calendar, student must still register according to the Rush academic calendar schedule. Information regarding course registration deadlines is sent via e-mail from the Office of the Registrar. Failure to register in a timely manner may result in additional registration costs, and may hinder a student's ability to progress through rotations. Students must attend clinical rotations as assigned, and must complete all clinical work within the program's proscribed rotation schedule. Under extraordinary circumstances, a student may require deviation from the proscribed course sequence, while still remaining in good standing in the program. This is known as deceleration. Requests for deceleration are considered on a case-by-case basis and are granted at the sole discretion of the Program Director. Course Syllabus and Other Learning Materials The faculty will provide students with a syllabus and other relevant materials related to each course at the beginning of the term via Blackboard, the University online learning platform. The syllabus provides information regarding the course goals and objectives, teaching methods, lecture topics, required readings, lecture learning objectives, and grading criteria. The Course Director identified in the syllabus is responsible for covering course topics or assigning self-study related to course content. The Course Director is the final arbiter in all matters concerning course grading. Lecture and learning materials are distributed at the discretion of the Course Director and lecturers. PA Program Handbook Page 35 of 90 Cumulative Competency Assessment At the end of each year, students are cumulatively evaluated for their eligibility to progress to the next stage of the program. Assessment Process Overview The Formative Evaluation process determines the students' eligibility to progress through each phase of the program. The Summative Evaluation process determines the students' eligibility to graduate from the program. The PA faculty conducts both the Formative and Summative evaluations. Both evaluations assess the following areas of student competency: Academic performance Clinical skills development - e.g., physical examination skills, clinical procedures, etc. Knowledge and skills integration Research activities Community service participation Professionalism The competencies and skills students are expected to acquire during their training at Rush are identified in the Terminal PA Program Learning Competencies (Appendix J, page 77) and PA Program Graduate Functions and Tasks (Appendix K, page 78). In both the Formative and Summative Evaluations, the student's advisor serves as the primary attester to the student's progress through the program, although all interactions between the student with the faculty and/or the administration are considered in the process. Only students in satisfactory academic standing are evaluated for progression. Any student on Academic Probation at the end of the academic year is not eligible for progression until remediation is successfully completed. If the student is successful in the remediation, he/she is evaluated as outlined in this section. In addition to all curricular academic and/or clinical assessment activities, additional, standardized assessment activities will be used to assess cumulative competency and acquisition of required patient management skills. Examples of additional assessment methods includes, but are not limited to, standardized patient management testing, such as objective structured clinical examination (see OSCE, below), standardized assessment examinations, and standardized clinical skills assessments. A copy of the forms used to conduct the Formative and Summative evaluations is attached as Appendix F (page 65). The Formative Evaluation The first formative evaluation takes place at the end of the didactic year to determine a student's eligibility to progress to the clinical year. Assessment of student eligibility is based on the direct, observed, or reported interactions of the student with core faculty, adjunct and guest instructors, and the administrative staff throughout the didactic year. The following definitions are used to describe progression eligibility: 1) Eligible to progress to clinical rotations without reservation; 2) Eligible to progress to clinical rotations with areas of concern, or for improvement; 3) Ineligible to progress to clinical rotations. PA Program Handbook Page 36 of 90 The second formative evaluation takes place at the end of the second phase of training, to determine a student's eligibility to progress to the advanced training portion of the curriculum. Assessment of student eligibility to progress to Phase III training is based on direct, observed, or reported interactions of the student with the preceptors and their staff, and the PA faculty throughout the clinical year. The following definitions are used to describe progression eligibility: 1) Eligible to progress to advanced clinical rotations without reservation; 2) Eligible to progress to advanced clinical rotations with areas of concern, or for improvement; 3) Ineligible to progress to advanced clinical training. All students are counseled regarding the findings of the evaluation. If areas for improvement are identified, the student will be advised of the recommendations prior to starting rotations and monitored for progress throughout the clinical year. If the student is judged to be ineligible for progress, the Progress and Promotions Committee will be convened for further evaluation and remediation recommendation. The Summative Evaluation The summative evaluation for eligibility to graduate takes place at the end of the advanced clinical year (Phase III). Eligibility is based on performance on a global evaluation of the student's skills and knowledge at the end of the program, as well as review of the direct, observed, or reported interactions of the student with the core faculty, preceptors, and their staff. For the clinical year summation, students are considered eligible for graduation only if the faculty recommendation is without reservation. Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) Evaluating the student's clinical knowledge base, skills integration, and patient assessment and management capacity is a critical component of the formative evaluation process. The program uses a standardized patient evaluation format known as Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to assess competence in these areas. The OSCE evaluates the student's competency in the following: communication skills, history and physical assessment, diagnostic evaluation capacity, and therapeutic management development. The OSCE requires the student demonstrate his/her global mastery and synthesis of materials in each year of the program. The OSCE will be administered at the end of the didactic year and during the Phase II and III clinical rotations. Students are expected to score above the minimal proficiency cut score established by the program for the exam. Failure to score above the minimal score set for the exam indicates the student has a serious deficit of required patient management capacity and clinical knowledge. If a student does not pass the exam, he/she will have an opportunity to remediate and re-take the exam for a satisfactory performance score. Failure to successfully attain the minimal proficiency OSCE constitutes grossly unsatisfactory academic performance and the student may be recommended for dismissal from the program, regardless of their previous performance evaluations or cumulative GPA in the program. PA Program Handbook Page 37 of 90 OSCE Remediation The OSCE is a high-stakes examination in the program, passing performance is required to progress through the curriculum, and to progress to the next phase of the program. Students must successfully pass the OSCE evaluation in order to demonstrate they have sufficient skills to practice professionally and to care for patients. Failure to demonstrate sufficient knowledge and skills to pass the OSCE evaluation constitutes gross deficit in ability to effectively care of patients, regardless of previous examination performance, preceptor feedback, or cumulative GPA. If a student fails the OSCE evaluation, they must remediate the exam in order to progress to the next phase of the program. Due to the methods required of an OSCE evaluation, remediation may entail additional monetary costs, which students are responsible to cover. In addition to the cost of the retesting itself, the students requiring remediation will also be responsible to conduct themselves to the examination site. Additionally, students requiring remediation may be required to forfeit their scheduled break or vacation to accommodate remediation activities. Details regarding the timing and cost of remediation will be discussed on an as needed basis. Discrimination and/or Harassment of Students Rush has a long-standing commitment to preventing harassment of any type in the institution, and the PA Program has a zero-tolerance stance towards acts of discrimination by or towards any of its students. The program strictly adheres to the University's policies on the reporting and handling of any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to its students. Under these policies and procedures, violations occurring under any of the following categories: harassment of a sexual nature, as well as harassment related to age, ancestry, color, disability as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, gender, gender identity and/or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran's status, or any other category protected by federal or state law, is prohibited. The Rush policies include protections for, and prohibit retaliation against, an individual making a complaint or supplying information about a complaint. They also incorporate protections for a person who considers him- or her-self accused in bad faith. Any concerns, inquiries, or complaints of harassment from students, residents, or faculty members should be reported to the PA program faculty. Students may also contact the Office for Equal Opportunity directly at: (312) 942-7093. Per University policy, all complaints will be handled through the Office for Equal Opportunity, available at: http://www.rushu.rush.edu/equal-opportunity-disability-rights-and-accessibility/office-equal-opportunity. The Rush policy on harassment and/or discrimination, and is located here: https://www.rushu.rush.edu/sites/default/files/_Rush%20PDFs%20and%20Files/sexual-harassment-policy-2014.pdf Electronic Devices in Class While students typically carry mobile phones and other electronic communications devices, use of such devices must not interfere with class activity. All mobile phones, pagers, iPads, etc., must be either shut off or the ringer silenced during class. Disruption to class activity due to these devices is not tolerated. Students may not disrupt class to respond to messages except during emergencies. Disrupting class for personal communications is considered a violation of professionalism. PA Program Handbook Page 38 of 90 The use of portable computers in the classroom should be for note taking related to the current course topic only. Students should ensure their note taking activities are not disruptive to their classmates. Students should refrain from web surfing, texting, instant messaging, or emailing during class. Students who use computers during class for any purpose other than the course work being given may be asked to discontinue his/her computer connection. Recurrent violation of this policy constitutes a violation of professionalism. Emergency Communication In an emergency, if anyone outside the University needs to reach a student, they should call the program administrator, Anthony Coleman, at (312) 942-1857. The program staff will attempt to forward a message to the student. The program does not give out student contact or location information to anyone, regardless of circumstances, without prior written permission from the student. Emergent communication between the Program and students after class hours is by email. Students are expected to check their email at least once a day for notices such as class cancellations or other announcements during non-class hours. End of Rotation Examinations The PA Program utilizes the end-of-rotation examinations provided by the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA). These exams are validated test instruments and are regularly updated for currency and accuracy. Many programs throughout the nation utilize this resource to assess student knowledge at the end of rotation evaluations. The exam is only available on an electronic platform. Students are expected to adhere to all program examination procedures and policies when taking this exam. Details regarding clinical examinations and other performance assessment tools during rotations is available in the program's respective year Clinical Handbook. Examination Procedures and Policies The primary mechanism of student assessment throughout the program is written testing of course material. Note the following policies regarding the program's testing procedures: Taking Exams: \u00a7 For paper exams, only pencils are allowed at the desk. The program will provide calculators if needed. Students may not have food or drink at their work area during exams. \u00a7 For electronic exams, only a pen or pencil is allowed. The program will provide scratch paper and calculators if needed. Food or drink is not allowed during exams. You must leave your scratch paper with the exam proctor prior to exiting the exam. \u00a7 The use of programmable calculators, cell phone calculators, or any other electronic device is prohibited during an exam. \u00a7 All books and notes must be secured and be placed away from the student at either at the front or rear of the examination room for the duration of the exam. \u00a7 Students are expected to work without taking breaks during exams. Except in cases of emergency, only one student at a time is allowed, with the exam proctor's permission, to leave the room for any reason during an exam. If you need to leave the room during an exam, indicate so quietly to the proctor and wait to be acknowledged before leaving the room. \u00a7 Proctors will not answer questions related to understanding or interpreting exam material. Questions regarding the meaning or wording of questions will be disregarded. \u00a7 Proctors will address technical issues with exam. Students should notify the proctor if there is a problem with the exam, such as missing pages, item numbers out of sequence, or illegibility. PA Program Handbook Page 39 of 90 \u00a7 Upon completing an exam, unless otherwise instructed, students must exit the exam room quietly and with minimal disruption to the remaining test takers. Scoring Exams: \u00a7 Paper exams are computer-scored, unless otherwise indicated, using Scantron forms. Students should ensure the correct and accurate completion of the Scantron form before submitting their exams for scoring. \u00a7 Paper exams, the only responses accepted for test scoring are those indicated on the Scantron form. Responses indicated in the test sheet/booklet are not acceptable. \u00a7 If a student neglects to, or incorrectly fills in, an answer on Scantron form, it will be marked as incorrect and no credit given, even if it is correctly recorded in the test booklet. \u00a7 Electronic exams are scored via the test platform. As with paper exams, the exam is scored based on the student's entered responses. If a student neglects to, or incorrectly fills in, an answer on the exam, it will be marked as entered, even if the student completed the response in error. Multiple Component Exams: \u00a7 Due to the pace of instruction and the amount of material covered in a given subject, a single exam may cover multiple topics. \u00a7 For those examinations whose content reflects material related to more than one distinct unit, students must pass the exam with an overall grade of 70% or above, AND must pass each component separately with a grade of 70% or above, in order to pass the exam. \u00a7 The grade for the exam is based on the performance on the test as a whole. \u00a7 If the student fails to pass a topic within the exam, regardless of the total exam score, they must remediate the topic material in order to continue in the course. See Failed Exams, below, for procedures regarding remediation. Missed Exams: \u00a7 Except in cases of illness or emergency, the student must provide the Course Director at least one-week advance notice if requesting to take an exam at a date other than as scheduled. Requests to defer exams are granted at the sole discretion of the Course Director. \u00a7 If a student must miss an exam due to illness or other unforeseen catastrophic event, they must notify either the Course Director and the Director of Academic Education of the absence at the earliest possible time in advance of the exam start time. The student will be asked to provide documentation for the absence, in the form of a clinical evaluation note for illness, or other paperwork as indicated. \u00a7 Students may notify the program of absence from an exam either by phone or email. If the Course Director or Director of Academic Education is not available by phone, the student should leave a voice mail message outlining the nature of the emergency and the best way to contact the student. \u00a7 Make-up exams are approved and given at the sole discretion of the Course Director. Students must take make-up examinations as scheduled, or risk a zero grade for the missed exam. \u00a7 If a student misses an exam due to illness or other unforeseen event, they are required to make up the exam at the earliest reasonable time upon returning to class, at the discretion of the Course Director. \u00a7 Except under extraordinary circumstances, it is not acceptable to notify the Course Director or program faculty of a missed exam after the scheduled start time. \u00a7 Failure to notify the Course Director and Director of Academic Education of a missed exam in a timely and appropriate manner will result in a score of zero on the exam. Late Arrival to Exams: \u00a7 If a student arrives late to an exam, they may be allowed to take the exam, at the discretion of the proctor. Late arriving students will not be given additional time to complete the exam. \u00a7 Students should notify the program by phone or email if they know they will be late to an exam. \u00a7 Late arriving student should be as quiet and undisruptive as possible taking their place in an exam. Reviewing Exams: \u00a7 Exams and/or computer-scored answer sheets will be returned to the students for review as soon as possible after all students have completed an exam and the faculty have completed their validation review of the scores. PA Program Handbook Page 40 of 90 \u00a7 Note the following procedures during an exam review: - No one is allowed to leave the room with an exam or computer scored answer sheet. - Students must return both the exam and the computer scored answer sheet as distributed. - Students are not allowed to copy or reproduce exam materials in any manner. Personal notes may not be taken regarding exam content. - Students are only allowed access to their own test scores and answer sheets. Exam Review and Rescoring: \u00a7 Exam reviews are provided to give students the opportunity to learn from questions they may have answered incorrectly and gain further understanding of the material. Exam reviews are not opportunities for students to debate exam content or the wording of questions. \u00a7 Challenges to exam questions are not allowed during the review. \u00a7 For each exam, the Course Director reviews all questions prior to posting the exam scores. Questions answered incorrectly by 60% or more of the class are reviewed for accuracy, and may be reviewed with the class as well. Exam rescoring may occur based on this review, at the discretion of the Course Director. Exam Score Posting: \u00a7 Posted exam scores are final. Scores are posted on Blackboard. \u00a7 Cumulative course grade information is posted on Blackboard. Failed Exams and Exam Remediation: \u00a7 Any student who receives an exam score of less than 70.0% on any exam must arrange for remediation with the Course Director within one week of the score posting. The timing, content, and methods of the exam remediation are at the sole discretion of the Course Director. \u00a7 Only one remediation attempt is allowed per exam. If a student fails to successfully remediate an exam, they will fail with the original exam score and will be placed on Academic Probation for further action as described in this Handbook. \u00a7 Successful remediation does not change the original exam score, but will allow the student to continue with the course. Students must successfully remediate a failed exam in order to continue in the course. \u00a7 Any failed examination must be remediated within the time frame designated by the Course Director in order to continue in the course. Failure to remediate an exam in a timely manner constitutes unprofessional behavior and may result in the student being placed on academic probation. \u00a7 If a student fails a final examination, they may be required to forfeit scheduled breaks or vacation to accommodate remediation activities. \u00a7 Exam remediation is intended to allow students who fail an exam to demonstrate their understanding of course materials in order to successfully continue in the program. However, students are expected to learn material sufficiently and develop their test taking skills such that they can pass all exams when they are given. Failing more than one exam in any class in a term constitutes unsatisfactory academic performance, which places the student on academic probation. Refer to the Academic Standards section regarding probation. Exam Procedure Violations: \u00a7 Failure to adhere to the examination procedure policies, inappropriate behavior or cheating during on an exam, or discussing and revealing exam content to current or future students constitutes a violation of the program policy on professionalism. \u00a7 Cheating during examinations is not tolerated. If a student is suspected of inappropriate behavior or cheating during an exam, she/he will be asked to forfeit their exam, regardless of time remaining, and leave the room quietly. The incident will be referred to the Progress and Promotions Committee for review and further action. \u00a7 Violators are subject to placement on Academic Probation and possible dismissal from the program. The exam proctor and/or Course Director is the final arbiter of inappropriate behavior during an exam or exam review session. The assessment of the exam proctor and/or Course Director regarding a student's testing behavior is final. PA Program Handbook Page 41 of 90 Grade Assignments All course and rotations grades will be assigned according to the policies set forth in each course syllabus. Under extraordinary circumstances, if a student is unable to complete the required course or rotation work within the designated time frame, they may be granted an extension to complete all assigned work and duties. Extensions will result in the granting of a course grade of incomplete, or \"I\". An incomplete grade is given solely at the discretion of the Course Director or Directors of Academic or Clinical Education (as appropriate) upon careful consideration of the circumstances affecting the student's ability to complete assigned tasks on a timely basis. If an incomplete grade is given, it must be remediated within a pre-determined time frame, which is agreed upon by both the student and the PA Faculty. If the student successfully completes all required tasks and assignments, the incomplete grade will be converted to a final course grade according to the grading criteria for that subject. Failure on the part of the student to complete the required work on time, or in a satisfactorily passing manner will result in the incomplete grade converting to an \"F\" and the student is subject to academic probation and possible dismissal from the program. Grievances, Complaints, and Student Appeals All issues or concerns related to PA Program courses or activities should be first directed to the respective Course Director. All clinical rotation issues should be addressed with the Director of Clinical Education or their designee in the faculty. If a student issue is not resolved at the course level, the matter should be referred to the Director of Academic or Clinical Education, as appropriate. If the issue remains unresolved, the chain of command within the PA department requires the matter be brought next to the Program Director, then Department Chair, as appropriate. In the event that the matter in question cannot be resolved at the Chair level, it will be directed to the Program's Progress and Promotions Committee for further consideration. This committee will either resolve the matter in question to the student's satisfaction or instruct the student on available mechanisms for appeal as described in the Rush University Catalog. The CHS Student Academic Appeal and Grievance Procedures can be found in the Academic Appeals and Rules of Governance policies provided in the 2017-2018 Rush University Catalog, available at the Office of the Registrar Website. Non-academic issues or concerns, regardless if they concern the PA Program, can be addressed to either the Director of Academic or Clinical Education, as appropriate, or directly to the Program Director or Department Chair. Additionally, Rush University's has a procedure to address non-academic issues. Information regarding Rush's Non-Academic Complaint Procedures can be found at: https://www.rushu.rush.edu/non-academic-complaint-procedures. Incidents in the Clinical Setting Any incident that affects patient or staff well-being, or a patient's prescribed care, must be reported to the preceptor and the Director of Clinical Education immediately. Filing a hospital incident report may also be required, depending on the policy of the particular institution involved. A duplicate of any hospital incident reports, as well as a memorandum of explanation from the clinical instructor, will be placed in the student's clinical file and the Program Director or Director of Clinical Education will be notified immediately. Incidents involving gross errors in judgment or practice on the part of the student may constitute grounds for dismissal from the program. PA Program Handbook Page 42 of 90 Incoming Student Screening On admission to the program, students are required to obtain and document health and background status clearance in order to attend classes and care for patients. Health screening entails documentation of immunity to major communicable diseases, for personal and public health safety. The program adheres to the CDC standards on vaccinations for health care workers, available here: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/hcw.html. For more information regarding the program's screening clearance requirements, see Student Health Policy, page 49. The program also requires each student complete a criminal background check and drug screening on file at the time of registration for class. The drug screen is repeated each year of the program. Students are responsible for the cost of these screenings. Criminal background check clearance is a common requirement for student placement at clinical rotation sites. If a student has a history of any misdemeanor or felony conviction, they should disclose these activities in their applications, or as soon as possible upon admission to the program. Positive results in the criminal background check will be handled on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the charges and its outcome. Students with a history of a felony conviction are not guaranteed availability of clinical placement, which may compromise their ability to complete the program. Documentation of negative drug screening is also an increasingly common requirement for clinical placement, and is consistent with Rush's zero-tolerance, drug free campus policy. Students with a positive drug screen at any time during enrollment in the program will be advised on a case-by-case basis, and will be subject to action in accordance with the policies described in the Student Catalog. Leave of Absence If a student requires a leave of absence from the program for any reason, they must first petition the Program Director for the leave. The terms of the student's leave, as well their return to the program after a leave of absence must be arranged prior to the student's beginning the leave, and agreed to in writing, by both the student and the Program Director. Permission to take a leave of absence is granted at the sole discretion of the Program Director. Requests for an extended leave of absence may significantly hinder a student's progress through the program, and delay graduation. Depending on the duration of leave, it may not be possible for the student to remain in good standing in the program, and may require the student withdraw from the program. If an extended leave is granted, this may require deceleration from the program's proscribed course sequence, delaying the time to graduation beyond the program's expected 30-month duration. Taking a leave of absence from the program may incur additional fees and/or tuition costs for which the student is solely responsible. The student is required to complete the appropriate Leave of Absence forms, available on the University's website under the Registrar section, including acquiring the appropriate signatures from the required University entities, such defined on the form. Changes to the terms of the student's return to the program after a leave of absence must be arranged with, and at the sole discretion of, the Program Director on case-by-case basis. Medical Liability Insurance Rush University medical liability insurance coverage applies to those learning opportunities assigned to a student by the PA program as part of training in the PA curriculum. Coverage is not in effect and does not cover student activities associated with outside employment, volunteer work, or observational activities not required or assigned by the PA Program. PA Program Handbook Page 43 of 90 The Rush medial liability insurance only applies if a student participates in a PA Program approved activity. Students should not accept invitations to work with, observe, or shadow a clinician unless the program has approved the activity and/or assigned the student to that activity. Patient Information Confidentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security rule creates a framework for ensuring the safety, security and integrity of all patient medical record information. This includes all forms of patient record information, whether in electronic and paper file formats, and all health care information communication, whether electronic, written or verbal. The goals of the privacy and security rule are to: Protect and enhance patient rights by providing access to and controlling inappropriate use of health care information. Improve health care quality by maintaining trust between patients, providers, and payers. Improve efficiency and effectiveness of care delivery by creating a national framework for the privacy, confidentiality, and security of patient information, whether held electronically or in paper. Protecting the privacy, confidentiality, and electronic security of patient information is of utmost importance at Rush. The institution is committed to maintaining patient confidentiality and understands the sensitivity of patient information. All Rush University students are expected to complete annual HIPAA Privacy and Security education. To review the University's HIPAA policy provided in the 2017-2018 Rush University Catalog, available at the Office of the Registrar Website. Physician Assistant National Certification Examination The National Commission on Certification for the Physician Assistant (NCCPA) administrates the PA National Certification Examination (PANCE) and maintains the certification status for all PAs in the United States. In order to obtain individual state licensure, all PAs must take and pass the PANCE examination. Adhering to the NCCPA's certification standards ensure that all PAs in the country maintain minimum competency for practice. Due to the significance of the PANCE examination in PA certification and licensure, and its impact on practice, students of the program are strongly encouraged to pass the PANCE on their first attempt. The program offers several opportunities for students to develop test-taking skills and to take practice exams. Additionally, the program's curriculum and assessment standards are based on the NCCPA's Content Blueprint for the PANCE. The Content Blueprint covers both the organ systems and diseases, and the knowledge and skills areas required to pass the PANCE. Because of the evolving nature of the Content Blueprint, students should regularly check the NCCPA website for updates to the PANCE Blueprint. The Blueprint can be accessed here: http://www.nccpa.net/ExamsContentBlueprint?mID=38. Physician Assistant Clinical Knowledge Rating and Assessment Tool (PACKRAT) The Physician Assistant Clinical Knowledge Rating and Assessment Tool (PACKRAT) is an evaluation test developed by the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA) to help students assess their preparedness for passing the PA National Certification Examination (PANCE). Studies have shown that the PACKRAT is a strong predictor of pass/fail performance on the PANCE. The exam also provides students with objective data to evaluate their medical knowledge and general didactic preparedness. PA Program Handbook Page 44 of 90 The PACKRAT is 4 hours long and contains 225 multiple-choice questions. The exam is only available electronically. The content directly parallels that of the Exam Content Blueprint for PANCE, and covers all topics related to primary care medicine practice. As part of the program's general educational mission, and to facilitate students' preparation for the PANCE, the program offers the PACKRAT examination three times during the curriculum, at the end of the didactic year, during the Phase II rotations, and at the end of Phase III rotations, just prior to graduation. Performance on the PACKRAT offers students a standardized measure by which to evaluate their acquisition of medical knowledge and examination performance capacity. It is offered as a study guide for students in preparation for both clinical practice and the PANCE. Although the outcome of the PACKRAT is not tied to any progression standard in the program, students should approach taking the PACKRAT as seriously as they would the PANCE itself. Professional Organization Membership While students in the program, and for the remainder of your career, membership and participation in PA professional organizations is strongly encouraged. Membership supports these organizations in their various political and professional advancement activities. For some of you, active involvement in these organizations may be of interest, and can greatly advance your career and help build the profession's profile. The program will provide you student membership in both the AAPA and IAPA during your enrollment, as well as encourage any leadership roles you may choose to participate in for these organizations. A list of PA professional organizations and their contact information is available on page 56. Professionalism and Professional Behavior Students in the program are expected to behave at all times in a manner which conveys the highest degree of personal, moral, and intellectual integrity. PA students are expected to demonstrate their professional capacity by treating one another and others with respect, being reliable in all program activities, communicating effectively in both written and oral forms, accepting personal responsibility for one's actions, and exhibiting knowledge of their limitations. As noted above in the above section, Academic Performance - Standards and Progress, students are continuously evaluated regarding their professional and ethical behavior. Throughout all phases of the program students are evaluated on their professionalism at minimum each year, based on the criteria in the Professionalism Assessment Form, attached as Appendix G. For more information regarding the program's policy on professionalism, refer to the PA Professionalism and Professional Behavior Policy (page 53) of this handbook. Students are also expected to adhere to the criteria contained in the CHS Guide to Professional Conduct, (Appendix D, page 62). More information on the CHS Guide to Professional Conduct is available in the 2017-2018 Rush University Catalog, available at the Office of the Registrar Website. Academic Honesty Students in the program are expected to approach all assignments with the highest level of academic and intellectual honesty. With the vast amount of information available through electronic and other media, we must acknowledge, through proper citation, the originators of any print, electronic, or oral presentation used in our work. All assignments must be the student's own work, and must properly cite when another author's work is used. PA Program Handbook Page 45 of 90 It is considered academic dishonesty to represent another's work as one's own, or to collaborate in such falsification in others. Activities such as plagiarizing, cheating, inappropriate testing behavior, unauthorized use of Rush computer hard- or soft- ware, or permitting others to use your work for such ends, are all forms of academic dishonesty. It is also dishonest to misrepresent yourself or your role to patients, their families and loved ones, or preceptors. Academic dishonesty falls within the purview of the PA Professionalism and Professional Behavior Policy. Please refer to the policies on Academic Performance (page 25) regarding the handling of violations of professional behavior. Program Completion Deadline At outlined in the Leave of Absence section, page 43, students are expected to complete the program within its proscribed 30-month curriculum. If a student is on an approved decelerated curriculum, the maximum amount of time a student may remain in the program is one year beyond the expected program duration, or 42 months. Failing to complete the program within the maximum time allotted will result in an academic withdrawal from the program. Students at risk for failing to complete the program must meet with the Program Director to develop a plan to successfully complete the program. Program Supported Student Travel As part of promoting learning and professional development, students may be invited to attend conferences and professional meetings as a representative of the program. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to: attending state and local PA professional meetings as the Rush student liaison, conference presentation of lectures, research, or posters, and participating in the AAPA national Student Challenge Bowl competition. The program strongly encourages participation in such activities and will help support student involvement whenever possible. Based on annual budget availability, the program may supplement registration, travel, and accommodations to students on a case-by-case basis. Program funds may not be used to support student participation in medical mission trips. More information regarding student activity funds is available through the program class officers and the faculty liaison to the class. Progress and Promotions Committee The Progress and Promotions Committee consists of the core faculty members of the PA Program, excluding the Program Director/Department Chair, and other faculty and PA representatives from bother within and outside Rush University. The Committee oversees all matters of student performance during the program. In the event a student fails to make satisfactory progress in any area of the program, the Progress and Promotions Committee is convened to identify the source of the student's difficulty and to consider remediation strategies for the student to overcome challenges and succeed in the program. The Committee's remediation recommendations will be discussed with the student by their faculty advisor, the Program Chair, or other designee as determined by the Committee. If the student fails to make satisfactory academic progress despite remediation, and the Committee finds no reasonable expectation of a successful remediation of the situation, the Committee may recommend that the student be dismissed from the program. For more information regarding University dismissal policies, refer to the Academic Appeals and Rules of Governance policies in the 2017-2018 Rush University Catalog, available at the Office of the Registrar Website. The final decision regarding dismissal rests with the Dean of the CHS, as discussed in the College of Health Sciences Policies and Procedures for the Rush University Rules for Governance PA Program Handbook Page 46 of 90 The Progress and Promotions Committee also conducts the formative evaluations at the end of phases I and II of the program to assess students' eligibility to progress to the next year of study, and the summative evaluation conducted at the end of the program to approve the student for graduation (see Cumulative Competency Assessment, page 34). Readmission to the Program If a student is unable, for whatever reason, to proceed to the next course in the published curriculum sequence, he/she may petition the Program Director to withdraw and appeal for readmission to the program at the start of the following academic year without reapplication to the program. The option for readmission to the program is granted at the discretion of the Program Director and the Progress and Promotions Committee. The following procedure is required: 1. If a student cannot proceed with the program, but wishes to reenter in the next year's class cohort, they must meet with the Program Director to determine if readmission is a viable option. At this meeting, the student must present compelling evidence of their capacity for academic success if allowed to reenter the program the following year. 2. If a readmission option is granted, a student contract will be made, stating the reasons for the withdrawal and any terms for possible readmission as agreed upon by the student and the Program Director. The contract will also outline a reasonable timeframe by which the student may reapply to the program. Both the student and the Program Director must sign their agreement to the contract. One copy will be given to the student and one copy will be placed in the student's program record. 3. At least three months prior to the beginning of the planned return, the student must petition for readmission by submitting a letter of intent declaring their readiness to reenter the program to the Program Director. In some cases, the student may be required to resubmit an application through CASPA for consideration with other new applicants in the admission cycle. a. In addition to stating their readiness to reenter the program, the letter of intent should also describe and provide documentation of the outcome of any of activities required in the terms for readmission. This may include remedial course work grades or medical health clearance documentation. 4. The decision regarding readmission is subject to the approval of the Program Director and the Progress and Promotions Committee. 5. The student will be informed in writing of the decision whether or not readmission is granted prior to the start of the academic year. The student must complete all customary procedures for entry into the program, including submission of transcripts, completion of health and drug screening, and completion of a criminal background check, in a timely manner before the start of classes, and regardless of prior admission screening status. If a student is dismissed from the program, or voluntarily withdraws from the program and wishes to return to the University more than one class cycle beyond their departure, they must re-apply and be re-accepted in the usual manner and on the same basis as any new applicant. Information on the CHS Guide to Readmission is available in the 2017-2018 Rush University Catalog, available at the Office of the Registrar Website. Students who voluntarily withdraw from the program, regardless of academic standing at the time of leaving the program, have no guarantee of reinstatement to the program. Remediation Remediation is a process to help students improve their performance. It is offered to all students, whether due to failing a single assessment activity, or due to demonstrating a pattern PA Program Handbook Page 47 of 90 of repeated or multiple performance issues. Remediation can occur for either academic or professional behavior issues. The process of remediation involves providing students with additional assistance in acquiring expected knowledge and/or skills related to the learning materials in the program or the program's professionalism standard. Examination remediation is the process of providing additional time and assistance to learn a subject matter, and allowing the student to demonstrate their knowledge in another examination. Remediation in the program can take many forms, depending on the student's needs, and is available at the discretion of the faculty. Scheduled Vacation and Breaks As noted under the Academic Calendar section, during the didactic year, the program adheres to the CHS academic calendar, with vacations and breaks as posted on the Registrar's Office calendar. I f a student is failing at the end of a course, or fails a formative assessment evaluation, and requires remediation at the end of the term, the faculty reserves the right to use scheduled vacation and break time to administer the required remediation. During the clinical rotations, breaks are determined at the sole discretion of the PA Program. Social Media Rush maintains a strict policy regarding the use of its name, logo, trademark, and image in any form of social media. Students, faculty, and employees are not permitted to use the Rush name, refer to, make statements on behalf of Rush, or represent themselves as an agent of Rush without express advance permission from the Department of Marketing and Communications. This relates to all publicly accessible forms of communication via the internet, including but not limited to: wikis; video-sharing Web sites such as YouTube; on-line social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Vine, and LinkedIn; social bookmarking sites such as Digg and Delicious; or any other form of on-line publishing, including blogs, discussion forums, newsgroups and e-mail distribution lists. For more information, refer to the complete RUMC policy on Social Media in Appendix H (page 71). Students are not permitted to refer to or identify patients or their protected health information in any social media forums or other non-Rush electronic communications. Similarly, students should not refer to faculty, clinical rotation sites, preceptors, or other program associates on any social media forums. Always keep in mind that you are personally responsible for the content you publish on-line, and that what you publish on blogs, wikis, or other forms of user-generated media can never be truly erased or deleted. Failure to adhere to this policy constitutes an egregious lapse in professionalism and will require disciplinary action. Student Attire and Identification Students are expected to dress appropriately for the overall hospital setting where classes are being offered. The PA Program's dress code is in place to demonstrate respect and create a positive image of the members of our program to colleagues, faculty, program instructors and guests, hospital staff and administration, and patients and their family and guests. For classes taking place at the University the dress code is comfortable, business casual. The PA Program's dress code is in effect whenever a student is on campus during regular business hours, and regardless of whether or classes are in session. Any attire other than business PA Program Handbook Page 48 of 90 casual on campus during business hours constitutes a violation of the program's professional behavior policies. Exemptions to the dress code policy are only permitted for the following lab-based training activities: anatomy, history and physical examination, clinical skills; BLS/ACLS training. For these activities, the only acceptable form of dress is light blue or green medical scrubs with closed-toe footwear, unless otherwise instructed. If you are in scrubs outside of the lab area, you must also wear a short, white lab coat. In addition to business casual dress, students are required to have their Rush University name tag on and clearly visible at all times. The University provides students with their Rush nametag at incoming student orientation. Students in any clinical or patient contact setting are required to dress in business professional attire. Students should also wear comfortable, shoes in the patient care setting, as work-hours are long and may require a lot of walking and/or long periods of standing. Footwear must always be closed-toe in the clinical setting. Additionally, in any clinical or patient contact setting, students are also required to wear a sport-coat-styled, short, white medical jacket with the University and the program's name and the student's nametag clearly visible. Additional white lab coats are available for purchase in the bookstore for use throughout the program. At minimum, the lab coat must have the Rush logo patch over the left chest flap. At the end of the first year, the program will present students with a personalized short white coat for use while on clinical rotations. The dress code policy statement and guidelines are in Appendix I, page 75 of this handbook. Student Counseling Center Rush University provides offers students access to professional counseling, at no charge, for a variety of concerns ranging from academic problems to issues of personal development. Students may seek guidance on a wide range of personal issues that may be affecting their health and academic performance. Students may voluntarily seek the services of the counseling center at any time. Additionally, the PA program faculty may refer students to the counseling center as part of their recommendations for student performance remediation. The Counseling Center maintains strict standards of privacy and confidentiality. No information about an individual student is released to anyone, inside or outside the University, without the prior consent of the student. No student contact with the Counseling Center becomes a part of any other University record. The Rush University Counseling Center, located in 701 Kidston House, is also reachable via telephone at (312) 942-3687. Student Health Policies Immunizations The PA program requires that each student have medical clearance from his/her healthcare provider and a record of immunization currency on file before they register for classes. The program requires students have documented immunity to each of the following: Measles, Mumps, Rubella Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Hepatitis B via the three-vaccination series (must document both having undergone the vaccination series and immunity) PA Program Handbook Page 49 of 90 Varicella (Chicken Pox, either by occurrence or vaccination) Providing a vaccination history is not sufficient to document immunity. You must have titer test results that prove immunity. Waivers for non-conversion are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the Rush Employee Health standards. In addition to documenting immunity to the above, students must document the following: Tuberculosis status annually, by a negative Quantiferon-TB Gold test, a 2-step PPD test, or a negative chest x-ray, as appropriate. Influenza vaccination within the year prior to matriculation date into the program. Thereafter, students must comply with Rush's annual influenza vaccination policy. Meningitis conjugate booster immunization after 16 years of age Certain rotations may also require that students update their health record prior to starting clinical rotations at that site. The program will inform students of any necessary procedures to meet such requirements in advance to the start of clinical rotations. Students must comply with all clinical rotation site health maintenance requirements in order to remain in good standing in the program. Student health records are confidential and will remain on file through CastleBranch. However, each student is required to sign a release of information that permits the program to provide affiliated clinical practice sites, agencies, and preceptors proof of the student's health status, as needed. Program faculty, medical directors, and instructors are not permitted to act as healthcare providers, or offer healthcare services to students, except in an emergency situation in which no other healthcare providers are available. Students are responsible for maintaining their personal health and are required to have health insurance to cover the cost of all necessary medical care throughout the program. Refer to the Rush University Catalog for information regarding compliance with mandatory health insurance policies and the University sponsored health insurance program. Accommodations Being a PA requires certain cognitive, motor, communication, and behavioral capacities. The minimum expected capacity in these domains are expressed in the Technical Standards for PA Students (page 54). Students who wish to request a reasonable accommodation based on a disability must contact the Rush Office of Student Disability for information on the accommodation process. Information on accommodations for students with disabilities is available at: http://www.rushu.rush.edu/students-disabilities. Hazardous Exposure Incidents In the event of hazardous material exposure at any phase of training during the program, students must adhere to the following University protocol: Procedures for Hazardous Exposure Incidents Exposure Incident Definition: Eye, mouth, mucous membrane, non-intact skin contact, or parenteral exposure to blood or potentially infectious or hazardous materials, that results from the performance of a duty related to a student's educational program. PA Program Handbook Page 50 of 90 Procedure at Rush University Medical Center Wash injured area with soap and water. If eyes, nose, or mouth, use water only. Immediately report the incident to your preceptor. o Contact the PA Program Director of Clinical Education or Program Director as soon as feasible to report the incident. Report to Employee and Corporate Health Services (ECHS), 4th floor Atrium, 312-942-5878, as soon as possible for further evaluation. If after hours, leave a message reporting the incident. o You MUST ensure ECHS is notified of the exposure incident in as timely manner as possible. o Confirmation from ECHS that the incident is reported is essential to ensure payment for services is covered. Failure to report to ECHS in a timely manner may result in erroneous out-of-pocket expenses. o If you leave a message with ECHS and do not hear back from them, continue to contact the office until you receive confirmation from their staff that the incident has been received. If ECHS is closed, immediately report to the Rush Emergency Room (ER), Rush Tower, 1st floor, 312-947-0100. o Bring your student ID and indicate that you are a student in the PA Program and not an employee. o If student is seen in ER, the student must report to ECHS on the next business day. Students will be counseled or treated as deemed appropriate by ECHS or ER personnel. Return to ECHS or to consultants as directed for follow-up lab work and treatment as indicated. Procedure if off campus Follow the protocol at your rotation facility and contact Rush ECHS, either in person or by phone at 312-942-5878, as soon as possible to report the incident. Student Employment during the Program The following guidelines apply to students regarding employment while in the PA program: The PA program maintains an intense curriculum that demands a great deal of time, effort, and energy. At the same time, it is important that students remain well balanced and allow sufficient time for social activities, recreation, and rest. Therefore, students are advised that it is best that they do not have outside employment while in the program. During the clinical phases of the program, several factors make it even more difficult to maintain employment. The requirements of the rotations and the variability of both the hours and location of the rotations prohibit students' working during their clinical rotations. Students should not accept any form of payment for the tasks they perform while on clinical rotations. While on clinical rotations, students may not provide services within the preceptor's practice apart from those rendered for their educational value and as part of the clinical instruction experience. Students may not receive monetary compensation for work performed within the preceptor's practice. Students should not perform any services outside of those appropriate for a PA student in training, regardless of the student's prior professional or academic background. Students of the PA Program do not have enough time, and are not permitted, to participate in the Rush University work-study program. PA Program Handbook Page 51 of 90 Students are not allowed to work for the PA program or its clinical agents in any capacity. Student Placement Policy The University's Career Services Office and the Office of Student Affairs assists students active in the job search application process with resumes, curriculum vitas, cover letters, personal statements, job search strategies and interviewing techniques. Career opportunities listings, various handouts and workbooks, and reference books are available for students in this office and on the web at www.rushu.rush.edu/studentlife/career. The Program also maintains a file of all positions received by the Program from potential employers. The Program makes this information available to all senior year PA students. During the third year of the program, the program will provide information and training in professional development and seeking employment through seminar presentations on such topics as conducting a job search, interviewing skills, and negotiating salaries and benefits. Continued Next Page PA Program Handbook Page 52 of 90 PA Professionalism and Professional Behavior Policy Professionalism relates to the expected intellectual, ethical, behavioral, and attitudinal attributes necessary to perform as a health care provider. Students in the PA program are expected to behave ethically and professionally, and in a manner appropriate to a clinician-in-training through all phases of the program. All students in the PA Program are expected to adhere to the ethical codes set forth in the following Professionalism Policy. Additional professionalism policies as stated in either program courses or the clinical entity may also apply.

PA Program Handbook Page 78 of 90 APPENDIX L - NCCPA Competencies for the PA Profession NCCPA Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession Preamble In 2003, the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA) initiated an effort to define PA competencies in response to similar efforts being conducted within other health care professions and growing demand for accountability and assessment in clinical practice. The following year, representatives from three other national PA organizations, each bringing a unique perspective and valuable insights, joined NCCPA in that effort. Those organizations were the Accreditation Review Commission for Education of the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA), the body that accredits PA educational programs; the Association of Physician Assistant Programs (APAP), the membership association for PA educators and program directors; and the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), the only national membership association representing all PAs. The resultant document, Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession, is a foundation from which each of those four organizations, other physician assistant organizations and individual physician assistants themselves can chart a course for advancing the competencies of the PA profession. Introduction The purpose of this document is to communicate to the PA profession and the public a set of competencies that all physician assistants regardless of specialty or setting are expected to acquire and maintain throughout their careers. This document serves as a map for the individual PA, the physician-PA team and organizations that are committed to promoting the development and maintenance of these professional competencies among physician assistants. The clinical role of PAs includes primary and specialty care in medical and surgical practice settings. Professional competencies1 for physician assistants include the effective and appropriate application of medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, patient care, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, systems-based practice, as well as an unwavering commitment to continual learning, professional growth and the physician-PA team, for the benefit of patients and the larger community being served. These competencies are demonstrated within the scope of practice, whether medical or surgical, for each individual physician assistant as that scope is defined by the supervising physician and appropriate to the practice setting. 1 In 1999, the Accreditation Council for Graduation Medical Education (ACGME) endorsed a list of general competencies for medical residents. NCCPA's Eligibility Committee, with substantial input from representatives of AAPA, APAP and ARC-PA, has modified the ACGME's list for physician assistant practice, drawing from several other resources, including the work of Drs. Epstein and Hundert; research conducted by AAPA's EVP/CEO, Dr. Steve Crane; and NCCPA's own examination content blueprint. PA Program Handbook Page 79 of 90 PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT COMPETENCIES Vers. 3.5 (3/22/05) The PA profession defines the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes required and provides educational experiences as needed in order for physician assistants to acquire and demonstrate these competencies. MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE Medical knowledge includes an understanding of pathophysiology, patient presentation, differential diagnosis, patient management, surgical principles, health promotion and disease prevention. Physician assistants must demonstrate core knowledge about established and evolving biomedical and clinical sciences and the application of this knowledge to patient care in their area of practice. In addition, physician assistants are expected to demonstrate an investigatory and analytic thinking approach to clinical situations. Physician assistants are expected to: understand etiologies, risk factors, underlying pathologic process, and epidemiology for medical conditions identify signs and symptoms of medical conditions select and interpret appropriate diagnostic or lab studies manage general medical and surgical conditions to include understanding the indications, contraindications, side effects, interactions and adverse reactions of pharmacologic agents and other relevant treatment modalities identify the appropriate site of care for presenting conditions, including identifying emergent cases and those requiring referral or admission identify appropriate interventions for prevention of conditions identify the appropriate methods to detect conditions in an asymptomatic individual differentiate between the normal and the abnormal in anatomic, physiological, laboratory findings and other diagnostic data appropriately use history and physical findings and diagnostic studies to formulate a differential diagnosis provide appropriate care to patients with chronic conditions INTERPERSONAL & COMMUNICATION SKILLS Interpersonal and communication skills encompass verbal, nonverbal and written exchange of information. Physician assistants must demonstrate interpersonal and communication skills that result in effective information exchange with patients, their patients' families, physicians, professional associates, and the health care system. Physician assistants are expected to: create and sustain a therapeutic and ethically sound relationship with patients use effective listening, nonverbal, explanatory, questioning, and writing skills to elicit and provide information appropriately adapt communication style and messages to the context of the individual patient interaction work effectively with physicians and other health care professionals as a member or leader of a health care team or other professional group apply an understanding of human behavior demonstrate emotional resilience and stability, adaptability, flexibility and tolerance of ambiguity and anxiety accurately and adequately document and record information regarding the care process for medical, legal, quality and financial purposes PA Program Handbook Page 80 of 90 PATIENT CARE Patient care includes age-appropriate assessment, evaluation and management. Physician assistants must demonstrate care that is effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient and equitable for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of wellness. Physician assistants are expected to: work effectively with physicians and other health care professionals to provide patient-centered care demonstrate caring and respectful behaviors when interacting with patients and their families gather essential and accurate information about their patients make informed decisions about diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on patient information and preferences, up-to-date scientific evidence, and clinical judgment develop and carry out patient management plans counsel and educate patients and their families competently perform medical and surgical procedures considered essential in the area of practice provide health care services and education aimed at preventing health problems or maintaining health PROFESSIONALISM Professionalism is the expression of positive values and ideals as care is delivered. Foremost, it involves prioritizing the interests of those being served above one's own. Physician assistants must know their professional and personal limitations. Professionalism also requires that PAs practice without impairment from substance abuse, cognitive deficiency or mental illness. Physician assistants must demonstrate a high level of responsibility, ethical practice, sensitivity to a diverse patient population and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements. Physician assistants are expected to demonstrate: understanding of legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the appropriate role of the physician assistant professional relationships with physician supervisors and other health care providers respect, compassion, and integrity responsiveness to the needs of patients and society accountability to patients, society, and the profession commitment to excellence and on-going professional development commitment to ethical principles pertaining to provision or withholding of clinical care, confidentiality of patient information, informed consent, and business practices sensitivity and responsiveness to patients' culture, age, gender, and disabilities self-reflection, critical curiosity and initiative PRACTICE-BASED LEARNING AND IMPROVEMENT Practice-based learning and improvement includes the processes through which clinicians engage in critical analysis of their own practice experience, medical literature and other information resources for the purpose of self-improvement. Physician assistants must be able to assess, evaluate and improve their patient care practices. Physician assistants are expected to: analyze practice experience and perform practice-based improvement activities using a systematic methodology in concert with other members of the health care delivery team locate, appraise, and integrate evidence from scientific studies related to their patients' health problems obtain and apply information about their own population of patients and the larger population from which their patients are drawn PA Program Handbook Page 81 of 90 apply knowledge of study designs and statistical methods to the appraisal of clinical studies and other information on diagnostic and therapeutic effectiveness apply information technology to manage information, access on-line medical information, and support their own education facilitate the learning of students and/or other health care professionals recognize and appropriately address gender, cultural, cognitive, emotional and other biases; gaps in medical knowledge; and physical limitations in themselves and others SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE Systems-based practice encompasses the societal, organizational and economic environments in which health care is delivered. Physician assistants must demonstrate an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger system of health care to provide patient care that is of optimal value. PAs should work to improve the larger health care system of which their practices are a part. Physician assistants are expected to: use information technology to support patient care decisions and patient education effectively interact with different types of medical practice and delivery systems understand the funding sources and payment systems that provide coverage for patient care practice cost-effective health care and resource allocation that does not compromise quality of care advocate for quality patient care and assist patients in dealing with system complexities partner with supervising physicians, health care managers and other health care providers to assess, coordinate, and improve the delivery of health care and patient outcomes accept responsibility for promoting a safe environment for patient care and recognizing and correcting systems-based factors that negatively impact patient care apply medical information and clinical data systems to provide more effective, efficient patient care use the systems responsible for the appropriate payment of services From: http://www.nccpa.net/uploads/docs/PACompetencies.pdf PA Program Handbook Page 82 of 90 APPENDIX M - AAPA Ethical Conduct Guidelines AAPA Guidelines for Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) Introduction The physician assistant profession has revised its code of ethics several times since the profession began. Although the fundamental principles underlying the ethical care of patients have not changed, the societal framework in which those principles are applied has. Economic pressures of the health care system, social pressures of church and state, technological advances, and changing patient demographics continually transform the landscape in which PAs practice. Previous codes of the profession were brief lists of tenets for PAs to live by in their professional lives. This document departs from that format by attempting to describe ways in which those tenets apply. Each situation is unique. Individual PAs must use their best judgment in a given situation while considering the preferences of the patient and the supervising physician, clinical information, ethical concepts, and legal obligations. Four main bioethical principles broadly guided the development of these guidelines: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Autonomy, strictly speaking, means self-rule. Patients have the right to make autonomous decisions and choices, and physician assistants should respect these decisions and choices. Beneficence means that PAs should act in the patient's best interest. In certain cases, respecting the patient's autonomy and acting in their best interests may be difficult to balance. Nonmaleficence means to do no harm, to impose no unnecessary or unacceptable burden upon the patient. Justice means that patients in similar circumstances should receive similar care. Justice also applies to norms for the fair distribution of resources, risks, and costs. Physician assistants are expected to behave both legally and morally. They should know and understand the laws governing their practice. Likewise, they should understand the ethical responsibilities of being a health care professional. Legal requirements and ethical expectations will not always be in agreement. Generally speaking, the law describes minimum standards of acceptable behavior, and ethical principles delineate the highest moral standards of behavior. When faced with an ethical dilemma, PAs may find the guidance they need in this document. If not, they may wish to seek guidance elsewhere possibly from a supervising physician, a hospital ethics committee, an ethicist, trusted colleagues, or other AAPA policies. PAs should seek legal counsel when they are concerned about the potential legal consequences of their decisions. The following sections discuss ethical conduct of PAs in their professional interactions with patients, physicians, colleagues, other health professionals, and the public. The \"Statement of Values\" within this document defines the fundamental values that the PA profession strives to PA Program Handbook Page 83 of 90 uphold. These values provide the foundation upon which the guidelines rest. The guidelines were written with the understanding that no document can encompass all actual and potential ethical responsibilities, and PAs should not regard them as comprehensive. Statement of Values of the Physician Assistant Profession Physician assistants hold as their primary responsibility the health, safety, welfare, and dignity of all human beings. Physician assistants uphold the tenets of patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Physician assistants recognize and promote the value of diversity. Physician assistants treat equally all persons who seek their care. Physician assistants hold in confidence the information shared in the course of practicing medicine. Physician assistants assess their personal capabilities and limitations, striving always to improve their medical practice. Physician assistants actively seek to expand their knowledge and skills, keeping abreast of advances in medicine. Physician assistants work with other members of the health care team to provide compassionate and effective care of patients. Physician assistants use their knowledge and experience to contribute to an improved community. Physician assistants respect their professional relationship with physicians. Physician assistants share and expand knowledge within the profession. The PA and Patient PA Role and Responsibilities Physician assistant practice flows out of a unique relationship that involves the PA, the physician, and the patient. The individual patient-PA relationship is based on mutual respect and an agreement to work together regarding medical care. In addition, PAs practice medicine with physician supervision; therefore, the care that a PA provides is an extension of the care of the supervising physician. The patient-PA relationship is also a patient-PA-physician relationship. The principal value of the physician assistant profession is to respect the health, safety, welfare, and dignity of all human beings. This concept is the foundation of the patient-PA relationship. Physician assistants have an ethical obligation to see that each of their patients receives appropriate care. PAs should be sensitive to the beliefs and expectations of the patient. PAs should recognize that each patient is unique and has an ethical right to self-determination Physician assistants are professionally and ethically committed to providing nondiscriminatory care to all patients. While PAs are not expected to ignore their own personal values, scientific or ethical standards, or the law, they should not allow their personal beliefs to restrict patient access to care. A PA has an ethical duty to offer each patient the full range of information on relevant options for their health care. If personal moral, religious, or ethical beliefs prevent a PA from offering the full range of treatments available or care the patient desires, the PA has an ethical duty to refer a patient to another qualified provider. That referral should not restrict a patient's access to care. PAs are obligated to care for patients in emergency situations and to responsibly transfer patients if they cannot care for them. PA Program Handbook Page 84 of 90 Physician assistants should always act in the best interests of their patients and as advocates when necessary. PAs should actively resist policies that restrict free exchange of medical information. For example, a PA should not withhold information about treatment options simply because the option is not covered by insurance. PAs should inform patients of financial incentives to limit care, use resources in a fair and efficient way, and avoid arrangements or financial incentives that conflict with the patient's best interests. The PA and Diversity The physician assistant should respect the culture, values, beliefs, and expectations of the patient. Nondiscrimination Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories include gender, color, creed, race, religion, age, ethnic or national origin, political beliefs, nature of illness, disability, socioeconomic status, physical stature, body size, gender identity, marital status, or sexual orientation. Initiation and Discontinuation of Care In the absence of a preexisting patient-PA relationship, the physician assistant is under no ethical obligation to care for a person unless no other provider is available. A PA is morally bound to provide care in emergency situations and to arrange proper follow-up. PAs should keep in mind that contracts with health insurance plans might define a legal obligation to provide care to certain patients. A physician assistant and supervising physician may discontinue their professional relationship with an established patient as long as proper procedures are followed. The PA and physician should provide the patient with adequate notice, offer to transfer records, and arrange for continuity of care if the patient has an ongoing medical condition. Discontinuation of the professional relationship should be undertaken only after a serious attempt has been made to clarify and understand the expectations and concerns of all involved parties. If the patient decides to terminate the relationship, they are entitled to access appropriate information contained within their medical record. Informed Consent Physician assistants have a duty to protect and foster an individual patient's free and informed choices. The doctrine of informed consent means that a PA provides adequate information that is comprehendible to a competent patient or patient surrogate. At a minimum, this should include the nature of the medical condition, the objectives of the proposed treatment, treatment options, possible outcomes, and the risks involved. PAs should be committed to the concept of shared decision making, which involves assisting patients in making decisions that account for medical, situational, and personal factors. In caring for adolescents, the PA should understand all of the laws and regulations in his or her jurisdiction that are related to the ability of minors to consent to or refuse health care. Adolescents should be encouraged to involve their families in health care decision making. The PA should also understand consent laws pertaining to emancipated or mature minors. (See the section on Confidentiality.) PA Program Handbook Page 85 of 90 When the person giving consent is a patient's surrogate, a family member, or other legally authorized representative, the PA should take reasonable care to assure that the decisions made are consistent with the patient's best interests and personal preferences, if known. If the PA believes the surrogate's choices do not reflect the patient's wishes or best interests, the PA should work to resolve the conflict. This may require the use of additional resources, such as an ethics committee. Confidentiality Physician assistants should maintain confidentiality. By maintaining confidentiality, PAs respect patient privacy and help to prevent discrimination based on medical conditions. If patients are confident that their privacy is protected, they are more likely to seek medical care and more likely to discuss their problems candidly. In cases of adolescent patients, family support is important but should be balanced with the patient's need for confidentiality and the PA's obligation to respect their emerging autonomy. Adolescents may not be of age to make independent decisions about their health, but providers should respect that they soon will be. To the extent they can, PAs should allow these emerging adults to participate as fully as possible in decisions about their care. It is important that PAs be familiar with and understand the laws and regulations in their jurisdictions that relate to the confidentiality rights of adolescent patients. (See the section on Informed Consent.) Any communication about a patient conducted in a manner that violates confidentiality is unethical. Because written, electronic, and verbal information may be intercepted or overheard, the PA should always be aware of anyone who might be monitoring communication about a patient. PAs should choose methods of storage and transmission of patient information that minimize the likelihood of data becoming available to unauthorized persons or organizations. Computerized record keeping and electronic data transmission present unique challenges that can make the maintenance of patient confidentiality difficult. PAs should advocate for policies and procedures that secure the confidentiality of patient information. The Patient and the Medical Record Physician assistants have an obligation to keep information in the patient's medical record confidential. Information should be released only with the written permission of the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative. Specific exceptions to this general rule may exist (e.g., workers compensation, communicable disease, HIV, knife/gunshot wounds, abuse, substance abuse). It is important that a PA be familiar with and understand the laws and regulations in his or her jurisdiction that relate to the release of information. For example, stringent legal restrictions on release of genetic test results and mental health records often exist. Both ethically and legally, a patient has certain rights to know the information contained in his or her medical record. While the chart is legally the property of the practice or the institution, the information in the chart is the property of the patient. Most states have laws that provide patients access to their medical records. The PA should know the laws and facilitate patient access to the information. Disclosure PA Program Handbook Page 86 of 90 A physician assistant should disclose to his or her supervising physician information about errors made in the course of caring for a patient. The supervising physician and PA should disclose the error to the patient if such information is significant to the patient's interests and well being. Errors do not always constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior, but failure to disclose them may. Care of Family Members and Co-workers Treating oneself, co-workers, close friends, family members, or students whom the physician assistant supervises or teaches may be unethical or create conflicts of interest. For example, it might be ethically acceptable to treat one's own child for a case of otitis media but it probably is not acceptable to treat one's spouse for depression. PAs should be aware that their judgment might be less than objective in cases involving friends, family members, students, and colleagues and that providing \"curbside\" care might sway the individual from establishing an ongoing relationship with a provider. If it becomes necessary to treat a family member or close associate, a formal patient-provider relationship should be established, and the PA should consider transferring the patient's care to another provider as soon as it is practical. If a close associate requests care, the PA may wish to assist by helping them find an appropriate provider. There may be exceptions to this guideline, for example, when a PA runs an employee health center or works in occupational medicine. Even in those situations, the PA should be sure they do not provide informal treatment, but provide appropriate medical care in a formally established patient-provider relationship. Genetic Testing Evaluating the risk of disease and performing diagnostic genetic tests raise significant ethical concerns. Physician assistants should be informed about the benefits and risks of genetic tests. Testing should be undertaken only after proper informed consent is obtained. If PAs order or conduct the tests, they should assure that appropriate pre- and post-test counseling is provided. PAs should be sure that patients understands the potential consequences of undergoing genetic tests from impact on patients themselves, possible implications for other family members, and potential use of the information by insurance companies or others who might have access to the information. Because of the potential for discrimination by insurers, employers, or others, PAs should be particularly aware of the need for confidentiality concerning genetic test results. Reproductive Decision Making Patients have a right to access the full range of reproductive health care services, including fertility treatments, contraception, sterilization, and abortion. Physician assistants have an ethical obligation to provide balanced and unbiased clinical information about reproductive health care. When the PA's personal values conflict with providing full disclosure or providing certain services such as sterilization or abortion, the PA need not become involved in that aspect of the patient's care. By referring the patient to a qualified provider who is willing to discuss and facilitate all treatment options, the PA fulfills their ethical obligation to ensure the patient's access to all legal options. End of Life Among the ethical principles that are fundamental to providing compassionate care at the end of life, the most essential is recognizing that dying is a personal experience and part of the life cycle. PA Program Handbook Page 87 of 90 Physician Assistants should provide patients with the opportunity to plan for end of life care. Advance directives, living wills, durable power of attorney, and organ donation should be discussed during routine patient visits. PAs should assure terminally-ill patients that their dignity is a priority and that relief of physical and mental suffering is paramount. PAs should exhibit non-judgmental attitudes and should assure their terminally-ill patients that they will not be abandoned. To the extent possible, patient or surrogate preferences should be honored, using the most appropriate measures consistent with their choices, including alternative and non-traditional treatments. PAs should explain palliative and hospice care and facilitate patient access to those services. End of life care should include assessment and management of psychological, social, and spiritual or religious needs. While respecting patients' wishes for particular treatments when possible, PAs also must weigh their ethical responsibility, in consultation with supervising physicians, to withhold futile treatments and to help patients understand such medical decisions. PAs should involve the physician in all near-death planning. The PA should only withdraw life support with the supervising physician's agreement and in accordance with the policies of the health care institution. The PA and Individual Professionalism Conflict of Interest Physician assistants should place service to patients before personal material gain and should avoid undue influence on their clinical judgment. Trust can be undermined by even the appearance of improper influence. Examples of excessive or undue influence on clinical judgment can take several forms. These may include financial incentives, pharmaceutical or other industry gifts, and business arrangements involving referrals. PAs should disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest to their patients. Acceptance of gifts, trips, hospitality, or other items is discouraged. Before accepting a gift or financial arrangement, PAs might consider the guidelines of the Royal College of Physicians, \"Would I be willing to have this arrangement generally known?\" or of the American College of Physicians, \"What would the public or my patients think of this arrangement?\" Professional Identity Physician assistants should not misrepresent directly or indirectly, their skills, training, professional credentials, or identity. Physician assistants should uphold the dignity of the PA profession and accept its ethical values. Competency Physician assistants should commit themselves to providing competent medical care and extend to each patient the full measure of their professional ability as dedicated, empathetic health care providers. PAs should also strive to maintain and increase the quality of their health care knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and cultural competence through individual study and continuing education. Sexual Relationships PA Program Handbook Page 88 of 90 It is unethical for physician assistants to become sexually involved with patients. It also may be unethical for PAs to become sexually involved with former patients or key third parties. Key third parties are individuals who have influence over the patient. These might include spouses or partners, parents, guardians, or surrogates. Such relationships generally are unethical because of the PA's position of authority and the inherent imbalance of knowledge, expertise, and status. Issues such as dependence, trust, transference, and inequalities of power may lead to increased vulnerability on the part of the current or former patients or key third parties. Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment It is unethical for physician assistants to engage in or condone any form of gender discrimination. Gender discrimination is defined as any behavior, action, or policy that adversely affects an individual or group of individuals due to disparate treatment, disparate impact, or the creation of a hostile or intimidating work or learning environment. It is unethical for PAs to engage in or condone any form of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or academic environment, or Accepting or rejecting such conduct affects or may be perceived to affect professional decisions concerning an individual, or Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's training or professional position. The PA and Other Professionals Team Practice Physician assistants should be committed to working collegially with other members of the health care team to assure integrated, well-managed, and effective care of patients. PAs should strive to maintain a spirit of cooperation with other health care professionals, their organizations, and the general public. Illegal and Unethical Conduct Physician assistants should not participate in or conceal any activity that will bring discredit or dishonor to the PA profession. They should report illegal or unethical conduct by health care professionals to the appropriate authorities. Impairment Physician assistants have an ethical responsibility to protect patients and the public by identifying and assisting impaired colleagues. \"Impaired\" means being unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety because of physical or mental illness, loss of motor skills, or excessive use or abuse of drugs and alcohol. PAs should be able to recognize impairment in physician supervisors, PAs, and other health care providers and should seek assistance from appropriate resources to encourage these individuals to obtain treatment. PA Program Handbook Page 89 of 90 PA-Physician Relationship Supervision should include ongoing communication between the physician and the physician assistant regarding patient care. The PA should consult the supervising physician whenever it will safeguard or advance the welfare of the patient. This includes seeking assistance in situations of conflict with a patient or another health care professional. Complementary and Alternative Medicine When a patient asks about an alternative therapy, the PA has an ethical obligation to gain a basic understanding of the alternative therapy being considered or being used and how the treatment will affect the patient. If the treatment would harm the patient, the PA should work diligently to dissuade the patient from using it, advise other treatment, and perhaps consider transferring the patient to another provider. The PA and the Health Care System Workplace Actions Physician assistants may face difficult personal decisions to withhold medical services when workplace actions (e.g., strikes, sick-outs, slowdowns, etc.) occur. The potential harm to patients should be carefully weighed against the potential improvements to working conditions and, ultimately, patient care that could result. In general, PAs should individually and collectively work to find alternatives to such actions in addressing workplace concerns. PAs as Educators All physician assistants have a responsibility to share knowledge and information with patients, other health professionals, students, and the public. The ethical duty to teach includes effective communication with patients so that they will have the information necessary to participate in their health care and wellness. PAs and Research The most important ethical principle in research is honesty. This includes assuring subjects' informed consent, following treatment protocols, and accurately reporting findings. Fraud and dishonesty in research should be reported so that the appropriate authorities can take action. Physician assistants involved in research must be aware of potential conflicts of interest. The patient's welfare takes precedence over the desired research outcome. Any conflict of interest should be disclosed. In scientific writing, PAs should report information honestly and accurately. Sources of funding for the research must be included in the published reports. Plagiarism is unethical. Incorporating the words of others, either verbatim or by paraphrasing, without appropriate attribution is unethical and may have legal consequences. When submitting a document for publication, any previous publication of any portion of the document must be fully disclosed. PAs as Expert Witnesses The physician assistant expert witness should testify to what he or she believes to be the truth. The PA's review of medical facts should be thorough, fair, and impartial. PA Program Handbook Page 90 of 90 The PA expert witness should be fairly compensated for time spent preparing, appearing, and testifying. The PA should not accept a contingency fee based on the outcome of a case in which testimony is given or derive personal, financial, or professional favor in addition to compensation. The PA and Society Lawfulness Physician assistants have the dual duty to respect the law and to work for positive change to laws that will enhance the health and well being of the community. Executions Physician assistants, as health care professionals, should not participate in executions because to do so would violate the ethical principle of beneficence. Access to Care / Resource Allocation Physician assistants have a responsibility to use health care resources in an appropriate and efficient manner so that all patients have access to needed health care. Resource allocation should be based on societal needs and policies, not the circumstances of an individual patient-PA encounter. PAs participating in policy decisions about resource allocation should consider medical need, cost-effectiveness, efficacy, and equitable distribution of benefits and burdens in society. Community Well Being Physician assistants should work for the health, well being, and the best interest of both the patient and the community. Sometimes there is a dynamic moral tension between the well being of the community in general and the individual patient. Conflict between an individual patient's best interest and the common good is not always easily resolved. In general, PAs should be committed to upholding and enhancing community values, be aware of the needs of the community, and use the knowledge and experience acquired as professionals to contribute to an improved community. Conclusion The American Academy of Physician Assistants recognizes its responsibility to aid the PA profession as it strives to provide high quality, accessible health care. Physician assistants wrote these guidelines for themselves and other physician assistants. The ultimate goal is to honor patients and earn their trust while providing the best and most appropriate care possible. At the same time, PAs must understand their personal values and beliefs and recognize the ways in which those values and beliefs can impact the care they "}
