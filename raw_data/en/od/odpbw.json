METHODS Community-recruited adults aged 50 years and older were random- ized to 1 of 3 study groups: 8-week training in mindfulness meditation, matched 8-week training in moderate-intensity sustained exercise, or observational con- trol. The primary outcome was area-under-the-curve global illness severity dur-ing a single cold and infl uenza season, using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) to assess severity. Health care visits and days of missed work were counted. Nasal wash collected during ARI illness was assayed for neutrophils, interleukin-8, and viral nucleic acid. RESULTS Of 154 adults randomized into the study, 149 completed the trial (82% female, 94% white, mean age 59.3 \u00b1 6.6 years). There were 27 ARI episodes and 257 days of ARI illness in the meditation group (n = 51), 26 episodes and 241 ill-ness days in the exercise group (n = 47), and 40 episodes and 453 days in the con-trol group (n = 51). Mean global severity was 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control. Compared with control, global severity was signifi cantly lower for meditation ( P = .004). Both global severity and total days of illness (duration) trended toward being lower for the exercise group ( P = .16 and P = .032, respec- tively), as did illness duration for the meditation group ( P = .034). Adjusting for covariates using zero-infl ated multivariate regression models gave similar results. There were 67 ARI-related days of-work missed in the control group, 32 in the exercise group ( P = .041), and 16 in the meditation group ( P <.001). Health care visits did not differ signifi cantly. Viruses were identifi ed in 54% of samples from meditation, 42% from exercise, and 54% from control groups. Neutrophil count and interleukin-8 levels were similar among intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS Training in meditation or exercise may be effective in reducing ARI illness burden. Ann Fam Med 2012;10:337-346. doi:10.1370/afm.1376. INTRODUCTION Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is extremely common, often debili- tating, and among the most costly of human illnesses. Infl uenza, the most serious of the viral ARIs, is associated with approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 500,000 hospitalizations in the United States yearly. 1 Nevertheless, symptoms of infl uenza infection are usually indistinguishable from those produced by other viruses.2,3 In the United States each year, noninfl uenza ARI accounts for more than 20 million doctor visits and 40 million lost school and work days, with an economic impact of more than $40 billion, making noninfl uenza ARI rank rst in the top 10 most expensive illnesses. 4 Reducing this burden even modestly could lead to substantial economic and quality-of-life bene ts.Bruce Barrett, MD, PhD1 Confl icts of interest: Bruce Barrett was previously supported by career development grants from the National Center for Complementary and Alter-native Medicine (K23 AT00051) and from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, both of which were essential for developing the methodology and infrastructure for recruiting and monitoring research subjects, and for assessing their acute respiratory infections.

If started early enough, antiviral medications have limited ef cacy for infl uenza, 5 but not for other viral ARIs. Symptomatic treatments may reduce severity slightly but have never been shown to reduce illness duration or overall severity. Infl uenza vaccination is accepted as effective for prevention, 6 but it is imperfect, with sero- protection rates ranging from 60% to 80% in healthy younger adults and 40% to 60% in the elderly. 7 For noninfl uenza ARI, immunization strategies are imprac-tical, and preventive strategies are limited to not smok-ing, 8 hand washing,9 and avoiding sick contacts. There is some evidence that enhancing general physical and mental health may reduce ARI burden. In a series of observational and viral inoculation stud-ies, perceived stress, 10 negative emotion,11 and lack of social support12 predicted not only self-reported illness, but also such biomarkers as viral shedding and infl am-matory cytokine activity. Evidence suggests that mind-fulness meditation can reduce experienced stress and negative emotions. 13,14 Similarly, both epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that regular exercise may protect people from ARI illness. 15,16 A recent observational cohort study (n = 1,002 adults) reported 32% to 46% lower incidence, duration, and severity of ARI illness among the most active vs least active participants. 17 Thus, suf cient evidence exists to justify testing the hypothesis that training in medita-tion or exercise can reduce susceptibility to ARI illness. METHODS DesignThe experimental design used balanced, randomized allocation to 3 parallel groups: (1) mindfulness medita-tion, (2) moderate-intensity exercise, or (3) observa-tional control. Allocation was directed using computer-generated randomization codes (balanced blocks of 3) in sequentially numbered envelopes. The primary aim was to determine whether train- ing in either meditation or exercise could reduce ARI illness burden compared with no intervention in the control group. Secondary aims included assessment of whether self-reported psychosocial states would respond to intervention, and whether these responses could help explain potential effects on ARI outcomes. These measures included perceived stress, positive and negative emotion, perceived social support, anxiety, optimism, sleep quality, and general physical and men-tal health. Secondary aims also included assessment of antibody response to infl uenza vaccination, which will be reported elsewhere. All participants received tri-valent inactivated infl uenza vaccination during week 6 of the interventions.Mindfulness Meditation The meditation intervention was derived from work by Jon Kabat-Zinn and others at the University of Mas-sachusetts Medical Center, where mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) was developed. 18 The Univer- sity of Wisconsin (UW) program has been in existence since 1993. All UW instructors have advanced degrees, and all were trained in Massachusetts by the Kabat-Zinn's group. The standardized 8-week MBSR course includes weekly 2\u00bd-hour group sessions and 45 minutes of daily at-home practice. This intervention, originally designed for stress reduction, is based on the idea that an increased awareness of physical, emotional, and cog-nitive manifestations of stress may lead to a healthier mind-body response to stress. The concept of mindful-ness refers to a state of nonjudgmental awareness, a heightened sensitivity to bodily sensation, and atten-tion to one's own thoughts and emotions. The goal for learners is to continue lifelong meditation practice. Exercise The exercise program was designed and led by senior exercise physiology staff at the UW Health Sports Med-icine Center and was matched to the mindfulness medi-tation program in terms of duration (8 weeks), contact time (weekly 2\u00bd hour group sessions), home practice (45 minutes per day), and location. Two of the 3 UW exer-cise instructors had master's degrees in clinical exercise physiology. The third had a bachelor's in sports manage-ment. All had many years of experience, and all carried licensed athletic trainer and certi ed strength and con- ditioning coach certi cations. Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion was used to guide participants toward moder-ate-intensity sustained exercise, with a target rating of 12 to 16 points on the 6 to 20 point scale. 19 Weekly group sessions were divided into didactic instruction (cogni-tive, logistic, and behavioral) and practice (moderately intensive exercise using stationary bicycles, treadmills, and other equipment). For most participants, home exer-cise consisted of brisk walking or jogging. Control Because this trial was preliminary, we opted for obser-vational control as the comparison study group, hoping to minimize risk of type II, as well as type I, error. 20 Control participants were monitored in the same man-ner as those receiving interventions and were eligible to receive meditation or exercise training, or monetary equivalent, at the conclusion of the trial. Randomization SAS software (SAS Institute Inc) was used to generate 165 unique identi cation numbers in balanced blocks of 3. Codes were concealed in consecutively numbered ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG VOL. 10, NO. 4 JULY/AUGUST 2012 339PREVENTING ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION sealed envelopes, which were opened after consent to indicate allocation. Setting This community-based trial was coordinated by the UW Department of Family Medicine. Behavioral train-ing interventions were conducted at UW Research Park, a multipurpose outpatient clinic with exercise facilities and space suitable for meditation training. Participants Inclusion criteria were aged 50 years or older, willingness to undertake any of the 3 randomization outcomes, and reporting either 2 or more colds in the last 12 months or an average of 1 or more cold per year. Exclusion criteria were previous training or current practice of meditation, moderate exercise at least 2 times a week or vigorous exercise at least 1 time a week, and a score of less than 24 points on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examina-tion 21 or more than 14 points on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression screen22; immunode ciency, autoimmune, or malignant disease; or prior allergic reaction to infl uenza vaccine or egg allergy. Human Subjects and Safety The protocol was approved by the UW Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. The trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was monitored by a data-and safety-monitoring committee. The American Heart Association guidelines 23 for safety when beginning an exercise program were followed. There were no speci c adverse outcomes designated for monitoring. Recruitment and Monitoring Community-targeted recruitment methods included advertising in local media. Prospective participants were screened by telephone and then met in person for entry into the run-in trial, which consisted of 2 in-person appointments, 2 telephone contacts, and 1 set of homework questionnaires. Those completing the run-in trial were eligible for consent and entry into the main trial. For logistical reasons related to NIH funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the study had to be done in 1 year, and 2 cohorts were needed. The rst cohort began in September, and the second cohort began in January. Participants were mon-itored biweekly by telephone beginning postinterven-tion and continuing until study exit at the end of May. Primary Outcome Measures The primary outcome was de ned as area-under-the- curve global severity for all ARI illness days throughout observation, from consent to study exit. During each ARI illness episode, severity was assessed once daily using a 24-item version of the Wisconsin Upper Respira-tory Symptom Survey (WURSS). 24-26 The WURSS-24 adds items assessing headache, body aches, and fever to the well-validated WURSS-21. 27 Daily severity scores come from summing items 2 through 23; the rst and last items are analyzed separately. The beginning of each ARI illness episode was de ned as the time a participant rst answered yes to either: \"Do you think you are com-ing down with a cold?\" or \"Do you think that you have a cold?\" The participant also had to score 2 or more points on the Jackson scale, 28 with at least 1 point from the following cold symptoms (or synonyms): (1) nasal dis-charge (runny nose), (2) nasal obstruction (plugged nose, stopped up nose, stuf ness), (3) sneezing, or (4) sore throat (scratchy throat). To be classi ed as an ARI ill- ness episode, these criteria had to be met at least 2 days in a row. The last day of the ARI illness episode was the last day the participant rated illness severity higher than 0 using the rst item of the WURSS instrument, \"How sick do you feel today?\" Times of self-report were recorded, and illness duration was assessed in hours and minutes and then converted to decimalized days. Par-ticipants were provided Jackson and WURSS question-naires at enrollment and were reminded with each study contact to begin documenting ARI symptoms as soon as they believed they might be getting a cold. Biomarkers With each ARI illness episode, a nasal wash was col-lected within 3 days of symptom onset and analyzed for interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil count, and viral nucleic acid. Elevated neutrophil count and IL-8 levels are indicators of infl ammation and correlate with symptom severity and viral shedding. 29,30 Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods developed and validated at UW were used to identify respiratory viruses. 31 Psychosocial Self-Report MeasuresSeveral validated self-report questionnaires were used to explore potential explanatory pathways linking behav-ioral interventions to ARI outcomes. The SF-12 is a 12-item version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) that measures overall health and provides algorithm-weighted physical and mental health scores. 32 The PSS-10 is a 10-item version of Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale that has been linked to ARI outcomes, including infl uenza. 10 The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)33 assesses positive and negative emo- tion, also known to be linked to ARI outcomes. Spiel-berger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) assesses anxiety either as trait (baseline) or state (secondary out-come, explanatory factor). 34 The 6-item Life Orientation Test (LOT) assesses cognitive aspects of optimism.35 To ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG VOL. 10, NO. 4 JULY/AUGUST 2012 340PREVENTING ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION Figure 1.

The International Physi-cal Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) 38 assessed exercise, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)39 assessed mindfulness. The SF-12, PSS-10, PANAS, IPAQ, and MAAS were administered at baseline, 1 week postintervention, and monthly thereafter. The STAI, LOT, PR, and PSQI indices were scored at baseline, 1 week postintervention, and then again 3 months later. Health Care Utilization and Days of Work or School Missed (Sick Days)During each biweekly telephone call, we asked about visits to health care facilities (clinic, hospital, or urgent care), the reason for the visit, and about missed work or school activities. Health care visits and missed work days were then classi ed as either related or unrelated to ARI illness, both by asking the participant's opin-ion and by cross-checking against cases, classi cation as ARI-related or not was done by the senior author (B.B.), guided by relevant data but blinded to allocation. Statistical Methods The sample size of 150 was based on power estimates contrasting (1) meditation vs control and (2) exercise vs control. To control for multiple testing, we chose a P .025 cutoff for null hypothesis rejection. One-sided testing was justi ed by previously published research, all in the direction of positive results. To arrive at the pri-mary outcome of area-under-the-curve global severity, we rst computed daily WURSS-24 scores by simple sum-mation and then applied trapezoidal approximation over illness episodes. For the less than 2% of missing WURSS-24 data, we assessed patterns of missing data, which satis ed miss-ing-at-random criteria, then applied a multiple imputation strategy, using an expectancy maximization algorithm, 40 which was undertaken before unblind-ing. Unadjusted between-group con-trasts were calculated using 1-sided t tests for continuous variables and proportional difference testing for binomials. Because most participants did not experience ARI illness, zero-infl ated regression models were used to control for potential confounders. These models take into account both logistic (incidence) and linear (days of illness or global severity) data. Covariates used in these models were age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, baseline physical and mental health (SF-12), and cohort. Because global severity was skewed, Box-Cox transformation was used for this outcome in these models. To explore potential causal pathways, we assessed the relationship of secondary outcomes mea-sured just after interventions to the main outcomes. The statistical framework for potential mediation was based on the Baron and Kenny model, 41 modi ed by Krull and MacKinnon,42 and by coauthor Brown.43ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG VOL. 10, NO. 4 JULY/AUGUST 2012 341PREVENTING ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION Additional detail on the results of the zero- infl ated regression models and potential confounders is available in Supplemental Table 1 and Table 2. See Supplemental Table 3 for information on model-data t (available at http://annfammed.org/content/ 10/4/337/suppl/DC1). RESULTS Of 883 adults screened, 204 were entered in the run-in trial; 154 consented and were enrolled and random-ized into the main trial, with 94 in cohort 1 and 60 in cohort 2 (Figure 1). Interventions began in September 2009 for cohort 1 and in January 2010 for cohort 2. Baseline measures were similar across the 3 groups (Table 1). Both cohorts were monitored through May 2010. Retention was high, with 149 (96.7%) providing primary outcome data; 82% were female, 94% were white, and their mean age was 59.3 \u00b1 6.6 years. There were 27 ARI episodes and 257 days of ill- ness in the meditation group, 26 episodes and 241 ARI illness days for the exercise group, and 40 episodes and 453 ARI illness days for the control group (Table 2). Mean global severity across all randomized par-ticipants was 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control (Figure 2). Comparing meditation with control groups, 1-sided t tests yielded P = .034 for ill- ness days and P = .004 for global severity. Comparing exercise with control groups, corresponding P values were .032 for illness days and .16 for global severity. Adjusting for covariates using zero-infl ated multivariate regression models, both total days of illness ( P = .033) and global severity ( P = .010) appeared to be lower for meditation, but not for exercise ( P = 0.47 and 0.31, respectively). Speci c viruses were identi ed for 53.8% of nasal wash samples tested from the meditation group, 42.1% of samples from the exercise group, and 54.3% of control samples (Table 2). Viruses identi ed included adenovi-rus (1), coronavirus (5), (3), respiratory syncytial and rhinovirus (28). Both cases of infl uenza (A/2009/California/H1N1) were in the control group. Mean neu-trophil counts (per high-power eld [HPF]) and IL-8 concentration in the 3 groups were 108/HPF and 910 pg/mL for the meditation group, 104/HPF and 694 pg/mL for the exercise group, and 110/HPF and 658 pg/mL for the control group. Between-group differences were not statistically sig-ni cant for these biomarkers, except for slightly higher IL-8 levels in nasal wash collected during ARIs from participants in the meditation group (P = .022). In the meditation group, there were 99 days of missed work (16 were ARI-related) and 116 health care visits (10 were ARI-related). Among the exercise group there were 91.5 days of missed work (32 ARI-related) and 116 health care visits (15 ARI-related). In the control group there were 144.5 missed days Cohort 2 418 Screened Cohort 2 Run-In Trial n=78 60 RandomizedReasons for exclusion 155 Already had fl u shot 70 Too much exercise 20 Meditation practice/training 33 Declined to participate 62 Other 18 Excluded 17 Declined to participate 1 Failed inclusion criteria 20 Assigned to exercise20 Assigned to meditation20 Assigned to control 2 Withdrew 1 Confl ict with work schedule 1 Interest in a different study 18 Received exercise intervention and included in analysis20 Received medita- tion intervention and included in analysis20 Received control intervention and included in analysis ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG VOL. 10, NO. 4 JULY/AUGUST 2012 342PREVENTING ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION of work (67 ARI-related) and 121 health care visits (16 ARI-related). Total number of health care visits and total and ARI-related missed work days were not statistically distinguishable among the groups. ARI-related absenteeism, however, was signi cantly lower for the meditation group ( P <.001) and marginally so for the exercise group ( P = .041) when compared with the control group. Although most self-reported psychosocial health indicators trended in expected directions, only self-reported exercise and the mental health portion of the SF-12 displayed statistically signi cant differences when compared with the control group (Table 3). Compared with control participants, those assigned to exercise training increased their IPAQ scores at 9 weeks, a change which persisted at 3 months. Statisti-cally signi cant improvements in SF-12 mental health in both groups were more mod-est, and were seen at 9 weeks in the exercise group and at both 9 weeks and 3 months among those assigned meditation train-ing. Statistical analyses directed at assessing potential mediation failed to show clear and convinc-ing pathways from interventions to outcomes. DISCUSSION We observed substantive reduc-tions in ARI illness among those randomized to exercise training, and even greater bene ts among those receiving mindfulness med-itation training. Incidence, dura-tion, and global severity of ARI illness were 29%, 43%, and 31% lower in the exercise group and 33%, 43%, and 60% lower in the mindfulness group, respectfully, compared with control. Although not all of these observed bene ts were statistically signi cant, the magnitude of the observed reductions in ARI illness is surely clinically signi cant. That our ndings are corroborated both by laboratory-measured biomark-ers and by reductions in work absenteeism further supports a positive interpretation. Implica-tions for the workplace may be especially important. Compared with the control group, all-cause absenteeism was 31% lower in both intervention groups. Looking at ARI-related absenteeism, there were 48% fewer days missed in the exercise group, and 76% fewer in the meditation group. For meditation especially, these ndings are unlikely be due to chance. Given that apart from hand washing, no ARI prevention strategies have before been proven, these ndings are especially noteworthy. This clinical trial has both strengths and limitations. In terms of strengths, this randomized trial is the rst to assess effects of mindfulness meditation on ARI ill-ness and the rst to use a validated outcome measure to assess effects of exercise on ARI illness. It is also the rst to compare 2 behavioral interventions with a valid control condition, allowing head-to-head comparative effectiveness assessment.

ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG VOL. 10, NO. 4 JULY/AUGUST 2012 343PREVENTING ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION to assess infl ammation is also a strength. Limitations include the inescapable fact that participants in such a trial cannot be blinded to behavioral training interven-tions, thus allowing for the possibility of self-report bias. Also, even with the large effect sizes observed, our sample size was only marginal for statistical signi cance for several outcomes. Although it is not likely that our ndings are entirely due to chance, the a priori selection of P .025 as a cutoff for null hypothesis rejection does leave that statistical possibility open for some outcomes. Finally, interpretation of results is limited in that the rst cohort was followed for a full cold and infl uenza season, Table 2.

The data do not suggest generalized self-report bias. If participants in the control group were overreporting ARI illness, we would expect them to also report a similar magnitude of improved scores on other self-report health measures, which they did not do. Similar think-ing applies to the biomarkers. If participants in the intervention groups were under-reporting ARI illness, one might expect that the episodes they did report would be relatively more severe, with higher levels of infl amma-tory markers and higher viral identi cation rates. These trends were not seen, except for mar-ginally higher IL-8 levels in the meditation group. Table 3.

One partial explanation may be that this was a relatively healthy population. National norms for similarly aged adults using the SF-12 are 46.3 for physical health and 50.1 for mental health. 44 At baseline, participants in our study had SF-12 scores of 50.5 and 51.4, respec-tively. Our participants also reported less stress than is usual, with mean PSS-10 scores of 11.9, well below national averages of 13.4 reported in 2006 and 14.5 in 2009. 45 Interpreting these ndings, one might hypoth- esize that sicker and more stressed people would have more to gain, and that similar interventions might yield greater bene ts in those populations. That hypothesis deserves further testing. In conclusion, this ground-breaking randomized trial of meditation and exercise vs wait-list control among adults aged 50 years and older found signi cant reductions in ARI illness. Corresponding reductions in time lost to work point toward socioeconomic as well as personal health bene ts. If these results are con rmed in future studies, there will be important implications for public and private health-related policy and prac-tice, as well as for scienti c research regarding mecha-nisms of health maintenance and disease prevention.
