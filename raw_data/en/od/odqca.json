Blind (DSB) DSB-01 DSB-03 DSB-04 DYS-19DAAS-1ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF AGING AND ADULT SERVICES INTRODUCTION SFY 2014 PRESIDENCYThe Division's mission is to promote the health, safety and independence of older Arkansans and adults with physical disabilities by working toward two primary goals: (1) to provide administrative support services for aging Arkansans and adults with physical disabilities; and (2) to enhance the quality of life for aging Arkansans and adults with physical disabilities . The Division is responsible for planning coordinating, funding, and evaluating programs for older adults and adults with physical disabilities that are authorized by both state and federal governments. The federal organization that makes the Older Americans Act a reality is the Administration on Aging (AoA). AoA is directly under the U.S. Depar tment of Health and Human Services (HHS). The administr ative network reaches through the 10 regional offices of HHS to the 56 State Units on Aging (SUAs) and some 618 Area Agencies on Aging (AA As).HISTORY A growing nationwide awareness of the problems of the elderly and the needs for services and assistance on their behalf led to the passage of the Older Americans Act in 1965. This legislation, which created the Administration on Aging at the federal level, also mandated the establishment of a state unit on aging in each state to administer programs under the Act. Accordingly, the Arkansas Office on Aging was established in 1966 by proclamation of Governor Orville Faubus under the auspices of the Governor's Office. Since 1965, the Older Americans Act has been amended several times, each time expanding the roles of state units on aging. Arkansas legislation has also changed the name of the state unit on aging, the organizational location, and its authority and funding responsibilities. In 1971, the State Unit was placed within the Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services. The responsibility for Adult Services was assumed in 1972. The agency achieved divisional status through Act 228 of 1977, and the responsibility for adult protective services was transferred by the General Assembly in 1979. As a result of Act 348 of 1985, the Division of Aging and Adult Services (DAAS) was created within the reorganized Arkansas Department of Human Services. In 1997 the Division began providing services to adults with physical disabilities. Recommends policy, develops regulati ons to implem ent the Old er Americans Act (OAA ) and administers the OAA budget, grants for research, training, model projects, etc. Coordinate state level activities on behal f of older people, develop and administer the state plans on aging, serve as advocates, and provide technical as sistance to Area Agencies on Aging. Develop and implement the area plans on aging, serve as advocates for older people, coordinate with other agencies and organizations in the planning and service areas to develop comprehensive aging service systems, and administer the Older Americans Act programs within their jurisdictions.DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES ADMINISTRATION ON AGING REGIONAL OFFICES ON AGING (10 Regions) STATE UNITS ON AGING (56 Jurisdictions) AREA AGENCIES ON AGING (618 Agencies) Source: DAAS Website and Division of Aging and Adult ServicesProvide technical assistance to states and monitor state aging programs.THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGING NETWORKMISSION AND OBJECTIVE SDAAS-2Black 11 Total 200 Asian 1 Native American 0GENDERARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DAAS SERVICES PROVIDED SFY 2014 Senior Citizens Centers provide a wide range o f services for aging adults, typically including recreational activities for adults, socialization, educational programs, and other services.

Priority populations for DBHS mental health services are individuals found not guilty by reas on of mental disease or defect, indiv iduals assessed as potentially violent, other forensic clients, adults with a serious mental illness, and children and adolescents with a serious emotional disturbance. The Arkansas State Hospital includes 90 adult acute care beds, 96 forensic beds, and 36 adolesc ent beds. Admission to acute care beds is through a referral from the state's CMHCs. Admission to forensic beds, for either evaluation and/or treatment, is by a circuit court order. The Arkansas Health Center provides skilled nursing home services for individuals with mental health problems that cannot be effectively managed in other nursing homes. The Center also provides some other specialized nursing home care.ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES INTRODUCTION SFY 2014 Act 383 of 1977 called for the renaming of the Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services to the \"Department of Human Services\". Reorganization of the Department of Human Services, brought about through the provisions of Act 348 of 1985, resulted in the transfer of operations of the two State operated Community Mental Health Centers (CMJCs) and responsibility of providing CMHCs statewide to the Department of Human Services. The authority and responsibility for operating for operating the institutional programs remained with the State Hospital Board. Act 1162 of 1995 abolished the State Hospital Board, and Arkansas Youth Services Board, and created the DHS State Institutional System Board to provide oversight for State operated facilities of Behavioral Health and Youth Services. Unlike other State Agencies regulated by various Boards and Commissions, the State Institutional Systems Board has limited authority in terms of budgeting, purchasing, personnel, policies, or other matters ascribed to the Department of Human Services. Act 1717 of 2003 created the Division of Behavioral Health Services within the Department of Human Services and transferred the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Program from the Department of Health to the new Division of Behavioral Health Services. Mission and Objectives The Division of Behavioral Health Services' (DBHS) mission is to fulfill legislative mandate and administrative intent to provide leadership and devote its resources to facilitate effective prevention, quality treatment, and meaningful recovery. The goal of the Division of Behavioral Health Services is to facilitate services that are: Trauma informed Gender sensitive Recovery based Age Informed Culturally and linguistically competent Client centered Family driven Evidence based/informed Cost effective Performance and outcome drivenDBHS-2Substance Abuse Services The Division of the Behavioral Health Services is the single state agency responsible for funding of alcohol and drug prevention and treatment services, providing court ordered treatment, licensing of alcohol and drug treatment programs, the State Methadone Authority, administering the Drug and Alcohol Safety Educational Programs, gambling treatment, juvenile drug court, Access to Recovery, and providing training in the field of substance abuse DBHS distributes federal funds from the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant to provide alcohol and drug prevention and treatment services in the state. Prevention services are funded through 3 grants (Block Grant, Strategic Pr evention Enhancement (SPE), and State Epidemiological Outcome Workgroup (SEOW)) to provide subgrants and to contrac t with local programs, comm unities and other organizations to provide an array of prevention services and data collection and analysis. Subgrants include the 13 Prevention Resource Centers (PRC) and six \"Lead and Seeds\" in the state that are designed to respond to the needs of a partic ular geographical area to support its prevention initiatives. DBHS licenses 52 alcohol and drug treatment programs in the state and appr oves Opioid Treatm ent prov ision that court-ordered persons rec eiving treatment meet the requirements of the Substance Abuse Commitment Law. Alc ohol and drug treatment services are provided through various funding sour ces. DBHS funds the following treatment services: Five secure treatment beds that provide secure treatment for court committed clients from outside of the Central Arkansas Area;Eight funded residential/outpatient treatment centers (as of January of 2014*) that provide alcohol and drug counseling service coupled with room and board when necessary. Court-Ordered Referral and Treatment Program providing court ordered treatment for clients committed to treatment under the Substance Abuse Commitment Law from Central Arkansas;Ten funded Regional Alcohol and Drug Detoxification Centers that provide detoxification services to persons needing supervised w ithdrawal from some type of substance abus e; SFY 2014ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES INTRODUCTION Each of the state's 13 CMHCs provides services in one of 13 designated geographic catchment areas that enc ompass the entire state. All CMHCs are nationally accredited by either the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) or the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcar e Organizations (JCAHO). CMHCs operate out of 119 sites located in 65 of the state's 75 counties. Servic es are provided in all counties of the state through off-site outreach. CMHCs provide screenings for all persons referred for publicly supported inpatient care, including at the Arkansas State Hospital and in local ps ychiatric hospital beds paid for through funds provided to the CMHCs. Additionally CMHCs provide a comprehensive array of clinical and rehabilitative mental health services including: crisis intervention and stabilization; mental health, psychiatric, psychological and forensic assessment; treatment planning; individual, family, and group therapy ; medication ent; case management; day treatment/partial hos rehabilitation day programs; specialized s ervices for children with serious emotional disturbance, including interagency service coordination and wr ap-around; prevention, consultation, and education; and other supportive services such as housing, vocational, and foster care services.

Both boards oversee the quality of persons providing alcohol and drug counseling and prevention services. DBHS also administers two major data collection efforts that include the Arkansas Prevention Needs Assessment Student Survey conducted and published annually, and the Risk Factors for Adolescent Drug and Alcohol Abuse in Arkansas, an archival data report compiled from various state data sources.DBHS administers and funds eight Drug and Alcohol Safety Educational Programs (DASEP). DASEP is responsible for providing the court with a Pre-sentence Screening Report on all persons adjudicated for Driving While Intoxicated/Driving Under the Influence of alcohol or other drugs. Educational services are also provided by the DASEP for those offenders required to take an educational course to get their driver license reinstated. Training services for the field of alcohol and drug services are funded by DBHS through contract and grants with Mid- South Addiction Training Network, Mid-South Summer School, and the Prevention Institute. These organizations provide training throughout the state for persons working in the field of substance abuse. During SFY 2014, 67,641 persons received mental health services through DBHS mental health programs, 16,750 received substance abuse treatment services, and 61,003 received alcohol and substance abuse prevention services. Tables 7 through 10 show the unduplicated number of mental health clients served by each provider. The total served in these tables (69,591) represents the duplication across providers in the system. Thus, there were 1,950 instances (69,591- 67,641) during the year of a person who had received mental health services from one provider, also receiving mental health services from another provider. For SFY 2014, Substance Abuse Services reports no duplication across providers. A t otal of 16,750 unduplicated persons received substance abuse treatment services. Gambling treatment follows the same structure as treatment for drug addiction or other similar addictions.

The Licensing Unit worked closely with Northrop Grumman to redesign the central licensing computer system (CLEAN). The new system (CCLAS) is an \"occasionally connec ted\" system that improves the efficiency of staff, and increases communication with providers. It went live on September 2010, with Better Beginnings functionality added and released for produc tion in July 2011. The Better Beginnings Unit is responsible for maintaining a quality accreditation system which consists of three quality tiers abov e minimum licensing requirements. Providers qualifying for levels abov e minimum licensing are entitled to grants based on their level. Implementation of Better Beginnings began in July 2010. The goal of the B etter Beginnings Unit is to improve the quality of care for children in child care settings by increas ing the number of programs participating in Better Beginnings. The B etter Beginnings program started with 684 programs participating. At the end of SFY2014, it had 1,032 total pr ograms participating. This indicates an increase of 51%.ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT LICENSING AND ACCREDITATION SFY 2014 The Child Care Licens ing Unit was placed with the Division of Child Car e and Early Childhood Education following the passage of Act 1132 in 1997. The Accreditation program became part of the unit in 2005 when the Division began work on \"Better Beginnings\", a quality rating and improvement system for licensed center and home child care providers. In July of 2009, the Placement and Residential Licensing Unit was placed with the Division. With this growth, the unit was renamed the Licensing and Accreditation Unit, which consists of three parts: Child Care Licensing, B etter Beginnings, and Placement and Residential Licensing. The Licensing and Accr editation Unit is responsible for licensing child care situations where m ore than five (5) children are car ed for, maintaining the V oluntary Registry for persons providing care to five (5) or fewer childr en and choose to be registered, administering Better Beginnings, and the licensing of child placement, residential, and adoption agencies . The unit routinely inspects licensed centers and licensed and r egistered homes a minimum of three (3) times per year. Some licensed centers or homes that are Better Beginnings level 2 or higher and have high levels of compliance may be placed on a reduced monitoring schedule. Technical assistance and consultative services are provided to licensed and registered programs, applicants, par ents, and to programs that are participating in, or who hav e applied for, Better Beginnings. The Child Care Licensing unit inv estigates complaints of non-compliance on licensed and registered child care facilities. The Unit also assis ts the Crimes Against Children Division of the Arkansas State Police, and the Division of Children and Family Services in the investigation of child maltreatment complaints in these facilities. The Child Care Licensing Unit is responsible for proc essing and tracking background checks on all child care owners/operators and employees through the FBI, State Police, and the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Central Registry. Child Care Licensing ensures that appropriate corr ective action is taken on any persons found to have a record of child maltreatment, and that persons who have a convic tion of a prohibited offens e are removed from child care. DCCECE-19The Placement and Residential Unit has a system called PRLS that supports the work processes of the Unit. The first phase has been in use and supports the monitoring of DCFS foster homes. The second phase, released J une 2014, completely supports the full monitoring of the unit, inc luding all placement and residential licensing facilities.ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT LICENSING AND ACCREDITATION SFY 2014 The Placement and Residential Licensing Unit is responsible for licensing child placement and residential agencies. This includes state and private agencies that have one or more programs such as placement, foster care, therapeutic foster care, residential facilities, psychiatric facilities, sex offender facilities, emergency shelters and adoption agencies. The Placement and Residential Licensing Unit investigates complaints of non-compliance on lic ensed agencies. The unit also assists the Crimes Against Children Division of the Arkansas State Police, and the Division of Children and Family Services in the investigation of child maltreatment complaints in these facilities. The Licensing staff members ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken on any persons found to have a record of child maltreatment, and that persons with a prior conviction of a prohibited offense are removed from caring for children.DCCECE-20Arkansas 11 635 8 112 747 0 0 Ashley 20 1,642 2 20 1,662 0 0 Baxter 25 2,400 4 52 2,452 0 0 Benton 140 18,566 24 286 18,852 1 5 Boone 21 1,494 8 104 1,598 0 0 Bradley 12 729 0 0 729 0 0 Calhoun 3 85 1 10 95 0 0 Carroll 8 748 7 82 830 1 5 Chicot 20 1,626 8 89 1,715 0 0 Clark 21 1,494 3 42 1,536 0 0 Clay 10 556 4 58 614 0 0 Cleburne 10 905 2 30 935 0 0 Cleveland 3 144 5 62 206 0 0 Columbia 20 1,278 1 10 1,288 0 0 Conway 15 1,186 6 78 1,264 0 0 Craighead 82 6,959 20 223 7,182 0 0 Crawford 29 2,237 9 96 2,333 0 0 Crittenden 44 3,880 10 118 3,998 0 0 Cross 18 1,047 6 66 1,113 0 0 Dallas 7 594 2 32 626 0 0 Desha 13 1,472 2 26 1,498 0 0 Drew 15 1,236 5 68 1,304 1 5 Faulkner 52 5,508 19 268 5,776 0 0 Franklin 12 793 5 74 867 0 0 Fulton 5 316 3 42 358 0 0 Garland 51 5,079 8 103 5,182 1 5 Grant 5 355 1 10 365 0 0 Greene 28 2,506 3 32 2,538 0 0 Hempstead 12 728 4 46 774 0 0 Hot Spring 19 1,271 2 26 1,297 0 0 Howard 10 601 6 96 697 0 0 Independence 24 2,975 3 30 3,005 0 0 Izard 8 330 1 10 340 0 0 Jackson 9 734 0 0 734 0 0 Jefferson 53 5,977 19 194 6,171 2 9 Johnson 12 1,110 6 78 1,188 0 0 Lafayette 7 363 2 32 395 0 0 Lawrence 16 1,226 1 10 1,236 0 0 Lee 7 396 3 30 426 0 0Total Licensed (RCCFH) Voluntary RCCFH Capacity(LCCFH) Licensed LCCFH CapacityARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT CHILD CARE FACILITIES SFY 2014 Licensed Facilities Registered Facilities County(CCC) Child Care CCC CapacityDCCECE-21Lincoln 5 333 0 0 333 0 0 Little River 6 312 2 26 338 0 0 Logan 12 910 9 108 1,018 0 0 Lonoke 40 3,272 8 110 3,382 3 15 Madison 8 266 5 62 328 0 0 Marion 6 249 4 58 307 0 0 Miller 20 1,161 7 88 1,249 1 5 Mississippi 40 2,934 11 140 3,074 1 5 Monroe 8 290 5 49 339 0 0 Montgomery 4 120 3 42 162 0 0 Nevada 7 306 0 0 306 0 0 Newton 8 172 1 10 182 0 0 Ouachita 16 853 22 246 1,099 0 0 Perry 6 316 0 0 316 0 0 Phillips 25 1,350 7 104 1,454 0 0 Pike 10 458 1 10 468 0 0 Poinsett 20 1,186 0 0 1,186 0 0 Polk 11 814 0 0 814 0 0 Pope 33 2,791 5 73 2,864 0 0 Prairie 5 154 0 0 154 0 0 Pulaski 368 36,582 36 327 36,909 13 65 Randolph 11 593 1 16 609 0 0 Saint Francis 13 1,012 10 116 1,128 0 0 Saline 46 4,636 10 124 4,760 0 0 Scott 4 383 2 20 403 0 0 Searcy 5 301 0 0 301 0 0 Sebastian 90 6,961 11 120 7,081 1 5 Sevier 10 443 4 46 489 0 0 Sharp 8 413 8 116 529 0 0 Stone 6 254 3 36 290 0 0 Union 30 2,270 1 10 2,280 0 0 Van Buren 9 462 3 42 504 0 0 Washington 131 12,360 34 399 12,759 2 10 White 43 4,299 9 126 4,425 0 0 Woodruff 6 373 4 40 413 0 0 Yell 11 939 2 32 971 0 0 Total 1,958 171,709 451 5,441 177,150 27 134 *Includes: Licensed Facilities with Preschool, Infant/Toddler and/or School Age license types * * Includes: Registered Relative Family Homes Source: Child Care LicensingSFY 2014 Licensed Facilities Registered Facilities County(CCC) Child Care CCC Capacity(LCCFH) Licensed LCCFH CapacityTotal Licensed ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT CHILD CARE FACILITIES (RCCFH) Voluntary RCCFH CapacityDCCECE-22CountyTotal Capacity SFY 2014Total Capacity SFY 2013Difference CountyTotal Capacity SFY 2014Total Capacity SFY 2013Difference Arkansas 747 822 -75 Lee 426 441 -15 Ashley 1,662 1,797 -135 Lincoln 333 373 -40 Baxter 2,452 2,368 Little River 338 Madison 328 328 0 Calhoun 95 111 -16 Marion 307 303 4 Carroll 835 874 -39 Miller 611 3 Montgomery 162 243 -81 Cleburne 935 921 14 Nevada 306 346 -40 Cleveland 206 222 -16 Newton 182 198 -16 Columbia 1,288 1,241 47 Ouachita 1,099 1,092 7 2,864 2,845 19 Desha 5,220 Scott 403 419 -16 Grant 365 367 -2 Searcy 301 346 -45 Greene 2,538 1,214 83 Sharp 529 560 -31 Howard 763 -29 Washington 2 Johnson 1,188 968 220 Woodruff 413 413 0 Lafayette 395 349 46 Yell 971 974 -3 Lawrence 1,236 1,288 -52 Total 177,284 177,449 -165 *Does Registered Homes Source: Child Care LicensingARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT CAPACITY OF CHILD CARE BY COUNTY SFY 2013 vs. SFY 2014*DCCECE-23\"All 3\" equals refers to facilities that hold all three age groups \"IT Only\" equals Infant/Toddler Only \"IT/PS equals Preschool/ School Age Only \"SA Only\" equals School Age Only State Fiscal Year All 3 IT/PS only PS/SA only IT Only PS Only SA Only 2011 365 513 72 25 595 196 2012 407 544 77 31 623 219 2013 447 555 104 37 658 238 2014 489 627 109 37 736 236 Source: Child Care LicensingARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT CHILD CARE LICENSE TYPES* SFY 2011- 2014 CHILD CARE LICENSE TYPES* *Please note that this chart is different than previous years.

Included in this Act was the provision to create a Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS). This legislative action culminated several years of departmental review and legislative interest in the delivery of services to children, youth, and families throughout the State of Arkansas. Specifically, Act 348 combined into DCFS all functions and duties of the Division of Youth Services (DYS) as provide in Act 502 of 1977, child welfare functions of the Division of Social Services, and residential treatment services for emotionally disturbed youth previously provided by the Division of Mental Health Services (DMHS). In 1993, the 79th General Assembly enacted Act 1296, which authorized the Governor to create a Division of Youth Services (DYS) within DHS. The juvenile justice functions of DCFS were transferred to the newly created DYS. In 1997 the 81st General Assembly enacted Act 1132, which authorized the creation of the Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education (DCC) within DHS. The daycare licensing, day care eligibility and special nutrition functions of DCFS were transferred to the newly created division. The General Assembly also enacted Act 1240, which authorized the formation of a Family Protection Unit within the Arkansas State Police (ASP) to conduct child abuse investigations. The Central Intake and Special Investigation functions of DCFS were transferred to the newly created Family Protection Unit, presently called Crimes Against Children Division of the Arkansas State Police. Lastly, in 1997, Act 1014 created the Child Welfare Agency Review Board. The Board was given the authority to promulgate rules and regulations to enforce the provisions of this act. The Board was also given authority to identify and implement alternate methods of regulations and enforcement. The Board licenses residential child welfare facilities and child placement agencies including agencies that provide foster care or adoption services. Mission and Objectives The mission of DCFS is to keep children safe and help families. DCFS will respectfully engage families and youth and use community-based services and supports to assist parents in successfully caring for their children. We will focus on the safety, permanency and well-being for all children and youth. To accomplish the mandates of Act 348, DCFS is functionally organized into the following major areas: Office of the Director supervises the executive staff and program managers. Office of Community Services is responsible for the direct and purchased services delivery of child welfare services in each of the 75 counties of the state. Office of Finance and Administrative Support provides financial, budgeting, funds management, accounts payable, contracts management and personnel support. Office of Operations provides is responsible for day to day operations for DCFS. Quality Assurance management is contracted with Hornby Zeller Associates Inc., and falls under the direction of the Division Director.

This and subsequent legislation expanded the responsibility of the agency to serve individuals with cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, spina bifida, and Down syndrome. In 1981, Act 513 was passed and changed the name and official title of the agency and Board to the Division and the Board of Developmental Disabilities Services. Under this Act, the Arkansas Children's Colonies became the Human Development Centers (HDCs). There are five HDCs across the state; the first opened in 1959 in Conway, and the last opened in 1978 in Warren. Act 38 of 1971 transferred the Arkansas Department of Intellectual Disabilities and its functions, powers, and duties to the Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services, which is now the Department of Human Services (DHS). Act 348 of 1985 authorized the reorganization of the Department of Human Services (DHS), and under this change DDS became one of 13 divisions/offices comprising an integrated services system. This Act designated control and administration of the HDCs under the management and direction of the DDS Board with daily operation authority extended to the DDS Director, in coordination with the Director of DHS. The Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDS) provides an extensive range of services to individuals in community settings.

In 1965, Title XIX of the Social Security Act created grant programs t o provide federal grants to the states for medical assistance programs. Title XIX, popularly known as Medicaid, enables states to furnish: Medical assistance to those who have insufficient incomes and resources to meet the costs of necessary medica services and Rehabilitation and other services to help families and individuals become or remain independent and able to care for themselves. Each state has a Medicaid program to meet the federal mandates and requirements as laid out in Title XIX. Arkansas however, established a medical care program 26 years before passage of the federal laws requiring health care for th needy; Section 7 of Act 280 of 1939 and Act 416 of 1977 authorized the State of Arkansas t o establish and maintain medical care program for the indigent. The Medicaid program was implemented in Arkansas on January 1, 1970. The Department of Human Services (DHS) is the single Arkansas state agency authorized and responsible for regulating and administering the Medicaid program. DHS administers the Arkansas Medicaid Program through the Department of Medical Services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administer the Medicaid Program for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS authorizes federal funding levels and approves each state's State Plan, e nsuring compliance with federal regulations. Individuals are certified as eligibl e for Arkansas Medicaid services by DHS Field Staff located in DHS County Offices or by District Social Security Offices. Mission To ensure that high-qu ality and accessible health care services are provided to citizens of Arkansas w ho are eligible fo Medicaid or Nursing Home Care. Programs The Division of Medical Services houses two major programs under one administration: ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF MEDICAL SERVICES INTRODUCTION SFY 2014 A list of covered services can be found on page DMS-13 of this publication.

Many of these optional services enable recipients to receive care in less costly home or community-based settings. Optional services are approved in advance by CMS and are funded at the same level as mandatory se rvices. The Department of Human Services (DHS) is the single state agency authorized and responsible for regulating and administering the program. DHS administers the Medicaid Program through the Division of Medical Services (DMS). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicaid Program for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS authorizes federal funding levels and approves each state's State Plan, ensuring compliance with federal regulations. Individuals are certified as eligible for Medicaid services by DHS Field Staff located in DHS County Offices or by District Social Security Offices.Medicaid Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides medical assistance for eligible individuals based on financial need and/or health status. Medicaid furnishes medical assistance to those who have insufficient incomes and resources to meet the costs of necessary medical services. It also provides rehabilitative and other services to help families and individuals become or remain independent and able to care for themselves. DMS-1DMS-2 Each year, more than 25,000 Arkansans who have chronic, long-term medical needs require services in long- term care facilities. These individuals live in approximately 227 nurs ing facilities and 42 intermediate care facilities for the Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities that are licensed to provide long-term care s ervices in Arkansas. Improving the quality of life for residents and protecting their health and safety through enforcing state and federal standards are primary goals of Arkansas Medicaid's Office of Long Term Care (OLTC). Using qualified health care professionals, OLTC inspects all facilities to ensure residents receive the care they need in a clean, safe environment and that they are treated with dignity and respect. The Office of Long Term Care (OLTC) also surveys Adult Day Care, Adult Day Health Care, Post Acute Head Injury Facility, Residential Care Facilities, and Assis ted Living Facilities. In addition to surveying facilities, OLTC administers the Nursing Home Administrator Lic ensure program, Criminal Back ground program, Certified Nursing Assistant registry and training pr ogram, processes Medical Needs Determinations for Nursing Home and Waivers and operates a Complaints Unit.

The LTC Section maintains a database of the cost report information, which is used to evaluate cost and develop reimbursement methodologies and rates. The LTC Section is also responsible for processing all necessary retroactive reimbursement rate change mass adjustments for these providers.Provider Reimbursement develops reimbursement methodologies and rates, identifies budget impacts for changes in reimbursement methodologies, coordinates payments with the Arkansas Medicaid Fiscal Agent and provides reimbursement technical assis tance for the following Ark ansas Medicaid providers: Institutional - The Institutional Section is responsible for processing: all necessary cost settlements for in-state and border city Hospitals, Residential Treatment Units and Federally Qualified Health Clinics; calculating and reimbursing annual hospital Upper Payment Limit amounts, hospital quality incentive payments and hospital Disproportionate Share payments; calculating per diem reimbursement rates for Residential Treatment Centers; processing and implementing all necessary rate changes within Medicaid Management Information System for the above named providers and pr ocessing all necessary retr oactive reimbursement rate c hange mass adjustments for these provider s.

This unit works with multi-payers, staff and contractors to design and deliver episodes of care for acute conditions; implement new models of population-based health care for chronic conditions (e.g., patient-centered medical homes and health homes); develop and coordinate infrastructure requirements; and facilitate stakeholder, provider and beneficiary engagement through the Arkansas Health Care P ayment Improvement Initiative.ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT MEDICAID ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT DESCRIPTIONS Now in its third year of work, HCI continues in its mission to improve the health of the population, enhance the patient experience of care, including quality, access, and reliability; and reduce, or at least control, the cost of health care. The main goal is to move the Arkansas health system from a payment model that rewards volume to one that rewards high-quality, efficient outcomes for patients by aligning financial incentives for how care is delivered. Patient-Centered Medical Hom es (PCMH), while not a physical location, embody prevention and wellness efforts of a patient- centered, coordinated care across all provider disciplines. With the goals of promoting and rewarding prevention and early intervention, coordinated team -based care and clinical innov ation will result in more efficient delivery of high-quality care. Today, visits to primary care doctors often focus on acute illnes ses with much less attention to managing chronic conditions. PCM Hs can change that by actively promoting prevention services, such as vaccines, and empowering patients with the education they need to stay healthy. Since its inception, 658 Primar y Care Physicians (PCPs) have enrolled in PCM Hs (includes those enrolled in both PCMH and CPCi, the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative.) To date, there are 310,446 Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in PCMHs and/or CPCi. The enrollment is twice the anticipated volum e and speak s to the success of the p rogram. Another segment of Health Care Innovation that has already been implemented is the Retrospective Episodes of Care. To date, thirteen (13) Episodes have gone live (including Perinatal, Congestive Heart Failur e, Total Joint Replacement, Colonoscopy, Cholecystectomy, Tonsillec tomy and three types of Upper Respiratory Infections.) With Episodes of Care, providers are rewarded for providing high quality, cost efficient care. And those providers whose c osts exceed the performance of their peers must make payments to the Medic aid program. Through July 2014, Retrospective Episodes of Care has produced over 15,600 reports to almost 2,000 individual providers responsible for a patient's care. In order to create these detailed reports, approximately 226.5 million Medicaid claims have been processed to format jus t under 2.67 million indiv idual episodes (before ex clusions). Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield and QualChoice continue to participate and launch selec ted episodes of care and in the creation of PCMHs. Implementation of the multi-payer provider portal, where providers can enter quality metric data and access historical and performance measurement reports, continues around quality metric portal design for future episodes and provider report format based on lessons learned and feedback. Efforts have begun to increase toward the development and implementation of assessment-based episodes and enhanced care coordination support through health homes models for developmental disabilities, behavioral health and long term services and supports s ervice populations. The Continuity of Care and Coor dination of Coverage unit is responsible for coordinating DMS efforts in the implementation of the Health Care Independence Program and assisting with coordination of coverage for enrollees as they move in and out of Medicaid and transition to private health insurance programs. The unit is also responsible for the administration and oversight of the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which implements required structural changes to enhance Medicaid-funded Home and Community Based Services (HCBS). Additionally, this unit supports other Medic aid initiatives and coordinates with all areas within DMS, several other DHS Divisions, and other State a gencies.DMS-24Arkansas Medicaid reimbursement for prescription drugs is based on cost plus a dispensing fee. Drug costs are established and based upon a pharmacy's Estimated Acquisition Cost (EAC), and the federally established Generic Upper Limit (GUL) or State Established Upper Limit (SUL). Arkansas Medicaid has a dispensing fee $5.51 as established by the Division of Medical Services and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). The EAC and dispensing fee are based upon surveys that determine an average cost for dispensing a prescription and the average ingredient cost. In Marc h of 2002, a differential fee of $2.00 was established and applied to generic prescriptions for which there is not an upper limit. The following table shows the average cost per prescription drug in the Arkansas Medicaid program. The Prescription Drug Program, which is an optional Medicaid benefit, was implemented in Arkansas in 1973. Under this program, eligible beneficiaries may obtain prescription medication through any of the 867 enrolled pharmacies in the state. During SFY 2014, a total of 464,661 Medicaid beneficiaries used their prescription drug benefits. A total of 5.1 million prescriptions were reimbursed by Arkansas Medicaid for cost of $326.3 million dollars thus making the average cost per prescription approximately $63.98. An average cost for a brand name prescription was $295 dollars, representing 16% of the claims and accounting for 69% of expenditures. The average cost for a generic prescription was $25 dollars, repr esenting 84% of claims and accounting for 31% of expenditures.ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM The Prescription Drug Program restricts each beneficiary to a maximum of (3) three prescr iptions per month, with the capability of getting up to (6) six prescriptions by prior authorization, except for beneficiaries under 21 years of age and certified Long-Term Care beneficiaries are not restricted to the amount of prescriptions received per month. Persons eligible under the Assis ted Liv ing Waiver are allowed up to (9) nine prescriptions per month. Beginning January 1, 2006, full benefit, dual-eligible beneficiaries began to receive drug coverage through the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 rather than through Arkansas Medicaid. Arkansas Medicaid is required to pay Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) the State Contribution for Prescription Drug Benefit, sometimes referred to as the Medicare Part D Clawback.

When this occurs, the OLTC performs an on-site complaint investigation. They are often able to resolve the issues with the immediate satisfaction of the involved parties. The OLTC received eight hundred and sixty-five (865) nursing home complaints during SFY 2014 regarding the care or conditions in long-term care facilities.The Criminal Record Check Program applies to all categories of licensed long-term care facilities consisting of over five hundr ed and sixteen (516) affected facilities. During SFY 2014, there were thirty-four thousand five hundred fifty-six (34,556) \"state\" record checks processed through OLTC and twenty thousand eight hundred and nineteen (20,819) \"federal\" record check s processed with a total of nine hundred and eight hundred thirty-three (833) disqualifications under both categories combined (2.00% of the disqualifications were due to the total number of state background checks performed) . NOTE: Approximately 64% of licensure renewals have been processed to date. At the end of SFY 2014, the Registry for Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) contained thirty thousand five hundred and twenty -five (30,525) active and seventy-six thousand three hundred and seventy-nine (76,379) inactive names. In addition to maintaining the Registry for CNA 's, the OLTC also manages the certification renewal process for CNA s, approves and monitors nursing assis tant training programs, manages the statewide competency testing services, and processes reciprocity transfers of CNAs coming into and leaving Arkansas. The Medical Need Determination Unit processed approximately one thousand two hundred and sixty-six (1,266) Arkansas Medicaid nursing facility applications per month while maintaining approximately twelve thousand two hundred fifty-one (12,251) active cases. The unit also processed ten thousand three hundred and eighty -four (10,384) assessments, one thousand nine hundred and ninety -five (1,995) changes of condition requests, five hundr ed and two (502) transfers, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight (1,928) utilization review requests and two thousand and three hundred and seven (2,307) applications/reviews for ICFID, which includes three hundred and seventy-seven (377) new asses sments and sixteen (16) transfers during the year. The unit completed three thousand five hundred and seventy (3,570) TEFRA applications and one hundred and five (105) autism waiver applications. Additionally, the unit completed fifteen thousand three hundred and eight (15,308) applications/reviews/waivers for other medical programs within the Department of Human Services during SFY 2014. ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT OFFICE OF LONG TERM CARE Most people think of nursing facilities when they think of the Office of Long Term Care (OLTC) . The OLTC profess ional surveyors conduct annual Medicare, Medicaid and State Licensure surveys of Arkansas' two hundred and twenty-sev en (227) Nursing Facilities and forty-two (42) Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICFID), including five (5) Hum an Development Centers. Annual and complaint surveys are also conducted in thirty-five (35) Adult Day Care and Adult Day Health Care facilities and two (2) Post-Acute Head Injury Facilities throughout the state. Semi-annual surveys are conducted in the sixty-one (61) Residential Care Facilities, eighty-two (82) Assis ted Living Facilities and fourteen (14) Alzheimer's Special Care Units . Additionally, annual Civil Rights surveys are conducted in one hundred and nine (109) hospitals. In SFY 2014, twenty-nine (29) face-to-face medical need d etermination vis its were made throughout the state. In addition to its role inspecting long-term care facilities, the OLTC provides training and educational opportunities to various health care providers to help ensure that facilities provide the highest level of care possible to long term care residents. OLTC staff provided approximately fifty-six (56) hours of continuing education through twenty-five (25) workshops/seminars to over one thousand and twenty-seven (1,027) staff members in the nursing home and assisted living industry during SFY 2014. Furthermore, there were two hundred and fifty-three (253) agendas submitted from outside sources for review to determine one thousand three hundred and thirteen (1,313) contact hours for nursing h ome administrators. The Nursing Hom e Administrator Licensure Unit processed renewals for six hundred and sixty-s even (667) licensed administrators, and ninety-two (92) license applications, and issued forty-s even (47) new licenses and fourteen (14) temporary licenses. Additionally, OLTC administered the state nursing home administrator examination to seventy-five (75) individuals.SFY 2014DMS-26Public Development CenterARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT LONG-TERM CARE MEDICAID PROGRAM SFY 2014 Since 1990, the federal long-term care program has had two levels of facility care under Medicaid. These levels of care are nursing facility services and intermediate care facility services for the intellectually disabled (ICF/ID). Arkansas classifies state-owned facilities as public and all others as private. Arkansas Health Center is a public nursing facility. The ICF/ID population is divided into the five (5) state-owned Human Development Center s, four (4) private pediatric facilities of which three (3) are for profit, one (1) private nonprofit pediatric facility, and thirty-three (33) fifteen (15) bed or less facilities serving adults. The nursing facilities include one (1) public and two hundred and twenty-four (224) private under Medicaid.

In 1977, the Office was established by Act 865 to assess and recognize the needs of communities throughout Arkansas and train volunteer coordinators and volunteer organizations in meeting those needs. In 1983, the Office of Volunteer Services transferred from the Office of the Governor to the Depar tment of Hum an Services (DHS). AR Code 25-16-206 officially made the agency the Division of Volunteerism. AR Code 25-10-128 (Act 1259 of 1997) expanded the duties of the Division of Volunteerism to include assistance to any agency or community organization with welfare reform initiatives. The division name was changed from Division of Volunteerism to the Division of Com munity Service and Nonprofit Suppor t (DCSNS) effective July 1, 2011 by Act 42 of 2011. The mission of the division is to strengthen community resources, volunteerism and national service in Arkansas. DCSNS continues to assist in special projec ts, meet comm unity needs and provide greater public awareness and recognition of volunteer efforts. The vision of DCSNS is guided by the principle that volunteerism, community and national service is a right and respons ibility of all citizens and that all people will experience an improved quality of life as a result of this service. The units within DCSNS work as a team to provide a wide array of trainings and services directed at building organizational capacity in Arkansas nonprofits and recognition of volunteers to fulfill the vision. The Governor's Advisory Commission on National Service assists DCS NS' Arkansas Service Commission unit in efforts related to national service. The 18 Advisory Com missioners serve three year terms , with an additional eight ex-officio positions repres enting related organizations. The Commission's responsibilities include serving as the state's liaison and voice to national and state organizations which support the mission, developing a state service plan, and reviewing and r ecommending state AmeriCorps grant recipients.Governor's Advisory Council and Commissioners History & Overview VisionThe Governor's Advisory Council on Volunteerism consists of 16 members appointed to three-y ear terms (Act 865 of 1977).

All direct services are made available to consumers in their own communities. DSB serves consumers through three interdependent units: Field Services, Business and Technology Services, and the DSB Directors Office. These three service units were designed by the DSB Board to offer two advantages t o t he State of Arkansas:ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF SERVICES FOR THE BLIND INTRODUCTION SFY 2014 During the 1940's and early 1950's, rudimentary services for blind people were provided by \"home teachers\" who were employed by the Arkansas Department of Welfare. In 1955, services to blind people were transferred to the Arkansas Rehabilitation Services, then to the Department of Education. Arkansas Rehabilitation Services for the Blind was created in 1965 by Arkansas Act 180. This Act established a Division of Rehabilitation Services for the Blind within the State Board for Vocational Education. All services for the blind were transferred to said Division from the Arkansas Rehabilitat ion Services. Act 38 of 1971 transferred the functions, powers, and duties of the Rehabilitation Services for the Blind to the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (now the Department of Human Services) and placed them in the Division of Rehabilitation Services.Agency History Arkansas Act 393 of 1975 amended Arkansas Act 38 of 1971 to require that the functions, powers and duties of the Rehabilitation Services for the Blind be located within an Office for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the Division of Rehabilitation Services. Act 393 gave the Office for the Blind and Visually Impaired statutory authority and legal authority to promulgate rules, and established an Advisory Committee appointed by the Governor. In 1983, a number of consumer, education, and service organizations identified a critical need for specialized services to visually impaired and blind Arkansans. In response to this concern, the Governor and Legislature established the Division of Services for the Blind (DSB) under Act 481. Although previously, Arkansas had offered separate services for blind and visually impaired persons, Act 481 provided that the agency should be governed by a policy-making board, the majority of whom must be blind persons. Within the past decade, DSB has been commended for innovative programming, consumer responsiveness, and consistently high performance in the rehabilitation of severely disabled persons.

Within the constraints of state and federal laws and based on available funds, t he Division of Services for the Blind fulfills its mission through t he following goals:Our mission is to work in partnership with these Arkansans by assisting them in obtaining the information they need to make informed choices and by providing them with access to services that increase their opportunities to live as they choose.DSB-3ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF SERVICES FOR THE BLIND SFY 2014 DSB Field Services AGE RANGE 14-21 22-39 508 25840-49 50-59325During the 2014 state fiscal year, DSB provided specialized services to blind and visually impaired persons through two major program units. Field Services offered vocational rehabilitation and independent living services to blind and severely visually impaired persons in their homes and communities throughout Arkansas. Business and Technology Services provided assessment of technological and job development needs, then prescribed equipment and training plans to meet those needs in a rapidly changing job market and business environment. The DSB Director's Office supported the programs offered above through supplemental administrative services as well as operating the Arkansas Information Reading Services for the Blind Network. Vocational Rehabilitation- The objective of the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program is to ensure that qualified blind and visually impaired persons work in appropriate careers and become as personally and economically independent as possible. The program assesses consumer needs, plans appropriate services based upon informed consumer choice, and develops and provides cost-effective services for individuals who are blind or severely visually impaired. Consumers usually range in age from 14 to 64. The vocational rehabilitation services provided are consistent with the strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities and informed choice of the disabled individual. To be eligible for DSB services, the individual must have a visual disability. The visual disability must be a substantial impediment to employment. It must be determined that the individual with the visual disability can benefit from vocational rehabilitation services in the achievement of a vocational outcome. Additionally, the individual requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, engage in, or retain gainful employment. After an individual is determined eligible for vocational rehabilitation, services are provided. In SFY 2014, DSB served 1,627 vocational rehabilitation consumers, of which 100% were severely disabled. Of this number, 336 blind or severely visually impaired individuals successfully achieved employment outcomes.

Vision Children and families in Arkansas are safe and have the resources they need in their communities to help them succeed. Values This plan is based on a number of shared values and beliefs among stakeholders for juvenile justice reform: State resources and programs to support children and families in Arkansas should be coordinated in asystem of care for maximum effectiveness. This imperative must infuse every goal and strategy in this plan.Mission Source: Division of Youth ServicesRedirecting resources from incarceration and punishment to prevention and treatment will be more effective, less costly, and lead to greater public safety for citizens of the state.History Act 199 of 1905 established the first reform schools in Arkansas in Little Rock and Alexander, respectively. Act 67 of 1917, the Arkansas Boys' Reform School was relocated to Pine Bluff. Act 60 of 1937 established two additional \"training\" schools at Wrightsville and Fargo. In 1968, the Department for Rehabilitative Services was assigned responsibility to administer \"training\" schools. The Benton Services Center was opened and controlled the diagnosis and intake responsibilities regarding the youth committed to state custody. In 1971, Act 38 established the Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services (SRS), a forerunner to the current Department of Human Services (DHS). The Office of Juvenile Services was placed under the direction of the Director of SRS. In 1977, the Division of Youth Services was formally created as a division within the current present DHS. In 1985, Act 348 merged the Division of Youth Services with the Division of Children and Family Services until Act 1296 of 1993 reestablished DYS as an independent division within DHS. The Division of Youth Services (DYS) was authorized by Act 1296 to be \"devoted entirely to handling the problems of youths involved in the juvenile justice system.\" DYS became operational in October 1993 and is responsible for client-specific programming and individual treatment programs, serious offender programs for violent youth offenders, providing alternative community-based programming, and other services specified directly by Act 1296.DYS-2Source: Division of Youth ServicesARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF YOUTH SERVICES INTRODUCTION SFY 2014 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. An effective juvenile justice system will require creative partnerships among state agencies, public and private schools, churches and faith-based organizations, local communities, the judicial system, and foundations.Youth and families should receive services in community centers close to their homes whenever possible. This will allow more community buy-in, family involvement, and ease of transition after treatment. Response to children in trouble should involve multi-system interventions with their families, and families should be involved in needs assessment and planning. Programs and services should be strength-based and empower youth and families to succeed. Programs and services should be evidence-bas ed or have data showing effec tive outcomes. To achieve this accountability will require better baseline data and on-going data shar ing as well as a commitment to data-based decision making. All children and youth in the state should have equal opportunities for fairness, help and success without regard to gender, race or ethnicity, disability, geographic location, income level, or any other factor.Values (Continued)DYS-3ARKANSAS DHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF YOUTH SERVICES SFY 2014 In SFY 2014, the Division of Youth Services contracted with Community Based Providers (CBP) for the following services: Targeted Casework Management, Therapy, Diagnosis and Evaluation, Intens ive Casework Management, Interstate Com pact, Emergency Shelter and Residential Treatment.
