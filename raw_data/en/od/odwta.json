New elements of standard precautions include Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette and Safe Injection Practices (See Appendix D). http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/gl_isolation_standard.html Policy 2.2 Hand Washing All staff must observe good personal hygiene, which includes hand washing. Staff should wash hands before and after each patient contact; before donning and after removing gloves or other personal protective equipment; before preparing and after administering medications or injections; after handling objects contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials; after using the toilet, blowing your nose, or covering a sneeze or cough; and before eating, drinking, or handling food. Policy 2.2.1 Hand-Washing Facilities All established clinics must be equipped with hand-washing facilities which are readily accessible to employees. Note: Proper hand washing is the single most important means of preventing the spread of infection! Procedure Key Points If possible, remove jewelry from hands and 1. wrists.Only a minimum amount of jewelry should be worn during clinic care. Wet hands under running water. Avoid 2. touching hands to sink surfaces. Lather hands well with soap, hand antiseptic, 3. or surface antiseptic from a dispenser. Wash fingers, in between the fingers, under the fingernails, palms, backs of hands, and wrists, for 15 seconds.Bar soap should be used only if soap dispensers are unavailable. It has been proven that bar soap can harbor bacteria if left undrained. If bar soap is to be used, provide a self-draining soap dish. Run water over the soap briefly before replacing it in the soap dish. Remove and clean the inside and outside of the soap dispenser when it needs to be refilled. Keep it free of soap build-up. Rinse hands thoroughly.4. Dry hands with paper towels.5. Use paper towels to turn off the faucet.6. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 2-3Procedure Key Points If hands are not soiled with organic debris, use an 7. instant hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.Hand sanitizers are as effective as soap and water; however, hands should be washed after every 10 uses or as soon as possible. Apply hand lotion as needed.8. Frequent hand washing removes skin oil. Using a hand lotion will lubricate the skin and prevent excessive drying and chapping. Note: As parents change diapers on their infant(s) during clinic visits, good hand-washing practices should be reinforced at that time. Soiled diapers should be discarded in rest room waste containers. Remember to wash hands and any other skin surface with soap and water, or flush mucous membranes with water immediately or as soon as feasible following direct contact with blood or other body substances. Report mucous membrane or non-intact skin contact with blood or other body substances to your supervisor immediately! (See Policy 2.11, \"Post-Exposure Management for Occupational Exposure to Blood or Other Potentially Infectious Materials [OPIM]. \") Policy 2.3 Use of Gloves/Barrier Precautions Gloves shall be worn when it can be reasonably anticipated the healthcare worker may have hand contact with blood, semen, vaginal secretions, urine, feces, saliva, sputum, vomitus, or any body substance. Note: Throughout the manual, unless otherwise specified, the term \"gloves\" will refer to disposable latex examination gloves or suitable equivalent such as vinyl gloves or glove liners used underneath the latex gloves, if the employee is allergic to latex. Employees who are allergic to latex should not wear latex gloves or inhale powder from latex gloves worn by other staff. Procedure Key Points Gloves shall be used for all procedures where 1. exposure to blood or body substances is expected, including patient care, cleaning equipment and environmental surfaces directly contaminated with such substances, or during any \"vascular access procedure. \"Disposable gloves will be made available for all staff to wear when contact with body substances is expected. Vascular access procedures include such things as phlebotomy and finger or heel sticks. It is recommended that gloves be worn on 2. both hands.When both hands are gloved, be careful not to contaminate equipment and surfaces while performing patient exams. If cross-contamination of surfaces and equip - 3. ment is anticipated, one hand should remain ungloved and not used to perform the exam.Employees should evaluate their working situations to determine appropriate glove use. 2-4 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 2Procedure Key Points Change gloves between patient contacts. 4. Gloves should not be washed or disinfected for continued use. Gloves should not be reused.Washing gloves with soap may cause \"wicking\" (i.e., the enhanced penetration of fluids through undetected holes in the gloves). Disinfecting agents will lead to glove deterioration. If the gloves become torn or punctured, 5. discard them and put on a new pair.Gloves should be checked for tears and should not replace hand washing. If breaks in the skin are present on the hands, 6. additional coverings may be worn under the gloves.Glove liners, bandages, gauze, or finger cots can help minimize hand irritations. For environmental cleaning purposes, heavier 7. reusable household gloves may be used. They can be washed with soap and water after use and hung to dry.The light weight examination gloves do not hold up under prolonged exposure to disinfection procedures. Discard the household gloves if they are 8. cracked, peeling, torn, or punctured, or show other signs of deterioration. Note: The use of gloves is not intended to replace good hand-washing practices; rather, it is meant to support and supplement hand washing.

Wear personal protective equipment appropriate to the task being performed.2. Healthcare workers who have exudative lesions/weeping dermatitis or open sores 3. should cover woulds, if possible, and refrain from direct patient care until the condition resolves. Change clothing splashed with blood or body fluids as quickly as feasible.4. Remember that gloves will not provide protection against needle sticks or other 5. percutaneous injuries. Gloves will, however, help to reduce the amount of blood or body substance entering into a wound, when the needle penetrates the glove. Policy 2.4 Use of Additional Personal Protective Equipment Additional forms of barrier protection such as goggles, masks, and gowns are necessary if splattering of blood or other body fluids is anticipated. Patients with signs or symptoms of infectious tuberculosis disease should wear a surgical or procedure mask; and healthcare workers, visitors and others entering the room of a suspected or confirmed infectious TB disease patient should wear minimum N95 disposable respirators that are user-seal checked. Policy 2.5 Provision of Personal Protective Equipment The employer shall provide, at no cost to the employee, necessary personal protective equipment and clean or replace such items as needed. 2-6 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 2Examples of Personal Protective Equipment for Protection from Table 2: Occupational Exposure to Blood and Body Fluids1 Task/ActivityDisposable Gloves Gown MaskProtective Eye wear Bleeding control for spurting blood Yes Yes Yes Yes Bleeding control with minimal bleeding Yes No No No Emergency childbirth Yes Yes2Yes Yes Blood drawing Yes No No No Handling and cleaning instruments with microbial contaminationYes Optional Optional Optional Measuring blood pressure No No No No Measuring temperature No No No No Giving an injection No3No No No Policy 2.6 Safety-Engineered Sharps Employee will use recommended safety-engineered sharps devices. Policy 2.7 Sharps Containers Employee will immediately, or as soon as possible, dispose of contaminated sharps into appropriate containers that are placed close to work area. Policy 2. 8 Employee Immunizations All employees will be in compliance with established departmental policies regarding immunizations and TB skin tests. Policy 2. 8.1 Employer Provision of Vaccines Employee policies outlined in the following documents are to be followed:1. Appendix A, \"DSHS Health Policy Statements, \" \"Employee Immunization\" (9/04). All positions in which the employee's duties include direct contact with patients, the public, or material from patients with infections will be identified. Specific vaccinations will be incorporated into job descriptions in the \"Special instructions\" section of Department of State Health Services Immunization Policy OS-3408 3. 1 Adapted from Centers for Disease Control Guidelines and OSHA standard, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens; Final Rule, December 6, 1991. 2 Gowns are not needed unless soiling of clothing is likely. 3 Gloves may be used at an employee's discretion. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 2-7eMp l o y e e policiesProcedure Key Points Employee policies outlined in the following 1. documents are to be followed: Appendix A, \"DSHS Health Policy Statements, \" \"Employee Immunization\" (9/04), and \"TB Skin Testing and Management Policy\"(2005).This document outlines requirements for pre-exposure vaccinations and TB screening. All positions in which the employee's duties 2. include direct contact with patients, the public, or material from patients with infections will be identified. Specific vaccination requirements for these positions will be incorporated into the Facility Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan ..Because of their direct contact with patients, the public, and material from patients with infections, healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, emergency medical personnel, dental professionals, medical and nursing students, laboratory technicians, hospital volunteers, administrative and clerical staff, hospital and clinic housekeeping staff, and others) are at increased risk for exposure to and possible transmission of TB and vaccine-preventable diseases. Employee vaccination, serology, and/or 3. infection history will be documented and reviewed to identify additional vaccinations or tests which are required.Vaccination not only protects employees from diseases transmitted by the patients and public they serve, but also protects patients and the public from becoming infected through exposure to healthcare workers. Newly hired employees will be offered required 4. vaccines, serological tests, or TB screening within 10 days of their initial assignment.Recommended TB screening intervals vary by risk of exposure. Periodic TB screening identifies recent convertors who would benefit from preventive therapy and prevents transmissions to clients and staff. Immunization records will not be inserted 5. in personnel records, but will be maintained in separate files to preserve employee confidentiality.Separate files for immunization records will permit easy access for evaluation as needed. Employee health files can serve this purpose. For more information regarding employee immunizations, contact your regional immunization program manager, or the DSHS Immunization Division at 1-800-252-9152. Policy 2.9 Employee TB Skin Testing DSHS will provide employees who have worksite risk of exposure to Tuberculosis (TB): Skin testing at specified intervals, appropriate user-tested masks; referral and post exposure follow-up treatment as needed. (See TB Skin Testing and Management Policy in Appendix A.) Policy 2.10 Orientation of Employees All employees with potential for occupational exposure will be oriented to infection-control guidelines within oyment, as changes occur in policies and practices concerning infection control, and annually thereafter. Documentation of training will be maintained. 2-8 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 2Policy 2.10.1 Employer Provision of Staff Orientation Staff orientation shall be provided during normal working hours, at no cost to the employees. Procedure Key Points All employees should be informed about the 1. risks of significant infection they are exposed to in the occupational setting.Presentation of the information should be geared to the educational level of the employee. Supervisors will ensure that training sessions 2. are provided to review these infection control guidelines with new employees at their initial assignment and annually thereafter.General principles of infection control should be included in the discussion. Employees should understand:3. the routes of transmission of various a. infectious diseases, especially those for the bloodborne diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV/AIDS;Diseases to be discussed include, but are not limited to, those listed in Policy 5.1, \"Identification/ Isolation of Potentially Infectious Patients. \" Refer to Appendix D, \"Infectious Diseases Information. \" other relevant epidemiologic aspects of b. occupationally acquired infectious diseases; an explanation of the department's c. bloodborne pathogen exposure control plan as outlined in this manual; a review of the \"OSHA Bloodborne d. Control Plan and chapter 96 \"Texas Bloodborne Pathogen Rule. \" the basic principles of standard precautions, e. and the uses and limitations of personal protective equipment; strategies to reduce occupational exposure, f. including the use of engineering controls and work practice controls, and safety- engineered sharps devices;Topics such as when to use various personal protective equipment and the types of protective items appropriate to the task will be discussed. how to dispose of potentially infectious g. waste, contaminated clothing, equipment, sharps, and other items such as gloves, etc.; the protective action to take in the event of h. spills or personal exposure to tissue or fluids, and the appropriate reporting measures; the department's i. Post Exposure Prophylaxis Policy for reporting and managing needle - sticks and other direct exposures to blood and other potentially infectious materials;Refer to Appendix B, \"Post-Exposure Management, \" for a summary of these procedures and the 2005 CDC Post Exposure Prophylaxis Guidelines. an explanation of the signs, labels, or color-j. coding regarding hazard communication. staff should be provided training in the use k. of safety engineered sharps devices. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 2-9eMp l o y e e policiesProcedure Key Points Employees at risk should be provided 4. tubercu losis education that includes annual respiratory-protection training in the use of respiratory devices; TB disease signs and symptoms, screening, transmission, and management. Staff should be given initial orientation, 5. annual training, and updates as needed in the content of the Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan and the Infection Control Manual for Ambulatory Care .

Policy 2.11 Post-Exposure Management for Occupational Exposure to Blood or Other Potentially Infectious Materials (OPIM) All accidental exposures of employees or patients to blood, blood products, secretions, or other body substances via percutaneous, parenteral, or mucosal routes shall be reported immediately, and appropriate post-exposure evaluation/treatment initiated, according to departmental policy. Policy 2.11.1 Employer Provision of Post-Exposure Management The employer shall ensure that all medical evaluations, procedures, prophylaxies, and counseling are made available at no cost to the employee and at a reasonable time/place. A licensed healthcare professional will evaluate the exposure and recommend treatment and follow-up as indicated. 2-10 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 2Procedure Key Points All employees should be aware of the risks 1. of acquiring an infection from occupational exposure in a healthcare setting. See Policy 2.8, \"Orientation of Employees. \"Exposure to bloodborne pathogens is defined as parenteral (needlestick or other punctures of the skin with a used needle or other sharp item), mucous membrane (splatters/aerosols into the eyes, nose, or mouth), or direct contamination of an open wound or non-intact skin with a body substance. All accidental exposures of employees to 2. patient blood or body substances shall be reported to the employee's direct supervisor immediately.If the direct supervisor is unavailable, the incident shall be reported to the next available supervisor or authorized person (e.g., clinic coordinator, nursing director, regional physician). Regardless of the source of exposure, first aid 3. consists of washing exposed skin site with soap and water or irrigation of exposed eyes with clean water/saline/sterile irrigant. For DSHS only, the employee or their 4. supervisor must complete the (Accident/ Incident Report) on-line through AccessHR http://www.accesshr.hhsc.state.tx.us .See Appendix B, \"Post-Exposure Management\" for examples of current forms and forms developed specifically for the purpose of documenting an occupational exposure to blood or OPIM. Enter employee number and password.a. Click on \"Health and Safety. \"b. A drop down Click on the yellow \"Add\" box and complete e. form. Then click on the \"Add\" on the bottom right f. hand corner. The form will automatically forward to g. AccessHR service center for handling. A copy will also automatically forward to h. the employee's supervisor and HHS risk management. If you need to exit the system prior to i. completion of the accident form, you may save your work and come back to complete the form at a later time. However, please complete the form as soon as possible after the accident occurs (preferably within 24 hours). If a supervisor enters an Accident/Incident j. report on behalf of a non-employee or an unavailable employee, they will need go through the \"Manager's Center\" menu to choose \"Add an Accident/Incident. \" Then follow the procedure above. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 2-11eMp l o y e e policiesProcedure Key Points The employee's supervisor or designee is 5. responsible for coordination of post-exposure management as specified in Appendix B.The tasks to be coordinated in post-exposure manage ment, include completing the risk assess ment, documentation of exposure in AcessHR if the employee has not done so, collecting seralogical information on the employee and the source (if available), HIV-related counseling, referral to an evaluating healthcare pro fessional as needed, and the providing of appro priate post-exposure prophylaxis within one hour of the incident pending the results of serologic follow-up. Document the route(s) of exposure and the 6. cir cum stances under which the exposure inci dent occurred on the AccessHR Accident/ Incident form (On-line at AccessHR); Employee Exposure Assessment (Appendix B); (Appendix B). Also see the information sheet titled \"Workers Compensation Accident Reporting for all HHS Agencies\" except State Schools and State Hospitals (Appendix B).This information will be important in risk assessment and management of the exposure incident. If post-exposure therapy for HIV is warranted, 7. the first dose should be administered as soon as possible (within one hour of exposure is ideal).See Appendix B, \"Post-Exposure Management. \" Post-exposure counseling will be given within 8. 10 calendar days of the exposure.Check with the HIV program manager for a list of qualified counselors in the area or region. When required for decisions regarding manage - 9. ment of hepatitis B prophylaxis, employee hepatitis B surface antibody results should be available within 72 hours.Postponing testing of the baseline serum will undermine the success of hepatitis B intervention. The employee may refuse all or part of the 10. recommended post-exposure management procedures. Document which step of the process was refused, and have this signed by both the employee and supervisor. Attach this documentation to the appropriate post-exposure form specific for bloodborne pathogens (see Appendix B).Be certain that the employee understands that refusal to submit a baseline serum for HIV antibodies or have it tested within 10 calendar days of the exposure will result in forfeiture of his/her eligibility for HIV-related workers' compensation. Failure to complete the scheduled follow-up serologic evaluation for HIV will also result in forfeiture of eligibility for HIV-related workers' compensation. The supervisor shall make available, or ensure 11. it is made available, to the evaluating healthcare professional the following information:The employee has the option to select an eval- uating healthcare professional outside the department. The evaluating healthcare professional will review the information provided and determine what prophylaxis may be needed. a copy of the \"OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens a.

B vaccination and/or serologic status, which may be relevant to the post-exposure treatment. Test results should remain strictly confidential 12. and be filed in the employee's health record.Any test, treatment, or follow-up procedure should be documented, but serologic test results should not be put into the employee's personnel file. The employer must obtain and provide the 13. employee with a copy of the evaluating healthcare professional's written report within 15 days of its completion in accordance with \"OSHA standard Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens; Final Rule\" (see Appendix C, \"OSHA Standards\").This report will document the need, if any, for completion of hepatitis B vaccine series, and that the employee has been advised of the evaluation's results and any medical conditions that may arise as a consequence of exposure. Employee health records will be maintained 14. for the duration of employment plus 30 years thereafter.

Surfaces which are likely to be contaminated with blood or body fluids will be cleaned daily, and must be cleaned and disinfected after contamination. Policy 3.1.1 Routine Schedule for Cleaning and Disinfection The facility will maintain a written schedule for cleaning and disinfection, outlining the surfaces and areas to be cleaned, the cleaners or disinfectants used, and the employees involved in the process Procedure Key Points Dilute solutions of chlorine bleach, or any 1. disinfectant-detergent formulations labeled as registered by the EPA, can be used for cleaning environmental surfaces.If using an EPA-registered disinfectant-detergent, follow the manufacturer's instructions for use (see note at end of Policy 3.1). Remember that the physical removal of micro - organisms by scrubbing is just as important as the anti-microbial action of the disinfectant used. If chlorine bleach is to be used for routine 2. cleaning/disinfection, a solution of bleach and water will be mixed and put in a labeled opaque spray bottle. The bleach solution must be mixed at 1:10 concentration.A 1:10 solution can be used up to a week. See Appendix E, \"Principles of Sterilization and Disinfection; Classification of Device, Processes, and Germicidal Products; and Formulas for Mixing Chlorine Bleach. \" If using a spray disinfectant, leave the 3. disinfectant on the surface for required length of time and then wash off and let dry according to manufacturer's directive.When spraying wear mask and eye protection. Do not use spray when patientss are present. Wear gloves while cleaning.4. Rinsing is very important in removing soil and chemical residue. It is especially important when using chlorine-bleach solutions, as residual chlorine can be damaging to metal surfaces. Reusable gloves should be inspected for tears or holes before using. They should be washed with soap and water and hung to dry after use. Replace the gloves if they are cracked, peeling, torn, etc. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 3-3Procedure Key Points Maintain and consult current \"Material Safety 5. Data Sheets\" on all products in order to deter mine appro pri ate precautions and to prevent hazardous conditions during product applications. Note: General information on sterilization and disinfection can be found in Appendix E, \"Principles of Sterilization and Disinfection. \" For a current listing of chemical disinfectants and sterilants registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, contact any of the OSHA regional offices in Texas. Check the government section in your local telephone directory for the office nearest you. Policy 3.2 Cleaning Up Blood and/or Body Secretion Spills Spills will be cleaned immediately or as soon as feasible, using a 1:10 chlorine-bleach solution or other appropriate EPA-registered disinfectant. Policy 3.2.1 Use of Chemical Germicides Chemical germicides that are registered by the EPA as \"hospital disinfectants\" and are tuberculocidal are to be used to clean up spills of blood or body secretions. Those disinfectant-detergent formulations not designated as \"hospital disinfectants\" should be reserved for general cleaning of environmental surfaces. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for using any EPA disinfectants. The procedures below address cleaning spills with a chlorine-bleach solution. Procedure Key Points When using chlorine bleach, a 1:10 solution of 1. chlorine bleach should always be available in a labeled, opaque spray bottle.The 1:10 solution of chlorine bleach can be used for up to one week. Make sure the dispensers are labeled clearly 1:10 Chlorine-Bleach Solution 1:10. Indicate on the label the date the solution was prepared. See Appendix E, \"Principles of Sterilization and Disinfection, \" for bleach-solution formulas. Put on household gloves.2. Take care not to splash the blood or body 3. secretions into your mouth or eyes. If the circumstances are such that aerosolization may occur, a mask and goggles must be worn. Cover the spill with disposable absorbent 4. toweling. Apply the disinfectant solution by spraying it or pouring it directly onto the covered area.When using any disinfectant in concentrated form or in large amounts (such as with spill cleanup), always make sure the area is well ventilated. 3-4 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 3Procedure Key Points Remove the majority of the spill with dis-5. pos able absorbent toweling. Place towels in heavy-duty garbage bag, and add absorbent material as needed. Dispose of in waste re - ceptacles marked with the BIOHAZARD label.Heavy-duty garbage bags should be at least 1.2 mil minimum thickness. Examples of absorbent material added to the bags include additional paper towels or kitty litter. See note at the end of Policy 3.2, \"Cleaning Up Blood and/or Body- Secretion Spills, \" and see Policy 4.3, \"Waste Treatment and Disposal Methods. \" When dealing with a large spill, reapply 6. disinfectant directly to the cleaned spill area, then remove with absorbent toweling.Longer contact times are required when more organic matter is present. Equipment used in spill cleanup (tongs, dust 7. pans, brooms with plastic bristles), should be decontaminated with the chlorine-bleach solution, washed with soap and water, and hung to dry.The reusable household gloves should be washed with soap and water and hung to dry after all the spill clean-up equipment has been decontaminated and washed. After spill cleanup, hands should be washed 8. with soap and water. Commercial blood spill clean-up kits are 9. available for purchase. Note: General information on sterilization and disinfection can be found in Appendix E, \"Principles of Sterilization and Disinfection. \" Policy 3.3 Exam Tables/Infant Scales All exam tables and infant scales should be cleaned daily with an appropriate disinfectant solution, and disposable coverings for exam surfaces should be used. Procedure Key Points Table paper or absorbent pads will be 1. changed on all exam tables and infant scales after use by each patient.This decreases the possibility of tables becoming contaminated with secretions, excretions, and/ or blood. Unless there is oil on the table, surface disinfection between patients is not necessary. Table paper or absorbent pads with no visible 2. soil or body fluids can be discarded with routine solid waste.If the paper or absorbent pad becomes con tam i- nated, the soiled covering must be discarded in waste containers identified with color coding or the BIOHAZARD symbol. See Policy 4.5, \"Other Clinic Waste, \" for the specifications of these waste containers. If the table or scales become soiled, remove 3. obvious organic soil with disposable towels and follow instructions in Policy 3.2, \"Cleaning Up Blood and/or Body Secretion Spills. \"Wear gloves during this cleaning procedure. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 3-5ster ilization a n d disinfec tion o f clinic eq u i p Me n tProcedure Key Points All exam tables and infant scales should be 4. cleaned at the end of each day with a chlorine- bleach solution of 1:10 concentration and left on surface for 10 minutes, or use an appropriate EPA-registered low-level disinfectant-detergent for non critical medical equipment according to manufacturer's directive. Surfaces cleaned with chlorine-bleach solutions or germicidal detergents should be left on surface for appro priate length of time and then cleaned with soap and water to remove residue. Glutaraldehyde is a high level disinfectant and is NOT appropriate for cleaning surfaces. Hospital low-level disinfectant detergents are an acceptable substitute to chlorine-bleach solution, but are less economical as a routine cleaner. Avoid prolonged contact of metal surfaces with chlorine-bleach solution, as bleach is corrosive and may pit surface. Rinse and dry the treated surface thoroughly.

See Policy3.1\"Counters/Sinks/Tables/Trays. \" Policy 3.4 Thermometers Mercury thermometer use is not recommended. Digital and ear thermometers must be cleaned according to manufacturer's instructions. Procedure Key Points Digital and Other (Such as Ear) Thermometers When using thermometers with disposable 1. sleeves or sheaths, use a new sleeve or sheath for each patient. Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning.2. Policy 3.5 Devices Used in Procedures Involving Blood All devices used in procedures involving blood shall be cleaned, disinfected, or discarded after each use, as directed below. Procedure Key Points Automatic Lancet DevicesA. Only safety-engineered disposal lancets 1. should be used. Contaminated lancets should be deposited in appropriate sharps containers immediately after use.Sharps containers should be placed close to work area and not overfilled. Vacutainer SleevesB. 3-6 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 3Procedure Key Points Vacutainer sleeves (blood tube holders) are 2. to be used only one time because they are reported to have a 50-80% con tam i na tion after one use and because the health worker is put at risk of a sharps injury during removal of the contaminated needle.Blood tube holder (vacutainer sleeve) Figure 1: Other Safety-Engineered DevicesC. Plastic or mylar-wrapped capillary tubes, 3. plastic blood tubes, and plastic slides should be used. Safety-engineered blood tube holders 4. should be used. Safety-engineered syringes and needles 5. should be used. The list of safety-engineered devices used 6. in the facility should be updated annually in the \"Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan. \" GlucometersD. Assign separate glucometers to individual 1. patients. If a glucometer used for one patient must be reused for another patient, the device must be cleaned and disinfected between patients according to manufacturer's guidelines with an EPA- approved disinfectant. Glucometers and other environmental surfaces should be cleaned regularly and whenever contamination with blood or body fluids occurs. Policy 3.6 Vaginal Specula Reusable specula will be cleaned and autoclaved or receive high-level disinfection as outlined, after each use. Disposable specula will be discarded after use. Procedure Key Points Immediately after use, the reusable specula 1. can be either put in a container of soap and water that is covered with a lid, or rinsed with warm water and put aside in the sink. The person doing this should wear gloves.Covered containers will help keep children's hands out of the container. At the end of the clinic session, disassemble 2. the specula and scrub with soap and water, being careful not to splash. Wear reusable household gloves.A small brush or toothbrush, only to be used for cleaning equipment, may be helpful in cleaning the specula. Clean the brush thoroughly and allow it to dry after use. Store brushes out of the reach of children. Rinse the specula with hot water and 3. dry with a paper towel. Reassemble the specula prior to autoclaving or disinfecting.Air-drying is also acceptable. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 3-7ster ilization a n d disinfec tion o f clinic eq u i p Me n tProcedure Key Points Use an autoclave to steam-sterilize the 4. specula. Place the specula side by side in the autoclave chamber. Do not stack them on top of one another.Single-layer stacking allows the steam to reach all surfaces of the specula. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for proper loading procedures of the autoclave. Place a chemical test strip in between several 5. of the specula. After the cycle, check to see if the strip has changed color. Do not consider any materials sterile from an autoclave run if the test strips did not change color.The strip should be placed in the most difficult area for the steam to reach. These special test strips change color when a temperature of 120\u00baC has been maintained for at least 12 minutes. This will provide an immediate indication that high enough temperature was achieved for a minimum period of time, but it does not assure sterility. See Policy 3.11.1, \"Autoclaves, \" for monitoring the effectiveness of the autoclave and for more information. After assessing the color of the tape has 6. changed, remove the specula and restock them in the rooms and exam tables.After autoclaving, the specula will be sterile. Once they are removed from the autoclave, they will be clean, but not sterile. High-level disinfection may be used as an 7. alternative if the autoclave is not functioning properly, or if an autoclave is not available. Soak the specula in a 2% glutaraldehyde solution, or appropriate disinfectant in a closed container, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to achieve high-level disinfection. Rinse, dry, and restock in exam rooms. Adhere to the directions of the glutaraldehyde 8. manufacturer concerning what rinse solution to use after specula have been in disinfectant solution required length of time.Either autoclaving or high-level disinfection is acceptable. High-level disinfection is an alternative to sterilization when treating objects or instruments that come into contact with mucous membranes. High-level disinfection inactivates viruses, fungi, actively growing bacteria, including tubercle bacilli, but it will not inactivate bacterial endospores. Disadvantages of glutaraldehyde include respiratory irritation from the vapor, pungent and irritating odor, relatively slow mycobactericidal activity, and the chemical coagulates blood and fixes tissue to surfaces. Glutaraldehyde is not an appropriate disinfectant for cleaning surfaces such as counter tops, etc. Glutaraldehyde must be neutralized according to manufacturer's direction prior to disposal of product. The minimum effective concentration 9. (MEC) of high level disinfectants such as glutaraldehyde, must be monitored by testing the solution before each use with records kept on solution effectiveness. Change drawer lining for specula on a weekly 10. basis. Disposable specula will be discarded into a waste 11. container marked with the BIOHAZARD label.These are considered as \"other regulated medical waste. \" See Policy 4.5, \"Other Clinic Waste, \" for more information. 3-8 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 3Policy 3.7 Diaphragm Fitting Rings (DFR) Diaphragm fitting rings will be disinfected as outlined after each use. Procedure Key Points After use, wash the rings with soap and water, 1. then dry. Wear gloves.The employee will wear gloves and goggles to prevent contact with body fluids and disinfectant solution. Immerse rings in currently recommended 2. percentage glutaraldehyde solution, or other high-level disinfectant according to manufacturer's instructions, to achieve high- level disinfection. Disinfect the rings in a closed container. Wear gloves and goggles when working with glutaraldehyde. Rinse diaphragm rings according to manufacturer's directions after removal from high level disinfectant.A 2% glutaraldehyde solution is an acceptable high-level disinfectant. Followers manufacturer's direction for checking solution effectiveness before each use. Policy 3.8 TB Sputum-Collection Equipment All sputum-collection equipment will be disinfected as outlined after each use. Procedure Key Points Self-collected sputum specimen outside the 1. building will not require use of equipment other than sputum specimen collection cup and mask for healthcare provider (See policy 5.2 for infor ma tion on the use of gloves, masks, and safe collec tion of sputum specimen in the absence of Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) environmental controls.)Refer to Appendix E, \" Methods of Sterilization and Disinfection, \" for more information. Medical instruments and equipment that 2. do not touch the patient or touch only the in-tact skin of patients who have TB disease are not usually involved in transmission of M. tuberculosis. Tuberculocidal is not required for low-level 3. disinfectants used to clean or disinfect minimally soiled non critical items and environmental surfaces such as floors, walls, and other surfaces in a TB/healthcare clinic. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 3-9ster ilization a n d disinfec tion o f clinic eq u i p Me n tPolicy 3.9 Otoscope/Ophthalmoscope: The plastic attachments are to be cleaned and disinfected as outlined after each use. Procedure Key Points After the piece is removed from the 1. instrument, clean off visible organic matter with a cotton swab. Wash the piece with soap and water, and dry it.Certain substances, such as pus and blood, neutralize the disinfectant. Soap and water assure emulsification and dispersion of these substances. Drying assures there is no dilution of the disinfectant from water left on the pieces. Place the cleaned piece(s) in 70% alcohol for 2. 10 minutes.Either ethanol or isopropyl alcohol is acceptable for use as a disinfectant, but check to make sure that the plastic materials are compatible with alcohol. Remove the pieces from the alcohol, rinse well 3. with water, dry, and store in a dry container. If there is not time to soak the piece(s) 4. between patients, the pieces can be cleaned by first washing with soap and water, then taking an alcohol prep or an alcohol-soaked cotton ball and wiping the piece thoroughly, then rinsing with water and drying. Then, at the end of each day, complete steps 1-3.See Policy 6.3, \"Cotton Balls. \" Disposable specula are preferred for ear and 5. nose exams and as single-use items should be discarded after completing each patient's exam.These may be discarded as routine clinic waste, provided that there is no visible blood present on the specula. If blood is present, these should be discarded into a waste receptacle marked with the BIOHAZARD label. Policy 3.10 Blood-Pressure Equipment Stethoscope earpieces should be cleaned after each use unless only one person is using the stethoscope. Blood-pressure cuffs should be kept clean and free from obvious debris. Procedure Key Points Earpieces on stethoscopes should be cleaned 1. by using cotton soaked with 70% alcohol or an alcohol swab each time a different person uses the stethoscope. See Policy 6.3, \"Cotton Balls. \"Ideally, the earpieces should be washed with soap and water first to remove obvious debris. This may not be practical in most situations. An alternative procedure would be to use a cotton swab to remove visible organic material and follow with alcohol. The bell of the stethoscope should be wiped 2. with 70% alcohol or an alcohol swab after use with each patient. Wash the blood-pressure cuffs when they 3. appear to be dirty or when they become soiled with a body substance.How often they are washed depends on how much they are used. 3-10 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 3Procedure Key Points Blood-pressure cuffs may be washed in regular 4. laundry detergent after first removing the bladder. The cuffs can be soaked in a sink with detergent and washed by hand, or they can be washed in a machine.Blood pressure cuff and stethoscope. Figure 2: Policy 3.11 Autoclave Operation Clinic autoclaves will be operated and maintained according to manufacturer's instructions to assure proper function. Policy 3.11.1 Autoclaves Clinic autoclaves will be monitored periodically to determine that they are functioning properly (i.e., achieving sterile conditions). Procedure Key Points Make sure that the autoclave is loaded 1. according to the following guidelines:This will ensure that steam reaches all materials adequately during the run. Do not overload or crowd items into the a. chamber. Do not allow material to come into contact b. with the sides or the door of the chamber. Separate items or arrange them loosely in c. the chamber. When wrapped and non-wrapped items are d. loaded together, autoclave them using the run time and tem pera ture guidelines for wrapped items. Do not use an autoclave that is not working 2. properly. Make alternate arrangements for sterilizing materials while the equipment is being repaired. Follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding 3. care and maintenance of the autoclave.Check to make sure the drain is kept clear. Testing procedures for monitoring autoclave 4. perfo rmance utilize both physical and biological parameters.Use special test strips that change color when a temperature of 121\u00baC has been maintained for at least 12 minutes. This will provide an immediate indication that a high enough temperature was achieved for a minimum period of time, but it does not assure sterility. Do not consider any materials sterile if the test strips did not change color. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 3-11ster ilization a n d disinfec tion o f clinic eq u i p Me n tProcedure Key Points Physical Parameters a. Autoclave performance will be monitored each time the equipment is used by including chemical test strips with the load. In addition, log books will be maintained to record the date, type of load, temperature achieved, and length of time at achieved temperature. Biological Parameters b. Autoclave performance will be monitored using a biological or equivalent indicator system, such as a spore test, on a quarterly basis, or more frequently, as needed. In the autoclave log, note the time and date of the run and the results of the spore test.

These refrigerators and freezers must not be used for food storage or vaccine storage. Procedure Key Points Refrigerators should be kept clean at all times. They can be wiped out with liquid dish soap and warm water.Be sure to include refrigerator cleaning in the written schedule for routine cleaning and disinfection (housekeeping schedule). Refrigerator should be kept at appropriate storage temperature. Policy 3.13 Centrifuges Centrifuges will be given a general cleaning once a month. All centrifuges will be cleaned immediately following contamination with blood or other potentially infectious material (OPIM) (see Appendix F).BIOHAZARD symbol for Figure 3: refrigerators containing blood and OPIM. 3-12 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 3Policy 3.13.1 Hazard Communication for Contaminated Equipment BIOHAZARD signs or labels must be posted on contaminated equipment if the equipment cannot be decontaminated immediately. Procedure Key Points Centrifuges will be cleaned routinely, once a 1. month, using a chlorine-bleach solution of 1:10 concentration or an EPA-registered disinfectant.Always unplug the centrifuge prior to cleaning. Do not immerse the unit in water. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning procedures. Wear gloves when cleaning centrifuges.2. The gloves will protect the hands from soil and chemical contact. A cloth, small brush, or cotton swab may be 3. needed to get to hard-to-reach areas inside the centrifuge. Rinse with water after using chlorine-bleach solutions.Remember that if chlorine bleach is used, these solutions can be corrosive to metal surfaces, so rinsing becomes especially important. Cotton swabs should be discarded into clinic trash after use. The cloths and brushes should be cleaned thoroughly and allowed to dry. If the centrifuge (or any piece of equipment) 4. becomes contaminated with blood or other body fluids, clean the spill up right away.Spills of blood or OPIM should be decontaminated first with a 1:10 solution of chlorine bleach. See Policy 3.2, \"Cleaning Up Blood and/or Body- Secretion Spills. \" If tubes of blood or OPIM leak or break during 5. centrifuge operation, close the centrifuge, leave the room for 30 minutes, and post a warning sign on the door. A hazardous aerosol will be created if blood or OPIM spills while the centrifuge is spinning. See Appendix F, \"Clinic Laboratory Information\" for centrifuge precautions. If contaminated equipment cannot be 6. disinfected and cleaned immediately after a spill, a sign or BIOHAZARD label must be posted on the equipment to alert employees that a spill has occurred.The sign should be readily visible and should indicate which parts of the equipment are contaminated. If a blood tube or hematocrit (HCT) tube breaks 7. in the centrifuge, use long forceps to remove broken glass. Wear gloves. If a large blood spill results from a tube breaking (where blood has created a pool), soak up the blood using a disposable paper towel, then spray and clean with a 1:10 chlorine bleach solution, let the solution set 10 minutes, then rinse with water.For disposal of paper towels used to soak up a pool of blood, see Policy 3.2, \"Cleaning Up Blood and/or Body-Secretion Spills. \" Keep contact time to a minimum as chlorine-bleach solution is corrosive to metals. Rinse metal surfaces thoroughly. Never use your hands to manually slow down or stop the centrifuge from spinning. Policy 3.14 Microscopes and Other Laboratory Equipment in the Clinic Any equipment that becomes contaminated with blood or OPIM must be decontaminated. Procedure Key Points If the microscope or any piece of clinic equipment becomes contaminated, it should be cleaned/ disinfected as soon as it is practical to do so.Any cleaners or disinfectants used must be compatible with the surface to be cleaned.

Large-quantity generators must record all items listed for small-quantity generators and have a written procedure for the process used, keep an account of any tests performed to monitor any equipment, as well as a description of chemicals used and their preparation.A large-quantity generator generates more than 50 pounds per calendar month. Waste Treated Off-Site 2. Clinics that ship untreated special waste directly from the premises via a registered transporter must obtain a written receipt from the transporter for the shipment. These receipts must be kept on file for at least three years from the date of the shipment.Check with your waste-management company for specific details. See Appendix H, \"Special Waste Treatment and Disposal. \" Policy 4.5 Non-Infectious Clinic Waste and Office Waste Waste which is generated within the facility and which does not have a high potential for causing infection does not require special precautions concerning handling and disposal. Note: Urine dipsticks and empty urine-specimen cups may be placed in the regular trash. These items do not meet the definition of special waste from healthcare related facilities or OSHA's definition of a bloodborne pathogen. Procedure Key Points Exam rooms, clinic areas, and laboratories 1. should have trash cans lined with heavy-duty plastic trash bags.Bags of 1.2 mil thickness are less likely to tear and leak. They are used to contain absorbent towels and other disposable clinic supplies stained with small amounts of blood (less than 100 ml) or other organic debris. All clinic waste that has not been identified 2. as potentially infectious under Policy 4.1.2, \"Definitions of Regulated Medical Waste, \" should be placed into these lined trash cans.Disposable items such as paper gowns, drape sheets, exam-table paper, applicators, swabs, tongue blades, used dressings and bandages, urine dipsticks, disposable gloves, cotton balls, hemocult cards, and disposable speculums, if contaminated with <100 ml blood or other potentially infectious materials, fall into this category. 4-8 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 4Procedure Key Points Clinic trash cans, when filled, should be 3. emptied by taking the plastic-bag lining and the receptacle out with the trash as a unit. Add a new plastic bag to the trash can.Removal of non-infectious waste from clinic areas may be assigned to the janitorial staff. Make certain that both the clinic personnel and janitorial staff understand that no one is to reach directly into clinic trash receptacles with their bare hands. This non-infectious waste may be placed with the regular trash. If the waste receptacle becomes 4. contaminated, clean and disinfect it using a 1:10 solution of chlorine bleach.This should be done as soon as possible. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 4-94-10 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsNotesSection 5 Isolation of Potentially Infectious PatientsSection 5: Isolation of Potentially Infectious Patients Policy 5.1 Identification/Isolation of Potentially Infectious Patients In an effort to prevent the transmission of disease, patients with a suspected or confirmed infectious disease that is transmitted by droplet spread or direct contact will be isolated from the general clinic population. Procedure Key Points All staff in the clinic should have a basic 1. knowledge of the common communicable diseases that may be present in the clinic. Patients suspected of having the following illnesses should be isolated: Bacterial meningitis Chickenpox Diphtheria Gastroenteritis Influenza Measles Mumps Pertussis Rashes of unknown source Rubella Tuberculosis Upper respiratory infections (especially with fever and productive cough)This information should be included as part of the employee's orientation program. See Policy 2.8, \"Orientation of Employees. \" See also Appendix D \"Incubation Period and Duration of Communicability of Common Infectious Diseases\" and \"2007 Guidelines for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infections Agents in Health Care Settings. \" When a patient suspected of having one of the 2. above illnesses comes to the clinic, the nurse in charge should be notified, and the patient should be taken out of the waiting room immediately and put in an exam room or office away from other patients. Patients who are coughing are required to wear a mask.It is not intended that clinic staff diagnose illness, but rather that they should be aware of indications that the patient may be infectious. It is particularly important to be aware of persons with rash-associated illness in maternity clinics. Clerical and other support staff should tell the nurse in charge if they suspect a patient is infectious. Whenever possible, these patients should be 3. seen immediately. Whenever possible, schedule clinics for 4. immunosuppressed patients early in the day.This strategy will help to minimize these patients' risk of exposure to infectious agents. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 5-3Policy 5.2 Collection of Sputum Specimen Collection of sputum will be done in a way to minimize possible exposure of staff and patients. Procedure Key Points Self-Produced TB Sputum Collection Appropriate precautions should be taken when 1. working with patients suspected or confirmed with TB disease. Environmental controls include technologies for the removal or inactivation of airborne M. tuberculosis. The technologies include local exhaust ventilation (booth), general negative-pressure room, HEPA filtration, and Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as described in MMWR Recommendations and Reports , December 30, 2005 Department of Health and Human Services Center for Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Healthcare Settings, 2005. If the above listed Airborne Infection Isolation environmental controls are not available, the sputum specimen can be collected safely outside of a building, away from other persons, windows, and ventilation intakes, with the healthcare worker wearing an N-95 disposable respirator during sputum collection.If used infrequently, the UVGI light must be dusted before each collection. See Policy 3.15, \"UVGI Lights. \" UVGI lights are remarkably effective in killing airborne tubercle bacilli and serve as a supplement to ventilation in cleaning the air. Airflow in the room should be gentle enough to not cause dust dispersal. The direction of the airflow should be away from occupied areas and air intakes. Air cleaning technologies for Airborne Infection Isolation must be designed, installed and monitored for efficacy at specified time intervals by qualified environmental specialists. Be sure to give the patient full instructions 2. or any necessary information on collecting the specimen before proceeding. The patient should be in the airborne infection isolation room alone when the sputum is collected. It is important, however, to check on the patient to be sure that the sputum is being collected correctly and to see if the patient has any questions.Encourage patients to come in for sputum collection in the morning, as this will increase the likelihood of obtaining a good specimen from a more productive cough. TB patients, if not known to be sputum-3. negative, who are coughing in the clinic should always be given tissues and asked to cover their mouths when coughing. They should be asked to wear a surgical/procedure masks. If possible place patient in a separate room while waiting and provide clinic services for this patient as soon as possible.Do not schedule a TB clinic prior to or simultaneously with clinics for immunocompromised patients. The Texas Department of State Health Services Communicable Disease Control Group is reviewing information on the efficacy of masks and particulate respirators. Check with the regional TB program manager for current recommendations. 5-4 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 5in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 5-5Notes5-6 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsSection 6 Storage and Handling of Equipment, Supplies, and Biological SpecimensSection 6: Storage and Handling of Equipment, Supplies, and Biological Specimens Policy 6.1 Equipment and Supplies All equipment and supplies, including those in boxes, will be stored in properly designated storage areas. Policy 6.2 Sterile Equipment All expiration dates on sterile equipment will be checked on a defined schedule with documentation of checking. For DSHS clinics only: Outdated equipment and supplies will be returned to regional headquarters for exchange. Policy 6.3 Cotton Balls Cotton balls will not be stored in alcohol unless they are be used that day. Commercially packaged alcohol sponges may be used but are more costly. Procedure Key Points Unpack supplies when received and place 1. them on shelves or in cabinets immediately.As an aid to rotating stock supplies, place the new supplies towards the back of the shelf and move the older supplies towards the front. Keep supplies off the floor to avoid 2. contamination from soil and bacteria. Cotton balls are to be soaked with 70% 3. alcohol at the time they are used. Only a one- day supply should be put into a container and moistened with alcohol. Discard the leftover ones at the end of the day.Unless the solution is changed daily, the alcohol begins to lose its effectiveness. Alcohol is the most convenient chemical germicide for use in this situation, but other germicides may be used, provided they are chemically compatible with the surface to be wiped and are not too irritating to the skin. Policy 6.4 Specimen Storage, Handling, and Transport Laboratory specimens of blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard (see Appendix C, \"OSHA Standards\"). in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 6-3Procedure Key Points Specimens of blood or OPIM must be placed in 1. containers which prevent leakage during collec tion, handling, storage, processing, or transport.Triple containers, required by postal regulations, are supplied by the DSHS Laboratory Services Section. All containers must be closed tightly prior to shipping the specimens. Be sure to add enough absorbent material 2. to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in case of breakage or leakage.See Appendix F, \"Guidelines for Submission of Laboratory Specimens\" for packing instructions. The outer container used for storing or shipping 3. specimens must be color-coded or labeled with the BIOHAZARD symbol and word.The OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard states that the BIOHAZARD label is to be affixed to all containers of specimens leaving the facility for testing. The BIOHAZARD label is not placed on outer containers sent through U.S. mail. Postal regulations have priority over OSHA regulations in this case. Contact other carriers for their specific protocols. All procedures involving blood or OPIM must 4. be performed in such a manner as to minimize splashing, spraying, spattering, and the creation of aerosols of these materials. Mouth pipetting/suctioning of blood or OPIM 5. is prohibited. Specimens must also be in leakproof containers 6. separate from vaccines or other biologicals during storage in the refrigerator. The containers should be disinfected at least once a week with a 1:10 solution of chlorine bleach or other EPA-registered hospital disinfectant.Clinical staff not housekeeping staff, will disinfect the leak proof containers weekly, and document disinfection. Note: General information on sterilization and disinfection can be found in Appendix E, \"Principles of Sterilization and Disinfection. \" For a current listing of chemical disinfectants and sterilants registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, contact any of the OSHA regional offices in Texas. Check the government section in your telephone directory for the office nearest you. 6-4 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsse c t i o n 6in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 6-5Notes6-6 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsSection 7 Miscellaneous Activities in Clinic SettingsSection 7: Miscellaneous Activities in Clinic Settings Policy 7.1 Laundry Clinic smocks, laboratory coats, or other reusable personal protective equipment made of cloth will be cleaned and repaired at no cost to the employee. Procedure Key Points Reusable personal protective equipment 1. made of cloth will be laundered and repaired, as needed, at no cost to the employee. Employees must remove their clinic coats or 2. smocks before leaving the clinic or lab area. Employees cannot take clinic coats or smocks home to be cleaned. A container that is labeled with the 3. BIOHAZARD symbol and word, or color- coded, must be available to collect clothing contaminated with blood or OPIM.If the contaminated clothing is wet and leakage is possible, the container must be leakproof. Employees will use universal precautions 4. when handling contaminated laundry.Gloves and other personal protective equipment will be necessary when handling contaminated laundry. If using a contract service for laundry, BIOHAZARD 5. labeling and color-coding provisions will apply, especially if the off-site contract service does not use universal precautions.See Appendix C, \"OSHA Standards, \" for labeling and color-coding instructions. Policy 7.2 Toys All toys provided for patients to play with will be washable and will be kept clean. Procedure Key Points Toys should be cleaned with soap and water and 1. dried as needed during the course of the day. At the end of each day, all toys that have been 2. used will be washed with soap and water, rinsed, and dried.Do not use toys that can't be washed. Be sure to include this cleaning process in the written schedule for routine cleaning and housekeeping. Toys that are used in the clinics must be safe, 3. easily maintained, and kept clean. They must be made of impervious materials. Throughout the day, make sure that clinic toys 4. do not clutter the entrances, exits, hallways, and walkways.Avoid toys with sharp edges, lead-based paints, beads, heavy hard balls that can be thrown, cloth toys, or toys with small removable parts. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics 7-3Policy 7.3 Food Employee food will be stored separately from vaccines, biologicals, medications, and specimens.

It is the purpose of this policy to minimize such risks whenever possible. 2.0 Policy All employees will have immunizations that are necessary to maintain immunity or show immunity to specific diseases. This is an essential part of prevention and infection control programs for healthcare workers. Vaccination not only protects employees from diseases transmitted by the patients and public they serve but also protects patients and the public from becoming infected through exposure to healthcare workers. Consistent immunization programs can significantly reduce the number of susceptible employees in health departments and can reduce employee absenteeism during flu season. 3.0 Definitions 3.1 Healthcare Workers \u2014 Medical or non-medical, paid or volunteer, full or part-time, student or non-student, with or without patient-care responsibilities -- who work in public or private facilities that provide healthcare or services to patients. This includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, emergency medical personnel, dental professionals, medical and nursing students, laboratory technicians, hospital volunteers, administrative and clerical staff, hospital and clinic housekeeping and maintenance staff, and others. 4.0 Persons Affected Employees who have direct contact with patients or the public Employees performing tasks involving exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids Employees performing tasks involving exposure to soil or animals or who routinely work outdoors Volunteers only if their duties involve direct healthcare of a patient or exposure to patients' blood or body substances Laboratory employees Unit Managers/Section Managers/Regional Administrators/Hospital Superintendents 5.0 Responsibilities Employee Group Vaccine Requirement 5.1 Employees who have direct contact with patients or the public, particularly employees of WIC, STD/HIV, TB, and Immunization clinics; outreach workers; inspectors; investigators; and receptionists, clerical staff, hospital and clinic housekeeping staff, and security personnel who contact with the public on a regular basisMMR (2 doses or evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella) Varicella (2 doses, reliable history of disease, or evidence of immunity to chickenpox) Influenza (1 dose annually) in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics a-3dsHs H e a l t H po l i c y st a t e Me n t s5.2 Employees performing tasks involving exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids, for example: nurses; physicians; lab and medical technicians; dentists and dental assistantsHepatitis B (documentation of 3 doses. Unvaccinated new employees must complete a 3-dose series and post-vaccination test showing immunity. If test result is negative, up to 3 additional doses of vaccine may be required) 5.3 Employees performing tasks involving exposure to soil or animals or who routinely work outdoorsTentanus-diphtheria (Td) (complete series with one booster dose every 10 years) 5.4 Laboratory employees Follow lab policy NOTE: Positions identified as having an immunization requirement may choose to undergo immune-status tests. These tests for DSHS employees are available through the DSHS Laboratory at 1100 West 49th Street, Austin, at no charge to the employee but must be coordinated through the Immunization Division (512) 458-7284. Employees with a previous history of a complete hepatitis B vaccination series do not have to be tested unless an exposure occurs. Medical Contraindications Employees who have certain medical conditions can not receive some vaccines due to the potential risk to their health. Individuals who cannot receive these vaccines and who are not already immune to the disease(s) may not be hired for positions that have an immunization requirement. Employees should consult with their physician who is most familiar with their health status regarding required vaccines and contraindications. All Vaccines Anyone who has had an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of any vaccine should never receive that vaccine again. MMR Vaccine Pregnancy. Known severe immunodeficiency. Varicella Vaccine Substantial suppression of cellular immunity. Influenza Vaccine Severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of vaccine including egg protein Opting Out of Immunizations Required Under this Policy Positions identified under this policy as having an immunization requirement may not opt out with the exception of hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B vaccine guidelines are provided by OSHA and employees may decline that vaccine by signing a waiver after being fully informed of their risks. Employees selected for positions that have an immunization requirement must either show proof of their immunization history or have their immune-status tested. The Americans with Disabilities Act does not provide for reasonable accommodation in these circumstances. The waiver for the hepatitis B vaccine must include the following wording taken directly from OSHA standards: \"I understand that due to my occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials I may be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. I have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, at no charge to myself. However, I decline hepatitis B vaccination at this time. I understand that by declining this vaccine, I continue to be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B, a serious disease. If in the future I continue to have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials and I want to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, I can receive the vaccination series at no charge to me. \" a-4 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x a5.5 Recommendation to all employees All employees should consider staying current with the following immunizations: MMR (2 doses or evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella); Varicella (2 doses, reliable history of disease, or evidence of immunity to chickenpox); Td (complete series with one booster dose every 10 years); Influenza (1 dose annually); and Pneumococcal (1 dose for persons > 65, 1 or more doses for persons at increased risk). 5.6 Unit Managers/Section Managers/Regional Administrators/Hospital Superintendents Will be responsible for: identifying to which specific positions these requirements apply; incorporating vaccine requirements into individual job descriptions; screening new employees for compliance with vaccine requirements; establishing a system for tracking employee immunization records within their programs and assuring ongoing compliance; encouraging participation in annual employee immunization clinics held across the state; and ensuring that the following statement is included in each job description: \"Compliance with DSHS Immunization Policy required-serologic evidence of immunity to, or documented evidence of vaccination against, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (chickenpox), and annual vaccination against influenza. \" 5.7 Facilities/Laboratories Facilities that maintain infection control staff and operate laboratories may adopt policies above and beyond these minimum standards that are specific and targeted towards protecting employees with risks not identified in this policy. Facilities that house patients must also have a policy regarding infection control among their patients.

Settings that serve communities with a high incidence of TB disease or that treat populations at high risk (e.g., those with human immunodeficiency virus infection or other immunocompromising conditions) or that treat patients with drug-resistant TB disease might need to be classified as medium risk, even if they meet the low-risk criteria. \u00a7 A classification of potential ongoing transmission should be applied to a specific group of HCWs or to a specific area of the healthcare setting in which evidence of ongoing transmission is apparent, if such a group or area can be identified. Otherwise, a classification of potential ongoing transmission should be applied to the entire setting. This classification should be temporary and warrants immediate investigation and corrective steps after a determination has been made that ongoing transmission has ceased. The setting should be reclassified as medium risk, and the recommended time frame for this medium risk classification is at least one year. \u00b6 All HCWs should have a baseline two-step tuberculin skin test (TST) or one blood assay for M. tuberculosis (BAMT) result at each new healthcare setting even if the setting is deteremined to be low risk. In certain settings, a choice might be made to not perform baseline TB screening or serial TB screening for HCWs who 1) will never be in contact with or have shared air space with patients who have TB disease (e.g., telephone operators who work in a separate building from patients) or 2) will never be in contact with clinical specimens that might contain M. tuberculosis . Establishment of a reliable baseline result can be beneficial if subsequent screening is needed after an unexpected exposure to M. tuberculosis . ** HCWs whose duties do not include contact with patients or TB specimens do not need to be included in the serial TB screening program. The frequency of testing for infection with M. tuberculosis will be determined by the risk assessment for the setting. \u00a7\u00a7 During an investigation of potential ongoing transmission of M. tuberculosis , testing for M. tuberculosis infection would be performed every 8-10 weeks until lapses in infection controls have been corrected and no further evidence of ongoing transmission is apparent. \u00b6\u00b6 Procedures for contact investigations should not be confused with two-step TST, which is used for newly hired HCWs. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics a-7dsHs H e a l t H po l i c y st a t e Me n t sa-8 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x aAppendix B Post-Exposure ManagementOccupational Exposure to Blood or Other Potentially Infectious MaterialPolicy Number OS-3412 Effective Date December 1, 2007 Revision Date Subject MatterInfectious Disease Surveillance and Epidemiology Branch Manager Approval Authority Chief Operating Officer Signed by: Dee Porter 1.0 Purpose The purpose of this policy is to assure that the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is in compliance with Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 96, Bloodborne Pathogen Control (Amended 2006) , analogous to the OSHA Bloodborne Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030 (1991) and the U. S. Public Health Service Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Recommendations (updated 2005), for the timely management of an occupational exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens or Other Potentially Infectious Materials. http://www.sos.state.tx.us/tac/index.shtml http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/bloodborne pathogens/postexposure.html 2.0 Policy It is the policy of the Texas Department of State Health Services to provide post exposure evaluation and follow up healthcare in accordance with current U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HIV and Recommendations for Post Exposure Prophylaxis to all employees with occupational exposures to bloodborne pathogens or other potentially infectious materials. 3.0 Definitions Bloodborne Pathogens - Pathogenic microorganisms present in human blood that can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Non-Intact Skin - A condition in which the integrity of the skin is breached, such as with a cut, scratch, or puncture wound or exudative weeping lesions. Unapparent exposures occur when blood or body fluids make skin contact in exposed skin that is chapped, abraded, afflicted with dermatitis, or has micro- lacerations. Occupational Exposure - A specific eye, mouth, or other mucous membrane, nonintact skin or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious material which results from an employee performing their duties [ 19 CFR 1910.1030 (b) ]. Those conditions that constitute a possible exposure to a Bloodborne disease include a needlestick or other penetrating puncture of the skin with a used needle or other contaminated item; or either a splash or aerosol into the eyes, nose, mouth; or any significant contamination of an open wound or other non-intact skin with blood or body fluids [ 25 TAC 96.101 (c) (17) ]. Other Potentially Infectious Materials - The following human body fluids: (1) semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, amniotic fluid; saliva in dental procedures; any fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood; and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; (2) any unfixed tissue or organ from a human (living or dead); (3) HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV/HBV/ containing culture medium or other solutions, and blood or body tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV [29 CFR 1910.1030 ]. Source Person - Any individual, living or dead, whose blood or other potentially infectious materials may be a source of occupational exposure to the employee. Examples include, but are not limited to, hospital and clinic patients; clients in institutions for the developmentally disabled; trauma victims; clients of drug and alcohol treatment facilities; residents of hospices and nursing homes; human remains; and individuals who donate or sell blood or blood components. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics b-3po s t-ex p o s u r e Ma n a g e Me n tNon-Intact Skin \u2014 A condition in which the integrity of the skin is breached, such as with a cut, scratch, or puncture wound or exudative weeping lesions.

Follow-up for occupational percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood or body secretions that might contain hepatitis B depends on: whether the source of the blood is available; the HBsAg status of the source; and the hepatitis B vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person. Source of Exposure Known and HBsAg-PositiveA. If the exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed the vaccination series, 1. the hepatitis B vaccination should be initiated. A single dose of HBIG (0.06 ml/kg) should be administered as soon as possible after exposure and within 24 hours, if possible. The first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered intramuscularly at a separate site (deltoid for adults) and can be administered simultaneously with HBIG or within seven days of exposure; subsequent doses should be administered as recommended for the specific vaccine. If the exposed person has begun but has not completed vaccination, one dose of HBIG should be administered immediately and vaccination should completed as scheduled. If the exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and the anti-HBs 2. response status is known: If the exposed person is known to have had an adequate response in the past, the anti-HBs a. level should be tested unless an adequate level has been demonstrated within the past 24 months. Although current data show that vaccine-induced protection does not decrease as antibody level wanes, most experts consider the following approach to be prudent: If the anti-HBs level is adequate (antibody level > 10 mIU/ml), no treatment is necessary.i. If the anti-HBs level is inadequate, a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered.ii. If the exposed person is known to have not responded to the primary vaccine series, he or b. she should receive either a single dose of HBIG and a dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after exposure, or two doses of HBIG (0.06 ml/kg), one as soon as possible after exposure and the second one month later. The latter treatment is referred for those who have not responded to at least four doses of vaccine. If the exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B and anti-HBs response is 3. unknown, the exposed person should be tested for anti-HBs. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics b-11po s t-ex p o s u r e Ma n a g e Me n tIf the exposed person has adequate antibody, no additional treatment is necessary.a. If the exposed person has inadequate antibody, one dose of HBIG (0.06 ml/kg) should be b. administered immediately, and a standard booster dose of vaccine should be administered at a different site. Source of Exposure Known and HBs Ag-NegativeB. If the exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination:1. If unvaccinated, the exposed person should be administered the first dose of hepatitis a. B vaccine within seven days of exposure, and vaccination should be completed as recommended. If the exposed person has not completed vaccination, the vaccination series should be completed as scheduled. If the exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, no treatment is necessary.2. Source of Exposure Unknown or Not Available For TestingC. If the exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination:1. If unvaccinated, the exposed person should be administered the first dose of hepatitis B a. vaccine with seven days of exposure, and vaccination should be completed as recommended. If the exposed person has not completed vaccination, the vaccination series should be b. completed as scheduled. If the exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and anti-HBs response 2. status is known: If the exposed person is known to have had adequate response in the past, no treatment a. is necessary. If the exposed person is known to have not responded to the vaccine, prophylaxis as b. described earlier in this outline (see page B-5, I.A.) \"Source of Exposure Known and HBsAg-Positive\") may be considered if the source of the exposure is known to be at high risk of HBV infection. If the exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and the anti-HBs 3. response is unknown, the exposed person should be tested for anti-HBs. If the exposed person has adequate anti-HBs, no treatment is necessary.a. If the exposed person has inadequate anti-HBs, a standard booster dose of vaccine should b. be administered. Table 1 summarizes the prophylaxis for percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood according to the HBsAg status of the source of exposure and the vaccination status and vaccine response of the exposed person. Records on tested sources and employees should be kept in accordance with established Texas Department of State Health Services policies. Laboratory results from HIV-antibody testing, hepatitis-B testing, or any other test must remain confidential and never be placed in personnel files. b-12 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x bRecommendations for Hepatitis B Prophylaxis Following Percutaneous Exposure Table 8: I.

If the employee gives a history of infection or has documentation of HCV-positive status, no 1. testing of either the source or the employee is necessary. Source of Exposure Known and Anti-HCV-Antibody-PositiveB. The exposed employee should be tested at the time of initial exposure or as soon as possible 1. after initial exposure for anti-HCV antibody and ALT (alanine aminotrans-ferase) activity. Repeat testing for anti-HCV antibody and ALT activity should be done six months after exposure.2. All anti-HCV results reported as repeatedly reactive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) should be 3. confirmed by supplemental anti-HCV testing. No post-exposure prophylaxis is available for hepatitis C; immune globulin is not recommended.4. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics b-13po s t-ex p o s u r e Ma n a g e Me n tSource of Exposure Unknown or Cannot be TestedC. Follow the guidelines in II. B. above, \"Source of Exposure Known and Anti-HCV-Antibody-Positive. \"1. Source of Exposure Known and Can be TestedD. The source should be tested for anti-HCV antibody as soon as possible after initial exposure. 1. If positive, guidelines in II. B. above, \"Source of Exposure Known and Anti-ACV-Antibody- Positive, \" should be followed. If the source tests negative for anti-HCV antibody, no further follow-up for hepatitis C is necessary for the employee. Summary RecommendationsE. No post-exposure prophylaxis is available for hepatitis C; immune globulin is not recommended.1. Institutions should provide to healthcare workers accurate and up-to-date information on the 2. risk and prevention of all bloodborne pathogens, including hepatitis C. Institutions should consider implementing policies and procedures for follow-up of healthcare 3. workers after percutaneous or permucosal exposure to anti-HCV-positive blood. Such policies might include baseline testing of the source for anti-HCV and baseline and six-month follow-up testing of the person exposed for anti-HCV and ALT activity. All anti-HCV results reported as repeatedly reactive by EIA should be confirmed by supplemental anti-HCV testing. There are currently no recommendations regarding restriction of healthcare workers with 4. hepatitis C. The risk of transmission from an infected worker to a patient appears to be very low. Furthermore, there are no serologic assays that can determine infectivity nor are there data to determine the threshold concentration of virus required for transmission. As recommended for all healthcare workers, those who are anti-HCV-positive should follow strict aseptic technique and standard (universal) precautions, including appropriate use of hand washing, protective barriers, and care in the use and disposal of needles and other sharp instruments. Occupational Exposure to HIV III. Employee with History of HIV InfectionA. If the employee gives a history of HIV infection or has documentation of HIV-positive status, 1. no testing of either the source or the employee is necessary. Source of HIV Exposure KnownB. If the source of exposure is known, he/she should be assessed clinically and epidemiologically 1. to determine the risk or likelihood of HIV infection. The source should be informed of the exposure and be asked to be tested. It should be stressed to the source that the results will be kept confidential. If the source has no clinical evidence of infection, is HIV-antibody-negative, and has no history of high-risk behavior, no further follow-up of source is indicated. The exposed healthcare worker should be counseled that the source could be infected even 2. though results are negative. The healthcare worker needs to understand that negative results are not reliable for behaviors that occurred within the past six weeks to three months. The decision to start/continue prophylaxis treatment should not be based on source test results alone. b-14 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x bTesting the Exposed EmployeeC. The exposed employee should be tested within 10 days (although 72 hours is preferable) of 1. initial exposure. Repeat testing should then be done six weeks, 12 weeks, and six months after exposure.2. Source of HIV Exposure Unknown and MiscellaneousD. If the source has evidence of possible HIV infection, a confirmed positive HIV-antibody test, 1. a history of high-risk behavior, cannot be tested, refuses to be tested, or is unknown, then the following steps should be taken: The exposed individual should be evaluated clinically for evidence of HIV infection, and a. HIV antibody testing should be recommended as soon as possible after the exposure. Refusal to submit a specimen must be documented. The exposed individual should be advised to report and seek medical evaluation for any acute febrile illness that occurs within 12 weeks after exposure. Such an illness, particularly one characterized by fever, rash, or lymphadenopathy, may be indicative of recent HIV infection. If the exposed individual's baseline test is negative for HIV antibody, he/she should have b. repeat testing for HIV antibody in six weeks, 12 weeks, and again in six months. Again, refusal to submit a specimen must be documented. Risk behavior during each testing interim must be assessed and documented. Both the source, if known, and the exposed individual should be counseled.c. If the source is unknown, decisions regarding appropriate follow-up should be individualized. d. Serologic testing should be made available by the employer to all workers who may be concerned they have been infected with HIV through an occupational exposure. Post-exposure counseling should be given within two weeks of exposure and should include e. information on the potential risk of infection and specific measures to prevent transmission. Medical Protocol for the Management of Occupational Exposure to HIVE. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be initiated within one hour of exposure, if possible.1. The attending physician should review available information on occupational-exposure forms 2. submitted by the employee, determine the extent and time of the exposure, and consult a copy of the Exposure Assessment Form (see page C-19). If a fax machine is readily available, this information can be faxed to the attending physician by the supervisor. If not, the supervisor can provide the information on the form over the telephone. If status of the source of exposure is unknown, initiating PEP should be determined on a case-by-case F. basis. Initiating PEP should be based on the exposure risk and likelihood of HIV infection in the source. Every effort should be made to determine this information; however, the physician's decision to offer or recommend PEP should depend on the type of exposure. PEP should not be delayed while waiting for information regarding the source. Information concerning what testing the involved specimen was submitted for might give some insight regarding the likelihood of HIV being found in that specimen. Blood specimens which are the source of an exposure will be tested for HIV (antibody in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics b-15and antigen) and hepatitis B and C. If there is not enough of the source blood to test, information should be gathered from the submitter and another blood sample obtained, if possible. The attending physician should initiate prophylaxis promptly (if appropriate and accepted), 1. preferably within 1-2 hours after exposure. Because the interval after which there is no benefit from PEP is not defined, prophylaxis after 24 hours should depend on the type of exposure (e.g., high risk, increased risk, no increased risk). (See Table 2 on following pages for defining criteria.) The recommended length of therapy is four weeks. Medications should not be provided if the exposed employee's HIV status is positive. Each health department should develop a plan to obtain medications within 24 hours, as needed. ChemoprophylaxisG. If medications are ordered, blood should be drawn for baseline laboratory tests of exposed 1. individual to monitor drug toxicity, if chemoprophylaxis is chosen as an option. Laboratory testing which should be performed is as follows:2. Complete blood counta. Liver-function testsb. of pregnancyf. HIV antibody by ELISAg. Hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B surface antigenh. Hepatitis C antibody (25% of HIV positive patients are also HCV positive)i. Some of the above tests may be performed by the DSHS Laboratory, and some will be performed 3. by an outside laboratory. These tests should be repeated by the employee's private physician after two weeks on prophylaxis. PregnancyH. If the employee who has been exposed is pregnant or has any reason to believe that she is in the 1. early stages of pregnancy, do not provide medications . The employee should immediately contact her private obstetrician, family practitioner, or the 2. individual on call for these physicians and discuss the situation with him/her. The employee's private obstetrician or family practitioner should make the determination as to whether this employee should be provided post-exposure prophylaxis. The employee's private obstetrician or family practitioner may be referred to the DSHS 3. physician handling the exposure and request that the DSHS physician dispense one or two days of medication. Any additional medication would be provided via a prescription for the employee by the private practitioner. b-16 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsUpdated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HIV and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 2005.

After being counseled and having all of your questions answered, sign the reverse side of this form to indicate that you understand and consent to testing for HIV and other blood-borne pathogens or that you understand and decline such testing. All tests used a sample of blood taken from your arm. HIV tests The tests currently used by the Texas Department of State Health Services are antibody tests, that is, tests which detect the presence of antibodies to HIV but not the virus itself. If you have been recently exposed to HIV , your body has not yet made the antibodies which can be detected by the tests. Y ou will need an initial test within 10 calendar days after exposure and additional tests at six weeks, twelve (12) weeks and six months. In addition to the knowledge gained from having the HIV tests performed, a small percentage of tests may give a \"false-positive\" or a \"false-negative\" result. A \"false positive\" result means a test has incorrectly indicated that you are infected with HIV , when in fact, you are not. A \"false-negative\" result means a test has incorrectly indicated that you are not infected with HIV , when in fact, you are. A small percentage of results can be inconclusive, necessitating retesting. If the first test is positive, further confirmatory tests shall be performed on that blood sample. Y ou will be considered as infected with HIV , but it does not indicate that you have HIV illness or AIDS now or that you will develop these conditions in the future. If all your tests results are positive, you are presumed to be infected with HIV , and you will be referred for more extensive counseling and medical evaluation. The test results can also help you make important decisions involving your personal life, professional duties and obligations. HIV testing is confidential, as provided by Texas law, and disclosure can be made only to the healthcare professional designated to evaluate claims of occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens, persons in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics b-25responsible for workers compensation claims and individuals who are specifically authorized by the individual tested or Texas law. Records shall be handled in a confidential manner, and personnel handling records have been advised of the confidentiality of HIV-related information. HCV Tests There is no pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C. If your exposure to blood was percutaneous or permucosal, you will also be tested for antibody to HCV and for alanine aminotransferase. Negative tests will be repeated six months after the exposure. If you seroconvert, you will have the opportunity to seek medical evaluation and treatment for chronic liver disease. HBV Hepatitis B is a treatment-preventable blood-borne pathogen and, therefore, more information about it will be provided during the process of evaluating the need for prophylaxis. b-26 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x bTexas Department of State Health Services Blood-borne Pathogen Testing Consent/Declination Form TO THE EMPLOYEE: Texas law requires that counseling be provided to anyone potentially exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV) during the course of job duties.

The risk of infection from my exposure is not know, however, should HIV infection occur the ultimate outcome is likely to be fatal. I have been offered treatment with one or more of the following medications, (Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Indinavir) or other currently recommended medications which might reduce my risk of infection. I have been advised that there is no guarantee that such drug treatment after HIV exposure will prevent infection. I have also been advised that because strains of HIV are now resistant to Zidovudine, combination treatment with multiple medications may be offered as post-exposure prophylaxis. I have been advised that the treatment by my personal physician should consist of the following:2. My blood will be tested for complete blood count platelet, liver function test, kidney a. function tests and other tests as determined by my personal physician, including but not limited to a test for antibodies to HIV . I have been advised to use contraception during the four weeks of treatment and the four b. weeks following treatment. If I am currently pregnant or feel that I could be in the early stages of pregnancy, I have consulted with my personal obstetrician or family practitioner to determine if I should be given post-exposure prophylaxis. I will be given a one or two day supply of one or more of the following medications: c. Zidovudine, Lamivudine, or Indinavir or other currently recommended medications (Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HIV and Recommmendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality weekly Report (MMWR) 54 (RR09); 1-17 (2005, September 30)) http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/bloodborne pathogens/postexposure.html with instructions on how to take this medication. I will contact my personal physician immediately to set up an appointment to obtain a d. prescription for additional medication as needed. My personal physician will be responsible for the continuation of therapy, if needed.e. I will consult my personal physician if I develop side effects while taking any of the medication.f.

Common: headache, muscle pain, tiredness, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, nausea. Uncommon: fever, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, anemia, low white blood count, low platelet count, hepatitis (liver inflammation), pancreatitis (pancreas inflammation). Known side effects of Lamivudine include: b. Common: headache, muscle pain, tiredness, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, nausea. Uncommon: fever, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, anemia, low white blood count, hepatitis liver inflammation), pancreatitis (pancreas inflammation). Known side effect of Indinavir include: c. Common: abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarhea, headache, insomnia, changes in taste, abnormal liver tests. Uncommon: anemia, low white blood count, hepatitis (liver inflammation), kidney stones (hephrolithlasis), pancreatitis (pancreas inflammation). Indinavir cannot be taken concurrently with any of the following drugs: Seldane, Hismanal, d. Halcion, Versed, and Propulsid. Serious and/or life-threatening events could occur if the above medications are taken with Indinavir. Treatment side effects are expected to disappear after treatment is stopped, but could be e. life-threatening or irreversible. I specifically acknowledge, however, that these drugs are new and there is little known about their short-term and long-term side effects when used in combination. New or rare side effects, including cancer, birth defects, or other life- threatening diseases, might develop now or in the future. The risks of drawing blood included temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising and 4. rarely, infection. Knowledge that I could be HIV infected may cause personal psychosocial risks. Being tested for 5. HIV may cause personal anxiety regardless of the test results. Receiving positive test results may cause severe personal anxiety. Post-exposure prophylaxis treatment will involve knowledge of this incident only to those 6. who need to know. Records recording this incident and the outcome will be kept confidential. I will be the only individual that can give written permission to have these records released. I may be asked for permission to enroll me in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's anonymous registry of healthcare workers who receive post-exposure prophylaxis. Enrollment in this registry will not affect my treatment, but may benefit healthcare workers in the future. I understand that treatment hereunder does not obligate the Texas Department of State Health 7. Services (DSHS) to treat any other conditions affecting me or to treat conditions that might arise after this treatment is completed. I understand that this treatment is optional and voluntary on my part, I have the right to decline 8. this treatment at any time.

The employer may require a written statement of need and confidentiality agreement, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), as soon as circumstances permit. (4) In non-emergency situations, an employer shall, upon request, disclose a specific chemical identity, otherwise permitted to be withheld under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, to a health professional, employee, or designated representative if: (i) The request is in writing; (ii) The request describes with reasonable detail one or more of the following occupational health needs for the information: (A) To assess the hazards of the chemicals to which employees will be exposed; (B) To conduct or assess sampling of the workplace atmosphere to determine employee exposure levels; (C) To conduct pre-assignment or periodic medical surveillance of exposed employees; (D) To provide medical treatment to exposed employees; (E) To select or assess appropriate personal protective equipment for exposed employees; (F) To design or assess engineering controls or other protective measures for exposed employees; and(G) To conduct studies to determine the health effects of exposure. (iii) The request explains in detail why the disclosure of the specific chemical identity is essential and that, in lieu thereof, the disclosure of the following information would not enable the health professional, employee or designated representative to provide the occupational health services described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section; (A) The properties and effects of the chemical; (B) Measures for controlling workers' exposure to the chemical; (C) Methods of monitoring and analyzing worker exposure to the chemical; and (D) Methods of diagnosing and treating harmful exposures to the chemical; (iv) The request includes a description of the procedures to be used to maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information; and (v) The health professional, employee, or designated rep re sent a tive and the employer or contractor of the services of the health professional or designated representative agree in a written confidentiality agreement that the health professional, employee or designated representative will not use the trade secret information for any purpose other than the health need(s) asserted and agree not to release the information under any circumstances other than to OSHA, as provided in paragraph (f)(7) of this section, except as authorized by the terms of the agreement or by the employer. (5) The confidentiality agreement authorized by paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section: (i) May restrict the use of the information to the health purposes indicated in the written statement of need; (ii) May provide for appropriate legal remedies in the event of a breach of the agreement, including stipulation of a reasonable pre-estimate of likely damages; and, (iii) May not include requirements for the posting of a penalty bond. (6) Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the parties from pursuing non-contractual remedies to the in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics c-21osHa s t a n d a r d sextent permitted by law. (7) If the health professional, employee or designated representative receiving the trade secret information decides that there is a need to disclose it to OSHA, the employer who provided the information shall be informed by the health professional prior to, or at the same time as, such disclosure. (8) If the employer denies a written request for disclosure of a specific chemical identity, the denial must: (i) Be provided to the health professional, employee or designated representative within thirty days of the request; (ii) Be in writing; (iii) Include evidence to support the claim that the specific chemical identity is a trade secret; (iv) State the specific reasons why the request is being denied; and, (v) Explain in detail how alternative information may satisfy the specific medical or occupational health need without revealing the specific chemical identity. (9) The health professional, employee, or designated representative whose request for information is denied under paragraph (f)(4) of this section may refer the request and the written denial of the request to OSHA for consideration. (10) When a health professional, employee, or designated representative refers a denial to OSHA under paragraph (f)(9) of this section, OSHA shall consider the evidence to determine if: (i) The employer has supported the claim that the specific chemical identity is a trade secret; (ii) The health professional employee, or designated representative has supported the claim that there is a medical or occupational health need for the information; and (iii) The health professional, employee or designated representative has demonstrated adequate means to protect the confidentiality. (11) (i) If OSHA determines that the specific chemical identity requested under paragraph (f)(4) of this section is not a \"bona fide\" trade secret, or that it is a trade secret but the requesting health professional, employee or designated representatives has a legitimate medical or occupational health need for the inf or ma tion, has executed a written confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means for complying with the terms of such agreement, the employer will be subject to citation by OSHA. (ii) If an employer demonstrates to OSHA that the execution of a confidentiality agreement would not provide sufficient protection against the potential harm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret specific chemical identity, the Assistant Secretary may issue such orders or impose such additional limitations or conditions upon the disclosure of the requested chemical information as may be appropriate to assure that the occupational health needs are met without an undue risk of harm to the employer. (12) Notwithstanding the existence of a trade secret claim, an employer shall, upon request, disclose to the Assistant Secretary any information which this section requires the employer to make available. Where there is a trade secret claim, such claim shall be made no later than at the time the information is provided to the Assistant Secretary so that suitable determinations of trade secret status can be made and the necessary protections can be implemented. (13) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the disclosure under any circumstances of process or percentage of mixture information which is a trade secret.

Standard Precautions Standard Precautions combine the major features of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation (BSI) and are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, non intact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. New elements of Standard Precautions include Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette , safe injection practices, and the use of masks for the insertion of catheters or injections into spinal or epidural spaces (e.g., myelogram, spinal or epidural anesthesia). Respiratory Hygience/Cough Etiquette is a strategy targeted at patients and accompanying family members and friends with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections, and applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased production of respiratory secretions when entering a healthcare facility. The elements of Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette include: 1) education of healthcare facility staff, patients, and visitors, 2) posted signs, in language(s) appropriate to the population served, with instructions to patients and accompanying family members or friends, 3) source control measures (e.g., covering the mouth/nose with a tissue when coughing and prompt disposal of used tissues, using surgical masks on the coughing person when tolerated and appropriate, 4) hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions, and 5) spatial separation, ideally >3 feet, of persons with respiratory infections in common waiting areas when possible. Covering sneezes and coughs and placing masks on coughing patients are proven means of source containment that prevent infected persons from dispersing respiratory secretions into the air. Healthcare personnel are advised to observe Droplet Precautions (i.e., wear a mask) and hand hygiene when examining and caring for patients with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection. Healthcare personnel who have a respiratory infection are advised to avoid direct patient contact, especially with high-risk patients. If this is not possible, then a mask should be worn while providing patient care. Safe Injection Practices. The investigation of four large outbreaks of HBV and HCV among patients in ambulatory care facilities in the United States identified a need to define an reinforced safe injection practices. The four outbreaks occurred in a private medical practice, a pain clinic, an endoscopy clinic, and a hematology/oncology clinic. The primary breaches in infection control practice that contributed to these outbreaks were 1) reinsertion of used needles into a multiple-dose vial or solution container (e.g., saline bag) and 2) use of a single needle/syringe to administer intravenous medication to multiple patients. In one of these outbreaks, preparation of medications in the same workspace where used needle/syringes were dismantled also a contributing factor. These and other outbreaks of viral hepatitis could have been prevented by adherence to basic principles of aseptic technique for the preparation and administration of parenteral medications.These include the use of a sterile, single-use, disposable needle and syringe for each injection given and prevention of contamination of injection equipment and medication. Whenever possible, use of single-dose vials is preferred over multiple-dose vials, especially when medications will be administered to multiple patients. Outbreaks related to unsafe injection practices indicate that some healthcare personnel are unaware of, do not understand, or do not adhere to basic principles of infection control and aseptic technique. A survey of US healthcare workers who provide medication through injection found that 1% to 3% reused the same needle and/or syringe on multiple patients. Among the deficiencies identified in recent outbreaks were a lack of oversight of personnel and failure to follow-up on reported breaches in infection control practices in ambulatory settings. Therefore, to ensure that all healthcare workers understand and adhere to recommended practices, principles of infection control and aseptic technique need to be reinforced in training programs and incorporated into institutional policies that are monitored for adherence. d-8 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x dII.

Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-Care Settings, 2005. MMWR 2005,54(no. RR-17). For specific, comprehensive information on infection control measures to prevent the transmission of M. tuberculosis , please refer to this document. This document can be found at the following Web site: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5417a1.htm . The 2005 CDC guidelines recommend: All healthcare setting should have a written TB infection control plan as part of an overall infection control program. Every healthcare setting should conduct an initial and ongoing assessment of the risk of transmitting Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the setting. The risk assessment will determine the risk category of transmitting M. tuberculosis as: low-risk, medium risk, or potential ongoing risk/transmission. The infection control plan will differ if the setting is one in which: patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease are expected to be encountered, or patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease are not expected to be encountered. A TB infection control plan is based on three levels of controls: administrative controls, environmental controls, and respiratory-protection controls. d-10 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x dThe risk category for each of the three levels of (low, medium, or potential ongoing transmission) determines which administrative, environmental and respiratory protection measures are needed for the individual healthcare setting. The following types of healthcare settings are defined and discussed in (2005) Inpatient settings in which patients are to be expected to be encountered emergency department ICU surgical suites laboratories bronchoscopy suites sputum induction and inhalation therapy rooms autopsy suites embalming rooms Outpatient settings TB treatment facilities medical offices and ambulatory care settings dialysis units dental-care settings Non-traditional settings emergency medical services medical settings in correctional facilities home-based healthcare and outreach settings The following information contains an outline of general recommendations for managing patients who have suspected or confirmed TB disease, as discussed on pages 16-19 in the 2005 CDC Guidelines. For comprehensive information, please refer to the 2005 CDCD Guidelines or the most recent guidelines from CDC. Think TB! The primary risk to healthcare workers is contact with individuals who are not diagnosed or suspected of having infectious TB disease. Healthcare workers in all categories of healthcare settings should maintain a high index of suspicion for patients with signs and symptoms of TB disease and should implement appropriate precautions: prompt triage, airborne precautions, including airborne infection isolation (AII) rooms when available, diagnostic procedures, and prompt initiation of treatment for TB infection or TB disease upon diagnosis. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics d-11in f e c t i o u s di s e a s e in f o r Ma t i o nManagement of patients with confirmed or suspected TB Table 15: Administrative Controls Environmental ControlsRespiratory Protection Controls Settings in which patients with suspected or confirmed infectious TB disease are not expected to be encountered Triage only: initial evaluation of patients who will transfer to another setting.Implement written infection-control plan for triage of patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease. Update annually.Settings in which patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease are rarely seen and not treated do not need an airborne infection isolation (A.I.I.) room. Promptly recognize and trans fer patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease to a facility that treats patients with TB disease.Place in A.I.I. room, if it is available, or hold in a separate room with door closed, away from others, and not in a waiting room.If the patient has signs or symp toms of infectious TB disease (positive AFB smear result), have patient wear a surgical or procedure mask during transport, in waiting areas, or when others are present. Before transfer, hold patient in an area separate from healthcare workers and other persons..If available, air cleaning tech nolo gies can be used to increase the number of air exchanges. Inpatient settings, TB expected to be encountered. Outpatient settings in which patients with suspected or confirmed infectious TB disease are expected to be encountered. Perform annual risk assessment for the setting.Environmental controls should be implemented based on the types of activities that are performed.For healthcare workers, visitors and others entering an A.I.I. room of a patient with settings in which patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease, at least N95 disposable respirators should be worn.

Ten-minute exposure is not adequate to disinfect many objects, especially those which are difficult to clean, because they have narrow channels or other areas that can harbor organic material and bacteria. Twenty-minute exposure at 20\u00baC is the minimum time needed to reliably kill M. tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria with a 2% glutaraldehyde. With follow the FDA-cleared high-level disinfaction claim. Some high-level disinfectants have a reduced exposure time (e.g., ortho-Phthalaldehyde at 12 minutes at 20\u00baC) because of their rapid activity against mycobacteria or reduced exposure time due to increased mycobactericidal activity at elevated temperature (2.5% glutaraldehyde at 5 minutes at 35\u00baC).. 3 Tubing must be completely filled for disinfection. Care must be taken to avoid entrapment of air bubbles during immersion. 4 Material compatibility should be investigated when appropriate 5 A concentration of 1000 ppm available chlorine should be considered where culures or concentrated preparations of microorganizms have spilled (5.25% to 6.15% household bleach diluted 1:50 provides> 1000 ppm available chlorine). This solution may corrode some surfaces. 6 Pasteurization (washer-disinfector) of respiratory therapy or anesthesia equipment is a recognized alternative to high-level disinfection. Some data challenge the efficacy of some pasteurization units. 7 Thermostability should be investigated when appropriate. 8 Do not mix rectal and oral thermometers at any stage of handling or processing. 9 By law, all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products must be followed. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on the EPA-registered products label, the user assumes liability from any injuries resulting from off-label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics e-5pr inciples o f ster ilization a n Mixing Chlorine-Bleach Solution Table 20: 1:100 Concentration1 Metric Measurement Volumes Approximate Household Measurement Volumes Bleach Water Total Bleach Water Total 2.5 mL 247.5 mL 250 mL 23 tsp 1\u00bc cup 10 oz 5 mL 495 mL 500 mL 1\u00bc tsp 2\u00bd cups 20 oz 10 mL 990 mL 1 L 2 tsp 1 qt 1 qt 20 mL 1980 mL 2 L 4 tsp 2 qts 2 qts 1:10 c o n c e n t r a t i o n2 Metric Measurement Volumes Approximate Household Measurement Volumes Bleach Water Total Bleach Water Total 25 mL 225 mL 250 mL 2 Tbsp 1 cup + 2 Tbsp 10 oz 50 mL 450 mL 500 mL \u00bc cup 2\u00bc cups 20 oz 100 mL 900 mL 1 L 6 Tbsp 3\u00bd cups 1 qt 200 mL 1800 mL 2 L \u00be cup 7 cups 2 qts Desired Chlorine Concentration3 5000 ppm 1000 ppm Dilution of bleach (5.25% NaCl) 1:100 1:500 Dilution of bleach 1-30 days 1:5 1:25 1:50 1:250 1 This solution is used for general cleaning of non-porous environmental surfaces on a routine basis. The solution must be made fresh daily because the active ingredient is lost more rapidly in very dilute solutions than in the more concentrated solution. 2 This solution is used to decontaminate and disinfect non-porous environmental surfaces when a spill of blood, body fluids or feces has occurred. The solution can be made up once a week and dispensed from an opaque spray bottle which has been clearly labeled. 3 To maintain the chlorine concentration, the bleach solution must be stored in a closed, opaque plastic container. Over a one-month period, the chlorine level will be reduced 40% to 50%. Therefore, for long-term storage, the beginning concentration should be twice as strong as the desired final concentration. e-6 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x eAppendix F Clinic Laboratory InformationManual of Reference Services Guidelines for Specimen Collection and Submission Telephone Inquiries Telephone inquiries should be directed to: (512) 458-7578 for lab results, or (512) 458-7598 for inquiries about guidelines for the submission, collection, and handling of specimens. We examine specimens as carefully and rapidly as possible; however, we do not sacrifice accuracy for speed. Please consider the following information before making a telephone inquiry: Lab reporting results are given only to the original submitter. Upon receipt of the specimen at the Laboratory, most testing will be completed in one to three days; however, newborn screening tests take 3-6 days. Confirmation of findings in certain bacteriological examinations may necessitate a short delay in reporting results. If specimens must go to another reference center, the report will be delayed for at least two weeks. Of course, emergency matters may be pursued at any time. Reference Services If reference services are needed but are not provided in this laboratory system, the Laboratory uses the services of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia or in Ft. Collins, Colorado. When a particular test is available only from CDC, submitters should send the specimen DSHS requisition form, along with a patient history, to the Texas Department of State Health Services for forwarding to the CDC. Submission of Specimens Please exercise care when submitting specimens and requesting tests. Services are offered only in keeping with departmental policies, licensure, and mission; therefore, services may be withdrawn in case of misuse or improper specimen submission. Submission of proper specimens under optimum conditions is very important. Accurate tests seldom can be performed on poor specimens. The Laboratory enforces the principles of Good Laboratory Practices. The submitter is responsible for ensuring expiration dating on media. We will monitor the interval between the collection and the receipt of time-sensitive specimens (newborn screening, bacteriological water, gonorrhea). in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics f-3Guidelines for Specific Types of Specimens Prenatal Triple Screen Collection and Packing Instructions General Instructions: Submit a G-1C form for each patient with corresponding specimen tube.1.

They may either be serum tubes, silicon coated (red-top tubes), or Serum Separator tubes with clot activator and gel for serum separation (red gray or \"tiger\" top tubes). Assays will require at least 5mls of whole blood in a tube. General specimens handling requirements are listed below, however, they differ with each assay, so please refer to the test requested in the Lab Tests for Diseases/Agents section of this manual. Serum samples that are to be tested fresh may be stored for up to two hours at 2-8\u00b0C in the presence of clots. Serum may be separated from the clot by centrifugation and transferred to a sterile tube with a screw-cap (make sure that the seal is tight to prevent leakage). Serum separated from the clot may be stored at 2-8\u00b0C up to 48 hours. After 48 hours, or for shipping, the serum must be frozen at -20\u00b0C and sent on dry ice. Temperature level during entire shipment should be no warmer than -20\u00b0C. Pack specimens in compliance with government regulations covering the transportation of etiologic agents. To prevent hemolysis in the specimens avoid: bacterial contamination, the presence of water or chemicals in syringes or tubes, or rough treatment. Avoid extremely high temperatures, such as may occur in mail vans and drop boxes in the summer, and never freeze whole blood . How to collect serum sample using serum separator tubes with clot activator: Gently invert tube 5 times to mix clot activator with blood.1. Allow blood to clot for a minimum of 30 minutes in a vertical position. Observe a dense clot.2. Centrifuge at full speed (between 1100 and 1300g) for 10 minutes for swing-head unit or 15 minutes 3. for fixed angle units. Barrier will form, separating serum specimen from clot. Transport spun tube to the laboratory.4. A single result is significant in a few serological tests, such as immune status testing. In many cases, single results will be more misleading than helpful. Therefore, the Laboratory's policy requires paired specimens, that is two blood specimens collected from two to three weeks apart for most diseases. Collecting the first specimens as soon as possible after the onset of the disease is essential. Single specimens will be accepted for syphilis and HIV serology, immune status testing (i.e. Rubella in pregnant women), and IgM antibody tests. Single specimens may also be submitted for systemic mycoses when a chronic infection is underway.

The specimens must not be sent in the bacteriological preservative. The specimen should be divided into two portions, one being placed into a vial of 10% Formalin, the second being placed into a vial of PV A (polyvinyl alcohol). The Laboratory provides kits to qualified providers. Call (512) 458-7661. Fecal specimens for viral isolation Fecal specimens for viral isolation must not be chemically preserved. Instead, fresh, unpreserved stools must be submitted. Any viral isolation specimen should be maintained at refrigerator temperatures (4-8\u00b0 C) between the time of collection and the time of receipt in the laboratory. If the expected time between collection and receipt in the laboratory will be greater than 72 hours, freeze specimens after collection and ship on dry ice. Rabies specimens The DSHS Laboratory recommends shipping rabies specimens by bus. Guidelines for shipping rabies specimens are as follows: Specimens must be shipped in a sealed, sturdy double container; a Styrofoam container inside a cardboard box works well. Place completed Rabies Submission Form (G-9) in a separate plastic bag to keep the form dry. Enclose sufficient absorbent material to keep all moisture within the container. Specimens should not be frozen because freezing delays and frequently compromises the examination. Use sufficient cold packs, to maintain a cool environment, even with a delay of one full day. Wet ice is not recommended. If ice must be used, double bag to prevent leakage. zip lock bags are recommended. State law requires telephone notification to this Laboratory before shipment of rabies specimens: 1 (800) 252-8163 Specimen Management for Infrequently Encountered Organisms Table 22: Specimen Management for Infrequently Encountered Organisms Organism (disease)Specimen of choice Transport issues Comments Bartonella sp (cat scratch fever)Blood, tissue, lymph node aspirate1 wk at 4\u00b0C; in- definitely at -70\u00b0CMay see organisms in or on erythrocytes with Giemsa stain.

Be aware that many commercial carriers no longer accept specimens. When using any carrier, including the bus service or the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), package specimens to avoid leakage or breakage. All specimen mailing containers supplied by the Laboratory meet USPS and Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements for the shipment of biological substance, Category Bs. Specimens must be packed in triple containment with sufficient absorbent material enclosed to absorb the entire volume of liquid. The container used must meet current DOT and USPS regulations. Shipment of infectious agents requires specialized training and United Nations (UN)-approved packaging that the Lab does not provide. ALW AYS EXERT THE MAXIMUM PROTECTION FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE WHO HANDLE THE PARCELS AND TO AVOID JEOPARDIZING THE SYSTEM FOR SHIPPING SPECIMENS. The Laboratory policy is: ALL blood specimens in a container will be considered broken if one tube in that container is broken during shipment. Mailing Containers/Completion of Forms The Laboratory provides specimen mailing containers and labels to physicians and public health laboratories and water sample containers to any citizen upon request. The containers are the property of the State of Texas and must not be used for any purpose other than the shipment of specimens to the DSHS laboratory. The mailing containers and labels meet current DOT and USPS regulations for shipping biological substance, Category Bs. Shipping infectious specimens requires special mailing containers that the Lab does not supply. DSHS request form must be included with every specimen in the same container. Forms should be completed as follows: Use BOLD CAPITAL BLOCK LETTERS to complete all information that is requested on the form. If the patient is Medicaid eligible, you must provide the Medicaid number. For THSteps (EPSDT) specimens, you must provide the Medicaid number. Date of Birth, Date of Collection, and test request are required. Unidentified or improperly identified specimens are unsatisfactory and they will not be tested.

A mechanical failure, such as a broken drive shaft, a faulty bearing, or a disintegrated rotor, can produce high-velocity hazardous fragments. If these fragments escape the protective housing of the centrifuge, they can produce traumatic injury to personnel. Mechanical failure can be minimized by meticulous observance of the manufacturer's instructions and utilization of periodic rotor inspection service. Aerosols can be avoided by observing sound laboratory practices and using appropriate centrifuge safety equipment and containment hoods or cabinets. Shields, trunnion cups, and centrifuge tubes should be properly balanced. Ensure that matched sets of trunnion cups, shields, and adapters do not become mixed. If the compo nents are not inscribed with their weights by the manufacturer, colored stains can be applied for identification to avoid confusion. When the tubes are balanced, the shields, trunnion cups, and adapters, including any disinfectant solution or water added for balancing, should be included in the procedure. The basic concern is that the centers of gravity of the tubes are equidistant from the axis of rotation. To illustrate the importance of this, two identical tubes containing 20 g of mercury and 20 g of water, respectively, will balance perfectly on the scales; however, their performance in motion is totally different, leading to violent vibration with all its attendant hazards. This is especially important to consider when centrifuging gradients containing cesium salts. Centrifuge Figure 7: in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics f-21clinic la b o r a t o r y in f o r Ma t i o nG-11 Clinic Laboratory Information Screw caps, or other tight-fitting skirted caps that fit outside the rim of the centrifuge tube are safer to use than plug-in closures. Even screw-capped bottles are not without risk; if the rim is soiled and seals imperfectly, fluid will escape down the outside of the tubes. Aluminum foil should not be used to cap centrifuge tubes because it detaches or ruptures and does not prevent aerosols. Do not use cotton plugs when centrifuging BIOHAZARDous materials. Instead, use rubber stoppers or other tight-fitting plastic, rubber, or metal caps or closures. Heat-sealed tubes should be used when centrifuging highly toxic or pathogenic materials or concentrating infectious agents, (e.g., viruses). Continuous-flow rotors, particularly the steam driven Sharples TM designed for cream separation, are notorious generators of aerosols and must be enclosed in well ventilated hoods, if used with infectious agents. The frequency of use, maximum g-force exposure, washing, etching, abrasion, and method of storage affect the life expectancy of glass centrifuge tubes and bottles. The stresses developed during these processes are cumul ative in Pyrex TM glass despite its excellent chemical resistance. When used with proper adapters and cushions, it can withstand moderate speeds. Corex TM glass has four to six times the strength of conventional glass, greater resistance to alkalies and acids, scratching, and etching, and is unaffected by temperatures up to 300\u00b0C. In proper adapters, CorexTM tubes may be used at relatively high speeds. Before using glass centrifuge tubes, eliminate those with cracks, severe etching, scratches, and chipped rims. While plastic tubes and bottles resist breakage, they may begin to show signs of deterioration (crazing, cracking, or spotting) after several runs as a result of the interaction of centrifugal forces, chemical effects from samples and cleaning solutions, and autoclaving cycles of heat and pressure. Tubes showing these signs should be discarded. Note that celluloid (cellulose nitrate) centrifuge tubes are highly flammable, prone to shrinkage with age, can distort on boiling, and can be highly explosive in an autoclave. G-12 Rotor Use and Maintenance It is generally recommended that medium- and high-speed rotors be accelerated to a low speed before allowing them to reach higher programmed speeds. The detection of imbalances, (e.g., missing or mis- hung swinging buckets, unfastened rotor covers, and unaligned drive shafts) at low speed can prevent serious accidents at higher speeds. High-speed rotor heads are prone to metal fatigue and, where there is a chance that they may be used on more than one machine, each rotor should be accompanied by its own logbook indicating the number of hours run at top speeds. Failure to observe this precaution and to institute replacement after recommended periods of use can result in dangerous and expensive disintegration. Frequent inspection, cleaning and drying are important to ensure absence of corrosion or other damage that may f-22 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x flead to the development of cracks. Many high-speed rotors, including the zonal rotors for preparative ultracentrifuges, are made of aluminum. Precautions must be exercised to avoid their deterioration and corrosion. For example, alkalis (e.g., RadiacwashTM and Count-OffTM), halide salt solutions, and many acids should not come in contact with these rotors as they may remove the anodizing that protects the rotor from pitting. For gradient separations in aluminum rotors, sucrose solutions are recommended. Some rotors also contain cores of NorylTM which deteriorate in the presence of certain solvents, including benzene, chloroform, petroleum ether, and propylene glycol. In general, titanium rotors are preferred. Caution should be exercised as to what chemicals, including disinfectants, are permitted to contact component materials that are subject to deterioration. If the rotor is treated with a disinfectant, it should be rinsed with clean water and dried as soon as the disinfectant has adequately decontaminated the rotor. Before using a rotor, inspect it carefully for the presence of contaminants, salt deposits, or cracks. Rinse out buckets/rotor cavity after each run. Use special brushes and detergent. Dry thoroughly and grease gaskets and threads according to manufacturer's recommendations. Always run all swing-out buckets. Open and inspect all buckets before and after use. Remove condensation ice from rotor chamber at frequent intervals. G-13 Clinic Laboratory Information Rubber \"O\" rings and tube closures must be examined for deterioration and must be kept lubricated with material recommended by the makers. This provision is especially important for the use of zonal rotors. Where tubes of different materials are provided (e.g., celluloid, polypropylene, stainless steel), care must be taken to employ tube closures designed specifically for the type of tube in use. These caps are often similar in appear ance, but are prone to leakage if applied to tubes of the wrong material. When properly designed tubes and rotors are well maintained and handled, leakage should never occur. When service is required, the centrifuge must be decontaminated before allowing service personnel to repair it. In the event of a centrifuge malfunction and/or spill which may create hazardous aerosols, air- circulating equipment should be shut down, (e.g., air conditioners, fans, fume hoods, biological safety cabinets) and the room should be vacated by all personnel for a suitable period (at least 30 minutes) to allow the aerosol to dissipate. Broken glass should then be cleaned up promptly and contaminated areas properly decon taminated. Remember that if contaminated materials have reached the chamber, the pump oil will be contaminated as well. The person using the centrifuge, along with the principal investigator in charge of the lab, is responsible for ensuring that clean-up and decontamination is achieved. Maintenance service may be refused on centrifuges which appear to be improperly used and/or contaminated. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics f-23clinic la b o r a t o r y in f o r Ma t i o nU.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration Table 23: Labeling Requirements Item No Label Needed if Universal Precautions Are Used and Specific Use of Container or Item Is Known to All EmployeesBIOHAZARD LabelRed Container Regulated waste container (e.g., contaminated sharps container) X or X Reusable contaminated sharps container (e.g., surgical instruments soaking in a tray) X or X Refrigerator/freezer holding blood or other potentially infectious material X Containers used for storage, transport or shipping of blood X or X Blood/blood products for clinical use No labels required Individual specimen containers of blood or other potentially infectious materials remaining in facilityX X or X Contaminated equipment needed service (e.g., dialysis equipment; suction apparatus) X Plus a label specifying where the contamination exists Specimens and regulated waste shipped from the primary facility to another facility for service or disposalX or X Contaminated laundry X* or X or X Contaminated laundry sent to another facility that does not use Universal PrecautionsX or X f-24 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x fFederal Register: November 1, 2006 (Volume 71, Number 211) [Rules and Regulations] [Page 64118-64121] From the Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr01no06-5] ========================================================================= ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 111 New Standards for Mailing Sharps and Other Regulated Medical Waste Containers AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The Postal Service revises the standards for mailing sharps and other regulated medical waste containers. The new standards include improvements to the packaging, the package testing, and the process for authorizing and suspending authorization. DATES: Effective Date: November 9, 2006. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bert Olsen, 202-268-7276. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background We published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (71 FR 19840, April 18, 2006) to revise the standards for mailing sharps and other regulated medical waste containers. Our proposal included the following changes: To require container vendors to provide the Postal Service with the names and addresses of their 1. distributors and to provide updates on a quarterly basis. To revise the process for authorizing and suspending authorization for mailing sharps and other 2. regulated medical waste containers to enhance monitoring and control of medical waste in the mail. To revise container standards and container testing standards to ensure that container testing is 3. performed on a consistent basis for all sharps and other regulated medical waste containers. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics f-25clinic la b o r a t o r y in f o r Ma t i o nComments Received We received comments from four authorized sharps container vendors and one potential vendor. All commenters supported the concept of revising the rules to promote uniform testing methods and to ensure the integrity of mail pieces containing sharps and other medical waste. Documentation Requirements Three commenters objected to the requirement that vendors provide a list of distributors to the Postal Service. All three commenters argued that requiring vendors to provide a quarterly list of distributors could lead to disclosure of sensitive proprietary vendor information. We agree that the Postal Service can identify a vendor's distributors, if needed, by requiring vendors to provide this information on request. Therefore, the final rule requires vendors to provide the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of their distributors to the Postal Service only on request. Packaging One commenter objected to a minimum size limit for the BIOHAZARD symbol placed on the outer shipping container. The commenter stated that requiring a 3 inch by 4 inch symbol would be excessively large on a small mail piece. The Postal Service notes that currently no approved medical waste mail pieces are so small as to not easily accommodate a 3 inch by 4 inch BIOHAZARD symbol. The new standard will clarify that the 3 inch by 4 inch label requirement applies to the outer shipping container. For safety reasons, medical waste containers must be easily identified as containing BIOHAZARDous materials. Therefore, this final rule adopts the standard as published in the proposal. Three commenters did not want the Postal Service to eliminate the use of outer shipping containers with interlocking bottoms. All three commenters stated that current requirements that allow for the use of shipping containers with interlocking bottom flaps reinforced with tape are more than adequate, especially considering the overall rigorous testing mandates. After further consultation with package testing professionals, we conclude that interlocking bottom flaps sufficiently contain the primary receptacle, particularly when reinforced with tape. Therefore, we will maintain our current standards that allow interlocking bottoms when they are reinforced with water-resistant tape. Two commenters requested clarification of the proposed changes to the secondary container requirements. The commenters stated that increasing the plastic bag thickness requirement from 3 mil to 4 mil was not necessary. In addition, they stated that it was not advantageous to require the plastic bag to be placed around the secondary box. We believe that increasing the thickness of the plastic bag will help maintain the contents of the primary container should it break. Therefore, we will require plastic bags to be 4 mil thick. However, we will not require the plastic bag to be placed outside the secondary box. Two commenters requested clarification of the proposed standards in section 601.10.17.7b4 of Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM). W e revised this section to clarify that the absorbent material must be placed in the primary receptacle. Item e10 will serve as the required test to ensure that the secondary system is watertight. One commenter suggested that the Postal Service f-26 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x frequire screw caps for primary containers. Historical data on safely mailing these mail pieces does not indicate a need to require screw caps. Therefore, this final rule adopts the standard as published in the proposal. Mail piece Testing One commenter objected to the requirement that mail pieces be tested at the vendor's identified maximum weight and that the container's maximum allowable weight be printed on the outer shipping container. The commenter stated that it was impossible to predict the maximum weight of the materials that might be placed into a container and that end users would not have scales to weigh the mail piece. We believe, in the interest of safety, that these mail pieces should be tested at the highest possible weight determined by the vendor, not to exceed 25 pounds, to ensure that the mail piece can safely contain the maximum weight. Therefore, this final rule adopts the requirements as published in the proposal. One commenter suggested that the Postal Service require accreditation of package testing facilities. Section 601.10.17.7d of the proposed rule states \"the Postal Service may require proof of accreditation or other documentation to support the credentials of an independent testing facility. '' We believe that this standard provides the authority to require proof of credentials as necessary. Therefore, this final rule adopts the standard as published in the proposal. One commenter questioned the need for a reference to 49 CFR 178.604, Leak-proof test. The commenter stated that we should not refer to the test because our pass/fail criteria were not the same as the criteria in 49 CFR. The test in 49 CFR 178.604 requires that the primary container hold 20 kPa without leakage. Our criteria allow for air leakage around the opening of the primary container as long as there is no air leakage anywhere else and no leakage of water. We agree that it would be clearer, in this case, to eliminate the reference and to provide only the USPS test procedure and pass/fail criteria. One commenter requested clarification on the height of the required drop tests. Our proposed rule requires 30-foot drops for the wet and cold tests as identified in 49 CFR 178.609e and f. The impact test requires a drop of 3 feet as identified in 49 CFR 178.609h. While we understand that the test identified in 49 CFR consists of requirements for packaging infectious substances, we believe that the Postal Service's handling and transportation systems are different from those of commercial carriers and require more stringent acceptance criteria. Therefore, this final rule adopts the standard as published in the proposal. One commenter suggested that testing material should be simulated medical waste. We disagree. The testing material should consist of sharps or other regulated medical waste as defined in DMM 601.10.17.2e and g. Vendors are on notice that contaminated medical waste will not be used for testing purposes. Therefore, this final rule adopts the standard as published in the proposal. Mail piece Acceptance One commenter objected to requirements that vendors retrieve improperly labeled containers when identified and held at plants. The commenter suggested that the Postal Service should confirm the mail piece was properly marked and labeled before accepting it. While we continually educate employees on acceptance criteria, the mailer remains responsible for properly labeling the mail piece. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics f-27clinic la b o r a t o r y in f o r Ma t i o nTherefore, this final rule adopts the requirement as published in the proposal. This final rule will be effective on November 9, 2006. Sharps and other regulated medical waste containers that are currently approved for mailing can maintain their authorization until it expires (24 months from the most recent approval). Containers must meet the new standards if they are submitted for authorization (or renewal of authorization) on or after November 9. We adopt the following amendments to Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR 111.1.

In addition, vendors must submit package testing results from an independent testing facility when the design of a container system changes or every 24 months, whichever occurs first. The test results must show that if every mail piece prepared for mailing were subject to the environmental and test conditions in 49 CFR and the additional test requirements in 10.17.7e, no contents would be released into the environment and the effectiveness of the packaging would not be significantly reduced. The Postal Service may require proof of accreditation or other documentation to support the credentials of an independent testing facility. [Add new item e as follows:] e. Testing Criteria. Each mail piece must pass each of the tests described below: Leak-proof test. The test must be conducted on one primary receptacle with the lid in place, without 1. the secondary and outer packaging. The test duration must be at least 5 minutes and must be conducted at 20 kPa (3 psi). The pass/fail criterion is: No air leakage from anywhere other than the closure of the primary receptacle. Air leakage at the closure is not considered a failure if the primary receptacle passes the test for watertightness as determined by placing 50 ml of deionized water into the primary receptacle, securing the closure, and then turning the container on its side and observing for any evidence of leakage. Any evidence of water leaking from the primary receptacle is a failure. Stacking test. One mail piece must withstand the test in 49 CFR 178.606. The dynamic compression 2. test must be conducted on the empty, unsealed mail piece assembled for mailing, without the primary receptacle(s). The test mass is the vendor-identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer shipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions. A compensation factor of 1.5 must be used to compute the test load, based on the vendor-identified weight. The pass/fail criteria are: No buckling of the side walls sufficient to cause damage to the contents in the primary container, and in no case does the deflection exceed 1 inch. Vibration test. One mail piece filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste must withstand 3. the test in 49 CFR 178.608. The test mail piece is filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste to the vendor-identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer shipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions. The test sample is prepared as it would be for mailing. The pass/fail criterion is: No rupture, cracking, or splitting of any primary receptacle. Wet drop test. Five mail pieces filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste must withstand 4. the test in 49 CFR 178.609e. Each test mail piece is filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste to the vendor-identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer f-30 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x fshipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions included with each mail piece. Each mail piece is prepared as it would be for mailing and subjected to the water spray as described in the test. A separate, untested mail piece is used for each drop orientation: Top, longest side, shortest side, and corner. The pass/fail criteria are: No rupture, cracking, or splitting of any primary receptacle, and no contents may penetrate into or through the body or lid of any primary receptacle. Cold drop test. Five mail pieces filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste must withstand 5. the test in 49 CFR 178.609f.

E6-18063 Filed 10-31-06; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7710-12-P 10.0 Hazardous Materials 10.17 Definitions The following definitions apply: Hazardous material is any article or substance designated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) as a. being capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property during trans porta tion. In international commerce, hazardous materials are known as \"dangerous goods. \" Limited quantity is the maximum amount of a specific hazardous material that is exempted from the labeling or b. packaging requirements in 49 CFR. Not every hazardous material is eligible to be shipped as a limited quantity. Almost all limited quantity materials are nonmailable. ORM-D (Other Regulated Material) material is a limited quantity of a hazardous material that presents a limited c. hazard during transportation due to its form, quantity, and packaging. In almost all instances, the proper shipping name for an ORM-D material is consumer commodity. Not all hazardous material permitted to be shipped as a limited quantity can qualify as an ORM-D material. ORM-D materials having the proper shipping name of \"consumer commodity\" are mailable subject to USPS quantity and packaging standards. Consumer commodity is a hazardous material that is packaged and distributed in a quantity and form intended d. or suitable for retail sale and designed for consumption by individuals for their personal care or household use purposes. This term can also include certain drugs or medicines. Not all hazardous material permitted to be shipped as a limited quantity can qualify as a consumer commodity. Air transportation requirements, for the purposes of 10.0 only, apply to all mailable hazardous materials sent at the e. First-Class Mail, Priority Mail, or Express Mail rates. All mailable hazardous materials sent at those rates must meet the requirements that apply to air transportation. Mailable hazardous materials sent at any of those rates may or may not be transported via air depending on the distance between the point of origination and the point of destination, and the ability of the USPS to obtain an air carrier between those points. Surface transportation requirements, for the purposes of 10.0 only, apply to all mailable hazardous materials sent at f. the Standard Mail or Package Services rates. All mailable hazardous materials sent at the Standard Mail or Package Services rates must meet the requirements that apply to surface transportation. Primary receptacle is the container (e.g., tube, vial, bottle) that holds the hazardous material.g. Secondary container is the packaging component into which the primary receptacle(s) and any required absorbent h. and cushioning material is securely placed. The packaging of certain mailable hazardous materials does not require the use of a secondary container. Outer shipping container is the exterior packaging component into which a primary receptacle, along with any i. required absorbent and cushioning material, and the secondary container (if required) are securely placed. The outer shipping container bears the addressing information along with all required markings. f-32 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x f10.2 U.S. Department of Transportation Regulations of Hazardous Material The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates the surface and air carriage of hazardous materials within the United States via any means of transportation. The DOT regulations for the transport of hazardous materials are codified in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (49 CFR) 100-185. USPS mailing standards for hazardous materials generally adhere to 49 CFR, but also include many additional limitations and prohibitions. 10.3 USPS Standards for Hazardous Material The USPS standards generally restrict the mailing of hazardous materials to ORM-D materials with the proper shipping name of \"consumer commodity\" that meet USPS quantity limitations and packaging requirements. The few non- ORM-D materials permitted to be mailed are subject to the standards in 10.0. Detailed information on the mailability of specific hazardous materials is contained in Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail. 10.4 Hazard Class Every hazardous material is assigned to one of nine hazard classes identified in 49 CFR 172.101 and 173. Some hazard classes are further separated into divisions based on their physical or chemical properties. For postal purposes, Exhibit 10.4 generally summarizes the mailability of hazardous materials by hazard class.

Anyone who mails, or causes to be mailed, a nonmailable or improperly packaged hazardous material can be subject to legal penalties, including but not limited to those specified in 18 USC. f-34 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x f10.6 Mailability Rulings for Hazardous Materials Generally, the acceptability for mailing chemicals and other types of hazardous materials depends on container fluid/ vapor capacities, the ability of the complete mail piece to contain the material, and the method of absorbing and containing the product in case of accidental leakage of the primary receptacle. To determine mailability of a specific material, a mailer must submit a material safety data sheet (MSDS) and the following information to the Pricing and Classification Service Center (PCSC): Name of material, hazard class, and assigned United Nations (UN) or North America (NA) identification number.a. Chemical composition by percentage of ingredient.b. Flash point.c. Toxic properties.d. Irritant action when inhaled, swallowed, or contacted by eyes or skin.e. Special precautions necessary to permit handling without harm to USPS employees or damage to f. property or other mail. Explanation of warning labels and shipping papers required by state or federal regulations.g. Proposed packaging method, including the addressing and required markings.h. Proposed number of pieces to be mailed, class of mail, and post office(s) of mailing.i. 10.Warning Labels for Hazardous Materials With few exceptions as noted in these standards, most hazardous materials acceptable for mailing fall within the Other Regulated Materials (ORM-D) regulations of CFR 49 173.144, which do not require DOT hazard class warning labels. Except for Division 6.2 materials under 10.17.4 and dry ice under 10.20.4, any hazardous material bearing or required to bear a DOT hazard class warning label under the requirements in 49 CFR is prohibited from mailing. Mailable ORM-D material must be marked as required in 10.8. Mailable hazardous material must bear DOT handling labels (e.g., orientation arrows, magnetized materials) when applicable. 10.8 Package Markings for Hazardous Materials Each mail piece containing a mailable hazardous material must be plainly and durably marked on the address side with the required shipping name and UN identification number. The UN identification number is not required on a mail piece that contains an ORM-D material. A mailable ORM-D material must be marked on the address side with \"ORM-D\" or \"ORM-D AIR, \" as applicable, immediately following or below the proper shipping name. The proper shipping name for a mailable ORM-D material is \"consumer commodity. \" The designation \"ORM-D\" or \"ORM-D AIR, \" as required, must be placed within a rectangle that is approximately 6.3 mm (1/4 inch) larger on each side than the designation. Mailable ORM-D materials sent as Standard Mail or Package Services must also be marked on the address side as \"Surface Only\" or \"Surface Mail Only. \" 10.9 Shipping Papers for Hazardous Materials A shipper's declaration for dangerous goods (shipping paper) prepared under 49 CFR 172.200 through 172.205 is required for certain types of hazardous materials when mailed. The shipping paper must be completed and signed in triplicate by the mailer. It must be affixed to the outside of the mail piece within an envelope or similar carrier that can be easily opened and resealed to allow viewing of the document. Shipping papers are required as follows: Air transportation requirements. Except for nonregulated materials sent under 10.17.3 or 10.17.8 and biological a. substance, Category Bs sent under 10.17.5, mail pieces containing mailable hazardous materials sent at the First-Class Mail, Priority Mail, or Express Mail rates must include a shipping paper. Surface transportation requirements. Except for nonregulated materials sent under 10.17.3 or 10.17.8 and mailable b.

The following types of hazardous materials that are prohibited from carriage on air transportation must not be sent at the First-Class Mail, Priority Mail, or Express Mail rates: Anything susceptible to damage or that can become harmful because of changes in temperature or atmospheric a. pressures unless protected against the effects of such changes. Magnetic materials that have a field strength sufficient to cause a compass deviation at a distance of 15 feet (4.6 b. meters) or more from any point on the outer packaging. Flammable materials (gases, liquids, and solids).c. Radioactive materials.d. Materials excluded from air shipment by DOT regulations (49 CFR 100-185) or of the applicable state (country) or e. air carrier operator variations. Certain restricted articles, as described in 49 CFR 100-185 and the operator variations of the air carriers, may be accepted for air transportation if properly packaged. These articles must be labeled and bear a shipper's declaration in triplicate, as required by 49 CFR 172.204, or must be marked according to the air carrier's operator variations. Refer to the technical instruction of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for air carrier operator variations. 10.11 Explosives (Hazard Class 1) 10.11.1 Definition An explosive is any substance, article, or device that is designed to function by explosion (i.e., an extremely rapid release of gas and heat) or that, by chemical reaction within itself, is able to function in a similar manner even if not designed to function by explosion, unless the substance or article is otherwise classed under the provisions in 49 CFR. Hazard class 1 has six divisions as shown in Exhibit 10.4. No further explanation of the six divisions is provided in these standards because explosives are prohibited in the mail except as permitted in 10.11.2. 10.11.2 Mailability Explosives are prohibited in international mail. Explosives are prohibited in the domestic mail via air transportation. For domestic surface transportation, explosives are prohibited except for certain Division 1.4S toy propellant devices and safety fuses specifically approved by the manager of Mailing Standards (see 608.8.0 for address) before mailing. A mailable explosive must meet the packaging and marking requirements provided with the manager's approval. A shipping paper is required. 10.12 Gases (Hazard Class 2) 10.12.1 Definition Hazard class 2 consists of three divisions: Division 2.1, Flammable Gases. A material that is a gas at 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) or less and 14.7 psi (101.3 kPa) of pressure. a.

Exempt human or animal specimen means a human or animal sample (including, but not limited to, secreta, excreta, f. blood and its components, tissue and tissue fluids, and body parts) transported for routine testing not related to the diagnosis of an infectious disease. Typically, exempt human specimens are specimens for which there is a low probability that the sample is infectious, such as specimens for drug or alcohol testing; cholesterol testing; blood glucose level testing; prostate-specific antigens (PSA) testing; testing to monitor heart, kidney, or liver function; pregnancy testing; and testing for diagnosis of noninfectious diseases such as cancer biopsies. Exempt human or animal specimens are not subject to regulation as hazardous materials but must be packaged according to 10.17.9. Patient specimen means material that is collected directly from humans or animals and transported for purposes g. such as diagnosis and research. Patient specimens include excreta, secreta, blood and its components, tissue and tissue swabs, body parts, and specimens in transport media (such as transwabs, culture media, and blood culture bottles). Regulated medical waste, for USPS purposes, means a soft waste material (other than a sharp) derived from the h. medical treatment, diagnosis, immunization, or biomedical research of a human or animal. Soft medical waste includes items such as used rubber gloves, swabs, gauze, tongue depressors, and other similar material. Mark these mail pieces with identification number UN 3291. Sharps medical waste, for USPS purposes, means a medical waste object that is capable of cutting or penetrating skin or i. packaging material and that is contaminated with a pathogen or may become contaminated with a pathogen derived from the medical treatment, diagnosis, immunization, or biomedical research of a human or animal.

Vendors must retrieve mail pieces held at processing facilities due to improper labeling such as no return address 8. or due to improperly completed shipping papers. Package Testing. Vendors must submit to the manager, Mailing Standards (see 608.8.0 for address), package testing e. results from an independent testing facility for each package for which the vendor is requesting authorization. In addition, vendors must submit package testing results from an independent testing facility when the design of a container system changes or every 24 months, whichever occurs first. The test results must show that if every mail piece prepared for mailing were subject to the environmental and test conditions in 49 CFR and the additional test requirements in 10.17.5f, no contents would be released into the environment and the effectiveness of the packaging would not be significantly reduced. The Postal Service may require proof of accreditation or other documentation to support the credentials of an independent testing facility. Testing Criteria. Packages tested for approval as Medical Professional Packages may not be tested using pre-primary f. containers that are currently, or have previously been, approved as USPS primary containers. Test reports must identify by brand name the pre-primary containers used during testing. Each mail piece must pass each of the tests described below: Leak-proof test. The test must be conducted on one primary receptacle with the lid in place, without the 1. secondary and outer packaging. The test duration must be at least 5 minutes and must be conducted at 20 kPa (3 psi). The pass/fail criterion is: no air leakage from anywhere other than the closure of the primary receptacle. Air leakage at the closure is not considered a failure if the primary receptacle passes the test for watertightness as determined by placing 50 ml of deionized water into the primary receptacle, securing the closure, and then turning the container on its side and observing for any evidence of leakage. Any evidence of water leaking from the primary receptacle is a failure. Stacking test. One mail piece must withstand the test in 49 CFR 178.606. The dynamic compression test must 2. be conducted on the empty, unsealed mail piece assembled for mailing, without the primary receptacle(s). The test mass is the vendor-identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer shipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions. A compensation factor of 1.5 must be used to compute the test load, based on the vendor-identified weight. The pass/fail criteria are: no buckling of the sidewalls sufficient to cause damage to the contents in the primary receptacle, and in no case does the deflection exceed 1 inch. f-48 in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinicsap p e n d i x fVibration test. One mail piece filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste must withstand the test in 49 3. CFR 178.608. The test mail piece is filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste to the vendor-identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer shipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions. The test sample is prepared as it would be for mailing. The pass/fail criterion is: no rupture, cracking, or splitting of any primary receptacle. Wet drop test. Five mail pieces filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste must withstand the test in 4. 49 CFR 178.609e. Each test mail piece is filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste to the vendor- identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer shipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions included with each mail piece. Each mail piece is prepared as it would be for mailing and subjected to a water spray as described in the test. A separate, untested mail piece is used for each drop orientation: top, longest side, shortest side, and corner. The pass/fail criteria are: no rupture, cracking, or splitting of any primary receptacle, and no contents may penetrate into or through the body or lid of any primary receptacle. Cold drop test. Five mail pieces filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste must withstand the test in 49 5. CFR 178.609f. Each test mail piece is filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste to the vendor-identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer shipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions included with each mail piece. Each mail piece is prepared as it would be for mailing and chilled as described in the test. A separate, untested mail piece is used for each drop orientation: top, longest side, shortest side, and corner. The pass/fail criteria are: no rupture, cracking, or splitting of any primary receptacle, and no contents may penetrate into or through the body or lid of any primary receptacle. Impact test. One mail piece filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste must withstand the test in 49 6. CFR 178.609h. The test mail piece is filled with sharps or other regulated medical waste to the vendor-identified maximum weight, not to exceed 25 pounds, as indicated on the outer shipping container and on the assembly and closing instructions included with each mail piece. The mail piece is prepared as it would be for mailing. The pass/fail criteria are: no rupture, cracking, or splitting of any primary receptacle, and no contents may penetrate into or through the body or lid of any primary receptacle. Puncture-resistant test. Package testing results must show that during all of the previous tests, the contents did 7. not penetrate through the primary receptacle. Temperature test. Package testing results must show that each primary receptacle maintained its integrity when 8. exposed to temperatures as low as 0\u00b0F and as high as 120\u00b0F. Absorbency test. Package testing results must show that the primary receptacle(s) contain enough absorbent 9. material to absorb three times the total liquid allowed within the primary receptacle in case of leakage. Absorbency is determined by pouring 150 ml of deionized water into the primary receptacle(s), then turning the receptacle(s) upside down and observing for any evidence of free liquid not absorbed on contact. Any evidence of free liquid is a failure. Watertight test. Package testing results must show that no leakage occurred when 50 ml of deionized water was 10. placed into the secondary containment system and the entire system turned upside down for 5 minutes. Suspension of Authorization. The Postal Service may suspend a vendor's authorization based on information that a g. mail piece no longer meets the standards for mailing sharps medical waste and regulated medical waste containers, or that the mail piece poses an unreasonable safety risk to Postal Service employees or the public. The suspension can be made immediately, making the mail piece nonmailable immediately. The vendor may contest a decision to suspend authorization by writing to the manager, Mailing Standards (see 608.8.0 for address), within 7 days from the date of the letter of suspension. The appeal should provide evidence demonstrating why the decision should be reconsidered. Any order suspending authorization remains in effect during an appeal or other challenge. When a vendor is notified that its authorization to mail sharps or other regulated medical waste containers has been suspended, the vendor must immediately: Recall all identified containers.1. Notify all customers that they cannot mail the identified containers.2. Suspend sales and distribution of all identified containers.3. in f e c t i o n co n t r o l Ma n u a l f o r aMb u l a t o r y ca r e clinics f-49clinic la b o r a t o r y in f o r Ma t i o nCollect the identified containers from distributors, consumers, and the Postal Service without using the mail and 4. in accordance with all federal and state regulations. 10.17.6 Packaging Used Health Care Products A used health care product known or reasonably suspected to contain a Category A material is not mailable.
