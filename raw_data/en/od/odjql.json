We use immune-boosting essential oil blends in many ways: - Of course, we diffuse! I LOVE the smell of essential oils and their all-natural therapeutic benefits. - In rooms where I'm not running a diffuser (like a bathroom) we use an essential oil room spray. - We even use immune-support essential oils in our countertop and bathroom cleaners. - And we use roller bottles to put essential oils (diluted with a carrier oil like fractionated coconut oil) on the bottoms of our feet. We use a 5% dilution (about 10 drops of essential oil in a 10 ml bottle) for me and my husband and a 2% dilution (about 4 drops of essential oil in 10 ml of carrier oil) for our 13 year old daughter. I like variety, so I change up the essential oil blends that we use for immune support. Sometimes I want a spicy blend, other times I want a woodsy scent or a floral scent or a uplifting citrus blend. I love that it's so easy to make a new blend. I can get a completely new aroma but still get the same great immune boosting support! - spicy blend includes rosemary, clove, eucalyptus, cinnamon, and wild orange essential oils - woodsy blend includes arborvitae, cardamom, and cassia essential oils - floral blend includes lavender, geranium, rosemary, and melaleuca essential oils - citrus blend includes invigorating blend, grapefruit, and protective blend of essential oils - traditional blend includes protective blend, lemon, oregano, melaleuca, and frankincense essential oils I'm excited to share with you theses 25 recipes for using essential oils for the support of a healthy immune system!!
