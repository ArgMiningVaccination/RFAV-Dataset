The healing mechanism that drives homeopathic medicine is a natural phenomenon observed between the earth and our body known as the law of similars. This principle of pharmacology states that healing occurs when symptoms are treated with a corresponding source in nature that produces similar symptoms if ingested in its crude form by a healthy person. In preparing homeopathic medicine, a natural source is transformed from its crude state into a healing agent that allows an interaction of the similar chemistries between the natural source and the body to neutralize symptoms and restore health. Claims based on traditional homeopathic practice, not accepted medical evidence. Not FDA evaluated. How can I benefit from using homeopathy? Homeopathic medicine is one of the safest approaches to self-care. For over 200 years, homeopathy has provided an effective, natural choice to treat physical and emotional conditions. Using therapeutically-prepared micro doses of plant, mineral and biological sources, homeopathic preparations ensure a high standard of purity and are non-toxic. Homeopathy works with the body's innate healing ability to respond to the cause of symptoms, without masking signs of illness. It offers a gentle way to restore health that is safe for children, elderly and those taking other medications. Our homeopathic products provide reliable relief for some of the key conditions of your active life-styles without risk of over-medication or side effects. How quickly do homeopathic medicines work It depends on the condition and severity of symptoms experienced. Emotional and acute conditions tend to respond within minutes. Chronic conditions like arthritis may take longer or require more frequent doses to achieve the desired state of wellbeing. Customers often report symptomatic relief from anxiety, sleeplessness, and grief after their first dose. During periods of acute stress, we advise more frequent repetitions to support and rebalance your body on both a physical and emotional level. Indications Do homeopathic medicines interact with other medications? No. Homeopathic medicines do not interfere with prescription drugs such as blood pressure medications, antibiotics, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medicines or other over-the-counter medications. While most drugs interact with the body's physical chemistry, homeopathy medicines are stripped of their physical properties and only engage the body's innate healing response to restore health. Neither therapy will interfere with the effectiveness of the other and are safe to take in conjunction with each other. Homeopathic medicines are not meant to replace medications prescribed by your physician. How frequently should I take homeopathic medicines? Take one dose and repeat every half hour as needed until you see improvement. How frequently you use homeopathic medicine will vary from day to day, depending on your physical and emotional state and external stressors. If you are under a deadline at work, you may find it supportive to keep a box of Stress Mints on your desk and use them throughout the day to stay relaxed and on-task. If you experience anxiety while flying, take a Calm Drop before take-off and repeat if anxiety resurfaces throughout the flight. If you are sore after working out at the gym, take an Arnica Drop every hour to aid your body's repair. If you feel a cold coming on, take a Pick Up Drop every hour to re-energize your body's immune response. When you feel better, discontinue using the remedy or lozenge. Our best advice is to keep the lozenges that fit your needs close at hand so you can take them as needed. If I use a homeopathic medicine every day, does it become less effective? No, these remedies do not lose their effectiveness with frequent usage. Homeopathic medicines are safe and non-habit forming. Is taking two lozenges more effective than taking one lozenge at a time? No greater effect is achieved by taking two lozenges at a time than by taking one lozenge because a homeopathic dosage is not body-mass dependent. Once you take a dose, the body receives a healing message to do something - stop the throbbing, ease tension, improve circulation, etc. The body's natural intelligence receives this message and responds without the need for larger doses. What will add therapeutic value is to increase the frequency of dosage during times of stress or acute symptoms. What is the difference between single remedies and lozenges? Single remedies are best when the picture of the person's state of health fits the remedy's description. For example, Nux Vomica is the best remedy for treating indigestion as a result of over-indulgence. Whereas, lozenges are made from a combination of remedies designed to holistically address conditions where multiple factors might be in play. For example, stress is often the result of multiple physical and emotional causes, which may include: overwork, fatigue, emotional distress, poor digestion and circulation. Stress Mints are formulated to address each of these factors, triggering the body's natural healing ability to restore balance and well-being. Products & Ingredients Will your stress-relief products make me feel drowsy? These products aim to bring a person back to their center of health and well-being. Stress Mints and Calm Drops will help support a person's alertness throughout the day, while bringing about a sense of inner calm. Some customers report using Calm Drops or Stress Mints in the evening as they unwind before bed, while others rely on Moon Drops as their sleep aid of choice. Use whatever product works best for you. Moon Drops are meant to be taken before sleep, so they do help a person become drowsy and fall into a restful sleep. Homeopathic medicine works very gently, without causing you to feel drugged. Are Moon Drops habit forming? No, Moon Drops are not habit forming and are safe to use as often as needed. Homeopathic medicines work very gently without causing you to feel drugged. If you wake up during the night and are unable to fall back asleep, you can take another Moon Drop without risk of side effects, even if you need to wake up in a few hours. Does peppermint interfere with the effectiveness of homeopathic medicines? No, peppermint does not interfere or counteract the effectiveness of homeopathic medicines. While some homeopathic practitioners caution patients against using mint while taking a remedy, the research does not back up this position. European physicians have conducted tests on animals and humans that have found that peppermint does not interfere with the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies. Researchers have observed that when a homeopathic remedy is administered, then followed by peppermint syrup or peppermint leaves, that the results are still therapeutic. Kids provide our best proof: they eat all kinds of things and brush their teeth with heavy peppermint toothpaste and the remedies work just the same. Contact us if you would like our position statement on the usage of mint with homeopathy. *Source: \" [Homeopathy for Doctor and Patient](https://www.historicalremedies.com/s/homeopathy-for-doctor-and-patient-po37.pdf)\" by Michel Philippe & Aubin Picard *Source: \" [Mint Not Contraindicated With Homeopathy](https://www.historicalremedies.com/s/mint-not-contraindictated-with-homeopathy.pdf)\" by Eric Foxman & Mary Beth Watkins Are animal sources used in homeopathy? Most homeopathic remedies are vegan in origin. Of the remedies we offer, three are made using animal sources. PMS Drops contain Sepia made from the ink expelled from the cuttlefish. The Single Remedy Cantharis is sourced from the Cantharis Beetle. Calm Drops are formulated with Lachesis which is derived from snake venom. Homeopathic medicines are highly diluted preparations stripped of their physical chemistry, leaving only the energetic essence from the original source. If you are concerned about using Cantharis, Lachesis or Sepia due to your dietary preferences, you can refrain from using these remedies. Our products are not tested on animals. Safety How long will homeopathic remedies keep before expiring? How should they be stored? These remedies are intended to be used within three years of the manufactured date found on the box. Homeopathy should be stored in a convenient place like your purse, a drawer at work, or your glove compartment. It is wise to not store them in direct sunlight, extreme temperatures, or damp environments to prevent absorption of fluid. Will drinking coffee or alcohol interfere with the effectiveness of homeopathic medicines? No, in fact, core homeopathic remedies found in the Materia Medica such as Chamomilla and Nux Vomica address symptoms caused by using coffee or alcohol. Chamomilla relieves caffeine jitters, while Nux Vomica is the go-to remedy for excess consumption of alcohol or other overindulgences. Our low-potency homeopathic products are designed to meet you where you're at and do not require you to change your habits in order to benefit from taking them. If you are under the care of a homeopathic practitioner who has prescribed a high-potency constitutional remedy, please follow the guidelines provided by your practitioner. Is homeopathic medicine safe for kids? If so, how does the dosage change for kids? Yes, homeopathy is very safe to use with children. The dosage does not change between children and adults because homeopathic medicines are not body-mass dependent. A parent may crush a lozenge in some warm water to administer, especially if there is concern that the child might choke on a whole lozenge. Our lozenges may safely be given to children 8 years and older for occasional use. If your child's condition does not improve, please seek medical guidance. My child just took several lozenges, what should I do? The level of active ingredient in the products is extremely small and should not cause harm even when ingested in large amounts. For further reassurance, you can contact poison control (1-800-222-1222). Each lozenge contains one gram of sugar. If your child is diabetic or sensitive to sugar, the concern would be the excess consumption of sugar. Is homeopathy safe to use with my pet? Homeopathy is very safe to use with animals. Several customers have reported giving a Stress Mint or Calm Drop to their pet before a trip to the vet or leaving for work to help with anxiety. If your pet accidentally gets into a box of lozenges, there is no concern of over-dosing due to the extremely high dilutions of active ingredients. "}
