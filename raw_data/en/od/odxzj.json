(NYSE: PFE) today announced that results of the Phase 3 SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 studies of investigational once-daily relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in over 1,200 women with moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis were published in [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00622-5/fulltext). As previously reported, both studies achieved their co-primary endpoints by demonstrating clinically meaningful reductions in dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain) and non-menstrual pelvic pain in women with endometriosis. SPIRIT 1 and 2 each met their co-primary endpoints with 75% of women in the relugolix combination therapy group in both studies achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in dysmenorrhea compared with 27% and 30% of women in the placebo groups at Week 24, respectively (both p < 0.0001). For non-menstrual pelvic pain, relugolix combination therapy achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in 59% and 66% of women, compared with 40% and 43% of women in the placebo groups (p < 0.0001). In SPIRIT 1, seven key secondary endpoints, and in SPIRIT 2, six key secondary endpoints comparing relugolix combination therapy with placebo at Week 24 achieved statistical significance, including reductions in dyspareunia and opioid use. In addition, more women treated with relugolix combination therapy groups were opioid free at Week 24 compared with placebo (86% and 82% vs 76% and 66%, respectively). In both studies, relugolix combination therapy was associated with a generally well-tolerated safety profile, including bone mineral density loss of <1% over 24 weeks. \"Approximately 7.5 million premenopausal women in the United States have endometriosis and 75-80 percent of them are symptomatic,\" said Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc.1,2,3,4 \"The data published in The Lancet underscore the value relugolix combination therapy may provide as a potential new treatment option for women with endometriosis-associated pain.\" \"We are excited to see this data published in The Lancet,\" said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine and Hospital, Global Product Development at Pfizer. \"We continue to look forward to bringing this potential new treatment option to women with endometriosis-associated pain.\" Seven key secondary endpoints in SPIRIT 1 and six key secondary endpoints in SPIRIT 2 comparing relugolix combination therapy with placebo at Week 24 also achieved statistical significance. These endpoints include changes in mean dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual pelvic pain, overall pelvic pain, impact of pain on daily activities as measured by the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) pain domain, the proportion of women not using opioids, the proportion of women not using analgesics, and change in mean dyspareunia (painful intercourse). While the seventh endpoint for the SPIRIT 2 study - reduction in analgesic use (based on pill count) - did not achieve statistical significance, possibly due to the low number of average pills per day and variability in day-to-day pill consumption, a post-hoc analysis of SPIRIT 2 showed that the percentage of patients who were analgesic-free at end of treatment was greater among women in the combination therapy group than the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events in both relugolix combination treatment and placebo groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, and hot flushes. In the U.S., relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) is currently available as MYFEMBREE\u00ae for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women, with a treatment duration of up to 24 months. Data from SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2, in addition to data from an open-label extension study, were included in a supplemental New Drug Application for MYFEMBREE for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis, which has a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of August 6, 2022. About Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the uterine lining is found outside of the uterine cavity, which often causes disruptive symptoms like painful periods, fatigue, pain in the lower back and abdomen, heavy menstrual bleeding, and even painful or difficult sexual intercourse. For endometriosis-associated pain, current treatment options include prescription and over-the-counter pain medications, oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists, and antagonists. There are also surgical options including adhesiolysis, cyst removal, and hysterectomy. Endometriosis can also impact general physical, mental, and social well-being, requiring a multi-disciplinary approach to care. Almost 200 million women suffer from symptoms of endometriosis globally.5 In the U.S., there are approximately 7.5 million premenopausal women with endometriosis.1,2,3 It can take between four and eleven years to get an endometriosis diagnosis6,7,8 and for some women, current treatment options do not provide relief.9 About MYFEMBREE\u00ae MYFEMBREE (relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate) is the first and only once-daily oral treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a treatment duration of up to 24 months. MYFEMBREE contains relugolix, which reduces the amount of estrogen (and other hormones) produced by ovaries, estradiol (an estrogen) which may reduce the risk of bone loss, and norethindrone acetate (a progestin) which is necessary when women with a uterus (womb) take estrogen.

Indications and Usage MYFEMBREE is indicated for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women. Limitations of Use: Use of MYFEMBREE should be limited to 24 months due to the risk of continued bone loss which may not be reversible. Important Safety Information BOXED WARNING: THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS AND VASCULAR EVENTS Estrogen and progestin combination products, including MYFEMBREE, increase the risk of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke and myocardial infarction, especially in women at increased risk for these events. MYFEMBREE is contraindicated in women with current or a history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders and in women at increased risk for these events, including women over 35 years of age who smoke or women with uncontrolled hypertension. CONTRAINDICATIONS MYFEMBREE is contraindicated in women with any of the risk arterial, venous thrombotic, or thromboembolic disorder; pregnancy; known osteoporosis; of breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive malignancies; known hepatic impairment or disease; undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding; known hypersensitivity to components of MYFEMBREE. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue immediately if an arterial or venous thrombotic, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular event occurs or is suspected. Discontinue at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization, if feasible. Discontinue immediately if there is sudden unexplained partial or complete loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis as these have been reported with estrogens and progestins. Bone Loss: MYFEMBREE may cause a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients, which may be greater with increasing duration of use and may not be completely reversible after stopping treatment. Consider the benefits and risks in patients with a history of low trauma fracture or risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss, including medications that may decrease BMD. Assessment of BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is recommended at baseline and periodically thereafter. Consider discontinuing MYFEMBREE if the risk of bone loss exceeds the potential benefit. Hormone-Sensitive Malignancies: Discontinue MYFEMBREE if a hormone-sensitive malignancy is diagnosed. Surveillance measures in accordance with standard of care, such as breast examinations and mammography are recommended. Use of estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin has resulted in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. Depression, Mood Disorders, and Suicidal Ideation: Promptly evaluate patients with mood changes and depressive symptoms including shortly after initiating treatment, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. Patients with new or worsening depression, anxiety, or other mood changes should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention for suicidal ideation and behavior and reevaluate the benefits and risks of continuing MYFEMBREE. Hepatic Impairment and Transaminase Elevations: Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in these patients. Instruct women to promptly seek medical attention for symptoms or signs that may reflect liver injury, such as jaundice or right upper abdominal pain. Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of MYFEMBREE use until the liver tests return to normal and MYFEMBREE causation has been excluded. Gallbladder Disease or History of Cholestatic Jaundice: Discontinue MYFEMBREE if signs or symptoms of gallbladder disease or jaundice occur. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, assess the risk-benefit of continuing therapy. Studies among estrogen users suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease. Elevated Blood Pressure: For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop MYFEMBREE if blood pressure rises significantly. Change in Menstrual Bleeding Pattern and Reduced Ability to Recognize Pregnancy: Advise women to use non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for one week after discontinuing MYFEMBREE. Avoid concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives. MYFEMBREE may delay the ability to recognize pregnancy because it alters menstrual bleeding. Perform testing if pregnancy is suspected and discontinue MYFEMBREE if pregnancy is confirmed. Risk of Early Pregnancy Loss: MYFEMBREE can cause early pregnancy loss. Exclude pregnancy before initiating and advise women to use effective non-hormonal contraception. Uterine Fibroid Prolapse or Expulsion: Advise women with known or suspected submucosal uterine fibroids about the possibility of uterine fibroid prolapse or expulsion and instruct them to contact their physician if severe bleeding and/or cramping occurs. Alopecia: Alopecia, hair loss, and hair thinning were reported in phase 3 trials with MYFEMBREE. Consider discontinuing MYFEMBREE if hair loss becomes a concern. Whether the hair loss is reversible is unknown. Effects on Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism: More frequent monitoring in MYFEMBREE-treated women with prediabetes and diabetes may be necessary. MYFEMBREE may decrease glucose tolerance and result in increased blood glucose concentrations. Monitor lipid levels and consider discontinuing if hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia worsens. In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations in triglycerides levels leading to pancreatitis. Use of MYFEMBREE is associated with increases in total cholesterol and LDL-C. Effect on Other Laboratory Results: Patients with hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism may require higher doses of thyroid hormone or cortisol replacement therapy. Use of estrogen and progestin combinations may raise serum concentrations of binding proteins (e.g., thyroid-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin), which may reduce free thyroid or corticosteroid hormone levels. Use of estrogen and progestin may also affect the levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, and coagulation factors. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediately discontinue MYFEMBREE if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions for MYFEMBREE (incidence 3% and greater than placebo) were hot flush/hyperhidrosis/night sweats, abnormal uterine bleeding, alopecia, and decreased libido. These are not all the possible side effects of MYFEMBREE. DRUG INTERACTIONS P-gp Inhibitors: Avoid use of MYFEMBREE with oral P-gp inhibitors. If use is unavoidable, take MYFEMBREE first, separate dosing by at least 6 hours, and monitor patients for adverse reactions. Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid use of MYFEMBREE with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers. LACTATION Advise women not to breastfeed while taking MYFEMBREE.
