All of the nutrients and dietary factors included in the Micronutrient Information Center may be obtained from the diet, and many are also available as dietary supplements. The Linus Pauling Institute's Micronutrient Information Center (MIC) is a source for scientifically accurate information on the functions and health effects of all micronutrients (vitamins and nutritionally essential minerals); other nutrients like choline and essential fatty acids; dietary factors, including many phytochemicals (non-nutritive plant chemicals that may affect health); and some food and beverages, including tea, coffee, and alcohol. All of the nutrients and dietary factors included in the MIC may be obtained from the diet, and many are also available as dietary supplements; dietary and supplemental sources are discussed in each article. Human research is emphasized in the MIC, although cell culture or animal studies may be mentioned when human studies are lacking. Most MIC articles have summaries at the beginning and include the following subsections: Function or Biological Activities, Metabolism and Bioavailability, Deficiency, The RDA or AI (for males and females of various age groups), Disease Prevention, Disease Treatment, Sources (food and supplements), and Safety (toxicity and drug or nutrient interactions). For the micronutrients (vitamins and essential minerals), the Linus Pauling Institute provides a daily intake recommendation.

The [Micronutrient Information Center staff](staff) can be contacted directly though The term vitamin is derived from the words vital and amine, because vitamins are required for life and were originally thought to be amines. Although not all vitamins are amines, they are organic compounds required by humans in small amounts from the diet. An organic compound is considered a vitamin if a lack of that compound in the diet results in overt symptoms of deficiency. The information from the Linus Pauling Institute's Micronutrient Information Center on vitamins and minerals is now available in a book titled, An Evidence-based Approach to Vitamins and Minerals: Health Benefits and Intake Recommendations. The book can be purchased from the [Linus Pauling Institute](../../publications/books) or [Thieme Medical Publishers](http://www.thieme.com/books-main/complementary-medicine/product/1040-an-evidence-based-approach-to-vitamins-and-minerals). Select a vitamin from the list for more information. Contents Biotin is a water-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that is generally classified as a B-complex vitamin. After its initial discovery in 1927, 40 years of additional research was required to unequivocally establish biotin as a vitamin [(1)](#references). Biotin is required by all organisms but can be [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by some strains of [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria), yeast, mold, algae, and some plant species [(2)](#reference2). Biotin functions as a [covalently](../glossary#covalent) bound [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) required for the biological activity of the five known mammalian biotin-dependent [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) (see [below](#enzyme-cofactor)). Such non- [protein](../glossary#protein) and common in water-soluble vitamins. The covalent attachment of biotin to the apocarboxylase (i.e., the carboxylase protein without the biotin prosthetic group and is is [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), \"biotinylation\" refers to the covalent addition of biotin to any molecule, including the apocarboxylases [histones](../glossary#histone). HCS catalyzes the post-translational biotinylation of the epsilon amino group of a lysine residue at the active site of each apocarboxylase, converting the inactive apocarboxylase into a fully active holocarboxylase (Figure 1a). Particular lysine residues within the N-terminal tail of specific histone that help package [DNA](../glossary#DNA) in eukaryotic [nuclei](../glossary#nucleus) can biotinylated [(3)](#reference3). catalyzes the biotin from biotinylated histones and from the [peptide](../glossary#peptide) products of Five mammalian to malonyl-CoA using bicarbonate and [ATP](../glossary#ATP); however, the two enzymes have different roles in metabolism and different intracellular locations. ACC1 is located in the cytosol, and the malonyl CoA generated by ACC1 is a rate-limiting substrate for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) (Figure 2). ACC1 is found in all tissues and is particularly active in [lipogenic](../glossary#lipogenesis) tissues (i.e., liver, white adipose tissue, and mammary gland), heart, and [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) islets. ACC2 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the malonyl CoA generated via ACC2 inhibits CPT1, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that regulates malonyl-CoA entry into the inner mitochondria, thereby regulating fatty acid [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) (Figure 3). ACC2 is especially abundant in skeletal muscle and heart [(4)](#reference4). Pyruvate carboxylase is a critical enzyme in [gluconeogenesis](../glossary#gluconeogenesis) (the formation of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) from sources other than [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) (Figure 3). Oxaloacetate can then be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate and eventually to glucose. Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes an essential step in the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) an essential [branched-chain amino acid](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids). This -oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms (Figure 4a). The conversion of propionyl-CoA to D-malonylmalonyl-CoA is also required in the catabolic pathways of two branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine and valine) and the side chain of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) (Figure 4a) and of the amino acids [methionine](../glossary#methionine) and threonine (Figure 4b). In eukaryotic [nuclei](../glossary#nucleus), [DNA](../glossary#DNA) is packaged into compact structures to form [nucleosomes](../glossary#nucleosome) \u2014 fundamental units of [chromatin](../glossary#chromatin). Each nucleosome is composed of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around eight [histones](../glossary#histone) (paired located at the outer surface of each nucleosome and serves as an anchor to fix the DNA around the histone core. The compact packaging of chromatin must be relaxed for DNA replication and [transcription](../glossary#transcription). Chemical modifications of DNA and histones affect the folding of chromatin, increasing or reducing DNA accessibility to factors involved in replication and transcription. DNA [methylation](../glossary#methylation) and a number of chemical modifications within the N-terminal tail of core histones modify their electric charge and structure, thereby changing chromatin conformation and transcriptional activity of [genes](../glossary#gene). regulatory functions. Several sites of biotinylation have been identified in histones lysine (K) 12 (noted H4K12bio) appears to be enriched in heterochromatin, a tightly condensed chromatin associated with repeat regions in (peri)centromeres and [telomeres](../glossary#telomere). H4 biotinylation appears to be enriched in transposable elements known as long terminal repeats [(3)](#reference3). These biotinylation marks also co-localize with well-known gene For example, H4K12bio can be found at the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of the gene SLC5A6 that codes for the transporter mediating biotin uptake into cells, the human sodium-dependent multivitamin biotin H4 in the SLC5A6 promoter, which down regulates hSMVT synthesis and reduces biotin uptake. Conversely, in biotin-deficient cells, biotinylation marks in the SLC5A6 promoter are removed increasing [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) and enabling the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of hSMVT and uptake of biotin [(7)](#reference7). Although clinically overt biotin deficiency is very rare, the human requirement for dietary biotin has been demonstrated in three different situations: prolonged [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) feeding ( [parenteral](../glossary#parenteral-nutrition)) without biotin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement), infants fed an elemental formula devoid of biotin, and consumption of raw egg white for a prolonged period (many weeks to years) [(8)](#reference8). Raw egg white contains avidin; this [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) protein binds biotin with an affinity and specificity that is almost unique as a reversible binding. Because native avidin is resistant to mammalian and microbial digestion, avidin prevents biotin absorption. Cooking egg white denatures avidin, rendering it susceptible to digestion and therefore unable to block the absorption of dietary biotin [(5)](#reference5). Signs of overt biotin deficiency include hair loss ( [alopecia](../glossary#alopecia)) and a scaly red rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and genital area. [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in adults have included depression, lethargy, hallucinations, numbness and tingling of the extremities, [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [seizures](../glossary#seizure). The characteristic facial rash, together with unusual facial fat distribution, has been termed the \"biotin deficient facies\" by some investigators [(1)](#references). Individuals with hereditary disorders of biotin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (see [Inborn metabolic disorders](#inborn-metabolic-disorders)) that result in functional biotin deficiency often have similar physical findings, impaired immune system function, and increased susceptibility to [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) and fungal infections [(9, 10)](#reference9). Aside from prolonged consumption of raw egg white or total [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) nutritional support lacking biotin, other conditions may increase the risk of biotin depletion. Smoking has been associated with increased biotin [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) [(11)](#reference11). The rapidly dividing cells of the developing fetus require biotin for [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of essential [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) and for [histone](../glossary#histone) biotinylation; hence, the maternal biotin requirement is likely increased during pregnancy. Research suggests that a substantial number of women develop marginal or [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) biotin deficiency during normal pregnancy (see also [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(8](#reference8), [12, 13)](#reference12). Moreover, certain types of liver disease may decrease biotinidase activity and theoretically increase the requirement for biotin. For example, a study of 62 children with chronic liver disease and 27 healthy controls found [serum](../glossary#serum) biotinidase activity to be abnormally low in those with severely impaired liver function due to [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) [(14)](#reference14). However, this study did not provide evidence of biotin deficiency. Additionally, [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) medications used to prevent [seizures](../glossary#seizure) in individuals with [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) increase the risk of biotin depletion (for more information on biotin and anticonvulsants, see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Biotinidase deficiency is an [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) inherited disorder that is often detected upon newborn screening for metabolic disorders, although late-onset forms have been recently described [(15-17)](#reference15). Biotinidase deficiency leads to secondary biotin deficiency in several ways. Intestinal absorption is decreased because deficient biotinidase impairs release of biotin from dietary [protein](../glossary#protein) [(18)](#reference18). of intracellular biotin bound to [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) and [histones](../glossary#histone) is also impaired, and urinary loss of biocytin (N-biotinyl-lysine) biotin is increased deficiency responds to [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) biotin. Oral supplementation with as much as 5 to 20 milligrams (mg) of biotin daily is sometimes required [(19, 20)](#reference19), although smaller doses may be sufficient, especially later in childhood (reviewed in [20, 21](#reference20)). [Prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) is characteristically good when biotin therapy is introduced in infancy or early childhood and reliably continued for life [(10)](#reference10). Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency results in decreased formation of blood responds to supplementation with [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of biotin in some cases but not others. The [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) of holocarboxylase synthetase is usually, but not always, good if biotin therapy is introduced early (even [antenatally](../glossary#antenatal)) and continued for life [(10](#reference10), [22)](#reference22). There has been one [case report](../glossary#case-report) of a child with biotin transport deficiency who responded to high-dose biotin supplementation [(23)](#reference23). Of note, the presence of a defective human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) was ruled out as a cause of biotin transport deficiency. Four measures of marginal biotin deficiency have been validated as indicators of biotin [status](../glossary#status): and (1) reduced levels of holo-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase and holo-propionyl-CoA carboxylase in lymphocytes, the most of biotin status [(24)](#reference24); (2) reduced propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity in peripheral blood [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) [(5)](#reference5); (3) high urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of an organic acid, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, and its derivative, 3-hydroxyisovaleryl carnitine, both of which reflect decreased activity of biotin-dependent methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase; (4) reduced urinary excretion of biotin and some of its catabolites. These markers have been only validated in men and nonpregnant women, and they may not accurately reflect biotin status in pregnant or breast-feeding women [(12](#reference12), [25)](#reference25). Sufficient scientific evidence is lacking to estimate the dietary requirement for biotin; thus, no Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for biotin has been established. Instead, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Medicine set recommendations for an Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI); Table 1). The AI for adults (30 g/day) was extrapolated from the AI for infants exclusively fed human milk and probably overestimates the dietary requirement for biotin for most adults. Dietary intakes of generally healthy adults have been estimated to be 40 to 60 micrograms (g) of biotin daily [(1)](#references). The requirement for biotin Current research indicates that at least one-third of women develop marginal biotin deficiency during pregnancy [(8)](#reference8). Small [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in pregnant women have reported an abnormally high urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid in both early and late pregnancy, suggesting decreased activity of biotin-dependent women, supplementation with 300 g/day of biotin for two weeks limited the excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo), confirming that increased 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid excretion indeed reflected marginal biotin deficiency in pregnancy [(29)](#reference29). A small [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 22 pregnant women reported an incidence of low [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity greater than 80% [(13)](#reference13). Although these levels of biotin deficiency are not associated with overt signs of deficiency in pregnant women, such observations are sources of concern because [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) biotin deficiency has been shown to cause cleft palate and limb hypoplasia in several animal species (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). In addition, biotin depletion has been found to suppress the expression of biotin-dependent carboxylases, remove biotin marks from [histones](../glossary#histone), and decrease the in human embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells in culture [(30)](#reference30). Impaired carboxylase activity may result in alterations in [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), which have been linked to cleft palate and skeletal abnormalities in animals. Further, biotin deficiency leading to reduced histone biotinylation at specific genomic loci may increase genomic instability and result in [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) anomalies and fetal malformations [(13)](#reference13). Analogous to pregnant women who are advised to consume [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) folic acid prior to and during pregnancy to prevent [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (see [Folate](folate#adverse-pregnancy-outcomes)), it would also be prudent to ensure adequate biotin intake throughout pregnancy. The current AI for pregnant women is 30 g/day of biotin, and no toxicity has ever been reported at this level of intake (see [Safety](#safety)). Biotin-thiamin-responsive basal deficiency, and an [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [gene](../glossary#gene) that codes for thiamin transporter-2 (THTR-2). The disease usually presents around 3 to 10 years of age [(31)](#reference31), but an early infantile form of the disease exists with onset as early as one month of age [(32)](#reference32). Clinical features include subacute [encephalopathy](../glossary#encephalopathy) (confusion, drowsiness, altered level of consciousness), [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [seizures](../glossary#seizure). A [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) of 18 affected individuals from the same family or the same tribe in Saudi Arabia showed that biotin [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) (5-10 mg/kg/day) efficiently abolished the clinical manifestations of the disease, although one-third of the patients suffered from recurrent acute crises. Often associated with poor outcomes, acute crises were not observed after thiamin supplementation started (300-400 mg/day) and during a five-year follow-up period, early diagnosis and immediate treatment with biotin and thiamin led to positive outcomes [(33)](#reference33). Although the specific mechanism for therapeutic effects of biotin in biotin-thiamin-responsive basal ganglia disease remains unknown, lifelong high-dose supplementation with a combination of biotin and thiamin is the recommended treatment [(31)](#reference31). Early diagnosis and treatment is important to ensure a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) [(32, 34)](#reference32). [Multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) (MS) is an [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) characterized by progressive damage to the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath surrounding nerve fibers ( [axons](../glossary#axon)) and [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) loss in the brain and spinal cord of affected individuals in anatomic locations that vary widely among affected individuals producing variable signs and symptoms. The progression of [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disabilities in MS patients is often assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) with scores from 1 to 10, from minimal signs of motor dysfunction (score of 1) to death by MS (score of 10). [ATP](../glossary#ATP) deficiency due to [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) may be partly responsible for the progressive degeneration of [neurons](../glossary#neuron) in MS [(35)](#reference35). Given its role in energy production by intermediary metabolism and [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) and in fatty (see [Function](#function)), high-dose biotin supplementation it has been hypothesized that to exert beneficial effects that would limit or reverse MS-associated functional impairments [(35)](#reference35). The mechanism of action of high-dose biotin has been investigated in a genetic mouse model of chronic axon injury caused by [oxidative [axonal](../glossary#axon) death and locomotor impairment. Dysregulation of the transcriptional program for [lipid](../glossary#lipid) synthesis and degradation in the spinal cord was also normalized, possibly as the result of hyperactivation of a nutrient/energy/ [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) sensor that controls protein synthesis restoring lipid homeostasis. A nonrandomized, uncontrolled [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 23 patients with progressive MS found high doses of biotin (100-600 mg/day) to be associated with sustained clinical improvements in five (out of five) patients with progressive visual loss and 16 (out of 18) patients with partial paralysis of the limbs after a mean three months following treatment onset [(36)](#reference36). Additionally, a multicenter, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 154 subjects with progressive MS reported that 13 out of 103 patients supplemented with high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin (300 mg/day) for 12 months achieved MS-related disability reversal \u2014 assessed by improved EDSS or 25-foot walk time [(37)](#reference37). In comparison, none of the 51 patients randomized to the placebo group showed significant clinical improvements [(37)](#reference37). However, when this regimen of high-dose biotin supplementation was examined in a larger, international cohort of patients with progressive MS (326 patients receiving biotin and 316 patients receiving placebo), no benefits on EDSS or walk time were seen after 12 months [(38)](#reference38). Moreover, a randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial in 93 MS patients with chronic visual loss found that 300 mg/day of pharmaceutical-grade biotin for six months did not improve visual acuity, but an interesting trend favoring the biotin group was observed in the subgroup of patients with progressive optic neuritis [(39)](#reference39). Moreover, a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials (2 on disability; 3 on adverse effects), involving 889 individuals diagnosed with MS (the preponderance of participants [830] had progressive MS while only 59 had remitting relapsing MS) was conducted [(40)](#reference40). Pooling results of two trials found no benefit of high-dose biotin on MS-related disability, but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. When the subgroup progressive MS was analyzed separately, a moderate certainty of evidence suggested a potential benefit in favor of high-dose biotin for the 25-foot minute walk time [(40)](#reference40). On balance, studies remain inconclusive but promising. Overt biotin deficiency has been shown to impair [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization in mice [(41)](#reference41) and cause fatal [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia) in chickens. Overt biotin deficiency likely also causes abnormalities in glucose regulation in humans (see [Function](#function)). One early human study reported lower [serum](../glossary#serum) biotin concentrations in 43 patients with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) compared to 64 control subjects without the disease; an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between fasting blood glucose and biotin concentrations was observed as well [(42)](#reference42). In a small, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 28 patients with type 2 diabetes, daily supplementation with 9 milligrams (mg) of biotin for one month resulted in a 45% decrease in mean fasting blood glucose concentrations [(42)](#reference42). Yet, another small study in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes and 7 controls without diabetes found no effect of biotin supplementation (15 mg/day) for 28 days on fasting blood glucose concentrations in either group [(43)](#reference43). A more recent [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study by the same research group showed that the same biotin regimen lowered [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [triglyceride](../glossary#triglyceride) concentrations in patients with hypertriglyceridemia \u2014 independent of whether they had type 2 diabetes [(44)](#reference44). In this study, biotin administration did not affect blood glucose concentrations in either patient group. Additionally, a few studies have shown that co-supplementation with biotin and chromium picolinate may be a beneficial [adjunct therapy](../glossary#adjunct) in patients with type 2 diabetes [(45-48)](#reference45). For information on chromium supplementation as a [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) for type 2 diabetes, see the article on [Chromium](../minerals/chromium#type-2-diabetes-treatment). Potential mechanisms for the glucose and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) effects have been suggested. As a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) of [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) required for [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), biotin may increase the utilization of glucose for fat synthesis. Also, biotin stimulates glucokinase, a liver [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that increases synthesis of [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen), the storage form of glucose. Biotin also triggers the secretion of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) in the pancreas of rats and improves glucose [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) [(50)](#reference50). Yet, reduced activity of ACC1 and ACC2 would be expected to reduce fatty acid synthesis and increase fatty acid [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation), respectively. Hence, whether [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of biotin benefits the management of [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in patients with [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) remains unclear. Moreover, whether supplemental biotin lowers the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) complications in patients with diabetes by reducing serum triglycerides and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) remains to be proven [(44-46)](#reference44). The finding that biotin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) were effective in treating hoof abnormalities in hoofed animals suggested that biotin might also be helpful in strengthening brittle fingernails in humans [(50-52)](#reference50). Three uncontrolled trials examining the effects of biotin supplementation (2.5 mg/day for several months) in women with brittle fingernails have been published [(53-55)](#reference53). In two of the trials, subjective evidence of clinical improvement was reported in 67%-91% of the participants available for follow-up at the end of the treatment period [(53, 54)](#reference53). One trial that used scanning electron microscopy to assess fingernail brittleness reported less fingernail splitting and a 25% increase in the thickness of the nail plate in patients supplemented with biotin for 6 to 15 months [(55)](#reference55). Biotin supplementation (5 mg/day) was also found to be effective in controlling unruly hair and splitting nails in two toddlers with inherited uncombable hair syndrome [(56)](#reference56). Although preliminary evidence suggests that supplemental biotin may help strengthen fragile nails (reviewed in [57](#reference57)), larger [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of high-dose biotin supplementation for the treatment of brittle fingernails. Biotin administration has been associated with [alopecia](../glossary#alopecia) reversal in children treated with the [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) valproic acid (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)), as well as with hair regrowth or normal hair growth in some children with inborn errors of biotin metabolism or other genetic disorders (i.e., uncombable hair syndrome) (reviewed in [58](#reference58)). Yet, while hair loss is a symptom of severe biotin deficiency (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)), there are no published scientific studies that support the claim that high-dose biotin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are effective in preventing or treating hair loss in men or women [(59, 60)](#reference59). [Randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in healthy individuals would be needed to evaluate this claim. Biotin is found in many foods, either as the free (i.e., unbound) form that is directly taken up by [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) or as biotin bound to dietary proteins. Egg yolk, liver, and yeast are rich sources of biotin. Estimates of average daily intakes of biotin from small studies ranged between 40 and 60 micrograms (g) per day in adults [(1)](#references). However, US national nutritional surveys have not yet been able to estimate biotin intake due to the scarcity and unreliability of data regarding biotin content of food. Food composition tables for biotin are incomplete such that dietary intakes cannot be reliably estimated in humans. A study by Staggs et al. [(61)](#reference61) employed a high-performance liquid chromatography method rather than bioassays [(62)](#reference62) and reported relatively different biotin content for some selected foods. Table 2 lists some food sources of biotin, along with their content in g. is about the size of a deck of cards.| A majority of [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally colonize the small and large intestine ( [colon](../glossary#colon)) [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) biotin [(63)](#reference63). Whether the biotin is released and absorbed by humans in meaningful amounts remains unknown. The uptake of free biotin into intestinal cells via the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) has been identified in cultured cells derived from the lining of the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) and colon [(64)](#reference64), suggesting that humans may be able to absorb biotin produced by enteric bacteria \u2014 a phenomenon documented in swine. Biotin is available as a single-nutrient [supplement](../glossary#supplement) in various doses (many containing 5,000 g [5 mg] of biotin) and is often included in B-complex and multivitamin-mineral supplements. Several multivitamin supplements contain 30 g of biotin, although the amount varies by product [(65)](#reference65). Biotin is not known to be toxic. In people without disorders of biotin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), doses of up to 5 mg/day (5,000 g) for two years were not associated with adverse effects [(66)](#reference66). Oral biotin supplementation has been well tolerated in doses up to 200 mg/day (nearly 7,000 times the [AI](../glossary#AI)) in people with hereditary disorders of biotin metabolism [(1)](#references). Daily supplementation with a highly concentrated formulation of biotin (100-600 mg) for several months was also found to be well tolerated in individuals with progressive [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) [(36](#reference36), [67)](#reference67). However, there is one case report of life-threatening eosinophilic pleuropericardial effusion in an elderly woman who took a combination of 10 mg/day of biotin and 300 mg/day of [pantothenic acid](pantothenic-acid) (vitamin B5) for two months [(68)](#reference68). Because reports of adverse events were lacking when the Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for biotin were established in 1998, the Food and Nutrition Board did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for biotin [(1)](#references). Large doses of [pantothenic acid](pantothenic-acid) (vitamin B5) have the potential to compete with biotin for intestinal and cellular uptake by the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) [Pharmacologic](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) (very high) doses of lipoic acid have been found to decrease the activity of biotin-dependent [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) in rats, but such an effect has not been demonstrated in humans [(72)](#reference72). Individuals on long-term [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) (anti- [seizure](../glossary#seizure)) therapy reportedly have reduced blood biotin concentrations, as well as an increased urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of organic acids (e.g., 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid) that indicate decreased [carboxylase](../glossary#carboxylase) activity (see [Markers of biotin status](#biomarkers-status)) [(5)](#reference5). as well increased biotin [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) [(73)](#reference73). Use of the anticonvulsant valproic acid in children has resulted in hair loss reversed by biotin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) [(74-77)](#reference74). Long-term treatment with antibacterial sulfonamide (sulfa) drugs or other antibiotics may decrease [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) synthesis of biotin. Yet, given that the extent to which bacterial synthesis contributes to biotin intake in humans is not known, effects of antimicrobial drugs on biotin nutritional [status](../glossary#status) remain uncertain [(73)](#reference73). In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a safety communication regarding high-dose biotin supplementation and its potential interference with streptavidin (avidin)-biotin immunoassays, including assays of thyroid hormones, reproductive hormones, and the cardiac protein, troponin. Such interference can cause aberrant results \u2014 either falsely high or falsely low depending on the method of the particular assay \u2014 and potential misdiagnosis of disease [(78-81)](#reference78). An updated FDA communication in 2019 focused on biotin interference in certain lab assays of troponin that have not addressed the concern of falsely low blood concentrations [(82)](#reference82). Troponin in blood is a marker of cardiac damage and often used in the clinical diagnosis of a myocardial infarction (heart attack). When blood work is planned, patients should routinely inform their health care provider concerning supplementation of biotin at doses substantially greater than those in usual diets or in routine daily multivitamins. Little is known regarding the amount of dietary biotin required to promote optimal health or prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation made by the National Academy of Medicine, which is 30 micrograms (g) of biotin per day for adults. A varied diet should provide enough biotin for most people. However, following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement will generally provide an intake of at least 30 g/day of biotin. Presently, there is no indication that older adults have an increased requirement for biotin. If dietary biotin intake is not sufficient, a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement will generally provide an intake of at least 30 g of biotin per day.

Accessed 7/5/2022. Contents [Folate is a water-soluble B-vitamin, which is also known as vitamin B9 or folacin. Naturally occurring folates exist in many chemical forms; folates are found in food, as well as in metabolically active forms in the human body. Folic acid is the major synthetic form found in fortified foods and vitamin supplements. Other synthetic forms include folinic acid (Figure 1) and levomefolic acid. Folic acid has no biological activity unless converted into folates ] [(1)](#references). In the following discussion, forms found in food or the body are referred to as \"folates,\" while the form found in supplements or fortified food is referred to as \"folic acid.\" The only function of folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) in the body appears to be in mediating the transfer of [one-carbon units](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [(2)](#reference2). Folate coenzymes act as acceptors and donors of one-carbon units in a variety of reactions critical to the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) and [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) (Figure vital role in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) through two different pathways. (1) The [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of DNA from its [precursors](../glossary#precursor) (thymidine and purines) is dependent on folate coenzymes. (2) A folate coenzyme is required for the synthesis of [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine), and methionine is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is a methyl group (one-carbon unit) donor used in most biological [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, including the methylation of a number of sites within DNA, [RNA](../glossary#RNA), [proteins](../glossary#protein), and [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid). The methylation of DNA plays a role in controlling [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) and is critical during cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation). Aberrations in DNA methylation have been linked to the development of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) (see [Cancer](#cancer-prevention)). Folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) are required for enzyme (as but also [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12). Thus, folate (and/or vitamin B12) deficiency can result in decreased synthesis of methionine and an accumulation of homocysteine. Elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine have been considered for many years to be a [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for some chronic diseases, including [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and [dementia](../glossary#dementia) (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). The [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) intermediate in the metabolism of sulfur-containing [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid), provides an example of the interrelationships among nutrients necessary for optimal physiological function and health. Healthy individuals utilize two different pathways to metabolize homocysteine (Figure 3). One pathway (methionine synthase) [methionine](../glossary#methionine) and folate and [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) as [cofactors](../glossary#cofactor). The other pathway converts homocysteine to another amino acid, cysteine, and requires two [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6)-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Thus, the concentration of homocysteine in the blood is regulated by three B-vitamins: folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 [(4)](#reference4). In some individuals, riboflavin (vitamin B2) is also involved in the regulation of homocysteine concentrations (see the article on [Riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin)). Although less well recognized, folate has an important metabolic interaction with [riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin). Riboflavin [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), (MTHFR). generates 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (see [Figure 2](#figure-2) above). This active form of folate is required to form [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine). Along with other B-vitamins, higher riboflavin intakes have been associated with decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations [(5)](#reference5). The effects of riboflavin on folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) appear to be greatest in individuals [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) for the common c.677C>T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) (i.e., TT genotype) in folate requirements](#genetic-variation-requirements)) [(6)](#reference6). These individuals (about 10% of adults worldwide) typically present with low folate status, along with elevated homocysteine concentrations, particularly when folate and/or riboflavin intake is suboptimal. The elevated homocysteine concentration in these individuals, however, is highly responsive to lowering with riboflavin supplementation, confirming the importance of the riboflavin-MTHFR interaction [(7)](#reference7). [Vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) may limit degradation of natural folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) and [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) folic acid in the stomach and thus improve folate [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). A [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in nine healthy men found that oral co-administration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (343 g) and vitamin C (289 mg or 974 mg) was associated with higher concentrations of serum folate compared to 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid alone [(8)](#reference8). Moreover, a recent study suggested that several genetic variations of folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) might influence the effect of vitamin C on folate metabolism [(9)](#reference9). Dietary folates exist predominantly in the polyglutamyl form (containing several [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate) residues), whereas folic acid\u2014the synthetic vitamin form\u2014is a monoglutamate, containing just one glutamate moiety. In addition, natural folates are reduced molecules, whereas folic acid is fully oxidized. These chemical differences have major implications for the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) such that folic acid is considerably more bioavailable than naturally occurring food folates at equivalent intake levels. The [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) absorption of dietary folates is a two-step process that involves the [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) of folate polyglutamates to the corresponding monoglutamyl derivatives, followed by their transport into intestinal cells. There, folic acid is converted into a naturally occurring folate, namely 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is the major circulating form of folate in the human body (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). The bioavailability of naturally occurring folates is inherently limited and variable. There is much variability in the ease with which folates are released from different food matrices, and the polyglutamyl \"tail\" is removed (de-conjugation) before uptake by intestinal cells. Also, other dietary constituents can contribute to instability of labile folates during the processes of digestion. As a result, naturally occurring folates show incomplete bioavailability compared with folic acid. The bioavailability of folic acid, in contrast, is assumed to be 100% when ingested as a [supplement](../glossary#supplement), while folic acid in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food is estimated to have about 85% the bioavailability of supplemental folic acid. Of note, folate recommendations in the US and certain other countries are now expressed as Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFEs), a calculation that was devised to take into account the greater bioavailability of folic acid compared to naturally occurring dietary folates (see [The Recommended Dietary Allowance](#RDA)). Folate and its [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) require transporters to cross [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Folate transporters include reduced folate folate transporter FR and FR. Folate [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) is supported by the ubiquitous distribution of folate transporters, although abundance and importance vary among tissues [(10)](#reference10). PCFT plays a major role in folate intestinal transport since [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding PCFT cause hereditary folate [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome). Defective PCFT also leads to impaired folate transport into the brain (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). FR and RFC are also critical for folate transport across the blood-brain barrier when extracellular folate is either low or high, respectively. Folate is essential for the proper development of the embryo and the fetus. The [placenta](../glossary#placenta) is known to concentrate folate to the fetal circulation, leading to higher folate concentrations in the fetus compared to those found in the pregnant woman. All three types of [receptors](../glossary#receptor) have been associated with folate transport across the placenta during pregnancy [(11)](#reference11). Folate deficiency is most often caused by a dietary insufficiency; however, folate deficiency can also occur in a number of other situations. For example, chronic and heavy alcohol consumption is associated with diminished absorption of folate (in addition to low dietary intake), which can lead to folate deficiency [(12)](#reference12). Smoking is also associated with low folate status. In one study, folate concentrations in blood were about 15% lower in smokers compared to nonsmokers [(13)](#reference13). Additionally, impaired folate transport to the fetus has been described in pregnant women who either smoked or abused alcohol during their pregnancy [(14, 15)](#reference14). Pregnancy is a time when the folate requirement is greatly increased to sustain the demand for rapid cell replication and growth of fetal, [placental](../glossary#placenta), and maternal tissue. Conditions such as cancer or inflammation can also result in increased rates of cell division and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), causing an increase in the body's demand for folate [(16)](#reference16). Moreover, folate deficiency can result also to folate deficiency (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Finally, a number of genetic diseases affecting folate absorption, transport, or metabolism can cause folate deficiency or impede its metabolic functions (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Clinical folate deficiency leads to [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia), which is reversible with folic acid treatment. Rapidly dividing cells like those derived from bone marrow are most vulnerable to the effects of folate deficiency since [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and cell division are dependent on folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme). When folate supply to the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow is inadequate, blood cell division is reduced, resulting in fewer but larger red blood cells. This type of [anemia](../glossary#anemia) is called [megaloblastic](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) or [macrocytic anemia](../glossary#macrocytic-anemia), referring to the enlarged, immature red blood cells. [Neutrophils](../glossary#neutrophil), a type of white blood cell, become hypersegmented, a change that can be found by examining a blood sample microscopically. Because normal red blood cells have a lifetime in the circulation of approximately four months, it can take months for folate-deficient individuals to develop the characteristic megaloblastic anemia. Progression of such an anemia leads to a decreased oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and may ultimately result in symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath [(1)](#references). It is important to point out that megaloblastic anemia resulting from folate deficiency is identical to the megaloblastic anemia resulting from [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) deficiency, and further clinical testing is required to diagnose the true cause of megaloblastic anemia (see [Toxicity](#safety)). Individuals in the early stages of folate deficiency may not show obvious symptoms, but blood concentrations of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) may increase (see [Disease Prevention](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)). Yet, the concentration of circulating homocysteine is not a specific indicator of folate status, as elevated homocysteine can be the result of vitamin B12 and other B-vitamin deficiencies, lifestyle factors, and [renal](../glossary#renal) insufficiency. Subclinical deficiency is typically detected by measurement of folate concentrations in [serum](../glossary#serum)/ [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or in red blood cells. Traditionally, the dietary folate requirement was defined as the amount needed to prevent a deficiency severe enough to cause symptoms like [anemia](../glossary#anemia). The most recent [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (1998; Table 1) was based primarily on the adequacy of red blood cell folate concentrations at different levels of folate intake, as judged by the absence of abnormal [hematological](../glossary#hematology) indicators. Red cell folate has been shown to correlate with liver folate stores and is used as an indicator of long-term folate status. [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) folate reflects recent folate intake and is not a reliable [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) for folate status. Maintenance of normal blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, an indicator of [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), was considered only as an ancillary indicator of adequate folate intake. Because pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in cell division and other metabolic processes that require folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme), the RDA for pregnant women is considerably higher than for women who are not pregnant [(3)](#reference3). However, the prevention of [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTDs) was not considered when setting the RDA for pregnant women. Rather, reducing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of NTDs was considered in a separate recommendation for women capable of becoming pregnant (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)), because the crucial events in the development of the neural tube occur before many women are aware that they are pregnant [(18)](#reference18). When the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine set the new dietary recommendation for folate, they introduced a new unit, the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) [(1)](#references). Use of the DFE reflects the higher [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of synthetic folic acid found in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food compared to that of naturally occurring food folates [(18)](#reference18). For example, a serving of food containing 60 g of folate would provide 60 g of DFEs, while a serving of pasta fortified with 60 g of folic acid would provide 1.7 x 60 = 102 g of DFEs due to the higher bioavailability of folic acid. A folic acid supplement of 400 g taken on an empty stomach would provide 800 g of DFEs. It should be noted that DFEs were determined in studies with adults and whether folic acid in infant formula is more bioavailable than folates in mother's milk has not been studied. Use of DFEs to determine a folate requirement for the infant would not be desirable. |Life Stage||Age||Males (g/day)||Females (g/day)| |Infants||0-6 months|| 65 ( | A [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) or variation in the sequence of the [gene](../glossary#gene) for the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thermolabile enzyme [(19)](#reference19). The substitution of a cytosine (C) by a thymine (T) at [nucleotide](../glossary#nucleotide) 677 in the exon 4 of MTHFR gene leads to an alanine-to-valine transition in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Depending on the population, 20% to 53% of individuals may have inherited one T copy (677C/T genotype), and 3% to 32% of individuals may have inherited two T copies (677T/T genotype) for the MTHFR [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) (see [Figure MTHFR (-30%) and homozygous 677T/T [(21)](#reference21). Homozygosity for the [mutation](../glossary#mutation) (677T/T) is linked to lower concentrations of folate in red blood cells and higher blood concentrations of homocysteine [(22, 23)](#reference22). Improving folate nutritional [status](../glossary#status) in elderly the T allele reduced [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine concentration [(24)](#reference24). An important unanswered question about folate is whether the present [RDA](../glossary#RDA) is enough to compensate for the reduced MTHFR enzyme activity in individuals with at least one T allele, or whether those individuals have a higher folate requirement than the RDA [(25)](#reference25). Fetal growth and development are characterized by widespread cell division. Adequate folate is critical for [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [RNA](../glossary#RNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). (NTDs) arise from failure of embryonic neural tube closure between the 21st and 27th days after conception, a time when many women may not even realize they are pregnant [(26)](#reference26). NTDs include various malformations, such as lesions of the brain (e.g., [anencephaly](../glossary#anencephaly), encephalocele) or lesions of the spine ( [spina bifida](../glossary#spina-bifida)), which are devastating and life-threatening [(27)](#reference27). The prevalence of NTDs in the United States prior to [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of food with folic acid was estimated to be 1 per 1,000 pregnancies [(1)](#references). Results of [randomized trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have demonstrated 60% to 100% reductions in NTD cases when women consumed folic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in addition to a varied diet during the periconceptional period (about one month before and at least one month after conception) [(28, 29)](#reference28). The results of these and other studies prompted the US Public Health Service to recommend that all women capable of becoming pregnant consume 400 g of folic acid daily to prevent NTDs. Women with a previously affected pregnancy were also advised to receive 4,000 g (4 mg) of folic acid daily in order to reduce NTD recurrence [(30)](#reference30). These recommendations were made to all women of childbearing age because adequate folate must be available very early in pregnancy, and because many pregnancies in the US are unplanned [(31)](#reference31). Despite the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation in improving folate status, it appears that globally only 30% of women who become pregnant correctly follow the recommendation, and there is some concern that young women from minority ethnic groups and lower socioeconomic backgrounds are the least likely to follow the recommendation [(32-34)](#reference32). To decrease the incidence of NTDs, the US FDA implemented legislation in 1998 requiring the fortification of all enriched grain products with 1.4 mg of folic acid per kg of grain (see [Sources](#sources)). The required level of folic acid fortification in the US was initially estimated to provide 100 g of additional folic acid in the average person's diet, though it probably provides even more due to overuse of folic acid by food manufacturers [(25](#reference25), [35)](#reference35). The National Birth Defects Prevention Network reported about a 30% decrease in the prevalence of NTDs in the US compared to the pre-fortification period, and the post-fortification prevalence of NTDs is 0.69 cases per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths [(36)](#reference36). Also, a genetic component in NTD [etiology](../glossary#etiology) is evidenced by the increased [risk](../glossary#risk) in women with a family history of an NTD and also by variations in risk among ethnicities [(37)](#reference37). Moreover, NTD occurrence can be attributed to specific folate- [gene](../glossary#gene) interactions. The MTHFR c.677C>T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) and other genetic variations can increase the folate requirement and susceptibility for an NTD-affected pregnancy. Prior to the fortification era, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) showed that both red blood cell and [serum](../glossary#serum) folate concentrations were significantly lower in pregnant women with the T/T and C/T variants compared A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 25 case-control studies, including 2,429 case mothers and 3,570 control mothers, showed a positive association between the maternal MTHFR c.677C>T polymorphism and NTDs [(38)](#reference38). Another MTHFR variant, an A-to-C change at position 1298, has also been associated with reduced MTHFR activity and increased NTD risk [(39)](#reference39). Individuals [heterozygous](../glossary#heterozygous) for both of these MTHFR variants 1298A/C) exhibit lower [plasma](../glossary#plasma) folate than 1298A/A [(40)](#reference40). Combined genotypes with carrier transporter (RFC-1) polymorphism (c.80A>G) could further contribute to NTD occurrence [(41)](#reference41). The degree of NTD risk was also assessed with additional MTHFR polymorphisms (c.116C>T, c.1793G>A) [(42)](#reference42), as well as with [mutations](../glossary#mutation) can impact pregnancy outcome, it appears that gene-gene interactions between mother and fetus influence it further. The risk of NTD was increased by certain genetic combinations, including maternal (MTHFR c.677C>T)-fetal Finally, [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) status has been associated with NTD risk modification in the presence of specific polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism [(47)](#reference47). [Congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) of the heart are a major cause of infant mortality but also cause deaths in adulthood [(48)](#reference48). Using data from the European Registration of Congenital Anomalies and Twins (EUROCAT) database, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study), involving 596 cases and 2,359 controls, found that consumption of at least 400 g/day of folic acid during the periconceptual period (one month before conception through eight weeks' post-conception, covering the period of embryonic heart development) was associated with an 18% reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of congenital heart defects [(49)](#reference49). Recent meta-analyses of 20 to 25 case-control and family-based studies observed positive associations between maternal, fetal, or paternal MTHFR c.677C>T variant and incidence of congenital heart defects [(50, 51)](#reference50). Additional studies are needed to elucidate the effects of [gene](../glossary#gene)-nutrient interactions on the risk of congenital heart defects; however, the currently available research indicates that adequate folate intake may play an important role. Maternal folate status during pregnancy may influence the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) called orofacial clefts, [(52)](#reference52). A population-based [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) in Norway investigated the impact of folic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in mothers of 377 newborns with CL/P, 196 with cleft palate only (CPO) and 763 controls [(53)](#reference53). Although dietary intakes or supplements (during the first three months of pregnancy) on their own did not significantly modify the risk of CL/P, the study reported a 64% lower risk among women taking multivitamin and folic acid (400 g daily) supplements in addition to dietary folates. In the same population, [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in the cystathionine [gene](../glossary#gene) (c.699C>T) or (c.677C>T; when folate intake was below 400 g/day) appeared protective, while other gene variants in the folate/ [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism could not be linked to CL/P [(54, 55)](#reference54). However, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 studies showed an elevation of CL/P risk with the maternal 677T/T [homozygosity](../glossary#homozygous) [(56)](#reference56). Additional studies are needed to evaluate the risk of CL/P while integrating both genetic polymorphism and folate intake parameters. [Epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) evidence supporting a role for folate in the risk of CPO is lacking. Low birth weight has been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality during the first year of life and may also influence health outcomes during adulthood [(57)](#reference57). A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found a positive association between folic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) and birth weight; no association with length of [gestation](../glossary#gestation) was observed [(58)](#reference58). Additionally, a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 306 pregnant adolescents associated low folate intakes and maternal folate status during the third trimester of pregnancy with higher incidence of small for gestational age births (birth weight <10th percentile) [(59)](#reference59). Moreover, the maternal c.677C>T MTHFR genotype and increased [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, considered an indicator of functional folate deficiency, have been linked to lower birth weights [(60)](#reference60). Elevated blood homocysteine concentrations have also been associated with increased incidence of miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, including [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) and [placental abruption](../glossary#placental-abruption) [(61)](#reference61). A large [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) showed that [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine in Norwegian women was strongly related to adverse outcomes and complications, including preeclampsia, premature delivery, and very low birth weight, in previous pregnancies [(62)](#reference62). A recent meta-analysis of 51 prospective cohort studies linked the c.677C>T MTHFR variant with increased risk of preeclampsia in Caucasian and East Asian populations, reinforcing the notion that folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) may play a role in the condition [(63)](#reference63). A large multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, the Folic Acid Clinical Trial (FACT), has been initiated to evaluate whether the daily supplementation of up to 5.1 mg of folic acid throughout pregnancy could prevent preeclampsia and other adverse outcomes (e.g., maternal death, placental abruption, preterm delivery) in high-risk women [(64)](#reference64). Adequate folate intake during pregnancy protects against [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) [(65)](#reference65). A recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) found a reduction in risk of autism spectrum disorders with daily folic acid consumption of 600 g or more before and during pregnancy when mother and child carried the c.677C>T MTHFR genotype [(66)](#reference66). Thus, it is reasonable to maintain folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy, even after closure of the neural tube, in order to decrease the risk of other problems during pregnancy. Moreover, recent systematic reviews of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found no evidence of an association between folate exposure during pregnancy and adverse health outcomes in offspring, in particular childhood [asthma](../glossary#asthma) and allergies [(67, 68)](#reference67). The results of more than 80 studies indicate that even moderately elevated concentrations of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in the blood increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) [(4)](#reference4). Possible predispositions to vascular accidents have also been linked to genetic deficiencies in homocysteine [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in certain populations [(69)](#reference69). The mechanism by which homocysteine may increase the risk of vascular disease has been the subject of a great deal of research, but it may involve adverse effects of homocysteine on blood clotting, arterial [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation), and thickening of arterial walls [(70)](#reference70). Although increased homocysteine concentrations in the blood have been consistently associated with increased risk of CVD, it is unclear whether lowering circulating homocysteine will reduce CVD risk (see [Folate and homocysteine](#folate-homocysteine)). Research had initially predicted that a prolonged decrease in [serum](../glossary#serum) homocysteine level of 3 micromoles/liter would lower the risk of CVD by up to 25% and be a reasonable treatment goal for individuals at high risk [(71, 72)](#reference71). However, the analysis of recent [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) of B-vitamin supplementation has shown that lowering homocysteine concentrations did not prevent the occurrence of a second [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) event in patients with existing CVD [(73, 74)](#reference73). Consequently, the American Heart Association recommends screening for elevated total homocysteine concentrations only in \"high risk\" individuals, for example, in those with personal or family history of premature cardiovascular disease, malnutrition or [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism), kidney failure, [lupus](../glossary#systemic-lupus-erythematosus), or individuals resins, methotrexate, [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease), [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (heart attack), and [stroke](../glossary#stroke). A study that followed 1,980 Finnish men for 10 years found that those who consumed the most dietary folate had a 55% lower risk of an acute coronary event when compared to those who consumed the least dietary folate [(75)](#reference75). Of the three B-vitamins that regulate [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, folic acid has been shown to have the greatest effect in lowering basal concentrations of homocysteine in the blood when there is no coexisting deficiency [vitamin through food or [supplements](../glossary#supplement) has been found to reduce homocysteine concentrations [(77)](#reference77). Besides, blood homocysteine concentrations have declined since the FDA mandated folic acid [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of the grain supply in the US [(25)](#reference25). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 25 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including almost 3,000 subjects, found that folic acid supplementation with 800 g/day or more could achieve a maximal 25% reduction in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine concentrations. In this meta-analysis, daily doses of 200 g and 400 g of folic acid were associated with a 13% and 20% reduction in plasma homocysteine, respectively [(78)](#reference78). A supplement regimen of 400 g of folic acid, 2 mg of vitamin B6, and 6 g of vitamin B12 has been advocated by the American Heart Association if an initial trial of a folate-rich diet (see [Sources](#sources)) is not successful in adequately lowering homocysteine concentrations [(79)](#reference79). Several [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in folate/ [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism modify homocysteine concentrations in blood [(80)](#reference80). In particular, the effect of the c.677C>T MTHFR variant has been examined in relation to folic acid fortification policies worldwide. The analysis of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) trials, including 59,995 subjects without a history of CVD, revealed that the difference in homocysteine concentrations between T/T and C/C genotypes was greater in low-folate regions compared to regions with food fortification policy (3.12 vs. 0.13 micromoles/liter) [(81)](#reference81). Although folic acid supplementation effectively decreases homocysteine concentrations, it is not yet clear whether it also decreases risk for CVD. A recent meta-analysis of 19 randomized [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial), including 47,921 subjects with preexisting cardiovascular or [renal](../glossary#renal) disease, found that homocysteine lowering through folic acid and other B-vitamin supplementation failed to reduce the incidence of CVD despite significant reductions in plasma homocysteine concentrations [(74)](#reference74). Other meta-analyses have confirmed the lack of causality between the lowering of homocysteine and the risk of CVD [(80-82)](#reference80), including the risk of stroke [(83, 84)](#reference83). Consequently, the American Heart Association removed its recommendation for using folic acid to prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk women [(85)](#reference85). It should be noted that the majority of prevention trials to date have been performed in CVD patients with advanced disease. The evidence supporting a beneficial role for folate and related B-vitamins appears to be strongest for the primary prevention of stroke [(86)](#reference86). The introduction of mandatory folic acid fortification has been associated with a decline in stroke-related mortality in North America, adding further support to the potential benefit of enhancing folate status and/or lowering homocysteine in the prevention of stroke [(87)](#reference87). Despite the controversy regarding the role of homocysteine lowering in CVD prevention, some studies have investigated the effect of folic acid supplementation on the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis), a known risk factor for vascular accidents. The measurement of the [carotid](../glossary#carotid-arteries) intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a surrogate endpoint for early atherosclerosis and a predictor for [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(88)](#reference88). The meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials testing the effect of folic acid supplementation showed a significant reduction in CIMT in subjects with chronic kidney diseases and in those at risk for CVD, but not in healthy participants [(89)](#reference89). [Endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction is a common feature in atherosclerosis and vascular disease. High doses of folic acid (400-10,000 g/day) have been associated with improvements in vascular health in both healthy and CVD subjects [(90)](#reference90). Although recent trials failed to demonstrate any cardiovascular protection from folic acid supplementation, low folate intake is a known risk factor for vascular disease, and more research is needed to explore the role of folate in maintaining vascular health [(91)](#reference91). [Cancer](../glossary#cancer) is thought to arise from [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage in excess of ongoing DNA repair and/or the inappropriate expression of critical [genes](../glossary#gene). Because of the important roles played by folate in DNA and [RNA](../glossary#RNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and [methylation](../glossary#methylation), it is possible that inadequate folate intake contributes to genome instability and [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) breakage that often characterize cancer development. In particular, DNA replication and repair are critical for genome maintenance, and the shortage in [nucleotides](../glossary#nucleotide) caused by folate deficiency might lead to genome instability and DNA [mutations](../glossary#mutation). A decrease in 5,10-methylene THF can compromise the conversion of deoxyuridine thymine depletion. This could then lead to uracil misincorporation into DNA during replication or repair, and cause DNA damage, including point mutations and strand breaks [(92)](#reference92). Since 5,10-methylene THF is also the MTHFR enzyme substrate, it is plausible that a reduction of MTHFR activity with the c.677C>T polymorphism may increase the use of 5,10-methylene THF for thymidylate synthesis and prevent DNA damage. However, this hypothesis might only be valid in a situation of folate deficiency [(93)](#reference93). Conversely, it was argued that folic acid supplementation could fuel DNA synthesis, therefore promoting tumor growth. This is supported by the observation that TS can function like a tumor promoter (oncogene), while a reduction in TS activity is linked to a lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of cancer [(94, 95)](#reference94). Additionally, antifolate molecules that block the thymidylate synthesis pathway are successfully used in cancer therapy [(96)](#reference96). Folate also controls the homocysteine/ [methionine](../glossary#methionine) cycle and the pool of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for methylation reactions. Thus, folate deficiency may impair DNA and [protein](../glossary#protein) methylation and alter the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of genes involved in DNA repair, [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and cell death. Global DNA hypomethylation, a typical hallmark of cancer, causes genome instability and chromosome breaks (reviewed in [97](#reference97)). The consumption of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables daily has been consistently associated with a decreased incidence of cancer [(98)](#reference98). Fruit and vegetables are excellent sources of folate, which may play a role in their anti-carcinogenic effect. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found diminished folate [status](../glossary#status) to be associated with site-specific cancers. While food [fortification](../glossary#fortification) is mandatory in the US (since 1998; see [Sources](#sources)), concerns about the impact of high folic acid intakes on health have delayed the practice in several other countries [(99)](#reference99). However, the most recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of folic acid [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) (supplemental doses ranging from 500 to 5,000 g/day for at least one year) did not show any specific benefit or harm regarding total and site-specific cancer incidence [(100, 101)](#reference100). A pooled analysis of 13 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), which followed a total of 725,134 individuals for a 7 to 20-year period, revealed a modest, inverse association between dietary and total (from food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) folate intake and [colon](../glossary#colon) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) risk. Specifically, a 2% decrease in colon cancer risk was estimated for every 100 g/day increase in total folate intake [(102)](#reference102). A large US [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), which followed 525,488 subjects, ages 50 to 71 years between 1995 and 2006, correlated dietary folate, supplemental folic acid, and total folate intakes with a decreased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk [(103)](#reference103). However, when stratified by gender, there was no association between dietary folate intake and CRC risk in women [(103, 104)](#reference103). A lack of association between CRC risk and dietary, supplemental, and total folate intakes was also reported in another prospective study that followed more than 90,000 US postmenopausal women during an 11-year period encompassing pre- and post- [fortification](../glossary#fortification) periods [(105)](#reference105). These data suggest the possible influence of gender over CRC risk modification by folate. In the latter study, a significant but transient risk elevation was also observed during the post-fortification era; however, some have asserted that this is unlikely to be caused by increased folate intake due to mandatory fortification [(106)](#reference106). Finally, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found a slight reduction in CRC risk with folate from food [(107)](#reference107). However, it is important to note that the case-control studies were highly [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity), and that the authors stated that dietary fiber, vitamins, and alcohol intake could have confounded their results. Moreover, the lower limit of the highest quantile of folate intake was highly variable, ranging from 270 to 1,367 g/day [(107)](#reference107). While most [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) research shows a protective effect of folate against colorectal cancer development, it has been suggested that high doses of supplemental folic acid may actually accelerate tumor growth in cancer patients [(108)](#reference108). Whereas higher folate status within the normal dietary range is widely considered to be protective against cancer, some investigators remain concerned that exposure to excessively high folic acid intakes may increase the growth of pre-existing neoplasms [(108)](#reference108). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) addressed the effect of folic acid supplementation in patients with a history of [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma), with trials finding a risk reduction or no effect of supplemental folic acid [(109-112)](#reference109). A recent meta-analysis of three large [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in high-risk subjects did not demonstrate any increase in colorectal adenoma recurrence in subjects supplemented with 500 or 1,000 g/day of folic acid for 24 to 42 months when compared with [placebo](../glossary#placebo) treatment [(113)](#reference113). As suggested earlier, the MTHFR 677T/T genotype might prevent uracil misincorporation and protect [DNA](../glossary#DNA) integrity and stability under low-folate conditions. A meta-analysis of 62 case-control and two cohort studies revealed that while the T/T variant reduces CRC risk by 12% compared to both C/T and C/C genotypes, the risk was decreased by 30% g/day) versus low in the MTR gene, which codes for methionine synthase, was also examined in relation with the risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer. Methionine synthase [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) and into methionine and TFH, respectively. The recent meta-analysis of 27 case-control studies showed no association between MTR variant and cancer risk [(115)](#reference115). Although alcohol consumption interferes with the absorption and metabolism of folate [(16)](#reference16), one case-control and five prospective cohort studies have reported either reduction in CRC risk among nondrinkers compared to drinkers or a lack of association [(107)](#reference107). However, in a large prospective study that followed more than 28,000 male health professionals for 22 years, intake of more than two alcoholic drinks (>30 grams of alcohol) per day augmented CRC risk by 42% during the pre-fortification period. CRC risk was not increased during the post-fortification period, suggesting that it is the combination of high alcohol and low folate intake that might increase CRC risk. Yet, another prospective study that followed more than 69,000 female nurses for 28 years did not report a significant increase in CRC risk with alcohol intake before and after the mandatory folic acid fortification [(116)](#reference116). In some studies, individuals who are [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) for the c.677C>T MTHFR polymorphism (T/T) have been found to be at decreased risk for colon cancer when folate intake is adequate. However, when folate intake is low and/or alcohol intake is high, individuals with the (T/T) genotype have been found to be at increased risk of colorectal cancer [(117, 118)](#reference117). Several [prospective cohort](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) affects [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) have reported mixed results [(119)](#reference119). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 15 prospective studies and one [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) found no relationship with dietary folate intake [(120)](#reference120). Moderate alcohol intake has been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of breast cancer in women [(121)](#reference121). The results of three prospective studies suggested that increased folate intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer in women who regularly consume alcohol [(122-124)](#reference122). Thus, high folate intake might be associated with a risk reduction only in women whose breast cancer risk is raised by alcohol consumption. A very large prospective study in more than 88,000 nurses reported that folic acid intake was not associated with breast cancer in women who consumed less than one alcoholic drink per day. However, in women consuming at least one alcoholic drink per day, folic acid intake of at least 600 g daily resulted in about half the risk of breast cancer compared with women who consumed less than 300 g of folic acid daily [(124)](#reference124). Nevertheless, whether and how alcohol consumption increases breast cancer risk is still subject to discussion [(125, 126)](#reference125). Finally, recent meta-analyses evaluating the influence of [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) on cancer risk found that specific variants in the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding thymidylate synthase increased the risk of breast cancer in certain ethnic populations [(127, 128)](#reference127). The incidence of Wilms' tumors (kidney [cancer](../glossary#cancer)) and certain types of brain cancers (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and ependymoma) in children has decreased since the mandatory [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of the US grain supply in 1998 [(129)](#reference129). However, incidence rates were unchanged between the pre- and post-fortification periods for leukemia\u2014a predominant childhood malignancy. Despite earlier studies linking maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy with the reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of childhood leukemia, more recent investigations have found little evidence to support a preventive effect of folic acid [(130)](#reference130). Several [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) have also found little to no protective effect with MTHFR [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism); however, the most recent meta-analysis of 22 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found a reduction in the risk of acute lymphoblastic [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia) (ALL) with the c.677C>T variant in Caucasians and Asians [(131)](#reference131). [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the most common form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), affecting more than 5 million individuals over 65 years old in the US [(132)](#reference132). [-amyloid plaque](../glossary#amyloid-plaque) deposition, Tau protein-forming tangles, and increased cell death in the brain of AD patients have been associated with [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline and memory loss. One study associated increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, which are abundant sources of folate, with a reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing dementia and AD in women [(133)](#reference133). Through its role in [nucleic acid](../glossary#nucleic-acid) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and methyl donor provision for [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, folate is critical for normal brain development and function, not only during pregnancy and after birth, but also later in life [(134)](#reference134). In one [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of elderly women, AD patients had significantly higher [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) and lower red blood cell folate concentrations compared to healthy individuals. However, there was no difference in the level of [serum](../glossary#serum) folate between groups, suggesting that long-term folate status, rather than recent folate intake, may be associated with the risk of AD [(135)](#reference135). Several investigators have described associations between increased homocysteine concentrations and cognitive impairment in the elderly [(136)](#reference136), but [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have not found higher folate intakes to be associated with improved [cognition](../glossary#cognition) [(137, 138)](#reference137). Higher homocysteine concentrations were found in individuals suffering from dementia, including AD and [vascular dementia](../glossary#vascular-dementia), compared to healthy subjects [(139, 140)](#reference139). Although deficiencies in folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 could increase homocysteine concentrations, a reduction in [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) concentrations in the serum of AD patients compared to healthy individuals could not be attributed to decreased vitamin intakes [(141)](#reference141). It is not presently clear whether serum homocysteine is a risk factor for developing dementia or simply associated with the cognitive decline. In the last decade, a number of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have tested the use of B-vitamins to lower homocysteine and prevent or delay cognitive decline. A meta-analysis of nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials of folic acid supplementation (0.2 to 15 mg/day for a median duration of six months) in healthy individuals over 45 years of age failed to find a short-term effect on cognitive functions, including memory, speed, language, and [executive functions](../glossary#executive-function) [(142)](#reference142). More recently, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 19 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials of B-vitamin supplementation found no difference in cognitive parameters between the treatment and placebo groups, despite the treatment effectively lowering homocysteine concentrations [(143)](#reference143). Inconsistent findings across trials may be due to differences in design and methodology (reviewed in [144](#reference144)). Nevertheless, a two-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 168 elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment recently described the benefits of a daily regimen of 800 g of folic acid, 500 g of vitamin B12, and 20 mg of vitamin B6 [(145, 146)](#reference145). [Atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) of specific brain regions affected by AD was observed in individuals of both groups, and this atrophy correlated with cognitive decline; however, the B-vitamin treatment group experienced a smaller loss of [gray matter](../glossary#gray-matter) compared to the placebo group (0.5% vs. 3.7%). A greater benefit was seen in subjects with higher baseline homocysteine concentrations, suggesting the importance of lowering circulating homocysteine in prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. Although encouraging, the effect of B-vitamin supplementation needs to be further studied in larger trials that evaluate long-term outcomes, such as the incidence of AD. Folinic acid (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above), a tetrahydrofolic acid derivative, is used in the clinical management of rare inborn errors that affect folate transport or [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (reviewed in [147](#reference147)). Such conditions are of [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) inheritance, meaning only individuals receiving two copies of the mutated [gene](../glossary#gene) (one from each parent) develop the disease. Hereditary folate [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) is caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the SLC46A1 [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for the folate transporter PCFT and typically affects [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) folate absorption and folate transport into the brain [(148)](#reference148). Patients present with low to undetectable concentrations of folate in [serum](../glossary#serum) and [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid), pancytopenia (low number of all blood cells), impaired immune responses that increase susceptibility to infections, and a general failure to thrive [(149)](#reference149). [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms, including [seizures](../glossary#seizure), have also been observed [(150)](#reference150). Clinical improvements have been recorded following [parenteral](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) provision of folinic acid [(151)](#reference151). CFD is characterized by low levels of folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) in [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) despite normal concentrations of folate in blood. Folate transport across the blood-brain barrier is compromised in CFD and has been linked either to the presence of [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) blocking the folate receptor FR or FR 153)](#reference152). [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) abnormalities, along with visual and hearing impairments, have been described in children with CFD; autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is present in some cases. Folinic acid (also known as leucovorin) can enter the brain and normalize the level of folate coenzymes and has been shown to normalize folate concentrations and improve various social interactions in CFD, including mood, behavior, and verbal communication in children with ASD [(152, 154, 155)](#reference152). DHFR is the NADPH-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). DHFR is also required to convert folic acid to DHF. DHFR deficiency is characterized by [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) folate deficiency causing intractable [seizures](../glossary#seizure) and mental deficits. Although folinic acid treatment can alleviate the symptoms of DHFR deficiency, early diagnosis is essential to prevent irreversible brain damage and improve clinical outcomes [(156, 157)](#reference156). Green leafy vegetables (foliage) are rich sources of folate and provide the basis for its name. Citrus fruit juices, [legumes](../glossary#legumes), and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods are also excellent sources of folate [(1)](#references); the folate content of fortified cereal varies greatly. A number of folate-rich foods are listed in Table 2, along with their folate content in micrograms (g). For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData help prevent neural tube defects, the US FDA required the addition of 1.4 milligrams (mg) of folic acid per kilogram (kg) of grain to be added to refined grain products, which are already enriched with niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and iron, as of January 1, 1998. The addition of nutrients to food in order to prevent a nutritional deficiency or restore nutrients lost in processing is known as | The principal form of [supplementary](../glossary#supplement) folate is folic acid. It is available in single-ingredient and combination products, such as B-complex vitamins and multivitamins. Doses of 1 mg or greater require a prescription [(159)](#reference159). Additionally, folinic acid, a tetrahydrofolic acid derivative, is used to manage certain metabolic diseases (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Further, the US FDA has approved the supplementation of folate in oral contraceptives. The addition of levomefolate calcium (the calcium salt of MeTHF; 451 g/tablet) to oral contraceptives is intended to raise folate status in women of childbearing age [(160)](#reference160). According to a US national survey, only 24% of non-pregnant women aged 15-44 years are meeting the current recommendation of 400 g/day of folic acid [(161)](#reference161). No adverse effects have been associated with the consumption of excess folate from food. Concerns regarding safety are limited to synthetic folic acid intake. Deficiency of vitamin B12, though often undiagnosed, may affect a significant number of people, especially older adults (see the article on [Vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12#deficiency)). One symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency is [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia), which is indistinguishable from that associated with folate deficiency (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). Large doses of folic acid given to an individual with an undiagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency could correct megaloblastic anemia without correcting the underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leaving the individual at [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing irreversible [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) damage. Such cases of neurologic progression in vitamin B12 deficiency have been mostly seen at folic acid doses of 5,000 g (5 mg) and above. In order to be very sure of preventing irreversible neurological damage in vitamin B12-deficient individuals, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine advises that all adults limit their intake of folic acid ( [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and [fortification](../glossary#fortification)) to 1,000 g (1 mg) daily (Table 3). The Board also noted that vitamin B12 deficiency is very rare in women in their childbearing years, making the consumption of folic acid at or above 1,000 g/day unlikely to cause problems [(1)](#references); however, there are limited data on the effects of large doses. |Age of intake should be from food and formula only.| The saturation of DHFR metabolic capacity by oral doses of folic acid has been associated with the appearance of unmetabolized folic acid in blood [(162)](#reference162). [Hematologic](../glossary#hematology) abnormalities and poorer [cognition](../glossary#cognition) have been associated with the presence of unmetabolized folic acid in vitamin B12-deficient older adults (60 years) [(163, 164)](#reference163). A small study conducted in postmenopausal women also raised concerns about the effect of exposure to unmetabolized folic acid on immune function [(165)](#reference165). In a small, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [open-label trial](../glossary#open-label-trial) in 38 women of reproductive age receiving 30 weeks of daily multivitamin supplements, daily supplementation with either 1.1 mg or 5 mg of folic acid resulted in the transient appearance of unmetabolized folic acid in blood over the first 12 weeks of supplementation [(166)](#reference166). However, unmetabolized folic acid concentrations returned to baseline levels at the end of the study, suggesting that adaptive mechanisms eventually converted folic acid to reduced forms of folate. Nonetheless, the use of supplemental levomefolate (5-methyl THF) may provide an alternative to prevent the potential negative effects of unconverted folic acid in older adults. When nonsteroidal anti- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen, are taken in very large therapeutic dosages (i.e., to treat severe arthritis), they may interfere with folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). In contrast, routine use of NSAIDs has not been found to adversely affect folate [status](../glossary#status). The [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant), phenytoin, has been shown to inhibit the [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) absorption of folate, and several studies have associated decreased folate status with long-term use of the anticonvulsants, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone [(167)](#reference167). However, few studies controlled for differences in dietary folate intake between anticonvulsant users and nonusers. Also, taking folic acid at the same time as the [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering agents, cholestyramine and colestipol, may decrease the absorption of folic acid [(159)](#reference159). Methotrexate is a folate [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) used of diseases, including [cancer](../glossary#cancer), [rheumatoid arthritis](../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis), and [psoriasis](../glossary#psoriasis). Some of the side effects of methotrexate are similar to those of severe folate deficiency, and supplementation with folic or folinic acid is used to reduce antifolate toxicity. Other antifolate molecules currently used in cancer therapy include aminopterin, pemetrexed, pralatrexate, and raltitrexed [(96)](#reference96). Further, a number of other medications have been shown to have antifolate activity, including trimethoprim (an antibiotic), pyrimethamine (an antimalarial), triamterene (a blood pressure medication), and sulfasalazine (a treatment for [ulcerative colitis](../glossary#ulcerative-colitis)). Early studies of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) containing high doses of [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) indicated adverse effects on folate status; however, this finding has not been supported in more recent studies that used low-dose oral contraceptives and controlled for dietary folate [(168)](#reference168). The available scientific evidence shows that adequate folate intake prevents [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) and other poor outcomes of pregnancy; is helpful in lowering the [risk](../glossary#risk) of some forms of [cancer](../glossary#cancer), especially in genetically susceptible individuals; and may lower the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adults take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, which typically contains 400 g of folic acid, the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)). Even with a larger than average intake of folic acid from [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food, it is unlikely that an individual's daily folic acid intake would regularly exceed the tolerable upper intake level of 1,000 g/day established by the Institute of Medicine (see [Safety](#safety)). The recommendation for 400 g/day of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) folic acid as part of a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, in addition to a folate-rich diet, is especially important for older adults because blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations tend to increase with age (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)).

Rev. 2011;69(10):572-583. Niacin or vitamin B3 is a water-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) used by the body to form the nicotinamide [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme), NAD+. The term 'niacin' is often used to refer to nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) only, although other vitamers with a pyridine ring, including nicotinamide (pyridine-3-carboxamide) and nicotinamide riboside, also contribute to NAD+ formation [(1)](#references). None of the vitamers are related to the nicotine found in tobacco, although their names are similar. Likewise, nicotine \u2014 but not nicotinic acid \u2014 is an [agonist](../glossary#agonist) of the nicotinic [receptors](../glossary#receptor) that respond to the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter), acetylcholine. Essential to all forms of life, the nicotinamide [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) NAD+ is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the body from four [precursors](../glossary#precursor) that are provided in the diet: nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, nicotinamide riboside, and tryptophan (Figure 1). Figure 2 illustrates the separate biosynthetic pathways that lead to NAD+ production from the various dietary precursors. NAD+ is synthesized from nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside via two enzymatic reactions, while the pathway that yields NAD+ from nicotinic acid - known as the Preiss-Handler pathway \u2014 includes three steps. The kynurenine pathway is the longest NAD+ biosynthetic pathway: the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of tryptophan through kynurenine produces acid, which is then converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide, an intermediate in NAD+ [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). NAD+ is then synthesized from nicotinic acid mononucleotide the Preiss-Handler pathway [(2)](#reference2). All pathways mononucleotide. Specific a phosphoribose moiety onto nicotinic acid or quinolinic acid to produce onto nicotinamide to generate nicotinamide mononucleotide. or (NADSYN), which uses glutamine as amide (Figure 2) [(2)](#reference2). Of note, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide has been reported to form following the administration of high-dose nicotinamide riboside, suggesting that a potential deamidation could occur to convert NAD+ to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide when the pool is high [(1)](#references). NAD kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of into ( [redox](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#redox%20reaction)) properties of the dinucleotide are not affected by the phosphorylation such that the redox pairs NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH show similar redox potentials [(4)](#reference4). Oxidation and reduction of the C-4 position of the nicotinamide moiety of NADand its phosphorylated form are essential for electron-transfer reactions supporting vital metabolic and bioenergetic functions in all cells (see [Function](#function)). Thus, NAD and NADP are recycled back and forth between oxidized (NAD+ and NADP+) and reduced forms (NADH and NADPH), as shown in Figure 3. Living organisms derive most of their energy from [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) reactions, which are processes involving the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron). Over 400 [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) require the niacin [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme), NAD and NADP, mainly to accept or donate electrons for redox reactions [(5)](#reference5). NAD and NADP appear to support distinct functions (Figure 4). NAD functions most often in energy-producing reactions involving the degradation ( [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism)) of [carbohydrates](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#carbohydrate), fats, [proteins](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#protein), and alcohol. NADP generally serves in biosynthetic (anabolic) reactions, such as [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [steroids](../glossary#steroid) (e.g., [cholesterol](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#cholesterol), bile acids, building blocks of other macromolecules [(4)](#reference4). NADP is also essential for the regeneration of components of detoxification and [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) systems [(4)](#reference4). To support these functions, the cell maintains NAD in a largely oxidized state (NAD+) to serve as oxidizing agent for catabolic reactions, while NADP is kept largely in a reduced state (NADPH) to readily donate electrons for reductive cellular processes The niacin [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme), NAD, is the [substrate](../glossary#substrate) (reactant) for at least four classes of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Two classes of enzymes with mono adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase and/or poly (ADP-ribose) Silent information regulator-2 (Sir2)-like proteins removal of acetyl groups acetylated [proteins](../glossary#protein), utilizing ADP-ribose from NAD as an acceptor for acetyl groups. Finally, ADP-ribosylcyclases are involved in the regulation of intracellular [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling). [Enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) with ADP-ribosyltransferase activities were ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). ARTs were first discovered in certain [pathogenic](../glossary#pathogen) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) \u2014 like those causing cholera or diphtheria \u2014 where they mediate the actions of toxins. These enzymes transfer an ADP-ribose residue moiety from NAD to a specific [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) of a target [protein](../glossary#protein), with the creation of an ADP-ribosylated protein and the release of nicotinamide. Because most PARPs have been found to exhibit only mono ADP-ribosyltransferase activities, a new nomenclature was proposed for enzymes catalyzing ADP-ribosylation: A family of mono ADP-ribosyltransferases with [homology](../glossary#homologous) to bacterial diphteria toxins was named ARTD, while enzymes with either mono or poly ADP-ribosyltransferase activities and related to C2 and C3 clostridial toxins sirtuins (SIRT 1-7) have been Sirtuins are a class of NAD-dependent deacetylase [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) that remove acetyl groups from the acetylated lysine residues of target [proteins](../glossary#protein). During the deacetylation process, the acetyl group is transferred onto the ADP-ribose moiety cleaved off NAD, producing O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Nicotinamide can to the Like ADP-ribosylation, [acetylation](../glossary#acetylation) is a post- [translational](../glossary#translation) modification that affects the function of target proteins. The initial interest in sirtuins followed the discovery that their activation could mimic caloric restriction, which has been shown to increase lifespan in lower organisms. Such a role in mammals is controversial, although sirtuins are energy-sensing regulators involved in [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways that could play important roles in delaying the onset of age-related diseases (e.g., [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), [cancer](../glossary#cancer), [dementia](../glossary#dementia), arthritis). To date, the spectrum of their biological functions includes [gene](../glossary#gene) silencing, [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage repair, [cell cycle](../glossary#cell-cycle) regulation, and cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) [(10)](#reference10). In humans, CD38 and CD157 belong to a family of NAD+ glycohydrolases/ADP-ribosylcyclases. These [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) [catalyze](../glossary#catalyst) the formation of ADP-ribose, cyclic and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate works within cells to provoke the release of calcium [ions](../glossary#ion) from internal storage sites (i.e., endoplasmic reticulum, mononucleotide O-acetyl-ADP-ribose generated by the activity of sirtuins also controls calcium entry through TRPM2 channels [(6)](#reference6). Intracellular calcium-mediated signal transduction is regulated by transient calcium entry into the cell or release of calcium from intracellular stores. Calcium signaling is critically involved in processes like neurotransmission, [insulin](../glossary#insulin) release from [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) -cells, muscle cell contraction, and T- [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) activation [(6)](#reference6). NAD+ has been identified as [membrane](../glossary#cell-membrane) [receptors](../glossary#receptor) of the P2Y subclass. In particular, NAD was found to bind to P2Y1 receptor and act as an inhibitory [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) at neuromuscular junctions in visceral smooth muscles [(12)](#reference12). Extracellular NAD+ was also found to behave like a proinflammatory [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine), triggering the activation of isolated granulocytes. NAD+ binding to the P2Y11 receptor at the granulocyte surface activated a [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) cascade involving cyclic ADP-ribose and the rise of intracellular calcium, eventually stimulating superoxide generation and [chemotaxis](../glossary#chemotaxis) [(13)](#reference13). [monocytes](../glossary#monocyte) NAADP+ and ADP-ribose receptors and trigger intracellular and ADP-ribose-dependent calcium mobilization (see [Calcium over half a century, [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of nicotinic acid, but not nicotinamide, have to reduce [serum](../glossary#serum) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)) [(17)](#reference17). However, the exact mechanisms underlying the [lipid](../glossary#lipid)-lowering effect of nicotinic acid remain speculative. Two G-protein-coupled [membrane](../glossary#cell-membrane) [receptors](../glossary#receptor), GPR109A and GPR109B, bind nicotinic acid with high and low affinity, respectively. These nicotinic acid receptors are primarily expressed in [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose-tissue) and immune cells (but not [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte)). They are also found in retinal pigmented and colonic epithelial cells, [keratinocytes](../glossary#keratinocyte), breast cells, microglia, and possibly at low levels in the liver [(18)](#reference18). Thus, lipid-modifying effects of nicotinic acid are likely to be mediated by receptor-independent mechanisms in major tissues of lipid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) like liver and skeletal muscle. Early [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) data suggested that nicotinic acid in [hepatocytes](../glossary#hepatocyte) [(19)](#reference19). In another study, nicotinic acid affected the hepatic uptake of ApoAI lipoprotein, thereby reducing [high-density lipoprotein](../glossary#HDL) (HDL) removal from the circulation (reviewed in [20](#reference20)). In adipocytes, the binding of nicotinic acid to GPR109A was found to initiate a [signal transduction cascade](../glossary#signal-transduction-pathway) resulting in reductions in free [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase involved in triglyceride lipolysis [(21)](#reference21). Nonetheless, recent observations have suggested that the lipid-lowering effect of nicotinic acid was not due to its anti-lipolytic activity [(22)](#reference22). Trials showed that synthetic agonists of GPR109A acutely lowered free fatty acids yet failed to affect serum lipids [(22)](#reference22). Aside from its impact on HDL and other [plasma](../glossary#plasma) lipids, nicotinic acid has exhibited modulating [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and regulating cell adhesion, migration, and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) (reviewed in [18](#reference18)). The late stage of severe niacin deficiency is known as pellagra. Early records of pellagra followed the widespread cultivation of corn in Europe in the 1700s [(23)](#reference23). The disease is generally associated with poorer social classes whose chief dietary staple consisted of cereal like corn or sorghum. Pellagra was also common in the southern United States during the early 1900s where income was low and corn products were a major dietary staple [(24)](#reference24). Interestingly, pellagra was not known in Mexico, where corn was also an important dietary staple and much of the population was also poor. In fact, if corn contains appreciable amounts of niacin, it is present in a bound form that is not nutritionally available to humans. The traditional preparation of corn tortillas in Mexico involves soaking the corn in a lime (calcium oxide) solution, prior to cooking. Heating the corn in an [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline) solution results in the release of bound niacin, increasing its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(25)](#reference25). Pellagra epidemics were also unknown to Native Americans who consumed immature corn that contains predominantly unbound (bioavailable) niacin [(24)](#reference24). Niacin deficiency or pellagra may result from inadequate dietary intake of NAD precursors, including tryptophan. Niacin deficiency \u2014 often associated with malnutrition \u2014 is observed in the homeless population, in individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa or [obesity](../glossary#obesity), and in consumers of diets high in maize and poor in animal protein [(26-29)](#reference26). Deficiencies of other B [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) and some trace [minerals](../glossary#mineral) may aggravate niacin deficiency [(30, 31)](#reference30). Malabsorptive disorders megaduodenum [(32, 33)](#reference32). Patients disease](../glossary#hartnup-disease), a hereditary disorder resulting in defective tryptophan absorption, have developed pellagra (see [Niacin-responsive genetic disorders](#niacin-responsive-genetic-disorders-treatment)). [Carcinoid syndrome](../glossary#carcinoid-syndrome), a condition secretion of [serotonin](../glossary#serotonin) and other [catecholamines](../glossary#catecholamine) by carcinoid tumors, may also result in pellagra due to increased utilization of dietary tryptophan for serotonin rather than niacin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). Further, prolonged treatment with the anti- [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis) drug isoniazid has resulted in niacin deficiency [(34)](#reference34). Other pharmaceutical agents, including the immunosuppressive given to people with [Parkinson's disease)](../glossary#parkinson-disease), are known to increase the reliance on dietary niacin by interfering with the tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway [(35)](#reference35). Finally, other populations at risk for niacin deficiency include [dialysis](../glossary#dialysis) patients, cancer patients [(36, 37)](#reference36), individuals suffering from chronic alcoholism [(38)](#reference38), and people with [HIV](../glossary#HIV) (see [HIV/AIDS](#HIV-AIDS-treatment) below). Further, chronic alcohol intake can lead to severe niacin deficiency through reducing dietary niacin intake and interfering with the tryptophan-to-NAD conversion [(30)](#reference30). The most common symptoms of niacin deficiency involve the skin, the digestive system, and the nervous system. The symptoms of pellagra are commonly referred to as the three \"Ds\": sun-sensitive [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis), diarrhea, and [dementia](../glossary#dementia). A fourth \"D,\" death, occurs if pellagra is left untreated [(5)](#reference5). In the skin, a thick, scaly, darkly pigmented rash develops symmetrically in areas exposed to sunlight. In fact, the word \"pellagra\" comes from \"pelle agra,\" the Italian phrase for rough skin. Symptoms related to the digestive system include [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the mouth and tongue (\"bright red tongue\"), vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and ultimately, diarrhea. [Gastrointestinal ](../glossary#gastrointestinal)disorders and diarrhea contribute to the ongoing malnourishment of the patients. [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms include headache, apathy, fatigue, depression, disorientation, and memory loss and are more consistent with delirium than with the historically described dementia [(38)](#reference38). Disease presentations vary in appearance since the classic triad rarely presents in its entirety. The absence of dermatitis, for example, is known as pellagra sine pellagra. To treat pellagra, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends administering nicotinamide to avoid the flushing commonly caused by nicotinic acid (see [Safety](#safety)). Treatment guidelines suggest using 300 mg/day of oral nicotinamide in divided doses, or 100 mg/day administered parenterally in divided doses, for three to four weeks [(37, 39)](#reference37). Because patients with pellagra often display additional [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) deficiencies, administration of a vitamin B-complex preparation is advised [(39)](#reference39). The term \"niacin equivalent\" (NE) is used to describe the contribution to dietary intake of all the forms of niacin that are available to the body. In healthy individuals, less than 2% of dietary tryptophan is converted to NAD in the kynurenine pathway [(40)](#reference40). The synthesis of NAD from tryptophan is fairly inefficient and depends on [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) requiring [vitamin B6](vitamin-B6) and riboflavin, Nonetheless, tryptophan is essential as a for NAD+. Inherited defects in tryptophan transport and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) result in severe clinical disorders attributed to NAD+ depletion (see [Niacin-responsive genetic disorders](#niacin-responsive-genetic-disorders-treatment)). On average, 60 milligrams (mg) of tryptophan are considered to correspond to 1 mg of niacin or 1 mg of NE. The recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for niacin is based on the prevention of deficiency. Pellagra can be prevented by about 11 mg NE/day, but 12 mg to 16 mg NE/day has been found to normalize the urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of niacin [metabolites](../glossary#metabolism) (breakdown products) in healthy young adults. Because pellagra represents severe deficiency, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine chose to use the excretion of niacin metabolites as an indicator of niacin nutritional status rather than symptoms of pellagra [(41)](#reference41). However, it has been argued that cellular NAD and NADP content may be more relevant indicators of niacin nutritional [(24)](#reference24). of cultured cells ( [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro)) provide evidence that NAD content influences mechanisms that maintain [genomic](../glossary#genome) stability. Loss of genomic stability, characterized by a high rate of damage to [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [chromosomes](../glossary#chromosome), is a hallmark of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(42)](#reference42). The current understanding is that the pool of NAD is decreased during niacin deficiency and that it affects the activity of NAD-consuming [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) rather than [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) and metabolic poly ADP-ribosylations catalyzed by PARP enzymes (ARTDs) are critical for the cellular response to DNA injury. After DNA damage, PARPs are activated; the subsequent poly ADP-ribosylations of a number of signaling and structural molecules by PARPs were shown to facilitate DNA repair at DNA strand breaks [(44)](#reference44). Cellular depletion of NAD has been found to decrease levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53, a target for poly ADP-ribosylation, in human breast, skin, and lung cells [(45)](#reference45). The expression of p53 was also altered by niacin deficiency in rat bone marrow cells [(46)](#reference46). Impairment of DNA repair caused by niacin deficiency could lead to genomic instability and drive tumor development in rat models [(47, 48)](#reference47). Both PARPs and sirtuins have been recently involved in the maintenance of heterochromatin, a chromosomal domain associated with genome stability, as well as in [transcriptional](../glossary#transcription) [gene](../glossary#gene) silencing, [telomere](../glossary#telomere) integrity, and chromosome segregation during cell division [(49, 50)](#reference49). Neither the cellular NAD content nor the dietary intake of NAD precursors necessary for optimizing protective responses following DNA damage has been determined, but both are likely to be higher than that required for the prevention of pellagra. [Cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients often suffer from bone marrow suppression following [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy), given that bone marrow is one of the most [proliferative](../glossary#proliferation) tissues in the body and thus a primary target for chemotherapeutic agents. Niacin deficiency was found to decrease bone marrow NAD and poly-ADP-ribose levels and increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of chemically induced [leukemia](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#leukemia) in rats [(51)](#reference51). Conversely, a [pharmacologic dose](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide was able to increase NAD and poly ADP-ribose in bone marrow and decrease the development of leukemia in rats [(52)](#reference52). It has been suggested that niacin deficiency often observed in cancer patients could sensitize bone marrow tissue to the suppressive effect of chemotherapy. However, little is known regarding cellular NAD levels and the prevention of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage or cancer in humans. One study in two healthy individuals involved elevating NAD levels in blood [lymphocytes](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#lymphocyte) by supplementation with 100 mg/day of nicotinic acid for eight weeks. Compared to non-supplemented individuals, the supplemented individuals had reduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes exposed to [free radicals](../glossary#free-radical) in a test tube assay [(53)](#reference53). However, nicotinic acid supplementation of up to 100 mg/day for 14 weeks in 21 healthy smokers failed to provide any evidence of a decrease in cigarette smoke-induced genetic damage in blood lymphocytes compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(54)](#reference54). More recently, the frequency of [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) translocation was used to evaluate DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 82 pilots chronically exposed to ionizing radiation, a known human [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen). In this [observational study](../glossary#observational-study), the rate of chromosome aberrations was significantly lower in subjects with higher (28.4 mg/day) compared to lower (20.5 mg/day) dietary niacin intake [(55)](#reference55). Higher availability of NAD+ in X-irradiated peripheral blood lymphocytes was found to favor DNA repair by enhancing survival, particularly through SIRT-mediated p53 deacetylation [(56)](#reference56). Generally, relationships between dietary factors and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) are established first in [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) and followed up by basic cancer research at the cellular level. In the case of niacin, research on biochemical and cellular aspects of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) repair has stimulated an interest in the relationship between niacin intake and cancer risk in human populations [(57)](#reference57). A large [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) found increased consumption of niacin, along with [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients, to be associated with decreased incidence of oral (mouth), pharyngeal (throat), and [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) cancers in northern Italy and Switzerland. An increase in daily niacin intake of 6.2 mg was associated with about a 40% decrease in cases of cancers of the mouth and throat, while a 5.2 mg increase in daily niacin intake was associated with a similar decrease in cases of [esophageal](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#esophagus) cancer [(58, 59)](#reference58). Niacin deficiency can lead to severe sunlight sensitivity in exposed skin. Given the implication of NAD-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) repair, there has been some interest in the effect of niacin on skin health. [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) and animal experiments have helped gather information, but human data on niacin/NAD status and skin [cancer](../glossary#cancer) are very limited. One study reported that niacin supplementation decreased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of ultraviolet light (UV)-induced skin cancers in mice, despite the fact that mice convert tryptophan to NAD more efficiently than rats and humans and thus do not get severely deficient [(60)](#reference60). Hyper- [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and impaired [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of skin cells can alter the integrity of the skin barrier and increase the occurrence of pre- [malignant](../glossary#malignant) and malignant skin conditions. A protective effect of niacin was suggested by [topical](../glossary#topical) application of myristyl nicotinate, a niacin derivative, which successfully increased the expression of [epidermal](../glossary#epidermis) [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) markers in subjects with [photodamaged](../glossary#photodamage) skin [(61)](#reference61). The activation of the nicotinic and GPR109B, by [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of niacin could be involved in improving skin barrier function. Conversely, differentiation defects in skin cancer cells were linked to the abnormal cellular localization of defective nicotinic acid receptors [(62)](#reference62). Nicotinamide restriction with subsequent depletion of cellular NAD was shown to increase [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress)-induced DNA damage in a precancerous skin cell model, implying a protective role of NAD-dependent pathways in cancer [(63)](#reference63). Altered NAD availability also affects sirtuin expression and activity in UV-exposed human skin cells. Along with PARPs, NAD-consuming sirtuins could play an important role in the cellular response to photodamage and skin [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) [(64)](#reference64). A pooled analysis of two large US [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 41,808 men and 72,308 women for up to 26 years suggested that higher versus lower intake of niacin (from diet and supplements) might be protective against squamous-cell carcinoma but not against basal-cell [phase III](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial), [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), trial in 386 subjects with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer recently examined the effect of daily nicotinamide supplementation (1 g) for 12 months on skin cancer recurrence at three-month intervals over an 18-month period [(66)](#reference66). Nicotinamide carcinoma (-30%), and basal-cell carcinoma (-20%) compared to placebo after 12 months, yet this protection was not sustained during the six-month post-supplementation period [(66)](#reference66). Larger trials are needed to assess whether nicotinamide could reduce the risk of melanomas, which are not as common as other skin cancer but are more deadly [(67)](#reference67). Type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) in children is caused by the [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) destruction of [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-secreting -cells in the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas). Prior to the onset of symptomatic diabetes, specific [antibodies](../glossary#antibody), including islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), can be detected in the blood of high-risk individuals [(68)](#reference68). In an experimental animal model of diabetes, high levels of nicotinamide are administered to protect -cells from damage caused by streptozotocin [(69)](#reference69). Yet, [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of nicotinamide (up to 3 g/day) have not been found to be effective in delaying or preventing the onset of type 1 diabetes in at-risk subjects. An analysis of 10 trials, of which five were [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, found evidence of improved -cell function after one year of treatment with nicotinamide, but the analysis failed to find any clinical evidence of improved glycemic control [(70)](#reference70). A large, multicenter [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of nicotinamide in ICA-positive siblings (ages, 3-12 years) of type 1 diabetic patients also failed to find a difference in the incidence of type 1 diabetes after three years [(70)](#reference70). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled multicenter trial of 3 g/day) was conducted in 552 ICA-positive relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes. The proportion of relatives who developed type 1 diabetes within five years was comparable whether they were treated with nicotinamide or placebo [(71)](#reference71). Nicotinamide could reduce [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation)-related parameters in these high-risk subjects yet was ineffective to prevent disease onset [(72)](#reference72). More recently, [case reports](../glossary#case-report) of the combined use of nicotinamide (25 mg/kg/day) and acetyl-L- [carnitine](../dietary-factors/L-carnitine) (50 mg/kg/day) in children at risk for type 1 diabetes showed promising results, warranting further investigation [(73)](#reference73). Niacin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) at [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) (i.e., doses much larger than those needed to prevent deficiency) have been used in an attempt to treat a range of conditions, some of which are discussed below. Congenital NAD deficiency-related disorders can result from [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in the uptake and transport of the various dietary NAD+ [precursors](../glossary#precursor) or in the distinct metabolic pathways leading to NAD+ production (see [Metabolism](#metabolism)). Some of these disorders might respond to niacin supplementation. For example, defective transport of tryptophan into cells results in [Hartnup disease](../glossary#hartnup-disease), which features signs of severe niacin deficiency [(74)](#reference74). Hartnup disease is due to mutations in the SLCA19 gene, which codes for a sodium-dependent neutral [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) transporter expressed primarily in the kidneys and intestine. Disease management involves supplementation with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide [(75)](#reference75). [Recessive mutations](../glossary#recessive-trait) in genes coding for [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) kynurenine pathway \u2014 namely kynureninase and 3-hydroxyanthranilic-acid \u2014 lead to combined Depletion of NAD+, rather than accumulation of intermediate [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) in the kynurenine pathway, was found to be responsible for these malformations. Niacin supplementation throughout pregnancy ensured adequate levels of NAD+ and prevented [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) in mice with kynurenine pathway mutations [(76)](#reference76). In humans, the dose of NAD+ precursors necessary to avert NAD deficiency-induced congenital VACTERL malformations has yet to be defined [(77)](#reference77). Nicotinamide may also rescue NAD+ depletion secondary to an ultra-rare inborn error of glutamine metabolism [(78)](#reference78). Glutamine is required for the conversion dinucleotide to NAD+ 2). Thus, inherited glutamine synthetase deficiency specifically affects the synthesis of NAD+ from the NAD+ precursors, tryptophan and nicotinic acid. If the combined deficiencies of glutamine and NAD+ are responsible for the severe clinical phenotype of subjects with inherited glutamine synthetase deficiency, it is likely that supplementation with both glutamine and nicotinamide would provide some relief [(78)](#reference78). Finally, many inborn errors of metabolism result from genetic mutations decreasing [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) binding affinity and, subsequently, enzyme efficiency [(79)](#reference79). In many cases, the administration of high doses of the [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) serving as precursors of cofactors can restore enzymatic activity \u2014 at least partially \u2014 and lessen signs of the genetic diseases [(79)](#reference79). Given the large number of enzymes requiring NAD, it is speculated that many of the conditions due to defective enzymes might be rescued by niacin supplementation [(5)](#reference5). Nicotinic acid is dense low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../glossary#LDL)) particles to large, buoyant LDL particles. All of these changes in the blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile are considered cardioprotective. Low concentrations of HDL-cholesterol are one major [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), and an increase in HDL concentrations is associated with a reduction of that risk [(80)](#reference80). Because of the adverse side effects associated with high doses of nicotinic acid (see [Safety](#safety)), nicotinic acid has most often been used in combination with other lipid-lowering medications at slightly lower doses [(17)](#reference17). In particular, low-dose nicotinic acid is often co-administered with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the cornerstone of treatment of [hyperlipidemia](../glossary#hyperlipidemia), a major risk factor for CHD. A [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 39 patients taking statins (cerivastatin, atorvastatin, or simvastatin) found that a very low dose of nicotinic acid (100 mg/day) increased HDL-cholesterol by only 2.1 mg/dL, and the combination had no effect on LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, or [triglyceride](../glossary#triglyceride) concentrations [(81)](#reference81). The Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol (ARBITER) 2 study \u2014 a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial \u2014 investigated the incremental effect of adding nicotinic acid (1 g/day) to statin therapy in 167 patients with known CHD and low HDL concentrations on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) [(82)](#reference82), a surrogate endpoint for the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis). The addition of extended-release nicotinic acid to simvastatin prevented the increase in CIMT compared to simvastatin [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy). A post-hoc analysis of data from ARBITER2 showed that the blockade of atherosclerotic progression was related to the increase in HDL concentrations in patients with normal glycemic status. However, in the presence of additional risk factors, such as impaired fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), the increase in HDL concentrations was not predictive of CIMT reduction and atherosclerotic retardation [(83)](#reference83). A comparative efficacy trial (ARBITER6) also showed a significant reduction of baseline CIMT with extended-release nicotinic acid (2 g/day for 14 months), as opposed to ezetimibe (a cholesterol-lowering drug), in patients taking statins [(84)](#reference84). Additional studies have examined the impact of nicotinic acid on endothelium-dependent brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients at risk of CHD or with established CHD. The measurement of FMD is often used as a surrogate marker of endothelial function; FMD values are [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of future cardiovascular events [(85)](#reference85). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including 441 participants, showed a significant, 2% increase with nicotinic acid (1-2 g/day) administered for 12 weeks to one year [(86)](#reference86). Several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, multicenter trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of nicotinic acid therapy, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents, on outcomes of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). Specifically, the Coronary Drug Project (CDP) followed over 8,000 men with a previous [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) for six years [(87)](#reference87). Compared to the placebo group, patients who took 3 g of immediate-release nicotinic acid daily experienced an average 10% reduction in total blood cholesterol, a 26% decrease in [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride), a 27% reduction in recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction, and a 10% reduction in total deaths with nicotinic acid treatment. The HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS), a three-year [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 patients with documented CHD and low HDL concentrations, found that a combination of simvastatin and nicotinic acid (2-3 g/day) increased HDL concentrations, inhibited the progression of coronary artery [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular ](../glossary#cardiovascular)events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, compared to placebo [(88)](#reference88). A subgroup analysis of the HATS patients with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) showed a reduction in rate of primary clinical events even though [glucose](../glossary#glucose) and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) were moderately impaired by nicotinic acid [(89)](#reference89). Moreover, a review of nicotinic acid safety and tolerability among the HATS subjects showed glycemic control in diabetic patients returned to pretreatment values following eight months of disease management with medication and diet [(90)](#reference90). Similarly, the cardiovascular benefit of long-term nicotinic acid therapy outweighed the modest increase in risk of newly onset type 2 diabetes in patients from the CDP study [(91)](#reference91). In contrast, the AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis intervention in metabolic syndrome with low HDL/high triglycerides: impact on global health outcomes) trial, which examined the incremental effect of extended-release nicotinic acid (1.5-2 g/day) on 3,414 patients who had [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia) and were treated with simvastatin (+/- ezetimibe), provided disappointing results. Indeed, in these patients who had achieved target concentrations of LDL-cholesterol (<70 mg/dL) before randomization, the HDL-raising effect of nicotinic acid treatment failed to reduce the number of cardiovascular events after a mean follow-up of three years [(92, 93)](#reference92). While some limitations, like a greater use of simvastatin and ezetimibe in the control group, may have [confounded](../glossary#confounder) the results, it was also suggested that low HDL-cholesterol might be a marker of risk rather than a causal risk factor for predicting CVD [(93)](#reference93). In addition, a post-hoc analysis of 505 participants with stage 3 chronic kidney disease found an increase in all-cause mortality in those randomized to nicotinic acid compared to those in the placebo group [(94)](#reference94). Although nicotinic acid failed to reduce the number of cardiovascular events in simvastatin-treated patients with low LDL-cholesterol, these results cannot be extrapolated to patients with higher LDL-cholesterol at baseline. A much larger multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial \u2014 the HPS2-THRIVE (Heart protection study 2: treatment of HDL to reduce the incidence of vascular events) trial \u2014 in 25,673 participants with vascular disease examined the incremental effect of extended-release nicotinic acid (2 g/day) and laropiprant (a prostaglandin D2 receptor-1 antagonist; 40 mg/day) on the incidence of vascular events. Compared to placebo, nicotinic acid/laropiprant reduced LDL-cholesterol by an average of 10 mg/dL, decreased triglycerides by 33 mg/dL, and increased HDL-cholesterol by 6 mg/dL after a median 3.9-year follow-up period. Nonetheless, nicotinic acid/laropiprant showed no effect on the incidence of major vascular events and death of any cause [(95)](#reference95). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 23 randomized controlled trials \u2014 including the CDP, AIM-HIGH, and HPS2-THRIVE trials \u2014 in 39,195 subjects with a history of vascular disease compared the effect of nicotinic acid alone or as an add-on to other lipid-lowering agents. No cardiovascular benefits were associated with nicotinic acid therapy: the number of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions and strokes was not decreased with nicotinic acid supplementation (median dose of 2 g/day for a median period of 11.5 months) [(96)](#reference96). Despite the lack of evidence for a role of nicotinic acid in CVD prevention [(96, 97)](#reference96), the use of nicotinic acid therapy has rapidly increased over the years in the US [(98)](#reference98). Friedreich's ataxia, a common form of inherited [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), is an early onset [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorder with clinical features that includes progressive ataxia, scoliosis, dysarthria, [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy), guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) expansions in the first intron of the [gene](../glossary#gene) FXN coding for the [protein](../glossary#protein) frataxin. These abnormal and unstable GAA repeats trigger gene silencing through heterochromatin formation, leading to significantly reduced frataxin expression [(100)](#reference100). Frataxin is a [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) protein needed for the making of iron-sulfur clusters (ISC). ISC-containing subunits are especially important for the mitochondrial [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) and for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing proteins localized in the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus), SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase that promotes gene silencing through heterochromatin formation. Nicotinamide has been shown to [antagonize](../glossary#antagonist) heterochromatization FXN locus and lymphoblastoid cells derived Friedreich's ataxia-affected patients, possibly through inhibiting SIRT1 activity [(100)](#reference100). In an open-label, dose escalating [pilot trial](../glossary#pilot-study) in 10 adult patients with Friedreich's ataxia, single and repeated doses of nicotinamide (2-8 g) for up to eight weeks were found to be well tolerated [(101)](#reference101). Repeated daily doses of 3.5 to 6 g of nicotinamide led to significant increases in frataxin concentration in peripheral white blood cells [(101)](#reference101). Yet, no [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) improvements were reported, suggesting that the duration of the treatment was too short and/or the nervous system of the participants was unresponsive to increases in frataxin [(102)](#reference102). To our knowledge, there is currently no ongoing trial designed to further investigate the effect of nicotinamide in Friedreich's ataxia-affected patients. The first step in the pathway is [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by the extrahepatic [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase which is responsible for the cleavage of tryptophan. The chronic stimulation of tryptophan oxidation, mediated by an increased activity of IDO and/or inadequate dietary niacin intakes, is observed with the infection of human immunodeficiency virus ( [HIV](../glossary#HIV)), the virus that causes ( [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS)). Interferon-gamma (IFN-) is a [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine) produced by cells of the immune system in response to infection. Through stimulating the enzyme IDO, IFN- increases the breakdown of tryptophan, thus supporting the finding that the average tryptophan concentration in blood is significantly lower in HIV patients compared to uninfected subjects [(40)](#reference40). An increased degradation of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway appears to coexist with intracellular niacin/NAD deficiency in HIV infection [(103)](#reference103). An explanatory model for these paradoxical observations incriminates the [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) induced by multiple nutrient deficiencies in HIV patients [(103)](#reference103). In particular, the activation of PARP enzymes (ARTDs) by [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to [DNA](../glossary#DNA) could be responsible for inducing niacin/NAD depletion (see [Function](#function)). The breakdown of tryptophan would then be a compensatory response to inadequate niacin/NAD levels. However, [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) derived from the oxidation of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway regulate specific T- [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) subgroups. As mentioned above, circulating IFN-, but also [viral](../glossary#virus) and [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) products, can activate IDO during HIV infection. The overstimulation of the tryptophan pathway has been involved in the loss of normal T-lymphocyte function, which characterizes HIV infection [(104, 105)](#reference104). The increased IDO activity has been linked to the altered immune response that contributes to the persistence of HIV [(104)](#reference104). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) only partially restores normal IDO activity, without normalizing it, yet induces viral suppression and CD4 T-cell recovery [(106)](#reference106). In a monkey model for HIV infection, a partial and transient blockade of IDO with IDO inhibitor 1-methyl tryptophan proved ineffective to reduce the viral load in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and intestinal tissues beyond the level achieved by ART [(107)](#reference107). At present, a better understanding of the role of kynurenine pathway and other NAD biosynthetic pathways during HIV infection is needed before the relevance and clinical implications of niacin supplementation in HIV treatment could be considered. Nonetheless, [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of nicotinic acid have been shown to be well tolerated in HIV patients with [hyperlipidemia](../glossary#hyperlipidemia) [(108)](#reference108). Abnormal [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles observed in patients have been attributed to the HIV infection and to the highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) [(109)](#reference109). Moreover, [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) has been ART-treated patients [(110)](#reference110). [Cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) is the second most frequent cause of deaths in the HIV population, and the rate of CVD is predicted to increase further as patients are living longer due to successful antiretroviral therapies. As for the general population, statin-based therapy appears to benefit HIV patients in terms of [atherogenic](../glossary#atherogenic) protection and CVD risk reduction, although contraindications exist due to drug interactions with ART. Other first-line treatments include lipid-lowering fibrates, which are preferred to nicotinic acid due to the increased risk of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance [(111)](#reference111). Nevertheless, an unblinded, controlled [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) showed that extended-release nicotinic acid (0.5-1.5 g/day for 12 weeks) could effectively improve endothelial function of the brachial artery in ART-treated HIV subjects with low [HDL](../glossary#HDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and no history of CVD [(112)](#reference112). In addition, combined treatment of fibrates, extended-release nicotinic acid (0.5-2 g/day), and lifestyle changes (low-fat diet and exercise) for 24 weeks was effective in normalizing lipid parameters in a cohort of 191 ART-treated patients. Increased risk of liver dysfunction was detected in subjects receiving both fibrates and niacin, but [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) was not affected by nicotinic acid treatment given alone or when combined with fibrates [(113)](#reference113). Another 24-week, [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), uncontrolled trial in 99 to extended-release nicotinic acid (0.5-2 g/day) or fenofibrates increased blood HDL-cholesterol but did not reduce inflammatory markers or improve endothelial function when compared to baseline [(114)](#reference114). [Schizophrenia](../glossary#schizophrenia) is a [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorder with unclear [etiology](../glossary#etiology) that is diagnosed purely from its clinical presentation. Because neurologic disorders associated with pellagra resemble acute schizophrenia, niacin-based therapy for the condition was investigated during the 1950s-70s (reviewed in [115](#reference115)). The [adjunctive](../glossary#adjunct-therapy) use of nutrients like niacin to correct deficiencies associated with neurologic symptoms is called orthomolecular psychiatry [(116)](#reference116). Such an approach has not been included in psychiatric practice; practitioners have instead relied solely on antipsychotic drugs to eliminate the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, recent scientific advances and new [hypotheses](../glossary#hypothesis) on the benefit of nutrient supplementation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders have suggested the re-assessment of orthomolecular medicine by the medical community [(117, 118)](#reference117). Skin flushing is one major side effect of the therapeutic use of nicotinic acid and the primary reason for non-adherence to treatment (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)). Flushing is caused by the activation of phospholipase A2, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that stimulates the production of a specific [lipid](../glossary#lipid) from the prostanoid family called [prostaglandin](../glossary#prostaglandin) D2. Prostaglandin D2, [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells of the skin and mucosa (i.e., the Langerhans cells), can induce the dilation of blood vessels and trigger a flushing response. Interestingly, patients with schizophrenia tend not to flush following treatment with nicotinic acid. This blunted skin flushing response suggests abnormal prostanoid signaling in schizophrenic patients [(119, 120)](#reference119). An association has been found between the altered niacin sensitivity and greater functional impairment in schizophrenic subjects [(121)](#reference121), which supports other findings suggesting that altered lipid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) could critically impair brain development and contribute to the disease [(122)](#reference122). Interestingly, blunted skin flushing responses are more [prevalent](../glossary#prevalent) in first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia than in the general population, suggesting that reduced niacin sensitivity is a heritable trait within affected families [(123)](#reference123). Good sources of niacin include yeast, meat, poultry, red fish (e.g., tuna, salmon), cereal (especially [fortified](../glossary#fortification) cereal), [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), and seeds. Milk, green leafy vegetables, [coffee](../food-beverages/coffee), and [tea](../food-beverages/tea) also provide some niacin [(124)](#reference124). In plants, especially mature cereal grains like corn and wheat, niacin may be bound to sugar molecules in the form of [glycosides](../glossary#glycoside), which significantly decrease its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(25)](#reference25). In the United States, the average dietary intake of niacin is about 30 mg/day for young adult men and 20 mg/day for young adult women. In a sample of adults over the age of 60, men and women were found to have an average dietary intake of 21 mg/day and 17 mg/day, respectively [(41)](#reference41). Some foods with substantial amounts of niacin are listed in Table 2, along with their niacin content in milligrams (mg). Food composition tables generally list niacin content without including niacin equivalents (NE) from tryptophan or any adjustment for niacin bioavailability. For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData Central database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/); data included in Table 2 are from this database [(125)](#reference125). |Food||Serving||Niacin (mg)| |Chicken (light meat, cooked canned, packed in the size of a deck of cards.| Niacin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are available as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid. Nicotinamide is the form of niacin typically used in nutritional supplements and in food [fortification](../glossary#fortification). Nicotinic acid is available over the counter and with a prescription as a [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering agent [(126)](#reference126). Nicotinic acid for anti- three formulations: immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid (absorption time, 1-2 hrs), acid (absorption time, 8-12 hrs), and sustained-release nicotinic (absorption time, >12 hrs) [(127)](#reference127). At the [pharmacologic dose](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) required for cholesterol-lowering effects, the use of nicotinic acid should be approached as if it were a drug (see [Safety](#safety)). Individuals should only undertake cholesterol-lowering therapy with nicotinic acid under the supervision of a qualified health care provider in order to minimize potentially adverse effects and maximize therapeutic benefits. Common side effects of nicotinic acid include flushing, [pruritus](../glossary#pruritus) (severe itching of the skin), skin rashes, and [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting [(97)](#reference97). Transient episodes of low blood pressure (hypotension) and headache have also been reported. Hepatotoxicity (liver cell damage), including elevated liver [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and [jaundice](../glossary#jaundice), has been observed at intakes as low as 750 mg/day of nicotinic acid [(128)](#reference128). Although [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis) has been observed with extended-release nicotinic acid at dosages as little as 500 mg/day for two months, almost all reports of severe hepatitis have been associated with doses of 3 to 9 g/day used to treat high [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) for months or years [(41)](#reference41). It is unclear whether immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid is less toxic to the liver than extended-release forms [(41)](#reference41). Yet, immediate-release nicotinic acid is often used at higher doses than extended-release forms, and severe liver toxicity has occurred in individuals who substituted extended-release nicotinic acid for immediate-release nicotinic acid at equivalent doses [(126)](#reference126). Large doses of nicotinic acid have been observed to [impair glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), likely because of a decrease in [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive). Impaired glucose tolerance in susceptible (pre-diabetic) individuals could result in elevated blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations and clinical type 2 diabetes mellitus. An analysis of the HPS2-THRIVE trial (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-treatment)), using data from 17,374 participants without type 2 diabetes at baseline, found a significantly higher proportion of newly diagnosed cases among those [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to nicotinic acid/laropiprant than to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) to nicotinic acid/laropiprant significantly increased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of serious disturbances in diabetes control (leading to hospitalization) compared to placebo among 8,299 participants with diabetes at baseline [(95)](#reference95). Elevated blood concentrations of [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid), occasionally resulting in attacks of [gout](../glossary#gout) in susceptible individuals, have also been observed with high-dose nicotinic acid therapy [(126)](#reference126). Niacin at doses of 1.5 to 5 g/day has resulted in a few [case reports](../glossary#case-report) of blurred vision and other eye problems, which have generally been reversible upon discontinuation [(41)](#reference41). People with abnormal liver function or a history of liver disease, diabetes, active [peptic ulcer disease](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease), gout, cardiac [arrhythmias](../health-disease/arrhythmia), [inflammatory bowel disease](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease), [migraine headaches](../glossary#migraine-headache), or alcoholism may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of excess niacin intake than the general population [(41)](#reference41). Nicotinamide is generally better tolerated than nicotinic acid; it does not generally cause flushing [(126)](#reference126). However, nausea, vomiting, and signs of liver toxicity (elevated liver [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), [jaundice](../glossary#jaundice)) have been observed at very high doses (10 g/day) [(126)](#reference126). A study in 12 healthy subjects found that nicotinamide riboside at three single doses (100 mg, 300 mg, and 1,000 mg) safely increased blood NAD+. Two of the participants self-reported skin flushing after taking the 300-mg dose, and two others reported feeling hot following intake of 1,000 mg of nicotinamide riboside [(1)](#references). In a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 120 healthy adults (ages, 60-80 years), daily supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (250 mg or 500 mg) and pterostilbene (a SIRT activator; 50 mg or 100 mg) for eight weeks showed a favorable side effect profile, with no evidence of higher incidence of adverse effects compared to placebo [(129)](#reference129). Most recently, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 40 obese men (ages, 40-70 years) found that daily supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (2,000 mg/day divided into two daily dosages) for 12 weeks was associated with reports of only minor side effects, including excessive sweating, [pruritus](../glossary#pruritus), and mild [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms like bloating [(139)](#reference139). Flushing of the skin primarily on the face, arms, and chest is a common side effect of nicotinic acid and may occur initially at doses as low as 30 mg/day. Although flushing from nicotinamide is rare, the Food and Nutrition Board set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) at 35 mg/day in adults to avoid the adverse effect of flushing [(41)](#reference41). Analysis of data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006 found that 15.8% of children and adolescents (ages 2-18 years) and 8.5% of adults (19 years) had total usual niacin intakes exceeding the UL [(130)](#reference130). The UL applies to the general population and is not meant to apply to individuals who are being treated with a nutrient under medical supervision (e.g., high-dose nicotinic acid for cholesterol of intake should be from food and formula only.| The occurrence of rhabdomyolysis is increased in patients treated with statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively uncommon condition in which muscle cells are broken down, releasing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and [electrolytes](../glossary#electrolyte) into the blood, and sometimes resulting in kidney failure [(131)](#reference131). Co-administration of nicotinic acid with a statin seems to enhance the [risk](../glossary#risk) of rhabdomyolosis [(132)](#reference132). A new drug, laropiprant, blocks nicotinic acid-induced flushing [(133)](#reference133). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial was designed to identify possible adverse effects of the niacin/laropiprant combination in over 25,000 simvastatin-treated subjects [(134)](#reference134). When added to the statin therapy, niacin/laropiprant increased the risk of [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy) and rhabdomyolosis, particularly in Asian subjects. It is possible that the niacin/laropiprant combination further reduces the poor tolerability to statin treatment observed in certain populations [(135)](#reference135). In the three-year, randomized controlled HATS study, concurrent therapy with [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) (1,000 mg/day of vitamin C, 800 IU/day of RRR--tocopherol, 100 \u00b5g/day of selenium, and 25 mg/day of -carotene) diminished the protective effects of the simvastatin-nicotinic acid combination [(136)](#reference136). Although the mechanism for these effects is not known, the benefit of concurrent antioxidant therapy in patients on lipid-lowering agents has been questioned [(137)](#reference137). Adverse effects of large doses of nicotinic acid may be exacerbated by the concomitant use of certain medications. The risk of [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy) may be further increased in those taking nicotinic acid and [bile acid](../glossary#bile-acids) and the risk of hepatotoxicity observed with nicotinic acid might be enhanced by drugs like paracetamol, amiodarone (Cordarone), or carbamazepine (Tegretol) [(35)](#reference35). In nicotinic acid may reduce [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid) [excretion](../glossary#excretion), thereby opposing the action of uricosuric agents like probenecid (Probalan) [(35)](#reference35). Several other medications may interact with niacin therapy or with absorption and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [(126)](#reference126). [Estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase the efficiency of niacin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) from tryptophan, resulting in a decreased dietary requirement for niacin [(138)](#reference138). Long-term administration of [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) agents has been reported to cause symptoms of pellagra; therefore, niacin supplementation may be needed (see [Pellagra causes](#pellagra)). The optimum intake of niacin for health promotion and [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) prevention is not yet known. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (16 mg NE/day for men and 14 mg NE/day for women) is easily obtainable by consuming a varied diet and should prevent deficiency in most people. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, containing 100% of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for niacin, will provide at least 20 mg of niacin daily.

Pantothenic acid is found throughout all branches of life in the form of [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) A, a vital coenzyme in numerous chemical reactions [(2)](#reference2). Pantothenic acid is a [precursor](../glossary#precursor) in the [biosynthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of coenzyme A (CoA) (Figure 1), an essential coenzyme in a variety of biochemical reactions that sustain life (see below). Pantothenic acid kinase II (PANKII) catalyzes the initial step of [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of pantothenic acid to 4'-phosphopantothenic acid. Coenzyme A and its derivatives inhibit the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of 4'-phosphopantothenic acid, but the inhibition can be reversed by [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), required for the transport of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) into the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) [(3)](#reference3). The subsequent reactions in this biosynthetic pathway include the synthesis of the intermediate 4'-phosphopantetheine, as well as the recycling of coenzyme A to 4'-phosphopantetheine (Figure 1). The 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety of coenzyme A can be transferred to [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in which 4'-phosphopantetheine is an essential [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for their biological activities (see [4'-phosphopantetheinylation](#phosphopantetheinylation)). Coenzyme A reacts with acyl groups, giving rise acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA. Coenzyme A and its acyl derivatives are required for reactions that generate energy from the degradation of dietary fat, [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), and [proteins](../glossary#protein). In addition, coenzyme A in the form of acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is involved in the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle), in the synthesis of essential fats, [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), [steroid](../glossary#steroid) [hormones](../glossary#hormone), vitamins A and D, the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) in the [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) - [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) pathway. Coenzyme A derivatives are also required for the synthesis of the hormone, melatonin, and for a component of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) called [heme](../glossary#heme). Further, [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of a number of drugs and toxins by the liver requires coenzyme A [(4)](#reference4). Coenzyme A was named for its role in [acetylation](../glossary#acetylation) reactions. Most acetylated proteins in the body have been modified by the addition of an acetate group that was donated by the coenzyme A thioester derivative, acetyl-CoA. Protein acetylation alters the overall charge of proteins, modifying their three-dimensional structure and, potentially, their function. For example, acetylation is a mechanism that regulates the activity of [peptide hormones](../glossary#peptide-hormone), including those produced by the [pituitary gland](../glossary#pituitary-gland) [(5)](#reference5). Also, protein acetylation, like other posttranslational modifications, has been shown to regulate the subcellular localization, the function, and the half-life of many [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules, [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor), and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Notably, the acetylation of [histones](../glossary#histone) plays a role in the regulation of [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) by facilitating [transcription](../glossary#translation) (i.e., [mRNA](../glossary#mRNA) synthesis), while deacetylated histones are usually associated with [chromatin](../glossary#chromatin) compaction and [gene](../glossary#gene) silencing. The acetylation of histones was found to result in structural changes of the chromatin, which affect both [DNA](../glossary#DNA)-protein and protein-protein interactions. Crosstalk between acetylation marks and other posttranscriptional modifications of the histones also facilitate the recruitment of transcriptional regulators to the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of genes that are subsequently transcribed (reviewed in [6](#reference6)). Finally, a number of signaling molecules are modified by the attachment of long-chain fatty acids donated by coenzyme A. These modifications are known as protein acylation and have central roles in [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways [(4)](#reference4). Specific multi- [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) complexes, which need to carry out several reactions in an orderly manner, may require the [covalent](../glossary#covalent-bond) attachment of a 4'-phosphopantetheine arm to a \"carrier\" domain (or [protein](../glossary#protein)). This carrier domain holds substrates or reaction intermediates during the progression through the various enzymatic reactions. In mammals, the transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety from coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue of a specific carrier domain is [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyze) by one unique phosphopantetheinyl transferase [(7)](#reference7). The 4'-phosphopantetheinylation is necessary for the conversion of apo-enzymes into fully active holo-enzymes (see below). [Lipids](../glossary#lipid) are fat molecules essential for normal physiological function and, among other types, include sphingolipids (essential components of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath that enhances nerve transmission), [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) (important structural components of [cell membranes)](../glossary#cell-membrane), and that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of fatty acids. Within the FAS complex, the acyl-carrier protein (ACP) requires pantothenic acid in the form of 4'-phosphopantetheine for its activity as a carrier protein [(3)](#reference3). A group, such as the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety for ACP, is called a prosthetic group; the prosthetic group is not composed of [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) and is a tightly bound [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) required for the biological activity of some [proteins](../glossary#protein) (Figure 2). Acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and ACP are all required for the synthesis of fatty acids in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol). During fatty acid synthesis, the acyl groups of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are transferred to the sulfhydryl group (-SH) of the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety of ACP. The prosthetic group is used as a flexible arm to transfer the growing fatty acid chain to each of the enzymatic centers of the type I FAS complex. In the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria), 4'-phosphopantetheine also serves as a prosthetic group for an ACP homolog present in mitochondrial type II FAS complex [(8)](#reference8). the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) and [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) (Figure 3). Similar to ACP, FDH requires a 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group for its biological activity. The prosthetic group acts as a swinging arm to couple the activities of the two catalytic domains of FDH [(9, 10)](#reference9). A homolog of FDH to be biologically active [(11)](#reference11). 4'-phosphopantetheinylation is required for -aminoadipate semialdehyde synthase (AASS). AASS [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the initial the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) pathway for the degradation of lysine \u2014 an essential [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) for humans. AASS is made of two catalytic domains. The lysine-ketoglutarate reductase domain first catalyzes the conversion of lysine to saccharopine. Saccharopine is further converted to -aminoadipate semialdehyde in a reaction catalyzed by the saccharopine dehydrogenase domain (Figure 4). Naturally occurring pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is very rare and has been observed only in cases of severe malnutrition. World War II prisoners in the Philippines, Burma, and Japan experienced numbness and painful burning and tingling in their feet; these symptoms were relieved specifically by pantothenic acid supplementation [(4)](#reference4). Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans has been induced experimentally by co-administering a pantothenic acid kinase and a pantothenic acid-deficient diet. Participants in this experiment complained of headache, fatigue, insomnia, intestinal disturbances, and numbness and tingling of their hands and feet [(12)](#reference12). In another study, participants fed only a pantothenic acid-free diet did not develop clinical signs of deficiency, although some appeared listless and complained of fatigue [(13)](#reference13). Calcium homopantothenate (or hopantenate) is a pantothenic acid [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) with [cholinergic](../glossary#cholinergic) effects (i.e., similar to those of the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter), acetylcholine). This compound is used in Japan to enhance mental function, especially in [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease). A rare side effect was the development of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition of abnormal brain function resulting from the failure of the liver to eliminate toxins. The encephalopathy was reversed by pantothenic acid supplementation, suggesting that it was due to homopantothenate-induced pantothenic acid deficiency [(14)](#reference14). Of note, genetic [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the human [gene](../glossary#gene) PANKII, which codes for pantothenic acid kinase II (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above), result in impaired [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of 4'-phosphopantetheine and A (see [Function](#function)). The disorder, called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, is characterized by visual and intellectual impairments, dystonia, speech abnormalities, behavioral difficulties, and personality disorders [(15)](#reference15). Yet, because pantothenic acid is widely distributed in nature and deficiency is extremely rare in humans, most information regarding the consequences of deficiency has been gathered from experimental research in animals (reviewed in [3](#reference3)). Pantothenic acid-deficient rats developed damage to the [adrenal glands](../glossary#adrenal-glands), while monkeys developed [anemia](../glossary#anemia) due to decreased synthesis of [heme](../glossary#heme), a component of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin). Dogs with pantothenic acid deficiency developed low blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose), rapid breathing and heart rates, and convulsions. Chickens developed skin irritation, feather abnormalities, and spinal nerve damage associated with the degeneration of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath. Pantothenic acid-deficient mice showed decreased exercise tolerance and diminished storage of glucose (in the form of [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen)) in muscle and liver. Mice also developed skin irritation and graying of the fur, which is reversed by pantothenic acid administration. The diversity of symptoms emphasizes the numerous functions of pantothenic acid in its [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) forms. Because there was little information on the requirements of pantothenic acid in humans, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine set an adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) based on observed dietary intakes in healthy of calcium D-pantothenate and/or pantothenol (Figure 5) to the medium of cultured skin [fibroblasts](../glossary#fibroblast) given an artificial wound was found to increase cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and migration, thus accelerating wound healing [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(17, 18)](#reference17). Likewise, in vitro deficiency in pantothenic acid induced the expression of [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) markers in proliferating skin fibroblasts and inhibited proliferation in human [keratinocytes](../glossary#keratinocyte) [(19)](#reference19). The application of ointments containing either calcium D-pantothenate or pantothenol \u2014 also known as D-panthenol or dexpanthenol \u2014 to the skin has been shown to accelerate the closure of skin wounds and increase the strength of scar tissue in animals [(3)](#reference3). The effects of dexpanthenol on wound healing are unclear. In a [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study that included 12 healthy volunteers, the application of dexpanthenol-containing ointment (every 12 hours for 1 to 6 days) in a model of skin wound healing was associated with an enhanced expression of markers of proliferation, [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and tissue repair [(20)](#reference20). However, the study failed to report whether these changes in response to [topical](../glossary#topical) dexpanthenol improved the wound-repair process compared to placebo [(20)](#reference20). Some studies have shown no effects. Early [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in patients undergoing surgery for tattoo removal found that daily co-supplementation with 1 gram or 3 grams of vitamin C and 200 mg or 900 mg of pantothenic acid for 21 days did not significantly improve the wound-healing process [(21, 22)](#reference21). Yet, in a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), study, the use of dexpanthenol pastilles (300 mg/day for up to 14 days post surgery) was found to accelerate mucosal healing after tonsillectomy in children [(23)](#reference23). Early studies suggested that [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of pantethine, a pantothenic acid derivative, might have a [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering effect [(24, 25)](#reference24). Pantethine is made of two molecules of pantetheine joined by a disulfide bond (chemical bond between two molecules of sulfur) (Figure 5). Pantethine is structurally related to coenzyme A and is found in the prosthetic group that is required for the biological function of acyl-carrier protein, formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, pantethine (600 mg/day for 8 weeks, followed by 900 mg/day for another 8 weeks) significantly improved the profile of [lipid](../glossary#lipid) parameters in 120 individuals at low-to-moderate risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). After adjusting to baseline, pantethine was found to be significantly more effective than placebo in lowering the concentrations of [low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol](../glossary#LDL) (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB), as well ratio of [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) to [high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol](../glossary#HDL) (TG:HDL-C) [(26)](#reference26). Although it appears to be well tolerated and potentially beneficial in improving cholesterol [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), pantethine is not a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), and the decision to use pharmacologic doses of pantethine to treat elevated blood cholesterol or triglycerides should only be made in collaboration with a qualified health care provider who provides appropriate follow up. Mice that are deficient in pantothenic acid developed skin irritation and graying of the fur, which is reversed by pantothenic acid administration. In humans, there is no evidence that taking pantothenic acid as [supplements](../glossary#supplement) or using shampoos containing pantothenic acid can prevent or restore hair color. Pantothenic acid is available in a variety of foods, usually as a component of coenzyme A (CoA) and 4'-phosphopantetheine (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). Upon ingestion, dietary coenzyme A and phosphopantetheine are [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) to pantothenic acid prior to intestinal absorption [(3)](#reference3). Animal liver and kidney, fish, shellfish, pork, chicken, egg yolk, milk, yogurt, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), mushrooms, avocados, broccoli, and sweet potatoes are good sources of pantothenic acid. [Whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains) are also good sources of pantothenic acid, but processing and refining grains may result in a 35 to 75% loss. Freezing and canning of foods result in similar losses [(16)](#reference16). Large national, nutritional surveys failed to estimate pantothenic acid intake, mainly because of the scarcity of data on the pantothenic acid content of food [(16)](#reference16). Smaller studies estimated average daily intakes of pantothenic acid to be between 4 and 7 mg/day in adults. Table 2 lists some rich sources of pantothenic acid, along with their content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content of foods, search [USDA's FoodData of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| The [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally colonize the [colon](../glossary#colon) (large intestine) are capable of [synthesizing](../glossary#synthesis) pantothenic acid. A specialized transporter for the uptake of [biotin](biotin) and pantothenic acid was identified in cultured cells derived from the lining of the colon, suggesting that humans may be able to absorb pantothenic acid and biotin produced by intestinal bacteria [(27)](#reference27). However, the extent to which bacterial synthesis contributes to pantothenic acid intake in humans is not known [(28)](#reference28). [Supplements](../glossary#supplement) commonly contain pantothenol (panthenol), a stable alcohol [analog](../glossary#analog) of pantothenic acid, which can be rapidly converted to pantothenic acid by humans. Calcium and sodium D-pantothenate, the [calcium](../minerals/calcium) and [sodium](../minerals/sodium) salts of pantothenic acid, are also available as supplements. Pantethine is used as a [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering agent in Japan and is available in the US as a dietary supplement [(29)](#reference29). Pantothenic acid is not known to be toxic in humans. The only adverse effect noted was diarrhea resulting from very high intakes of 10 to 20 g/day of calcium D-pantothenate [(30)](#reference30). of life-threatening eosinophilic pleuropericardial effusion in an elderly woman who took a combination of 10 mg/day of [biotin](biotin) and 300 mg/day of pantothenic acid for two months [(31)](#reference31). Due to the lack of reports of adverse effects when the Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRI](../glossary#DRI)) for pantothenic acid were established in 1998, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for pantothenic acid [(16)](#reference16). Pantethine is generally well tolerated in doses up to 1,200 mg/day. However, [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects, such as nausea and heartburn, have been reported [(29)](#reference29). Also, [topical](../glossary#topical) formulations containing up to 5% of dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) have been safely used for up to one month. Yet, a few cases of skin irritation, contact [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis), and eczema have been reported with the use of dexpanthenol-containing ointments [(32, 33)](#reference32). Large doses of pantothenic acid have the potential to compete with [biotin](biotin) for intestinal and cellular uptake by the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) [(27](#reference27), [34)](#reference34). Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) containing [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and progestin may increase the requirement for pantothenic acid [(30)](#reference30). Use of pantethine in combination with cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) or with nicotinic acid (see the article on [Niacin](niacin)) may produce additive effects on blood [lipids](../glossary#lipid) [(29)](#reference29). More data are needed to define the amount of dietary pantothenic acid required to promote optimal health or prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation by the Food and Nutrition Board of 5 mg/day of pantothenic acid for adults. A varied diet should provide enough pantothenic acid for most people. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) that contains 100% of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for pantothenic acid will ensure an intake of at least 5 mg/day. There is currently little evidence that older adults differ in their intake of or their requirement for pantothenic acid. Most [multivitamin/mineral supplements](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) provide at least 5 mg/day of pantothenic acid.

Riboflavin is primarily found as an integral component of the that use a flavocoenzyme are called flavoproteins [(2)](#reference2). Living organisms derive most of their energy from [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) reactions, which are processes that involve the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron). Flavocoenzymes participate in redox reactions in numerous metabolic pathways They are critical for the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), [lipids](../glossary#lipid), and [proteins](../glossary#protein). FAD is part of the [electron transport (respiratory) chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain), which is central to energy production. In conjunction with [cytochrome P-450](../glossary#cytochrome-P450), flavocoenzymes also participate in the metabolism of toxins [(4)](#reference4). Glutathione reductase is a FAD-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) cycle of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione). The glutathione redox cycle plays a major role in protecting organisms from [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), such as hydroperoxides. Glutathione reductase requires FAD to regenerate two molecules of reduced glutathione from oxidized glutathione. Riboflavin deficiency has been associated with increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) [(4)](#reference4) Measurement of glutathione reductase activity in red blood cells is commonly used assess riboflavin nutritional [status](../glossary#status) [(5)](#reference5). Glutathione peroxidases (GPx), [selenium](../minerals/selenium)-containing enzymes, reduced glutathione to break down hydroperoxides. GPx are involved in the [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid). Uric acid is one of the most effective water-soluble [ antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) in the blood. Riboflavin deficiency can result in decreased xanthine oxidase activity, reducing blood uric acid levels [(6)](#reference6). Riboflavin (as FAD or FMN) is required for the synthesis of [niacin](niacin) from tryptophan, and in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [vitamin B6](vitamin-B6) and [iron](../minerals/iron). It is also essential for folate and related [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism, where FAD is required as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a key folate-metabolizing enzyme. B6](vitamin-B6), riboflavin [status](../glossary#status) can affect several [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) systems. The conversion of vitamin B6 to its active [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) form in Human studies have provided evidence of the metabolic dependency of vitamin B6 on riboflavin status in older [(8-10)](#reference8) and younger [(10)](#reference10) adults. The [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the NAD 3-monooxygenase. deficiency can thus decrease the conversion of tryptophan to NAD and NADP, increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) is enzyme plays a key role in [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism by catalyzing the reduction of 5,10 methyleneTHF to 5 methylTHF. Once formed, 5 methylTHF is used by methionine synthase for the vitamin B12-dependent conversion of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) to methionine and the formation of THF (Figure 2). Both FMN and FAD are coenzymes for the enzyme methionine synthase reductase, which is responsible for the regeneration of methylcobalamin, the biologically active form of vitamin B12 acting as a coenzyme for methionine synthase [(11)](#reference11). Along with other B vitamins vitamin B12, and vitamin B6), higher dietary riboflavin intakes have been associated with lower [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of homocysteine [(12)](#reference12). In individuals [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) in the MTHFR [gene](../glossary#gene), low riboflavin status is associated with elevated plasma homocysteine, and in turn linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and other [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) [(13, 14)](#reference13). Furthermore, supplementation with riboflavin results in marked lowering of homocysteine concentrations specifically in individuals with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype [(15)](#reference15). Such results illustrate that chronic disease risk may be influenced by complex interactions between genetic and dietary factors. Riboflavin deficiency alters [iron](../minerals/iron) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). Although the mechanism is not clear, research in animals suggests that riboflavin deficiency may impair iron absorption, increase intestinal loss of iron, and/or impair iron utilization for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) [(16)](#reference16). In humans, low dietary intake of riboflavin has been associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for [anemia](../glossary#anemia) [(17)](#reference17), and improving riboflavin nutritional [status](../glossary#status) has been found to increase circulating hemoglobin levels [(18)](#reference18). Correction of riboflavin deficiency in individuals who are both riboflavin and iron deficient improves the response of iron-deficiency anemia to iron therapy [(19)](#reference19). Anemia during pregnancy, a worldwide public health problem, is responsible for considerable perinatal morbidity and mortality [(20, 21)](#reference20). The management of maternal anemia typically involves [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with iron alone or iron in combination with folic acid [(22)](#reference22). It is possible that the inclusion of riboflavin could enhance the effects of iron-folic acid supplementation in treating maternal anemia, but the evidence is limited. There are, however, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) conducted in pregnant women with anemia in Southeast Asia showing that a combination of folic acid, iron, [vitamin A](vitamin-A), and riboflavin improved hemoglobin levels and decreased anemia compared to iron-folic acid supplementation alone [(23, 24)](#reference23). Ariboflavinosis is the medical name for clinical riboflavin deficiency, which occurs commonly in low- and middle-income countries. Riboflavin deficiency is rarely found in isolation; it typically occurs in combination with deficiencies of other water-soluble [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin). Clinical signs of riboflavin deficiency include sore throat, redness and swelling of the lining of the mouth and throat, cracks or sores on the outsides of the lips (cheliosis) and at the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and redness of the tongue (magenta tongue), and a moist, scaly skin inflammation (seborrheic dermatitis). Other signs may involve the formation of blood vessels in the clear covering of the eye ( [vascularization](../glossary#vascularization) of the [cornea](../glossary#cornea)) and decreased red blood cell count in which the existing red blood cells contain normal levels of hemoglobin and are of normal size (normochromic normocytic [anemia](../glossary#anemia)) [(1, 3)](#references). Subclinical deficiency (low [status](../glossary#status)) of without clinical signs may be widespread, including in high-income countries, but usually goes undetected because riboflavin [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) are very rarely measured in human studies. Low or deficient riboflavin status may result in decreased conversion of vitamin B6 to its active [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) form (PLP) and decreased conversion of tryptophan to [niacin](niacin) (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). [Preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) is defined as the presence of elevated blood pressure, protein in the urine, and [edema](../glossary#edema) (significant swelling) during pregnancy. About 5% of women with preeclampsia progress to [eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia), a significant cause of maternal and fetal death. Eclampsia is characterized by seizures, in addition to high blood pressure and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (severe bleeding) [(25)](#reference25). A study in 154 pregnant women at increased risk of preeclampsia found that those who were riboflavin deficient were 4.7 times more likely to develop preeclampsia than those who had adequate riboflavin nutritional status [(26)](#reference26). The cause of preeclampsia-eclampsia is not known. Decreased intracellular levels of flavocoenzymes could cause [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction, increase [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and interfere with [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) release and thus blood vessel dilation - all of these changes have been associated with preeclampsia [(26)](#reference26). A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 54 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found that the MTHFR C677T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, especially in Caucasian and Asian populations [(27)](#reference27). The reduction in the flavoprotein MTHFR activity observed in individuals with the variant MTHFR 677TT [genotype](../glossary#genotype) leads to an increase in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) higher homocysteine concentrations [(28)](#reference28). One [small randomized controlled](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) trial in 450 pregnant women in West Africa, without specified MTHFR genotype but at high risk for preeclampsia, found that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 15 mg of riboflavin daily was not effective in preventing the condition [(29)](#reference29), but the study was likely underpowered to detect a significant effect. Further studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of riboflavin supplementation in reducing [perinatal](../glossary#perinatal) complications generally and specifically in preeclamptic women with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Alcoholics are at an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of riboflavin deficiency, likely due to decreased dietary intake, decreased absorption, and/or impaired utilization of riboflavin. Interestingly, the elevated blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations associated with riboflavin deficiency rapidly decline during alcohol withdrawal [(30)](#reference30). Additionally, people with anorexia rarely consume adequate dietary riboflavin, and those who are lactose intolerant are unlikely to meet requirements due to the avoidance of dairy products, the major dietary sources of riboflavin. The conversion of riboflavin into the active [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) forms FAD and FMN is impaired in [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) and [adrenal](../glossary#adrenal-glands) insufficiency [(3, 4)](#reference3). Further, people who are very active physically (athletes, laborers) may have slightly increased riboflavin requirements. However, riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) has not generally been found to increase exercise tolerance or performance [(31)](#reference31) unless the individuals are riboflavin deficient [(32)](#reference32). The [ RDA](../glossary#RDA) for riboflavin, revised in 1998, is based on the prevention of deficiency (Table 1). Clinical signs of deficiency in humans appear at intakes of less than 0.5 to 0.6 milligrams (mg)/day, and urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of riboflavin is seen are the leading cause of visual disability in the US and other developed countries. Research has focused on the role of nutritional [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) because of evidence that light-induced [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) of [lens](../glossary#lens) proteins may lead to the development of age-related cataracts. A [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) found significantly decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of age-related cataracts (33% to 51%) in men and women in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of dietary riboflavin intake (median of 1.6 to 2.2 mg/day) compared to those in the lowest quintile (median of 0.08 mg/day in both men and women) [(33)](#reference33). Another case-control study reported that individuals in the highest quintile of riboflavin [status](../glossary#status), as measured by red blood cell glutathione reductase activity, had approximately one-half the occurrence of age-related cataract as those in the lowest quintile of riboflavin status, though the results were not statistically significant [(34)](#reference34). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 2,900 Australian men and women, 49 years of age and older, found that those in the highest quintile of riboflavin intake were 50% less likely to have cataracts than those in the lowest quintile [(35)](#reference35). A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of more than 50,000 women did not observe a difference between rates of cataract extraction between women in the highest quintile of riboflavin intake (median of 1.5 mg/day) and women in the lowest quintile (median of 1.2 mg/day) [(36)](#reference36). However, the range between the highest and lowest quintiles was small, and median intake levels for both quintiles were above the [RDA](#RDA) for riboflavin. A study in 408 women found that higher dietary intakes of riboflavin were [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with a lens [(37)](#reference37). A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) using a fractional factorial design showed that compared with [placebo](../glossary#placebo), the combined supplementation with riboflavin (3 mg/day) and niacin (40 mg/day) for five to six years reduced the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of nuclear cataract but increased the progression of posterior subcapsular cataracts in population affected by multiple nutrient deficiency living in rural China [(38)](#reference38). Of note is that the results of this trial are somewhat conflicting, and the study design does not allow the effects of riboflavin and niacin to be differentiated. In summary, there is some evidence predominantly from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), that suggests higher riboflavin status might be beneficial; however, more evidence from well-designed, randomized controlled trials is needed to confirm a role for riboflavin in the prevention of cataracts. The flavoprotein, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase plays converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to re-methylation of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) to [methionine](../glossary#methionine) (see [Figure 2](#figure-2) above). The conversion of homocysteine to methionine is of importance for homocysteine detoxification and for the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for the [methylation](../glossary#methylation) of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [histones](../glossary#histone). Folate deficiency and elevated homocysteine concentrations may [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) (see the article on [Folate](folate#cancer-prevention)). Aberrant methylation changes are also known to alter the structure and function of DNA and histones during cancer development [(39)](#reference39). Since MTHFR controls the detoxification of homocysteine and the supply of methyl groups for SAM synthesis, a reduction in its activity can affect homocysteine metabolism and disturb cellular methylation processes. The substitution of a cytosine by a thymine in position 677 (c.677C>T) in the MTHFR [gene](../glossary#gene) is a [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) that affects the binding of FAD and leads to an increased propensity for MTHFR to lose its flavin exhibit reduced MTHFR activity and increased risk for a wide variety of cancers [(41-43)](#reference41), but the evidence of an association between this polymorphism and cancer is inconsistent, with some reports suggesting a reduction in [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) risk with the T [allele](../glossary#allele) [(44)](#reference44). As mentioned above (see [B-complex vitamins](#B-complex-vitamins)), riboflavin intake is a determinant of homocysteine concentration. This suggests that riboflavin [status](../glossary#status) can influence MTHFR activity and the metabolism of folate, thereby affecting cancer risk [(43)](#reference43). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, 93 subjects with colorectal [polyps](../glossary#polyp) and 86 healthy subjects were given a placebo, folic acid (400 or 1,200 g/day), or folic acid (400 g/day) plus riboflavin (5 mg/day) for 45 days. These interventions significantly improved folate and riboflavin status in [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin)- [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) individuals compared to those taking the placebo. Interestingly, riboflavin enhanced the effect of 400 g folic acid on circulating 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) specifically in the polyp patients with the C677T genetic variant [(45)](#reference45). This suggests that riboflavin may improve the response to folic acid supplementation in individuals with a reduced MTHFR activity. Additionally, a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 88,045 postmenopausal women found total (dietary plus supplemental) intake of riboflavin to be [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with colorectal cancer risk when comparing the highest (>3.97 mg) and lowest (<1.80 mg) [quartiles](../glossary#quartile) of daily intake [(46)](#reference46); intake in the reference group was well above the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for riboflavin of 1.1 mg/day. The subjects in this study were not prescreened to identify those with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype, and the association between this polymorphism and colorectal cancer remains unclear, with some reports suggesting a reduction in cancer risk with the T allele [(44)](#reference44). Two [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) have found inverse associations between riboflavin intake and risk of colorectal cancer [(47, 48)](#reference47). The most recent of these was a dose-response meta-analysis that pooled results from five prospective cohort studies, nine [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), and two studies reporting blood concentrations of riboflavin. This analysis found that higher intakes of riboflavin were associated with a significantly lower risk of colorectal cancer ( [RR](../glossary#relative-risk)=0.87; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval), 0.81-0.93); inverse associations were observed for both dietary riboflavin intake and total daily intake from the diet and supplements [(48)](#reference48). Associations between riboflavin intake and cancer risk have also been evaluated in other types of cancer. A seven-year [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) evaluated the use of riboflavin-fortified salt in 22,093 individuals at high risk for [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) cancer in China. Riboflavin status and esophageal [pathology](../glossary#pathology) (percent normal, dysplastic, and cancerous tissues) improved in the intervention group compared to the control group, but the lower incidence of esophageal cancer found in the intervention group was not statistically significant [(49)](#reference49). Additionally, a 25-year follow up of an intervention trial in patients at high risk for gastric cancer found that dietary supplementation with riboflavin (3.2 mg/day) and niacin (40 mg/day) for five years decreased the risk of mortality from esophageal cancer by 8% but had no effect on mortality from [gastric cancer](../health-disease/stomach-cancer) [(50)](#reference50). In the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, which followed 41,514 men and women over a 15-year period, weak inverse associations were found between riboflavin intake and lung cancer [(51)](#reference51) and breast cancer [(52)](#reference52); no association of riboflavin intake with [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer was observed in this cohort [(53)](#reference53). A 2017 meta-analysis of 10 observational studies found an overall inverse association of riboflavin intake and breast cancer incidence and reported a 6% lower risk with each 1 mg/day increment of riboflavin intake [(54)](#reference54). Further, studies to date have not found riboflavin intake or measures of riboflavin status to be associated with renal cell carcinoma, as reviewed in a recent meta-analysis [(55)](#reference55). Some evidence indicates that impaired [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) oxygen [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in the brain may play a role in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of [migraine headaches](../glossary#migraine-headache). Since riboflavin is the [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of the two flavocoenzymes (FAD and FMN) required by flavoproteins of the mitochondrial [electron transport chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain), [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) riboflavin has been investigated as a treatment for migraine. A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examined the effect of very high dose riboflavin (400 mg/day) for three months on migraine prevention in 54 men and women with a history of recurrent migraine headaches [(56)](#reference56). Riboflavin compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) reduced attack frequency and the number of headache days, though the beneficial effect was most pronounced during the third month of treatment [(56)](#reference56). Another study by the same investigators found that treatment with either a -blocker drug or high-dose riboflavin (400 mg/day) for four months resulted in clinical improvement, but each therapy appeared to act on a distinct pathological mechanism: -blockers on abnormal cortical information processing and riboflavin on decreased brain mitochondrial energy reserve [(57)](#reference57). A small study in 23 patients reported a reduction in median migraine attack frequency after supplementation with 400 mg of riboflavin daily for three months [(58)](#reference58). A single-blinded, randomized, parallel group trial in 85 patients with migraine headaches (ages 15-55 years), high-dose riboflavin supplementation (400 mg/day) for 12 weeks decreased migraine frequency, duration, and severity compared to baseline and was as effective as sodium valproate (500 mg/day) [(59)](#reference59), a medication with established efficacy in migraine preventative therapy [(60)](#reference60). Riboflavin elicited significantly fewer adverse effects compared to the drug [(59)](#reference59). Thus, although the available trials have been small and short term, most studies to date suggest that high-dose riboflavin supplementation might be a useful [adjunct therapy](../glossary#adjunct-therapy) in adults with migraine headaches. A few randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of riboflavin supplementation on the frequency and severity of headache attacks in children with migraines. An initial study evaluated riboflavin at 200 mg/day for 12 weeks in 48 children of ages 5 to 15 years old [(61)](#reference61). A second study was a [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) with half of the 42 children, ages 6 to 13, receiving 50 mg/day riboflavin for 16 weeks then placebo (100 mg/day carotene) for 16 weeks (with a four-week washout period in between each), while the other half were first given the placebo then riboflavin [(62)](#reference62). Neither study showed differences in the frequency, duration, or intensity of migraines between treatments. However, a more recent trial found a benefit of intervention with higher dose riboflavin: children with migraine treated with 400 mg/day of riboflavin for 12 weeks (n=30) had reductions in migraine frequency and duration, but not intensity, compared to placebo (n=30), yet no benefit was seen in children taking 200 mg/day for 12 weeks in this study [(63)](#reference63). Additionally, a randomized controlled trial in 98 adolescents, ages 12 to 19 years, found that 400 mg/day of riboflavin for three months decreased both headache frequency and duration and improved migraine-related disability compared to placebo [(64)](#reference64). [Retrospective studies](../glossary#retrospective-study) of children and adolescents suffering from migraine have also suggested some benefit associated with supplemental riboflavin [(65-67)](#reference65). Thus, studies to date are somewhat conflicting, and more research is needed to understand whether riboflavin supplementation might have utility in the treatment of childhood migraine and the most effective dose required for any beneficial effects. Increasing evidence from [case reports](../glossary#case-report) indicates that patients with [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorders caused defective FAD-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) could benefit from riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement). MADD, also known acidemia), is a [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) disorder characterized by the accumulation of short-, medium-, and long-chain acyl- [carnitines](../glossary#carnitine) in various tissues. MADD is classified into three separate types based on age of onset and clinical symptoms: type I MADD is evident in the neonatal period and is characterized by the presence of [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly); type II MADD is present in the neonatal period but lacks congenital defects; and type III is characterized by late onset, from infancy through adulthood [(68)](#reference68), and even as late as the seventh decade of life [(69)](#reference69). Clinical symptoms of type I and II MADD present shortly after birth and include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, metabolic acidosis, hepatomegaly, and respiratory distress [(68](#reference68), [70)](#reference70); these forms of MADD are often fatal in infancy, even if treated. Type III MADD usually presents later in life and includes milder symptoms, varying from periodic vomiting, rhabdomyolysis, muscle pain and weakness, and exercise intolerance [(68](#reference68), [70)](#reference70). [Peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy) has also recently been reported as a symptom of adult-onset MADD [(71)](#reference71). MADD is caused by [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [genes](../glossary#gene) that impair the activity of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron) from acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to [coenzyme (Figure ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH code for the two subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF-A and -B) and for ETF dehydrogenase/ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFDH/ETFQO), respectively. Deficiencies in these enzymes (ETF or ETFDH) lead to a decrease in oxidized FAD, which becomes unavailable for FAD-dependent dehydrogenation reactions, including the first step in -oxidation - a major fatty acid [catabolic](../glossary#catabolism) process that takes place in the mitochondria. A defect in fatty acid -oxidation causes [lipid](../glossary#lipid) accumulation in skeletal muscles, leading to lipid storage [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy) characterized by muscle pain and weakness and exercise intolerance. Together with a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) has led to significant clinical improvements in patients with ETFDH mutations. The specific type of the mutation in ETF/ETFDH contributes to age of onset, severity, and responsiveness to riboflavin treatment [(70](#reference70), [72)](#reference72). Additionally, the report of a 20-year-old man with riboflavin-responsive MADD failed to find mutations in ETF and ETFDH genes, suggesting that other sites of mutation should not be excluded [(73)](#reference73). Finally, secondary deficiencies in the respiratory chain are observed in MADD and appear to respond favorably to riboflavin supplementation [(72](#reference72), FAD-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) with important roles in both the [electron transport -oxidation of ACAD9 [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for ACAD9 have been found in patients with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a respiratory chain disorder [(75)](#reference75). Complex I carries [electrons](../glossary#electron) from NADH to [coenzyme Q10](../dietary-factors/coenzyme-Q10) Defective oxidative phosphorylation ( [ATP](../glossary#ATP) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by the respiratory chain) due to complex I deficiency has been linked to a broad variety of clinical manifestations, from neonatal death to late-onset [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease). The clinical symptoms of complex I deficiency due to ACAD9 mutations typically include muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, lactic acidosis, and [hypertrophic](../glossary#hypertrophy) [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) [(76)](#reference76). However, symptoms can be of varying severity, likely due to the remaining functional activity of ACAD9. For example, affected patients have been reported to exhibit a spectrum of cardiac deficits, including isolated, mild ventricular has been shown to increase complex I activity in patients with childhood-onset clinical forms of ACAD9 deficiency. Improvements in muscle strength and exercise tolerance have also been associated with riboflavin supplementation [(78-80)](#reference78). A review of cases of ACAD9 deficiency presenting in infancy (i.e., cases with severe symptoms) found riboflavin treatment to be associated with improved survival: 7 of 22 patients treated with riboflavin succumbed to the illness compared to 16 out of 17 untreated patients [(76)](#reference76). SLC52A1, SLC52A2, and SLC52A3 [genes](../glossary#gene) RFVT1, RFVT2, and RFVT3, respectively. [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in these genes lead to riboflavin transporter deficiency, a rare [neurodegenerative](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) condition with variable age of onset, from infancy to early stages of adulthood. [Autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 respectively cause disorders known as riboflavin transporter deficiency type 2 (RFVT2 deficiency) and riboflavin transporter deficiency type 3 (RFVT3 deficiency). These genetic disorders were formerly called Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and Fazio-Londe syndrome [(81)](#reference81). Riboflavin transporter deficiency caused by mutation of SLC52A1 is exceedingly rare and has been reported in only three cases (reviewed in [82](#reference82)). Clinical features of riboflavin transporter deficiency can include muscle weakness in the arms and legs, sensory [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), bulbar palsy with hypotonia and High-dose, oral supplementation with riboflavin improves many of these symptoms in the majority of affected patients; such treatment should be given at the time of suspected riboflavin transporter deficiency for a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) [(84)](#reference84). A 2016 review of the published literature found that oral supplementation with riboflavin - at doses ranging from 7 to 60 mg/kg/day - led to improved symptoms in 71% of the patients (n=39) and to no deaths [(83)](#reference83). In contrast, all of the untreated patients (n=31) had a progression of the disease and a mortality rate of at least 48% [(83)](#reference83). Primary [trimethylaminuria](../glossary#trimethylaminuria) is caused by defective [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of trimethylamine by a liver flavoprotein called flavin containing mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO3). Individuals with FMO3 deficiency have increased levels of trimethylamine in urine, sweat, and breath [(85)](#reference85). This socially distressing condition is known as \"fish odor syndrome\" due to the fishy odor and volatile nature of trimethylamine. FMO3 [gene](../glossary#gene) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) are usually associated with mild or intermittent trimethylaminuria; the condition is sometimes limited to peri-menstrual periods in female subjects or to the consumption of trimethylamine-rich food. The clinical management of the condition includes dietary restriction of trimethylamine and its [precursors](../glossary#precursor), such as foods rich in [choline](../other-nutrients/choline) and seafood, as well as [cruciferous vegetables](../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) that contain both trimethylamine precursors and FMO3 [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) [(86)](#reference86). The use of riboflavin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) was reported 17-year-old female patient affected by pyridoxine non-responsive homocystinuria [(87)](#reference87). The disease was initially treated with betaine (a choline derivative), which caused body odor secondary to FMO3 deficiency. Riboflavin supplementation (200 mg/day) reduced trimethylamine [excretion](../glossary#excretion) and the betaine body odor. Similar effects were seen with riboflavin supplementation in two pediatric patients [(88)](#reference88). The data suggest that riboflavin might help maximize residual FMO3 [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) activity in patients with primary trimethylaminuria. Moreover, a recent [case report](../glossary#case-report) in a 35-year-old male with [HIV](../glossary#HIV) described supplemental riboflavin as an effective treatment for secondary trimethylaminuria caused by antiretroviral therapy [(89)](#reference89). [Hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) in adulthood is recognized as the leading risk factor contributing to mortality worldwide primarily from [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), while hypertension in pregnancy leads to serious adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. A number of risk factors are recognized to contribute to the development of hypertension. In recent years, evidence has emerged from genetic and clinical studies pointing to the role of [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in blood pressure [(90)](#reference90). The common MTHFR C677T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism), affecting 1 in 10 adults globally, is associated with higher blood pressure, although this is much less well recognized compared with the phenotype of elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations that was established at the time of discovery of this polymorphism and its link with cardiovascular disease [(91)](#reference91). [Meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) show that this polymorphism is associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypertension by up to 87% and of heart disease and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) by up to 40% [(92)](#reference92). The MTHFR C677T polymorphism is also associated with a significantly higher risk of hypertension in pregnancy [(93)](#reference93) and with [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) [(27)](#reference27). Since FAD is required as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the MTHFR [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) and the MTHFR C677T polymorphism results in decreased MTHFR activity, studies have investigated whether affected individuals may benefit from riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement). In an initial [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 77 healthy young adults stratified by MTHFR [genotype](../glossary#genotype), riboflavin supplementation at dietary levels (1.6 mg/day for 12 weeks) resulted in marked lowering of homocysteine concentrations in the MTHFR 677TT genotype group, but not in the 677CC or 677CT genotype groups who exhibited normal [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine at baseline [(15)](#reference15). Three randomized controlled trials subsequently investigated the effect of riboflavin on blood pressure in patients with hypertension with or without overt cardiovascular disease [(91](#reference91), [94, 95)](#reference94). The results of these trials showed that supplementation with low-dose riboflavin (1.6 mg/day for 16 weeks) resulted in significant lowering of blood pressure and reduction in incidence of hypertension specifically in those patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. Riboflavin intervention reduced mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure in those with the TT genotype from 144/87 to 131/80 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg), with no response observed in those without the genetic variant (i.e., the CT or CC genotypes) [(89)](#reference89). Notably, the 13 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred even though over 80% of the patients were taking one or more antihypertensive drugs at recruitment, and the addition of supplemental riboflavin was shown to greatly enhance the achievement of goal blood pressure with routine antihypertensive drugs [(89, 91)](#reference89). Furthermore, the magnitude of blood pressure response achieved with riboflavin in these trials compares very favorably with typical decreases from other interventions, such as dietary salt reductions of 3 g/day (3.6/1.9 mm Hg) and 6 g/day (7.1/3.9 mm Hg). The trial findings therefore suggest that the excess risk of hypertension linked to this genetic polymorphism can be overcome by low-dose riboflavin supplementation. Also, analysis of plasma samples from individuals participating in these trials showed lower concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), an important methyl group donor for [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, in those with the MTHFR (1.6 mg/day) for 12 weeks was shown to increase plasma concentrations of SAM and another one-carbon metabolite, cystathionine [(96)](#reference96), and thus may have potential in correcting the altered one-carbon metabolism arising with the variant TT genotype. Thus, studies to date indicate that riboflavin supplementation may have benefits in lowering blood pressure and reducing hypertension in individuals (and sub-populations) affected by the common MTHFR C677T polymorphism. However, the mechanisms explaining the blood pressure phenotype and its responsiveness to riboflavin remain unclear. Future studies examining the effects of riboflavin supplementation on one-carbon metabolism may help to elucidate the biological mechanisms involved. Interestingly, a recent randomized controlled trial found that riboflavin supplementation in those with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype resulted in altered [DNA](../glossary#DNA) methylation of certain [genes](../glossary#gene) known to be involved in blood pressure regulation [(97)](#reference97). Anticancer agents often display various side effects that may force patients to limit the dose or to discontinue the treatment. The [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) effect of co-administering riboflavin was evaluated in 78 postmenopausal patients with breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) treated with tamoxifen for 90 days. This [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) effectively prevented the [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) associated with tamoxifen treatment [(98)](#reference98). Riboflavin can also act as a photosensitizer, and this property may have value in photodynamic therapy of cancer. A mouse model was used to assess the effect of riboflavin in combination with cisplatin, one of the most effective anticancer agents. Under light exposure, riboflavin administration reduced cisplatin-induced [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage in the liver and kidneys [(99)](#reference99). These results are promising, but human studies are needed to examine whether riboflavin is an effective [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct-therapy) to [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy). Corneal ectasia is an eye condition characterized by irregularities of the [cornea](../glossary#cornea) that affect vision. Corneal cross-linking - a fairly new procedure used by professionals to limit the progression of corneal damage -involves the use of [topical](../glossary#topical) riboflavin in conjunction with ultraviolet-A irradiation. Riboflavin functions as a photosensitizer in the reaction. Cross-linking modifies the properties of the cornea and strengthens its architecture [(100, 101)](#reference100). [Multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) (MS) is an [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) of unknown [etiology](../glossary#etiology) that is characterized by the progressive destruction of [myelin](../glossary#myelin) and nerve fibers in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), causing [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in affected individuals [(102)](#reference102). Riboflavin appears to have a role in the formation of myelin [(103)](#reference103), and [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) has been implicated in the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of MS; thus, riboflavin may be helpful in treatment of the disease. A strong [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between dietary riboflavin intake and [risk](../glossary#risk) for MS was initially observed in a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) [(104)](#reference104). In a mouse model of MS (i.e., experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), riboflavin supplementation improved clinical measures of a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 29 patients with MS found that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 10 mg/day of riboflavin for six months had no effect on MS-related disability, assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale [(106)](#reference106). Large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine whether riboflavin supplementation has a beneficial effect in the treatment of MS. Most plant- and animal-derived foods contain at least small quantities of riboflavin. In the US, wheat flour and bread have been enriched with riboflavin (as well as [thiamin](thiamin), [niacin](niacin), and [iron](../minerals/iron)) since 1943. Data from a US national survey indicate that the average dietary intake of riboflavin is 2.5 mg/day for men and 1.8 mg/day for women [(107)](#reference107); these intakes are well above the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) values of 1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women. Surveys of adults of ages 70 years or older showed similar intakes: 2.2 mg/day for older men and 1.8 mg day for older women [(107)](#reference107). Riboflavin is heat-stable, but it is easily destroyed upon exposure to light. For instance, up to 50% of the riboflavin in milk contained in a clear glass bottle can be destroyed after two hours of exposure to bright sunlight [(6)](#reference6). Nationally representative surveys from the US, Ireland, and the UK showed that milk and other dairy products were the main dietary contributors to riboflavin intake, followed by meat and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals [(108-110)](#reference108). Some foods with substantial amounts of riboflavin are listed in Table 2, along with their riboflavin content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content of food, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). The [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of riboflavin from food is reported to be very high, nearly 95% [(108)](#reference108). Limited data exist for the relative bioavailability of riboflavin from different food sources, however a [cross-over study](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in healthy women using stable isotopes and kinetic modeling did not find significant differences in riboflavin absorption from milk and spinach [(111)](#reference111). of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.| The most common forms of riboflavin available in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are riboflavin and riboflavin 5'-monophosphate. Riboflavin commonly found in multivitamin and vitamin B-complex preparations [(112)](#reference112). No toxic or adverse effects of high riboflavin intake in humans are known. Studies in cell culture indicate that excess riboflavin may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) strand breaks in the presence of chromium (VI), a known [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen) [(113)](#reference113). This may be of concern to workers exposed to chrome, yet no data in humans are available. High-dose riboflavin therapy has been found to intensify urine color to a bright yellow (flavinuria), but this is a harmless side effect. The Food and Nutrition Board did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) when the RDA was revised in 1998 [(1)](#references). Several early reports indicated that women taking high-dose oral contraceptives had diminished riboflavin [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) status. However, when investigators controlled for dietary riboflavin intake, no differences between users of oral contraceptives and non-users were found [(1)](#references). Phenothiazine derivatives like the anti-psychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), and tricyclic antidepressants inhibit the conversion of riboflavin to FAD and FMN, as do the and the the may increase destruction of riboflavin by liver [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of deficiency [(3)](#reference3). Additionally, chronic alcohol consumption has been associated with riboflavin deficiency. In rats chronically fed alcohol, the inhibition of riboflavin transporters caused impairment in intestinal absorption and [renal](../glossary#renal) re-uptake of the vitamin [(114)](#reference114). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for riboflavin (1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women), which should prevent deficiency in most individuals, is easily met by eating a varied diet. Consuming a varied diet should supply 1.5 mg to 2 mg of riboflavin a day. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement containing 100% of the Daily Values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) will ensure an intake of at least 1.3 mg/day of riboflavin. Some experts in nutrition and aging feel that the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women) leaves little margin for error in people over 50 years of age [(115, 116)](#reference115). A study of independently living people between 65 and 90 years of age found that almost 25% consumed less than the recommended riboflavin intake, and 10% had biochemical evidence of that riboflavin 1.6 to 2.2 mg/day may reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing age-related cataracts. Additionally, older people suffering from acute [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) were found to be deficient for riboflavin [(118)](#reference118), and riboflavin deficiency has been linked to a higher risk of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in postmenopausal women with the MTHFR 677T variant [(119)](#reference119). Individuals whose diets may not supply adequate riboflavin, especially those over 50 years of age, should consider taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement, which generally provides at least 1.3 mg/day of riboflavin.

Isolated and characterized in the 1930s, thiamin was one of the first organic compounds to be recognized as a vitamin [(2)](#reference2). Thiamin occurs in the human body as free required as a in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [branched-chain amino acids](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids). Forms of thiamin are also needed for ribose synthesis complex within cellular [organelles](../glossary#organelle) called [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria). (CoA), succinyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, and derivatives of BCAA, respectively (Figure 1). All products play critical roles in the production of energy from food through their connection to the [citric acid (Krebs) cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) [(2)](#reference2). BCAA, into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA to fuel the citric acid cycle. The [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of the three BCAAs also contributes to the production of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and donates nitrogen for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter), [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate) and g-aminobutyric requires catalyzes critical reactions in another metabolic pathway occurring in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol), known as the pentose phosphate pathway. One of the most important intermediates of this pathway is ribose-5-phosphate, a phosphorylated 5-carbon sugar required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) [DNA](../glossary#DNA), and [RNA](../glossary#RNA). The pentose decreases early in thiamin deficiency and, unlike most thiamin-dependent enzymes, is present in red blood cells, measurement of its activity in red blood cells has been used to assess thiamin nutritional of acids through the process of -oxidation, the oxidative removal of a single carbon atom from fatty acids like phytanic acid [(7)](#reference7). Beriberi, the disease resulting from severe thiamin deficiency, was described in Chinese literature as early as 2600 B.C. Thiamin deficiency affects the [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular), muscular, [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal), and central and peripheral nervous systems [(2)](#reference2). Beriberi has been subdivided into dry, wet, cerebral, or gastrointestinal, depending on the systems affected by severe thiamin deficiency [(1](#references), [8)](#reference8). The main feature of dry (paralytic or nervous) beriberi is [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy). Early in the course of the neuropathy, \"burning feet syndrome\" may occur. Other symptoms include abnormal (exaggerated) reflexes, as well as diminished sensation and weakness in the legs and arms. Muscle pain and tenderness and difficulty rising from a squatting position have also been observed [(9)](#reference9). In addition to [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms, wet (cardiac) beriberi is characterized by [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) manifestations of thiamin deficiency, which include rapid heart rate, enlargement of the heart, severe swelling ( [edema](../glossary#edema)), difficulty breathing, and ultimately, [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure). The Japanese literature describes the acute fulminant form of wet beriberi as \"shoshin\" [(10)](#reference10). Cerebral beriberi may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis, especially in people who abuse alcohol. The diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy is based on a \"triad\" of signs, which include abnormal eye movements, stance and gait [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment. Due in part to an overlap of symptoms with alcoholic delirium, Wernicke's encephalopathy is thought to be underdiagnosed [(11)](#reference11). If left untreated, the irreversible [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) damage can cause additional clinical manifestations known as Korsakoff's psychosis. This syndrome - also called Korsakoff's [dementia](../glossary#dementia), Korsakoff's amnesia, or amnestic confabulatory syndrome - involves a confused, apathetic state and a profound memory disorder, with severe amnesia and loss of recent and working memory. Thiamin deficiency affecting the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) is referred to as Wernicke's disease when the amnesic state is not present and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) when the amnesic symptoms are present along with the eye-movement and gait disorders. Rarer neurologic manifestations can include [seizures](../glossary#seizure) [(12)](#reference12). Most WKS sufferers are alcoholics, although it has been observed in other disorders of gross malnutrition, including stomach [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS). Administration of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) thiamin to WKS patients generally results in prompt improvement of the eye symptoms, but improvements in motor coordination and memory may be less, depending on how long the symptoms have been present. Evidence of increased immune cell activation and increased [free radical](../glossary#free-radical) production in the areas of the brain that are selectively damaged suggests that [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) plays an important role in the neurologic pathology of thiamin deficiency [(13)](#reference13). TPP is critical for metabolic reactions that utilize [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [glycolysis](../glossary#glycoloysis) and the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). A decrease in the activity of thiamin-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) limits the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and the utilization of the citric acid cycle, leading to accumulation of pyruvate and lactate. Lactic acidosis, a condition resulting from the accumulation of lactate, is often associated with nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain in a syndrome described as gastrointestinal beriberi [(8)](#reference8). Thiamin deficiency may result from inadequate thiamin intake, increased requirement for thiamin, excessive loss of thiamin from the body, consumption of anti-thiamin factors in food, or a combination of these factors. Inadequate consumption of thiamin is the main cause of thiamin deficiency in developing countries [(2)](#reference2). Thiamin deficiency is common in low-income populations whose diets are high in [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) and low in thiamin (e.g., milled or polished rice). Breast-fed infants whose mothers are thiamin deficient are vulnerable to developing infantile beriberi. Alcoholism, which is associated with low intake of thiamin among other nutrients, is the primary cause of thiamin deficiency in industrialized countries. Some of the non-alcoholic conditions associated with WKS include anorexia nervosa, [bariatric](../glossary#bariatrics) heightened thiamin deficiency [(18, 19)](#reference18). Moreover, cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy have been linked with hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy) [parenteral nutrition](../glossary#parenteral-nutrition) lacking [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) supplementation Conditions resulting in an increased requirement for thiamin include strenuous physical exertion, fever, pregnancy, breast-feeding, and adolescent growth. Such conditions place individuals with marginal thiamin intake at [risk](../glossary#risk) for developing symptomatic thiamin deficiency. [Malaria](../glossary#malaria) patients in Southeast Asia were found to be thiamin deficient more frequently than non-infected individuals [(24, 25)](#reference24). Malarial infection leads to a large increase in the metabolic demand for [glucose](../glossary#glucose). Because thiamin is required for [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in glucose [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), the stresses induced by malarial infection could exacerbate thiamin deficiency in predisposed individuals. [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-infected individuals, whether or not they had developed [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS), were also found to be at increased risk for thiamin deficiency [(26)](#reference26). Further, chronic alcohol abuse impairs intestinal absorption and utilization of thiamin [(1)](#references); thus, alcoholics have increased requirements for thiamin. Thiamin deficiency is also observed as a complication of the refeeding syndrome: the introduction of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) in severely starved individuals leads to an increased demand for thiamin in [glycolysis](../glossary#glycoloysis) and the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) that Excessive precipitate deficiency. By increasing urinary flow, [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) may prevent reabsorption of thiamin by the kidneys and increase its excretion in the urine [(28, 29)](#reference28). The [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency is increased in diuretic-treated patients with marginal thiamin intake [(30)](#reference30) and in individuals receiving long-term, diuretic therapy [(31)](#reference31). Individuals with kidney failure requiring [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) lose thiamin at an increased rate and are at risk for thiamin deficiency [(32)](#reference32). Alcoholics who maintain a high fluid intake and high urine flow rate may also experience increased loss of thiamin, exacerbating the effects of low thiamin intake [(33)](#reference33). The presence of anti-thiamin factors (ATF) in foods contributes to the [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency. Certain plants contain ATF, which react with thiamin to form an oxidized, inactive product. Consuming very large amounts of tea or coffee (including decaffeinated), as well as chewing tea leaves and betel nuts, might lower thiamin status due to the presence of ATF [(34, 35)](#reference34). ATF include mycotoxins (molds) and thiaminases that break down thiamin in food. Individuals who habitually eat certain raw fresh-water fish, raw shellfish, or ferns are at higher risk of thiamin deficiency because these foods contain thiaminase that normally is inactivated by heat in cooking [(1](#references), [6)](#reference6). In Nigeria, an acute, [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) syndrome (seasonal [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia)) has been associated with thiamin deficiency precipitated by a thiaminase in African silkworms, a traditional, high-protein food for some Nigerians [(36)](#reference36). The [ RDA](../glossary#RDA) for thiamin, revised in 1998 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, was based on the prevention of deficiency in generally healthy individuals [(37](#reference37); Table 1). |Life of 2,900 Australian men and women, 49 years of age and older, found that those in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of thiamin intake were 40% less likely to have nuclear [cataracts](../glossary#cataract) than those in the lowest quintile [(38)](#reference38). In addition, a study in 408 US women found that higher dietary intakes of thiamin were [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with five-year change in lens opacification [(39)](#reference39). However, these cross-sectional associations have yet to be elucidated by studies of causation. Patients with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) have been reported to have low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations and high [renal](../glossary#renal) clearance of thiamin [(40, 41)](#reference40), suggesting that individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for thiamin deficiency. Two thiamin transporters, thiamin transporter-1 THTR-2, are involved in thiamin uptake by [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) in the small intestine and re-uptake in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. One study suggested that [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in patients with diabetes could affect thiamin re-uptake by decreasing the expression of thiamin transporters in the kidneys [(42)](#reference42). Conversely, thiamin deficiency appears to impair the normal [endocrine](../glossary#endocrine-system) function of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) and exacerbate hyperglycemia. Early studies showed that [insulin](../glossary#insulin) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and secretion were altered in the endocrine of thiamin-deficient rats [(43, 44)](#reference43). In caused by [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding leads to the thiamin-responsive six weeks to hyperglycemic individuals (either [glucose](../glossary#glucose) intolerant or newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes). Thiamin supplementation prevented any further increase in fasting glucose and insulin concentrations compared with [placebo](../glossary#placebo) treatment but did not reduce the hyperglycemia [(45)](#reference45). However, one study suggested that thiamin supplementation might improve fasting glucose concentrations in in early stages of type 2 diabetes (i.e., pre-diabetes) [(46)](#reference46). Some older adults are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for developing [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) thiamin deficiency secondary to poor dietary intake, reduced [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption, and multiple medical conditions [(47, 48)](#reference47). Since thiamin deficiency can result in a form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia) (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), its relationship to [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) (AD) and other forms of dementia have been investigated. AD is characterized by a decline in [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function in elderly people, accompanied by [pathologic](../glossary#pathology) features that include [-amyloid plaque](../glossary#amyloid-plaque) deposition and tomography (PET) scanning](../glossary#PET-scan), reduced [glucose](../glossary#glucose) metabolism has been observed in brains of AD patients [(50)](#reference50). A large, multicenter PET study using a radiolabeled glucose [analog](../glossary#analog), 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG), correlated a reduction in FDG uptake (a surrogate marker for glucose metabolism) with the extent of cognitive impairment in AD patients. This study, which included 822 subjects over 55 years of age that were cognitively normal (n=229), displayed mild cognitive impairment (n=405), or had mild AD (n=188), demonstrated that brain glucose utilization could predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD [(51)](#reference51). A nine-year longitudinal study associated the presence of [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) in older people (above 55 years old) with an increased risk for developing AD [(52)](#reference52). Emerging evidence links type 2 diabetes and AD, conditions that may involve [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) in the brain (reviewed in [53](#reference53)). A reduction in thiamin-dependent processes in the brain appears to be related to the altered glucose metabolism in patients with AD [(54-56)](#reference54). [Case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) have found blood levels of thiamin, TPP, and TMP to be lower in those with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) compared to control subjects [(57, 58)](#reference57). Moreover, several investigators have found evidence of decreased activity of TPP-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase, in the brains of patients who died of AD [(59)](#reference59). The finding of decreased brain levels of TPP in the presence of normal levels of free thiamin and TMP suggests altered TPP synthesis rather than poor thiamin [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). However, it is not clear whether the activities of TPP-metabolizing enzymes (including thiamin pyrophosphokinase) are altered in AD patients [(60, 61)](#reference60). Chronic administration of the thiamin derivative benfotiamine alleviated cognitive alterations and decreased the number of -amyloid plaques in a mouse model of AD without increasing TMP and TPP levels in the brain. This suggested that the beneficial effects of benfotiamine in the brain were likely mediated by the stimulation of TPP-independent pathways [(62)](#reference62). Chronic benfotiamine administration was also shown to decrease the number of neurofibrillary tangles in certain brain regions and improve survival in a mouse model [(63)](#reference63). In a rat model of neurodegeneration, long-term oral benfotiamine [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) increased thiamin pyrophosphate concentrations and led to improvements in insulin signaling and cognitive deficits [(64)](#reference64). Thiamin deficiency has been linked to increased -amyloid production in cultured [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cells and to plaque formation in animal models [(65, 66)](#reference65). These pathological hallmarks of AD could be reversed by thiamin supplementation, suggesting that thiamin could be protective in AD. Other disorders, including [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and chronic [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), have been linked to both thiamin deficiency and AD pathogenesis and progression [(13](#reference13), [55](#reference55), [67)](#reference67). Presently, there is only slight and inconsistent evidence that thiamin supplements are of benefit in AD. A [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study of 15 patients (10 completed the study) reported no beneficial effect of 3 grams/day of thiamin on cognitive decline over a 12-month period [(68)](#reference68). A preliminary report from another study claimed a mild benefit of 3 to 8 grams of thiamin per day in DAT, but no additional data from that study are available [(69)](#reference69). A mild beneficial effect in patients with AD was reported after 12 weeks of treatment with 100 mg/day of a thiamin derivative (thiamin tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide), but review](../glossary#systematic-review) of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of thiamin in patients with DAT found no evidence that thiamin was a useful treatment for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease [(71)](#reference71). More recently, a small uncontrolled study in five patients with mild-to-moderate AD reported cognitive improvement, measured by the Mini-Mental Status Examination, following supplementation with 300 mg/day of benfotiamine for 18 months [(72)](#reference72). In a placebo-controlled study of 70 -amyloid positive patients with either amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a [precursor](../glossary#precursor) to AD) or mild AD, those receiving 600 mg/day of benfotiamine for 12 months experienced less cognitive decline compared to placebo, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.125; [73)](#reference73). Large-scale, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether supplemental thiamin or benfotiamine might help slow progression of cognitive decline in those with Alzheimer's disease. [Huntington's disease](../glossary#huntington-disease) is an inherited [neurodegenerative disorder](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by selective degeneration of nerve cells known as striatal spiny neurons. Symptoms, such as movement disorders and impaired [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function, typically develop in the fourth decade of life and progressively deteriorate over time. A recent study found decreased levels of the thiamin transporter-2 (THTR-2) protein in the striatum and frontal cortex of patients with Huntington's disease compared to age-and sex-matched healthy controls [(74)](#reference74). Compared to control subjects, this study also found lower concentrations of TPP in the striatum and lower concentrations of TMP in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of patients with thiamin for life (see [Biotin-thiamin-responsive ganglia disease](#biotin-thiamin-responsive-basal-ganglia-disease) In a mouse model of Huntington's disease, high-dose supplementation with both of these vitamins improved neuropathological and motor deficits but had no effect on lifespan (p=0.15) [(74)](#reference74). A [phase II](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial), at moderate (600 mg/day of thiamin and 150 mg/day of biotin) and high (1,200 mg/day of thiamin and 300 mg/day of biotin) dosages, in Huntington's disease is currently underway [(75)](#reference75). Severe thiamin deficiency (wet beriberi) can lead to impaired cardiac function and ultimately [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) (CHF). Although cardiac manifestations of beriberi are rarely encountered in industrialized countries, CHF due to other causes is common, especially in the elderly. Loop [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) used in the treatment of CHF, notably furosemide, increase thiamin [excretion](../glossary#excretion), potentially leading to thiamin deficiency [(76, Patients with CHF might also have altered thiamin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), including reduced absorption of thiamin in the [(78)](#reference78). A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found a 2.5 times higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency in patients with heart failure compared to control subjects [(78)](#reference78). As in the general population, older CHF patients were found to be at higher risk of thiamin deficiency than younger ones [(79)](#reference79). An important measure of cardiac function in CHF is the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which can be assessed by [echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography). One study in 25 patients found that furosemide use at doses of 80 mg/day or greater was associated with a 98% [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of thiamin deficiency [(31)](#reference31). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) study of 30 CHF patients, all of whom had been taking furosemide (80 mg/day) for at least three months, [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) (IV) thiamin therapy (200 mg/day) for seven days resulted in an improved LVEF compared to IV [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(80)](#reference80). When all 30 of the CHF patients in that study subsequently received six weeks of oral thiamin therapy (200 mg/day), the average LVEF improved by 22%. This finding may be relevant because improvements in LVEF have been associated with improved survival in CHF patients [(81)](#reference81). However, [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) of oral thiamin supplementation in heart failure patients have not found any benefit. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 52 patients with systolic heart failure, 300 mg/day of supplemental thiamin for one month did not improve LVEF compared to placebo [(82)](#reference82). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 64 patients with heart failure reported that 200 mg/day or supplemental thiamin for six months did not improve LVEF [(83)](#reference83). Although little evidence supports the routine use of supplemental thiamin in CHF patients, trials specifically in CHF patients with marginal thiamin [status](../glossary#status) have not been done, and some suggest that it may be prudent to screen patients on long-term diuretic therapy for thiamin deficiency and treat accordingly [(84)](#reference84). Chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in individuals with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) contributes to the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of microvascular diseases. Diabetes-related [retina](../glossary#retina) (retinopathy), and [neuropathy](../glossary#neuropathy)). In subjects with diabetes, hyperglycemia alters the function of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) that are critical for the growth of blood vessels [(85)](#reference85). Interestingly, a higher daily intake of thiamin from the diet was correlated with more circulating EPC and with better vascular endothelial health in 88 individuals with type 2 diabetes [(86)](#reference86). An [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) has also been found between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of thiamin and the presence of soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), a marker of vascular dysfunction, in patients with diabetes [(40](#reference40), [87)](#reference87). Early markers of diabetic nephropathy include the presence of [serum](../glossary#serum) albumin in the urine, known as microalbuminuria. Administration of thiamin or benfotiamine (a thiamin derivative) prevented the development of [renal](../glossary#renal) complications in chemically-induced diabetic rats [(88)](#reference88). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study conducted in 40 patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria found that high-dose thiamin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) three-month period [(87)](#reference87). Since thiamin treatment has shown promising results in cultured cells and animal models [(89-91)](#reference89), the effects of thiamin and its derivatives on vascular complications should be examined in patients with diabetes. Thiamin deficiency and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome have been observed in some [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients with rapidly growing tumors [(92, 93)](#reference92). Research in cell culture and animal models indicates that rapidly dividing cancer cells have a high requirement for thiamin [(94)](#reference94). All rapidly dividing cells require [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) at an increased rate, and some cancer cells appear to rely heavily on the TPP-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), transketolase, to provide the ribose-5-phosphate necessary for nucleic acid [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). One study found that the levels of THTR-1, transketolase, and TPP [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) transporters were increased in samples of human breast cancer tissue compared to normal tissue, suggesting an adaptation in thiamin [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) in support of cancer metabolism [(95)](#reference95). Other studies have found that the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding THTR-2 is downregulated in certain cancers [(96)](#reference96). Moreover, use of the chemotherapeutic drug, 5-fluorouracil, inhibits [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of thiamin to thiamin thiamin deficiency [(97, 98)](#reference97). Thiamin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in cancer patients is common to prevent thiamin deficiency, but Boros et al. caution that too much thiamin may actually fuel the growth of some [malignant](../glossary#malignant) tumors [(99)](#reference99), suggesting that thiamin supplementation be reserved for those cancer patients who are actually deficient in thiamin. Presently, there is no evidence available from studies in humans to support or refute this theory. However, it would be prudent for individuals with cancer who are considering thiamin supplementation to discuss it with the clinician managing their cancer therapy. [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous), high-dose thiamin has been suggested as a treatment for cancer patients with confirmed Wernicke-Korsakoff [(93)](#reference93). Sepsis is a life-threatening critical illness caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. The widespread [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) can lead to tissue and organ damage and to death [(100)](#reference100). Because thiamin deficiency is common among septic patients [(101)](#reference101), several studies have investigated the treatment effect of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) thiamin - alone or in combination with other agents like vitamin C and hydrocortisone. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) examining the association of intravenous thiamin as a [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) have mainly looked at its association with lactic acidosis, which commonly occurs in both thiamin deficiency and sepsis, and with mortality. One [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) in 123 septic patients and 246 matched controls found that intravenous thiamin administration within 24 hours of hospital admission was linked to improvements in both lactate clearance and 28-day mortality [(102)](#reference102). In a small retrospective study of 53 alcohol-use disorder patients presenting with septic shock, lower mortality was observed in the 34 patients who received intravenous thiamin compared to the 19 patients who did not [(103)](#reference103). A few [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have evaluated the effect of intravenous thiamin in the treatment of sepsis. A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 88 patients with sepsis and elevated blood concentrations of lactate reported that intravenous thiamin (200 mg twice daily for seven days or until discharge from the hospital) did not decrease lactate concentrations at 24 hours post initiation of treatment - the primary endpoint of the trial [(104)](#reference104). No differences between the treatment and placebo groups were found for the secondary endpoints, which included survival [(104)](#reference104). In a subsequent analysis of data from this trial, the septic patients that were given parenteral thiamin (n=31) had lower creatinine concentrations throughout the treatment and were less likely to need [renal](../glossary#renal) replacement therapy compared to placebo (n=39; [105)](#reference105). A 2020 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four studies - one observational and three randomized controlled trials - found no benefit of intravenous thiamin for improving lactate concentrations, length of hospital stay in intensive care, or overall survival [(106)](#reference106). Large-scale [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether parenteral administration of thiamin is beneficial in the treatment of sepsis. Administering thiamin in combination with vitamin C and corticosteroids may be more efficacious to treat sepsis [(107)](#reference107); some clinical trials of such treatments are currently underway (see clinicaltrials.gov/). Thiamin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) is included in the clinical management of genetic diseases that affect the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [branched-chain amino acids](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids) efficient [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) in affected individuals. PDHC deficiency is commonly characterized by lactic acidosis, [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) and neuromuscular degeneration, and death during childhood. The patients who respond to thiamin treatment (from a few mg/day to doses above 1,000 mg/day) exhibit PDHC deficiency due to the decreased affinity of PDHC for TPP [(108, 109)](#reference108). Although thiamin supplementation can reduce lactate accumulation and improve the clinical features in thiamin-responsive patients, it does not constitute a cure [(110)](#reference110). Inborn errors of [BCAA](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids) metabolism lead to thiamin-responsive branched-chain ketoaciduria, also known as maple syrup urine disease. Alterations in the BCAA [catabolic](../glossary#catabolism) pathway result in [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) dysfunction caused by the accumulation of BCAAs and their derivatives, branched-chain ketoacids (BCKA). The therapeutic approach includes a synthetic diet with reduced BCAA content, and thiamin (10-1,000 mg/day) is supplemented to subunit of the BCKDH complex [(111)](#reference111). In thiamin-responsive individuals, the supplementation has been proven effective to correct the phenotype without recourse to the BCAA restriction diet. [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) SLC19A2 [gene](../glossary#gene) impairs to thiamin-responsive [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) [(112)](#reference112). This syndrome, which is also called thiamin metabolism dysfunction syndrome-1, is characterized by megaloblastic anemia, [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and deafness. A review of 30 cases reported additional [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic), visual, and cardiac impairments [(113)](#reference113). High-dose oral supplementation with thiamin (up to 300 mg/day) helps to maintain health and correct [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in prepubescent children. A recent study in 32 individuals with found no additional benefit of oral doses above 150 mg/day [(114)](#reference114). After puberty, a decline in [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) function results in the requirement of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) together with thiamin to control the hyperglycemia. One study also reported that the treatment of a four-month-old girl with 100 mg/day of thiamin did not prevent hearing loss at 20 months of age [(115)](#reference115). Early diagnosis of the syndrome and early treatment with thiamin is important for a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) deficiency, and an [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [mutation](../glossary#mutation) in the SLC19A3 [gene](../glossary#gene) that codes for THTR-2. The disease usually presents around 3 to 10 years of age [(116)](#reference116), but an early infantile form of the disease exists with onset as early as one month of age [(117)](#reference117). Clinical features include subacute [encephalopathy](../glossary#encephalopathy) (confusion, drowsiness, altered level of consciousness), [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [seizures](../glossary#seizure). A [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) of 18 affected individuals from the same family or the same tribe in Saudi Arabia showed that biotin [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) (5-10 mg/kg/day) efficiently abolished the clinical manifestations of the disease, although one-third of the patients suffered from recurrent acute crises. Often associated with poor outcomes, acute crises were not observed for a five-year follow-up period following thiamin supplementation (300-400 mg/day) - early diagnosis and immediate treatment with biotin and thiamin led to positive outcomes [(118)](#reference118). Recent studies have found supplemental thiamin to be important in treating the condition. In an [open-label study](../glossary#open-label-trial) of 20 pediatric patients with the disease, supplemental thiamin alone was as effective as combined biotin-thiamin supplementation when given for 30 months [(119)](#reference119). Lifelong high-dose supplementation with a combination of biotin and thiamin is generally the treatment for biotin-thiamin-responsive basal ganglia disease [(116)](#reference116). Early diagnosis and treatment is to ensure a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) [(117](#reference117), [120)](#reference120). [Supplemental](../glossary#supplement) thiamin has limited utility in treating other inborn errors of thiamin metabolism. [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the SLC25A19 [gene](../glossary#gene) that codes for the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) TPP transporter can result in either thiamin metabolism dysfunction syndrome-3 (THMD3) or thiamin metabolism dysfunction called Amish-type or Amish lethal microcephaly) the more severe phenotype, resulting in a congenital microcephaly, elevated concentrations of -ketoglutarate in urine, and usually death in infancy [(121)](#reference121). THMD4 is characterized by episodic encephalopathy and weakness, which often presents following a viral infection or febrile illness in childhood. Some patients affected with THMD4 may respond to high-dose thiamin supplementation [(122)](#reference122). Mutations in the TPK1 gene result pyrophosphokinase 1 deficiency and thiamin metabolism dysfunction syndrome-5 (THMD5), which usually manifests in early childhood. While the clinical presentation of THMD5 varies, affected individuals often experience episodic ataxia, dystonia, and lactic acidosis [(123)](#reference123). Only a few cases of THMD5 have been reported to date; two of these patients experienced limited improvement of symptoms upon supplementation with thiamin, in conjunction with adherence to a high-fat diet [(124)](#reference124). Humans obtain thiamin from dietary sources and from the normal [microflora](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) of the [colon](../glossary#colon), although the contribution of the latter towards the body's requirement for thiamin is not clear [(125)](#reference125). A varied diet should provide most individuals with adequate thiamin to prevent deficiency. In the US the average dietary thiamin intake for young adult men is about 2 mg/day and 1.2 mg/day for young adult women. A survey of people over the age of 60 found an average dietary thiamin intake of 1.4 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women [(37)](#reference37). However, institutionalization and poverty both increase the likelihood of inadequate thiamin intake in the elderly [(126)](#reference126). Whole-grain cereals, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes) (e.g., beans and lentils), [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), lean pork, and yeast are rich sources of thiamin [(1)](#references). Because most of the thiamin is lost during the production of white flour and polished (milled) rice, white rice and foods made from white flour (e.g., bread and pasta) are [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with thiamin in many Western countries. A number of thiamin-rich foods are listed in the table below, along with their thiamin content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content of of meat is a serving about the size of a deck of cards| Thiamin is available in dietary [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods, most commonly as thiamin hydrochloride or thiamin mononitrate [(127)](#reference127). Multivitamin supplements typically contain at least 1.2 mg of thiamin, the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for adults and children 4 years and older [(128)](#reference128). Benfotiamine is a synthetic, lipid-soluble [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of thiamin that is available as a dietary supplement. It has higher [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) compared to thiamin [(129)](#reference129). The Food and Nutrition Board did not set a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for thiamin because there are no well-established toxic effects from consumption of excess thiamin in food or through long-term, oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (up to 200 mg/day). A small number of life-threatening [anaphylactic](../glossary#anaphylaxis) reactions have been observed with large [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) doses of thiamin [(37)](#reference37). Reduced blood concentrations of thiamin have been reported in individuals with [seizure](../glossary#seizure) disorders ( [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy)) taking the [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) medication, phenytoin, for long periods of time [(130)](#reference130). 5-Fluorouracil, a drug used in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) therapy, inhibits of thiamin to TPP especially furosemide, may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency in individuals with marginal thiamin intake due to increased urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of thiamin [(29)](#reference29). Moreover, chronic alcohol abuse is associated with thiamin deficiency due to low dietary intake, impaired absorption and utilization, and increased excretion of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [(1)](#references). Chronic alcohol feeding to rats showed a decrease in the active absorption of thiamin linked to the inhibition of thiamin membrane transporter THTR-1 in the intestinal epithelium [(132)](#reference132). Alcohol consumption in rats also decreases the levels of THTR-1 and THTR-2 in [renal](../glossary#renal) [epithelial](../glossary#epithelium) cells, thus limiting thiamin re-uptake by the kidneys [(133)](#reference133). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation by the Food and Nutrition Board of 1.2 mg/day of thiamin for men and 1.1 mg/day for women. A varied diet should provide enough thiamin for most people. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, containing 100% of the Daily Values (DV), will ensure an intake of at least 1.5 mg/day of thiamin. Presently, there is no evidence that the requirement for thiamin is increased in older adults, but some studies have found inadequate dietary intake and thiamin insufficiency to be more common in elderly populations [(126)](#reference126). Thus, it would be prudent for older adults to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement, which will generally provide at least 1.5 mg/day of thiamin.

Retinol and retinyl esters are often referred to as preformed vitamin A. Retinol can be converted by the body to retinal, which can be in turn be ] [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to retinoic acid, the form of vitamin A known to regulate [gene](../glossary#gene) [transcription](../glossary#transcription). Retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and related compounds are known as retinoids. -Carotene and other food carotenoids that can be converted by the body into retinol are referred to as provitamin A carotenoids (see the article on [Carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids)). Hundreds of different carotenoids are [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by plants, but only about 10% of them are capable of being converted to retinol [(1)](#references). The following discussion will focus mainly on preformed vitamin A compounds and retinoic acid. Vitamin A compounds are essential fat-soluble molecules predominantly stored in the liver in the form of retinyl esters (e.g., retinyl palmitate). When appropriate, retinyl which binds to retinol binding [protein](../glossary#protein) (RBP) before being released in the bloodstream. The all-trans-retinol/RBP complex circulates bound to the protein, transthyretin, which delivers all-trans-retinol to peripheral tissues (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). Vitamin A as retinyl esters in chylomicrons was also found to have an appreciable role in delivering vitamin A to extrahepatic tissues, especially in early life [(3, 4)](#reference3). Located at the back of the eye, the [retina](../glossary#retina) contains two main types of light-sensitive [receptor](../glossary#receptor) cells known as rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Photons (particles of light) that pass through the [lens](../glossary#lens) are sensed by the photoreceptor cells of the retina and converted to [nerve impulses](../glossary#nerve-impulse) (electric signals) for interpretation by the brain. All-trans-retinol is transported to the retina via the circulation and accumulates in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (Figure 2) [(5)](#reference5). Here, all-trans-retinol is esterified to form a retinyl ester, which can be stored. When needed, retinyl esters are broken apart ( [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis)) and isomerized to 11-cis-retinol, which can be [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to form 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal can be shuttled across the interphotoreceptor space to the rod photoreceptor cell that is specialized for vision in low-light conditions and for detection of motion. In rod cells, 11-cis-retinal binds to a [protein](../glossary#protein) called opsin to form the visual pigment rhodopsin (also known as visual purple). Absorption of a photon of light [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal that is released from the opsin molecule. This photoisomerization triggers a cascade of events, leading to the generation of a nerve impulse conveyed by the optic nerve to the brain's visual cortex. All-trans-retinal is converted to all-trans-retinol and transported across the interstitial space to the RPE cells, thereby completing the visual cycle. A similar cycle occurs in cone cells that contain red, green, or blue opsin proteins required for the absorption of photons from the visible light spectrum [(2)](#reference2). Vitamin A is also essential for mammalian eye development [(6)](#reference6). Thus, because vitamin A is required for the normal functioning of the retina, dim-light vision, and color vision, inadequate retinol and retinal available to the retina result in impaired dark adaptation. In the severest cases of vitamin A deficiency, thinning and ulceration of the cornea leads to blindness (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). In cells, all-trans-retinol can be either stored (in the form of retinyl ester) or [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to all-trans-retinal by alcohol dehydrogenases. retinaldehyde dehydrogenases can [catalyze](../glossary#catalyze) the conversion of retinoic as to [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) and thereby influence numerous physiological processes. All-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA are transported to the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) of the cell bound to cellular retinoic acid-binding [proteins](../glossary#protein) (CRABP). Within the nucleus, RA isomers bind specific nuclear [receptor](../glossary#receptor) proteins that are [ligand](../glossary#ligand)-dependent [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor) (Figure 3). Both all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA can bind to retinoic acid receptors (RAR, RAR, and RAR), whereas only 9-cis-RA binds to retinoid X receptors (RXR, RXR, and RXR) [(7)](#reference7). RAR and RXR subtypes form either complexes of two of the same protein (RAR/RAR and RXR/RXR [homodimers](../glossary#homodimer)) or complexes of two different proteins (RAR/RXR [heterodimers](../glossary#heterodimer)). RAR/RXR heterodimers can bind to a regulatory [DNA](../glossary#DNA) sequence called retinoic acid response element (RARE) located within the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of retinoid-responsive [genes](../glossary#gene). The [transcriptional](../glossary#transcription) activity of RAR/RXR heterodimers appears to be mainly driven by the binding of all-trans-RA to RAR. The activation of RAR by RA binding triggers the recruitment of transcriptional coregulators to target promoters, thereby inhibiting or allowing the transcription of genes [(8)](#reference8). RXR also forms heterodimers with several other nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptor (TR), [vitamin D](vitamin-D) receptor (VDR), [steroid](../glossary#steroid) receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) [(9)](#reference9). In this way, vitamin A may interact with thyroid hormone, vitamin D, steroids (e.g., estrogen), or PPAR ligands [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways and influence the transcription of a broad range of genes. There is also evidence that RA/RAR can affect gene expression in a RARE-independent manner. For example, it was reported that RAR could interfere with TGF/Smad signaling pathway through direct interaction of RAR with the heterodimeric transcription factor, Smad3/Smad4. In the absence of RA, RAR was found to act as a coactivator of Smad3/Smad4-mediated transcription, while RAR agonists repressed the transcriptional activity of Smad3/Smad4 [(10)](#reference10). In retinoblastoma cells, RAR was also involved in RA-induced activation of signaling cascades mediated by tyrosine kinases known as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and leading to [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) [(11, 12)](#reference11). RA also appeared to induce [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) differentiation by activating ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway that [phosphorylated](../glossary#phosphorylation) transcription factor, CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein). Phosphorylated CREB can subsequently bind to the CREB response element in the promoter of genes involved in cell differentiation [(13)](#reference13). Also, independently of RAR, RA was found to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation and subsequent AP1-mediated expression of interleukin-6 in synovial cells [(14)](#reference14). Hence, RA can influence the expression of genes whose promoters do not contain RARE. By regulating the expression of over 500 retinoid-responsive genes (including several genes involved in vitamin A [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) itself), retinoic acid isomers play major roles in cellular [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and differentiation (i.e., cell commitment to highly specialized functions). In the eye and tissues like white [adipose](../glossary#adipose) and muscle, [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) retinol esterification and to maintain an inward concentration gradient of retinol [(15)](#reference15). Interestingly, retinol uptake by STRA6 was found to trigger the activation of a [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) cascade mediated by tyrosine kinases known as Janus kinases (JAK) and associated [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor) (STAT). JAK/STAT signaling pathway regulates the expression of a wide range of [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), [hormones](../glossary#hormone), and growth factors [(16)](#reference16). Animal studies have reported that an increased [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of [genes](../glossary#gene), such as SOCS3 by the JAK/STAT pathway, could result in the inhibition of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) signaling. Hence, obese mice lacking LRAT or be protected from retinol/STRA6-induced [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) [(17, 18)](#reference17). Apart from its role as a [ligand](../glossary#ligand) for opsin in the visual cascade (see [Visual system and eyesight](#visual-system)), retinal has been specifically implicated in the regulation of [genes](../glossary#gene) important for [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). In humans, two types of [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose) have been distinguished based on their respective functions: white adipose tissue (WAT) stores [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) as [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) [oxidizes](../glossary#oxidation) to generate heat (thermogenesis). In the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) of brown adipose cells, the processes of electron transport and [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production are uncoupled (dissociated) to permit the rapid production of heat from fatty acid oxidation [(19)](#reference19). Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1), which converts retinal to retinoic acid, is highly expressed in WAT but not in BAT. The suppression of RALDH1 expression in WAT can induce a thermogenic phenotype resembling that of BAT [(20)](#reference20). During adipocyte differentiation, the stimulation of cells with all-trans retinal has been found to activate the UCP1 gene required for thermogenesis while inhibiting genes promoting adipogenesis, such as PPAR [(20)](#reference20). Retinal also appeared to regulate lipid metabolism and adiposity in bone marrow by inhibiting PPAR/RXR [heterodimer](../glossary#heterodimer)-mediated [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) [(21)](#reference21). In addition, retinal was found to inhibit [gluconeogenic](../glossary#gluconeogenesis) gene expression and [glucose](../glossary#glucose) production in the liver of mice deficient in RALDH1 [(22)](#reference22). Vitamin A was initially coined \"the anti-infective [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin)\" because of its importance in the normal functioning of the immune system [(23)](#reference23). The skin and mucosal cells, lining the airways, digestive tract, and urinary tract function as a barrier and form the body's first line of defense against infection. Retinoic acid (RA) is produced by [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells (APCs), including [macrophages](../glossary#macrophage) and [dendritic cells](../glossary#dendritic-cell), found in these mucosal interfaces and associated lymph nodes. RA appears to act on dendritic cells themselves to regulate their [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), migration, and antigen-presenting capacity. In addition, the production of RA by APCs is required for the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 T- [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) into induced regulatory T- lymphocytes (Tregs). Critical to the maintenance of mucosal integrity, the differentiation of Tregs is driven by all-trans-RA through RAR-mediated regulation of [gene (see [Regulation of gene expression](#gene-expression-regulation)). Also, during [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), signaling pathway the conversion of na\u00efve into effector T-lymphocytes type 1 helper T-cells (Th1) (rather than into Tregs) and induces the production of proinflammatory [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) by effector T-lymphocytes in response to infection. There is also substantial evidence to suggest that RA may help prevent the development of autoimmunity (reviewed in [24](#reference24)). Both vitamin A excess and deficiency are known to cause birth defects. Retinoid signaling begins soon after the early phase of embryonic development known as gastrulation. During fetal development, RA is critical for the development of organs, including the heart, eyes, ears, lungs, as well as other limbs and visceral organs. Vitamin A has been implicated in fetal lung maturation [(2)](#reference2). Vitamin A status is lower in preterm newborns than in full-term infants [(25)](#reference25). There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplmentation) may help reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease and mortality in preterm newborns (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). Retinoid signaling is also involved in the expression of many [proteins](../glossary#protein) of the extracellular matrix (ECM; material surrounding cells), including [collagen](../glossary#collagen), laminin, and [proteoglycans](../glossary#proteoglycan) [(26)](#reference26). Vitamin A deficiency may then result in alterations of the ECM composition, thus disrupting organ morphology and function (reviewed in [26](#reference26)). Red blood cells ( [erythrocytes](../glossary#erythrocyte)), like all blood cells, are derived from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow. Studies involving [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) culture systems have suggested a role for retinoids in stem cell commitment and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) to the red blood cell lineage. Retinoids might also regulate [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) (programmed cell death) of red blood cell [precursors](../glossary#precursor) (erythropoietic cells) [(27)](#reference27). However, whether retinoids regulate erythropoiesis vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) has not been established. Yet, vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in vitamin A deficient-individuals has been shown to increase [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentrations. Additionally, vitamin A appears to facilitate the mobilization of [iron](../minerals/iron) from storage sites to the developing red blood cell for incorporation into hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in red blood cells [(27, 28)](#reference27). [Zinc](../minerals/zinc) deficiency is thought to interfere with vitamin A [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in several ways [(29)](#reference29): (1) zinc deficiency results in decreased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of retinol-binding protein (RBP), which transports retinol through the circulation to peripheral tissues and protects the organism against potential toxicity of retinol; (2) zinc deficiency results in decreased activity of the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that releases retinol from its storage form, retinyl palmitate, in the liver; and (3) zinc is required for the enzyme that converts retinol into retinal [(30)](#reference30). The health consequences of zinc deficiency on vitamin A nutritional status in humans are yet to be defined [(29)](#reference29). Vitamin A deficiency often coexists with [iron](../minerals/iron) deficiency and may exacerbate iron deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) by altering iron [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(27)](#reference27). Vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) has beneficial effects on iron deficiency anemia and improves iron nutritional status among children and pregnant women [(27, 28)](#reference27). The combination of supplemental vitamin A and iron seems to reduce anemia more effectively than either supplemental iron or vitamin A alone [(31)](#reference31). Moreover, studies in rats have shown that iron deficiency alters [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and liver levels of vitamin A [(32, 33)](#reference32). Vitamin A deficiency usually results from inadequate intakes of vitamin A from animal products (as preformed vitamin A) and fruit and vegetables (as provitamin A carotenoids). In developing countries, vitamin A deficiency and associated disorders predominantly affect children and women of reproductive age. Other individuals at [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin A deficiency are those with poor absorption of [lipids](../glossary#lipid) due to impaired [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) or [biliary](../glossary#bile) secretion and those and [celiac disease](../glossary#celiac-disease) A deficiency is often defined by serum retinol concentrations lower than 0.70 mol/L (20 g/dL). In severe vitamin A deficiency, vitamin A body stores are depleted and serum retinol concentrations fall below 0.35 mol/L (10 g/dL). Other [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) have been calibrated to assess vitamin A nutritional status (reviewed in [34](#reference34)). Of note, the World Health Organization considers vitamin A deficiency a public health problem when the prevalence of low serum retinol (<0.70 mol/L) reaches 15% or more of a defined population. With an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children becoming blind annually, vitamin A deficiency constitutes the leading preventable cause of blindness in low- and middle-income nations [(35)](#reference35). The earliest symptom of vitamin A deficiency is impaired dark adaptation known as night blindness or nyctalopia. The next clinical stage is the occurrence of abnormal changes in the conjunctiva (corner of the eye), manifested by the presence of Bitot's spots. Severe or prolonged vitamin A deficiency eventually results in a condition called xerophthalmia (Greek for dry eye), characterized by changes in the cells of the cornea (clear covering of the eye) that ultimately result in corneal ulcers, scarring, and blindness [(36)](#reference36). Immediate administration of 200,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A for two consecutive days is required to prevent blinding xerophthalmia [(36)](#reference36). There is an estimated 19.1 million pregnant women worldwide (especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America) with vitamin A deficiency and over half of them are affected by night blindness [(37)](#reference37). The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and night blindness is especially high during the third trimester of pregnancy due to accelerated fetal growth. Also, approximately 190 million preschool-age children have low [serum](../glossary#serum) retinol concentrations (<0.70 mol/L), with 5.2 million suffering from night blindness. Moreover, half of the children affected by severe vitamin A deficiency-induced blinding xerophthalmia are estimated to die within a year of becoming blind [(37)](#reference37). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) promote vitamin A supplementation as a public health intervention to reduce child mortality in areas and populations where vitamin A deficiency is [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) [(38-40)](#reference38). Infectious diseases have been associated with depletion of vitamin A [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) reserves (already limited in vitamin A-deficient subjects), reduced [serum](../glossary#serum) retinol concentrations, and increased loss of vitamin A in the urine [(37)](#reference37). Infection with the measles virus was found to precipitate conjunctival and [corneal](../glossary#cornea) damage, leading to blindness in children with poor vitamin A status [(41)](#reference41). Conversely, vitamin A deficiency can be considered a nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency disease [(42)](#reference42). Even children who are only mildly deficient in vitamin A have a higher incidence of respiratory complications and diarrhea, as well as a higher rate of mortality from measles infection compared to children consuming sufficient vitamin A [(43)](#reference43). Because vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may decrease both the severity and incidence of measles complications in developing countries (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)), WHO recommends that children aged at least one year receive 200,000 IU of vitamin A (60 mg RAE) for two consecutive days in addition to standard treatment when they are infected with measles virus and live in areas of vitamin A deficiency [(44)](#reference44). A recent [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), conducted in 2,774 Colombian children (ages, 5-12 years old) followed for a median 128 days, also reported an inverse relationship between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) retinol concentrations and rates of diarrhea with vomiting and cough with fever, the latter being a strong predictor of influenza infection (flu) [(45)](#reference45). A review of five [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies that included 7,528 [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-positive pregnant or breast-feeding women found no substantial benefit of vitamin A supplementation in reducing the mother-to-child transmission of HIV [(46)](#reference46). One early [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) found that HIV-infected women who were vitamin A deficient were three to four times more likely to transmit HIV to their infants [(47)](#reference47). Yet, no trial to date has provided any information on potential adverse effects of vitamin A supplementation on mother-to-child HIV transmission [(48)](#reference48). In North and West Africa, vitamin A deficiency and [iodine](../minerals/iodine) deficiency induced- [goiter](../glossary#goiter) can coexist in up to 50% of children. The response to iodine [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) in iodine-deficient populations appears to depend on various nutritional factors, including vitamin A status [(49, 50)](#reference49). Vitamin A deficiency in animal models was found to interfere with the [pituitary](../glossary#pituitary-gland)- [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) axis by (1) increasing the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) thyroid-stimulating [hormone](../glossary#hormone) (TSH) by the pituitary gland, (2) increasing the size of the thyroid gland, (3) reducing iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and impairing the synthesis and iodination of thyroglobulin, and (4) increasing circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones (reviewed in [51](#reference51)). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 138 children with concurrent vitamin A and iodine deficiencies found that the severity of vitamin A deficiency was associated with higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of goiter and higher concentrations of circulating TSH and thyroid hormones [(50)](#reference50). These children received iodine-enriched salt with either vitamin A (200,000 IU at baseline and 5 months) or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), 10-month trial. This vitamin A supplementation significantly decreased TSH concentration and thyroid volume compared to placebo [(50)](#reference50). In another trial, supplementation of vitamin A to iodine-deficient children had no additional effect to iodine on thyroid status compared to placebo, but vitamin A supplementation alone (without iodine) reduced the volume of the thyroid gland, as well as TSH and thyroglobulin concentrations [(52)](#reference52). Phrynoderma or follicular hyperkeratosis is a skin condition characterized by an excessive production of keratin in hair follicles. The lesions first appear on the extremities, shoulders, and buttocks and may spread over the entire body in the severest cases [(53)](#reference53). While vitamin A deficiency may contribute to the occurrence of phrynoderma, the condition has been strongly associated with multiple nutritional deficiencies and is considered a sign of general malnutrition. A rare case of esophagitis ( [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus)) has recently been attributed to hyperkeratosis secondary to vitamin A deficiency [(54)](#reference54). Also, vitamin A deficiency affects [iron](../minerals/iron) mobilization, impairs [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), and precipitates iron deficiency anemia that is only alleviated with [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) of both vitamin A and iron (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)) [(27)](#reference27). Vitamin A can be obtained from food as preformed vitamin A in animal products or as provitamin A carotenoids in fruit and vegetables (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Yet, while preformed vitamin A is effectively absorbed, stored, and [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) to form retinol, provitamin A [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids) like -carotene are less easily digested and absorbed, and must be converted to retinol and other retinoids by the body after uptake into the small intestine. The efficiency of conversion of provitamin A carotenes into retinol is highly variable, depending on factors such as food matrix, food preparation, and one's digestive and absorptive capacities [(55)](#reference55). The most recent international standard of measure for vitamin A is retinol activity equivalents (RAE), which represent vitamin A activity as retinol. It has been determined that 2 micrograms (g) of -carotene in oil provided as a [supplement](../glossary#supplement) could be converted by the body to 1 g of retinol giving it an RAE ratio of 2:1. However, 12 g of -carotene from food are required to provide the body with 1 g of retinol, giving dietary -carotene an RAE ratio of 12:1. Other provitamin A carotenoids in food are less easily absorbed than -carotene, resulting in RAE ratios of 24:1. RAE ratios are shown in Table 1 [(56)](#reference56). |Quantity Consumed||Quantity Bioconverted to Retinol||RAE Ratio| |1 supplemental vitamin A||1 g of retinol*||1:1| |2 g of supplemental -carotene||1 g of retinol||2:1| |12 g of dietary -carotene||1 g of retinol||12:1| |24 g of dietary -carotene||1 g of retinol||24:1| of dietary -cryptoxanthin||1 g of retinol||24:1| |*1 IU is equivalent to 0.3 microgram (g) of retinol, and 1 g of retinol is equivalent to 3.33 IU of retinol.| The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A was revised by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2001. The RDA is based on the Estimated Average Requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)), which is defined as the biological requirement for 50% of the population. The RDA is the recommended intake needed by nearly all of the population to ensure adequate [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) stores of vitamin A in the body (20 g/g for four months if the person consumes a vitamin A-deficient diet) to support normal reproductive function, immune function, [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), and vision (for details of calculations, see [56](#reference56)). Table 2 lists the RDA values in micrograms (g) of Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE) months|| 400 ( | Preterm infants are born with inadequate body stores of vitamin A, placing them at [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing diseases of the eye and the respiratory and [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tracts. About one-third of preterm infants born between 22 and 28 weeks of gestation develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease that can be fatal or result in life-long morbidities in survivors. A few [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have investigated the effect of postnatal vitamin A supplementation on the incidence of BPD and the risk of mortality in very low birth weight infants (1,500 g) requiring respiratory support [(57-59)](#reference57). In the largest, multicenter, randomized, blinded, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial that enrolled 807 extremely low birth weight (ELBW; 1,000 g) preterm newborns, the intramuscular administration of 5,000 IU of vitamin A three times a week for four weeks significantly, though modestly, reduced the risk of BPD or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (gestational age plus chronological age) [(58)](#reference58). While vitamin A supplementation was included in some neonatal programs after this trial [(60)](#reference60), a national shortage in vitamin A supply that has affected US neonatal intensive care units since 2010 has led to a significant reduction in the use of vitamin A supplementation in premature newborns (401-1,000 g at birth) with respiratory failure [(61, 62)](#reference61). However, a [retrospective analysis](../glossary#retrospective-study) of US nationwide data from 6,210 preterm infants born between 2010 and 2012 found that a reduction in vitamin A [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) from 27.2% to 2.1% during the same period had no significant impact on the incidence of BPD or death before hospital discharge [(62)](#reference62). In another retrospective study, the nonrandomized use of vitamin A supplementation with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) was found to result in a lower incidence of BPD (but not mortality) compared to iNO therapy alone in preterm newborns with a birth weight of 750-999 g [(63)](#reference63). Neurodevelopment index scores at one year of age were also improved in the vitamin A group of newborns weighing 500-749 g at birth. Yet, caution is advised with the interpretation of the results, especially because the trial was not designed to assess the effect of vitamin A. In Germany, one large, multicenter, randomized study - the NeoVitaA trial - is under way to explore the effect of high-dose oral vitamin A (5,000 IU/kg/day) for 28 days on the incidence of BPD and mortality at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age [(64)](#reference64). While high doses of vitamin A during early pregnancy can cause birth defects (see [Safety](#safety)), vitamin A supplementation during late pregnancy may improve maternal and fetal vitamin A status [(65)](#reference65). Although a few randomized controlled trials have failed to show an effect on maternal and neonatal mortality [(66)](#reference66), more research is required to assess whether vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy reduces BPD incidence in infants. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) evaluating the preventive effect of vitamin A on childhood mortality indicated that vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (200,000 IU every 4 or 6 months) reduced all-cause mortality by 25% (13 studies) and diarrhea-specific mortality by 30% (7 studies) in children aged 6 to 59 months. However, vitamin A administration in this age group had no preventive effect on rates of [pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia)-specific mortality (7 studies), measles-specific mortality (5 studies), or meningitis-specific mortality (3 studies). Moreover, no reduction in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of disease-specific mortality was found in neonates (0 to 28 days of age) and infants 1 to 6 months of age supplemented with vitamin A [(67)](#reference67). Another meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found no evidence of a reduction in mortality risk during infancy when either breast-feeding mothers (7 studies) or infants aged less than six months (9 studies) were supplemented with vitamin A [(68)](#reference68). Current WHO policy recommends vitamin A supplementation at routine vaccination contacts in children after six months of age living in regions at high risk of vitamin A deficiency. Supplementation with high doses of vitamin A 100,000 IU (30 mg RAE) for infants 6 to 11 months of age and 200,000 IU (60 mg RAE) for children 12 to 59 months of age is thought to provide adequate protection for up to six months [(38)](#reference38). A recent placebo-controlled trial in Guinea-Bissau, which randomized 7,587 children (ages, 6 to 23 months old) to receive vitamin A supplementation at one vaccination contact, evaluated the co-administration of vitamin A and vaccines on child mortality [(69)](#reference69). The study found that vitamin A supplementation had no effect on overall mortality rates, although a six-month follow-up of infants given both measles and DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccinations showed a significant reduction in mortality in girls, but not in boys [(69)](#reference69). Although neonatal vitamin A supplementation is not currently recommended, a trial assessing the benefit of early measles vaccination at 4.5 rather than the usual 9 months of age found no reduction in mortality rates when children had received neonatal vitamin A supplementation [(70)](#reference70). The recent pooled analysis of previous trials of vitamin A supplementation (VITA I-III) in Guinea-Bissau confirmed that vitamin A supplementation may interfere with vaccines. Specifically, compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo), neonatal vitamin A supplementation was associated with a significant increase in mortality rates in boys (but not in girls) when children had received measles virus vaccination at 4.5 months of age rather than the usual 9 months of age [(71)](#reference71). The timing of vitamin A interventions needs to be further examined in relation to the timing of vaccinations in order to maximize their benefits. An earlier [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examining specifically the role of vitamin A supplementation in 2,069 children with measles found no overall reduction on the [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality [(72)](#reference72). Yet, the pooled analysis of four studies that reported the age distribution of participants found an 83% lower risk of mortality with two doses of 200,000 IU of vitamin A in children younger than two years. In addition, the pooled analysis of three studies indicated a 67% reduction in the risk of [pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia)-led mortality [(72)](#reference72). Similar to WHO and UNICEF guidelines, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin A supplementation for children over six months of age when they are infected with measles while malnourished, immunodeficient, or are at risk of measles complications or vitamin A deficiency disorders [(73)](#reference73). Although measles infection has been associated with vitamin A deficiency and blindness, there is currently no evidence to suggest that vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of blindness in children infected with measles [(74)](#reference74). Studies in cell culture and animal models have documented the capacity for natural and synthetic retinoids to reduce [carcinogenesis](../glossary#carcinogenesis) significantly in skin, breast, liver, [colon](../glossary#colon), [prostate](../glossary#prostate), and other sites. However, the results of human studies examining the relationship between the consumption of preformed vitamin A and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) do not currently suggest that consuming vitamin A at intakes greater than the RDA benefit in the prevention of cancer [(2)](#reference2). The results of the -Carotene And Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) have suggested that high-dose supplementation of preformed vitamin A and -carotene should be avoided in people at high [risk](../glossary#risk) for lung [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(75)](#reference75). In the CARET study, about 9,000 people (smokers and people with asbestos exposure) were assigned a daily regimen of 25,000 IU (7,500 g RAE) of retinyl palmitate and 30 mg of -carotene, while a similar number of people were assigned a [placebo](../glossary#placebo). After four years of follow-up, the incidence of lung cancer was 28% higher in the [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) group compared to the placebo group; however, the incidence was not different six years after the intervention ended [(76)](#reference76). A possible explanation for an increase in lung cancer is that the [oxidative](../glossary#oxidation) environment of the lung, created by smoke or asbestos exposure, could give rise to unusual [carotenoid](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids) cleavage products, which might promote [carcinogenesis](../glossary#carcinogenesis) [(77)](#reference77). Interestingly, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 749 lung cancer cases and 679 controls from the CARET trial found a significant association between lung cancer risk reduction and high [vitamin D](vitamin-D) intakes (400 IU/day) in individuals who received the active CARET supplements or in those with vitamin A intakes equal to or greater than 1,500 g RAE/day [(78)](#reference78). Further, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including a total of 202,924 participants at low risk of lung cancer, indicated that supplementation with retinol and/or -carotene had no significant effect on lung cancer incidence [(79)](#reference79). At present, it seems unlikely that increased intake of preformed vitamin A (e.g., retinol) could lower the risk of lung cancer. Retinoids may be used at [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) to treat several conditions, including, acute promyelocytic [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia), retinitis pigmentosa, and various skin diseases. It is important to note that treatment with high doses of natural or synthetic retinoids overrides the body's own control mechanisms; therefore, retinoid therapies are associated with potential side effects and toxicities. Additionally, all of the retinoid compounds have been found to cause fetal deformations. Thus, women who have a chance of becoming pregnant should avoid treatment with these medications. Retinoids tend to be very long acting: side effects and birth defects have been reported to occur months after discontinuing retinoid therapy [(2)](#reference2). The retinoids discussed below are prescription drugs and should not be used without medical supervision. Normal [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of myeloid stem cells in the bone marrow gives rise to [platelets](../glossary#platelet), red blood cells, and white blood cells (also called [leukocytes](../glossary#leukocyte)) that are important for the immune response. Altered differentiation of myeloid cells can result in the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) of immature white blood cells, giving rise to [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia). Reciprocal [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) translocations involving the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) [gene](../glossary#gene) and the gene coding for retinoic acid [receptor](../glossary#receptor) (RAR) lead to a specific type of leukemia called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The fusion protein PML/RAR represses [transcription](../glossary#transcription) by binding to RARE in the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of retinoid-responsive genes involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Gene repression by PML/RAR is achieved by the recruitment of several [histone](../glossary#histone) receptor, PML/RAR appears to be insensitive to physiological concentrations of retinoic acid (RA) such that only treatments with high doses of all-trans-RA can restore normal differentiation and lead to significant improvements and complete remission in some APL patients [(80)](#reference80). More information on APL treatment programs can be found in the [National Cancer Institute website](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/childAML/HealthProfessional/page6). Both natural and synthetic retinoids have been used as pharmacologic agents to treat disorders of the skin. Acitretin is a synthetic retinoid that has been proven useful in combination treatments for [psoriasis](../glossary#psoriasis) [(81)](#reference81). [Topical](../glossary#topical) tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) and oral isotretinoin vulgaris](../glossary#acne-vulgaris) [(82, 83)](#reference82). [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of skin [epithelial](../glossary#epithelium) cells, as well as the production of [sebum](../glossary#sebum). Use of [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of retinoids (especially oral isotretinoin) by pregnant women causes birth defects and is therefore contraindicated prior to and during pregnancy (see [Safety in pregnancy](#safety-pregnancy)). For more information on the use of retinoids in the management of acne, see the article on [Vitamin A and Skin Health](../micronutrients-health/skin-health/nutrient-index/vitamin-A). Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects approximately 1.5 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of inherited blindness. RP describes a broad spectrum of genetic disorders that result in the progressive loss of photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) in the [retina](../glossary#retina) of the eye [(84)](#reference84). While at least 45 loci have been associated with RP, [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the rhodopsin [gene](../glossary#gene) (RHO), the usherin gene (USH2A), and the RP GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) account for about 30% of all RP cases [(85)](#reference85). Early symptoms of RP include impaired dark adaptation and night blindness, followed by the progressive loss of peripheral and central vision over time [(85)](#reference85). The results of only one [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 601 patients with common forms of RP indicated that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 15,000 IU/day of retinyl palmitate (4,500 g RAE) significantly slowed the loss of retinal function over a period of four to six years [(86)](#reference86). In contrast, supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin E (dl--tocopherol) modestly but significantly increased the loss of retinal function, suggesting that patients with common forms of RP may benefit from long-term vitamin A supplementation but should avoid high-dose vitamin E supplementation. Up to 12 years of follow-up in these patients did not reveal any signs of liver toxicity as a result of excess vitamin A intake [(87)](#reference87). Because neither children younger than 18 years nor adults affected by less common forms of RP were included in the trial, no formal recommendation about vitamins A and E could be made [(85)](#reference85). High-dose vitamin A supplementation to slow the course of RP requires medical supervision and must be discontinued if there is a possibility of pregnancy (see [Safety](#safety)). Free retinol is not generally found in food. Retinyl esters (including retinyl palmitate) are the storage form of retinol in animals and thus the main [precursors](../glossary#precursor) of retinol in food from animals. Plants contain [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids), some of which are precursors for vitamin A (e.g., -carotene, -carotene, and -cryptoxanthin). Yellow- and orange-colored vegetables contain significant quantities of carotenoids. Green vegetables also contain carotenoids, though yellow-to-red pigments are masked by the green pigment of chlorophyll [(1)](#references). The table below lists a number of good food sources of vitamin A, including fruit and vegetables, along with their vitamin A content. The retinol activity is indicated in micrograms of retinol activity equivalents (g RAE). For information on this unit of measurement, see the section on [RAE](#RAE). In addition, use [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) to check foods for their content of carotenoids without vitamin A activity, such as lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. Vitamin A may still be listed on food and supplement labels in international units versus as g RAE ('mcg' on labels). [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) also provides the vitamin A content of food sources using the vitamin A international unit (IU). Yet, contrary to RAE, the number of IUs of vitamin A does not reflect the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of vitamin A from different food sources. Conversion rates between IUs and g RAE are set as follows: 1 IU of retinol is equivalent to 0.3 g RAE 1 IU of supplemental -carotene is equivalent to 0.3 g RAE 1 IU of dietary -carotene is equivalent to 0.05 g RAE 1 IU of -carotene or -cryptoxanthin to 0.025 g RAE Thus, in Table 3, the number of IUs of vitamin A in carotenoid-containing food (numbers in italics) can be obtained by multiplying the RAE by approximately 20. |Food||Serving||Preformed Vitamin A (Retinol), g||Vitamin A, g cup (8 milk (vitamin intake level ( | The principal forms of preformed vitamin A in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are retinyl palmitate and retinyl acetate. -Carotene is also a common source of vitamin A in supplements, and many supplements provide a combination of retinol and -carotene [(88)](#reference88). If a percentage of the total vitamin A content of a supplement comes from -carotene, this information is included in the Supplement Facts label under vitamin A (Figure 4). Some multivitamin supplements available in the US provide up to 5,000 IU of preformed vitamin A, corresponding to 1,500 g RAE, which is substantially more than the current [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A. This is due to the fact that the Daily Values (DV) used by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for supplement labeling are based on the RDA established in 1968 rather than the most recent RDA, and multivitamin supplements typically provide 100% of the DV for most nutrients. Because retinol intakes of 5,000 IU/day (1,500 g RAE) may be associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) in older adults (see [Safety](#safety)), some companies have reduced the retinol content in their multivitamin supplements to 2,500 IU (750 g RAE). The condition caused by vitamin A toxicity is called hypervitaminosis A. It is caused by overconsumption of preformed vitamin A, not [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids). Preformed vitamin A is rapidly absorbed and slowly cleared from the body. Therefore, toxicity from preformed vitamin A may result acutely from high-dose exposure over a short period of time or chronically from a much lower intake [(2)](#reference2). Acute vitamin A toxicity is relatively rare, and symptoms include nausea, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, dizziness, dry skin, desquamation, and [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) [edema](../glossary#edema). Signs of chronic toxicity include dry itchy skin, desquamation, anorexia, weight loss, headache, cerebral edema, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, [anemia](../glossary#anemia), and bone and joint pain. Also, symptoms of vitamin A toxicity in infants include bulging fontanels. Severe cases of hypervitaminosis A may result in liver damage, [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage), and coma. Generally, signs of toxicity are associated with long-term consumption of vitamin A in excess of 10 times the RDA (8,000-10,000 g RAE/day or 25,000-33,000 IU/day). However, more research is necessary to determine if [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) vitamin A toxicity is a concern in certain populations [(89)](#reference89). There is evidence that some populations may be more susceptible to toxicity at lower doses, including the elderly, chronic alcohol users, and some people with a genetic predisposition to high [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) [(90)](#reference90). In January 2001, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) of vitamin A intake for adults at 3,000 g RAE (10,000 IU)/day of of preformed vitamin A is equivalent to 0.3 g RAE, and 1 g RAE is equivalent to 3.33 IU of preformed vitamin A| Although normal fetal development requires sufficient vitamin A intake, consumption of excess preformed vitamin A (such as retinol) during early pregnancy is known to cause birth defects. No increase in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin A-associated birth defects has been observed at doses of preformed vitamin A from [supplements](../glossary#supplement) below 3,000 g RAE/day (10,000 IU/day) [(56)](#reference56). Of note, in 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended vitamin A supplementation (up to 3,000 g RAE/day or 7,500 g RAE/week) during pregnancy in areas with high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin A deficiency for the prevention of blindness [(91)](#reference91). In industrialized countries, pregnant or potentially pregnant women should monitor their intake of vitamin A from [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food and food naturally high in preformed vitamin A (e.g., liver) and avoid taking daily multivitamin supplements that contain more than 1,500 g RAE (5,000 IU) of vitamin A. There is no evidence that consumption of vitamin A from -carotene might increase the risk of birth defects. The synthetic derivative of retinol, isotretinoin, is known to cause serious birth defects and should not be taken during pregnancy or if there is a possibility of becoming pregnant [(82)](#reference82). Tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), another retinol derivative, is prescribed as a topical preparation that is applied to the skin. Although percutaneous absorption of [topical](../glossary#topical) tretinoin is minimal, its use during pregnancy is not recommended [(92)](#reference92). Results from some [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have suggested that long-term intakes of preformed vitamin A in excess of 1,500 g RAE/day (equivalent to 5,000 IU/day of vitamin A as retinol) were associated with reduced [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporotic](../glossary#osteoporosis) [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older adults [(93-95)](#reference93). However, other investigators failed to observe such detrimental effects on BMD and/or fracture risk [(96-98)](#reference96). The recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four prospective studies, including nearly 183,000 participants over 40 years of age, found that highest vs. lowest [quintiles](../glossary#quintile) of retinol (preformed vitamin A) intake significantly increased the risk of hip fracture [(99)](#reference99). Only excess intakes of retinol, not -carotene, were associated with adverse effects on bone health. Besides, the pooled analysis of four observational studies also indicated that a U-shaped relationship between circulating retinol and risk of hip fracture, suggesting that both elevated and reduced retinol concentrations in the blood were associated with an increased risk of hip fracture [(99)](#reference99). To date, limited experimental data have suggested that vitamin A (as all-trans-retinoic acid) may affect the development of [bone-remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling) cells and stimulate bone matrix degradation ( [resorption](../glossary#resorption)) (reviewed in [100](#reference100)). Vitamin A may also interfere with the ability of [vitamin D](vitamin-D) to maintain [calcium](../minerals/calcium) balance [(101)](#reference101). In the large Women's Health Initiative (WHI) prospective study, the highest vs. lowest quintile of retinol intake (1,426 g/day vs. <474 g/day) was found to be significantly associated with increased risk of fracture only in women with the lowest vitamin D intakes (440 IU/day) [(102)](#reference102). Until supplements and fortified food are reformulated to reflect the current RDA for vitamin A, it is advisable for older individuals to consume multivitamin supplements that contain no more than 2,500 IU (750 g) of preformed vitamin A (usually labeled vitamin A acetate or vitamin A palmitate) and no more than 2,500 IU of additional vitamin A as -carotene. Chronic alcohol consumption results in depletion of liver stores of vitamin A and may contribute to alcohol-induced liver damage ( [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis)) [(103)](#reference103). However, the liver toxicity of preformed vitamin A (retinol) is enhanced by chronic alcohol consumption, thus narrowing the therapeutic window for vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in alcoholics [(103)](#reference103). Oral contraceptives that contain [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and progestin increase retinol binding protein (RBP) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by the liver, increasing the export of all-trans-retinol/RBP complex to the circulation. Whether this increases the dietary requirement of vitamin A is not known. Also, the use of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering medications (like cholestyramine and colestipol), as well as orlistat, mineral oil, and the fat substitute, olestra, which interfere with fat absorption, may affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A [(88)](#reference88). Further, intake of large doses of vitamin A may decrease the absorption of [vitamin K](vitamin-K). isotretinoin, should not be used in combination with single-nutrient vitamin A [supplements](../glossary#supplement), because they may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin A toxicity [(88)](#reference88). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A (700 g RAE/day for women and 900 g RAE/day for men) is sufficient to support normal [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), immune function, and vision. However, following the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement daily could supply as much as 5,000 IU (1,500 g RAE)/day of vitamin A as retinol, the amount that has been associated with adverse effects on bone health in older adults. For this reason, we recommend taking a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) that provides no more than 2,500 IU (750 g) of preformed vitamin A (usually labeled vitamin A acetate or vitamin A palmitate) and no more than 2,500 IU of additional vitamin A as -carotene. High potency vitamin A supplements should not be used without medical supervision due to the [risk](../glossary#risk) of toxicity. Presently, there is little evidence that the requirement for vitamin A in older adults differs from that of younger adults. Additionally, vitamin A toxicity may occur at lower doses in older adults than in younger adults. Further, data from observational studies suggested an association between intakes of preformed vitamin A in excess of 1,500 g RAE (5,000 IU)/day and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older people (see [Safety](#safety)). Yet, following the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement daily could supply as much as 5,000 IU/day of retinol, the amount that has been associated with adverse effects on bone health in older adults. For this reason, we recommend taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement that provides (750 g) of preformed vitamin A (usually labeled vitamin A acetate or vitamin A palmitate) and no more than 2,500 IU of additional vitamin A as -carotene. As for all age groups, high potency vitamin A supplements should not be used without medical supervision due to the risk of toxicity.

The term vitamin B6 refers to six common forms, namely pyridoxal, pyridoxine (pyridoxol), pyridoxamine, and 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the bioactive [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) form involved in over 4% of all [enzymatic](../glossary#enzyme) reactions (Figure 1) [(1-3)](#references). Vitamin B6 must be obtained from the diet because humans cannot synthesize it. PLP plays a vital role in the function of over 100 enzymes that catalyze essential chemical reactions in the human body [(4)](#reference4). PLP-dependent enzymes have been classified into five structural classes known as Fold Type I-V [(5)](#reference5): The many biochemical reactions catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes are involved in essential biological processes, such as [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) and [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) biosynthesis, as well as [fatty functions for [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen) phosphorylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the release of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) from stored glycogen. Much of the PLP in the human body is found in muscle bound to glycogen phosphorylase. PLP is also a coenzyme for reactions that generate glucose from amino acids, a process known as [gluconeogenesis](../glossary#gluconeogenesis) [(6)](#reference6). In the brain, the PLP-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) aromatic [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) reactions catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes [(7)](#reference7). PLP functions as a [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, which is involved in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [heme](../glossary#heme), an [iron](../minerals/iron)-containing component of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin). Hemoglobin is found in red blood cells and is critical to their ability to transport oxygen throughout the body. Both pyridoxal and PLP are able to bind to the hemoglobin molecule and affect its ability to pick up and release oxygen. However, the impact of this on normal oxygen delivery to tissues is not known [(6, 8)](#reference6). Vitamin B6 deficiency may impair hemoglobin synthesis and lead to microcytic [anemia](../glossary#anemia) [(3)](#reference3). Deficiency in another B vitamin, [niacin](../vitamins/niacin), is easily prevented by adequate dietary intakes. The dietary requirement for niacin and the niacin [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), can be also met, though to a fairly limited extent, by the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of the essential [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) tryptophan in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway (Figure 2). Key reactions in this pathway are PLP-dependent; in particular, PLP is the [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) kynureninase, which [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the conversion of 3-hydroxykynurenine to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid. A reduction in PLP availability appears to primarily affect kynureninase activity, limiting NAD production and leading to higher concentrations of kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and xanthurenic acid in blood and urine (Figure 2) [(9)](#reference9). Thus, while dietary vitamin B6 restriction impairs NAD [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) from tryptophan, adequate PLP levels help maintain NAD formation from tryptophan [(10)](#reference10). The effect of vitamin B6 inadequacy on immune activation and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) may be partly related to the role of PLP in the tryptophan-kynurenine [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) as [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and testosterone, exert their effects in the body by binding to [steroid hormone receptors](../glossary#steroid-hormone-receptor) in the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) of target cells. The nuclear receptors themselves bind to specific regulatory sequences in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and alter the [transcription](../glossary#transcription) of target [genes](../glossary#gene). Experimental studies have uncovered a mechanism by which PLP may affect the activity of steroid receptors and decrease their effects on [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression). It was found that PLP could interact with RIP140/NRIP1, a repressor of nuclear receptors known for its role in reproductive biology [(11)](#reference11). Yet, additional research is needed to confirm that this interaction can enhance RIP140/NRIP1 repressive activity on steroid receptor-mediated gene expression. If the activity of steroid receptors for estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, or other steroid hormones can be inhibited by PLP, it is possible that vitamin B6 status may influence one's risk of developing diseases driven by steroid hormones, such as breast and [prostate](../glossary#prostate) [cancers](../glossary#cancer) [(6)](#reference6). a coenzyme for SHMT, which [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the simultaneous conversions glycine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) to 5,10-methylene THF. The latter molecule is the donor](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) for the generation of dTMP from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) by TYMS. Severe deficiency of vitamin B6 is uncommon. Alcoholics are thought to be most at risk of vitamin B6 deficiency due to low dietary intakes and impaired [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin). In the early 1950s, [seizures](../glossary#seizure) were observed in infants as a result of severe vitamin B6 deficiency caused by an error in the manufacture of infant formula [(7)](#reference7). Abnormal [electroencephalogram](../glossary#electroencephalogram) (EEG) patterns have also been reported in vitamin B6-deficient adults. Other [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms observed in severe vitamin B6 deficiency include irritability, depression, and confusion; additional symptoms include [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the tongue, sores or ulcers of the mouth, and ulcers of the skin at the corners of the mouth [(12)](#reference12). Since vitamin B6 is involved in many aspects of especially in [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) metabolic pathways, an individual's [protein](../glossary#protein) intake is likely to influence the requirement for vitamin B6 [(13)](#reference13). Unlike previous recommendations issued by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine, the most recent [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin B6 was not expressed in terms of protein intake, although the relationship was considered in setting the RDA [(14)](#reference14). The current RDA was revised by the FNB in 1998 and is presented in Table 1. |Life (mg/day)||Females (mg/day)| |Infants||0-6 are metabolism](#tryptophan-metabolism)). This pathway is known to be activated during pro- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) immune responses and plays a critical role in immune tolerance of the fetus during pregnancy [(15)](#reference15). Key intermediates in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway are involved in the regulation of immune responses. Several tryptophan derivatives have been found to induce the death ( [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis)) or block the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) of certain types of immune cells, such as [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) (in particular T-helper 1). They can also inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) (reviewed in [15](#reference15)). There is evidence to suggest that adequate vitamin B6 intake is important for optimal immune system function, especially in older individuals [(16, 17)](#reference16). Yet, chronic inflammation that triggers tryptophan degradation and underlies many diseases (e.g., [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and [cancers](../glossary#cancer)) may precipitate the loss of PLP and increase vitamin B6 requirements. Additional research is needed to evaluate whether vitamin B6 intakes higher than the current [RDA](../glossary#RDA) could prevent and/or reverse immune system impairments (see also [Vitamin B6 and inflammation](#inflammation)). The use of multivitamin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) (including vitamin B6) has been associated with a 24% lower risk of incidental [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CAD) in a large [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 80,082 women from the US Nurses' Health Study cohort [(18)](#reference18). Using [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire), the authors observed that women in the highest quintile of vitamin B6 intakes from both food and supplements (median, 4.6 mg/day) had a 34% lower risk of CAD compared to those in the lowest quintile (median, 1.1 mg/day). CAD is characterized by the abnormal [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing) of [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-artery) (generally due to [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis)), which can result in a potentially fatal [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (heart attack). More recently, a prospective study that followed a Japanese cohort of over 40,000 middle-aged individuals for 11.5 years reported a 48% lower risk of myocardial infarction in those in the highest (mean, 1.6 mg/day) versus lowest quintile (mean, 1.3 mg/day) of in non-supplement users [(19)](#reference19). Early an between suboptimal pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) plasma level, elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) blood level, and increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(20-22)](#reference20). More recent research has confirmed that low plasma PLP status is a risk factor for CAD. In a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study), which included 184 participants with CAD and 516 healthy controls, low plasma PLP levels (<30 nanomoles/liter) were associated with a near doubling of CAD risk when compared to higher PLP levels (30 nanomoles/liter) [(23)](#reference23). In a nested case-control study based on the Nurses' Health Study cohort and including 144 cases of myocardial infarction (of which 21 were fatal), women in the highest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of blood PLP levels (70 nanomoles/liter) had a 79% lower risk of myocardial infarction compared to those in the lowest quartile (<27.9 nanomoles/liter) [(24)](#reference24). Even moderately elevated levels of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in the blood have been associated with increased risk for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD), including cardiac insufficiency acids](../glossary#amino-acid), including [methionine](../glossary#methionine), released. Methionine is an essential amino acid and [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for most [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, including the methylation of [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [RNA](../glossary#RNA), proteins, and [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) (Figure 4). Homocysteine is an intermediate in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of methionine. Healthy individuals utilize two different pathways to regenerate methionine from homocysteine in the methionine remethylation cycle (Figure 5). One pathway relies on the [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12)-dependent methionine synthase and the methyl donor, 5-methyl folate derivative), to convert homocysteine back to The other reaction is [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyze) by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, which uses betaine as a source of methyl groups for the formation of methionine from homocysteine. Moreover, two PLP-dependent enzymes are required to convert homocysteine to the amino synthase 5). Thus, the amount of homocysteine in the blood may be influenced by nutritional status of at least three B vitamins, namely [folate](../vitamins/folate), [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12), and vitamin B6. Deficiencies in one or all of these B vitamins may affect both remethylation and transsulfuration processes and result in abnormally elevated homocysteine levels. An early study found that vitamin B6 supplementation could lower blood homocysteine levels after an oral dose of methionine was given (i.e., a methionine load test) [(26)](#reference26), but vitamin B6 supplementation might not be effective in decreasing fasting levels of homocysteine. In a recent study conducted in nine healthy young volunteers, the rise of homocysteine during the postprandial period (after a meal) was found to be greater with marginal vitamin B6 deficiency (mean [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP level of 19 nanomoles/liter) as compared to vitamin B6 sufficiency (mean PLP level of 49 nanomoles/liter) [(27)](#reference27). The authors reported an increased rate of cystathionine synthesis with vitamin B6 restriction, suggesting that homocysteine catabolism in the transsulfuration may be maintained or enhanced in response to a marginal reduction in PLP availability. Yet, the flux ratio between methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway appeared to favor homocysteine clearance by remethylation rather than transsulfuration in six out of nine participants [(27)](#reference27). Numerous [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), many in subjects with existing [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) and vascular dysfunction, have demonstrated that supplementation with folic acid, alone or combined with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, could effectively reduce fasting plasma homocysteine concentrations. In 19 intervention studies recently included in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis), reductions in homocysteine level in the blood following B-vitamin supplementation ranged between 7.6% and 51.7% compared to baseline levels [(28)](#reference28). In contrast, studies supplementing individuals with only vitamin B6 have usually failed to show an effect on fasting levels of homocysteine [(29, 30)](#reference29). Of the three supplemental B vitamins, folic acid appears to be the main determinant in the regulation of fasting homocysteine levels when there is no coexisting deficiency of vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 [(31)](#reference31). Yet, the effect of homocysteine lowering on CVD risk reduction is debated. A recent meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials reported a 10% reduction in stroke events with supplemental B vitamins, with greater benefits for high-risk subjects (e.g., those with kidney disease) [(32)](#reference32). However, most [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analyses of B-vitamin intervention studies to date have indicated a lack of causality between the decrease of fasting homocysteine levels and the prevention of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(28](#reference28), [33-35)](#reference33). Moreover, B-vitamin supplementation trials in high-risk subjects have not resulted in significant changes in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, two markers of vascular health used to assess [atherosclerotic](../glossary#atherosclerosis) progression [(36)](#reference36). Finally, in the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial (WENBIT), a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 87 subjects CAD, vitamin B6 supplementation (40 mg/day of pyridoxine) for a median of 10 months had no effect on coronary [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) progression, assessed by quantitative [angiography](../glossary#angiography) [(37)](#reference37). It has been suggested that antiplatelet therapy used in the primary prevention of CVD might interfere with the effect of homocysteine lowering by B vitamins on CVD risk [(38)](#reference38). In this context, a post-hoc subgroup analysis of the multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled VITATOPS trial [(39)](#reference39) proposed that the small benefit of homocysteine-lowering by B vitamins might be cancelled in patients treated with antiplatelet drugs [(40)](#reference40). Yet, the benefit of B-vitamin supplementation in primary prevention (i.e., in non-antiplatelet users) remains to be established. A growing body of evidence currently suggests that low vitamin B6 status may increase the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) through mechanisms independent of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) lowering [(41-43)](#reference41). Markers of immune activation and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) have been associated with [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) (homocysteine levels individuals with [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CAD) [(44)](#reference44). In fact, inflammation is involved in the early steps of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) in which [lipids](../glossary#lipids) deposit in plaques (known as atheromas) within arterial walls and increase the risk of CAD [(45)](#reference45). In a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 267 patients with CAD and 475 healthy controls, [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP concentrations were inversely correlated with the levels of two markers of systemic inflammation, [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) and fibrinogen [(46)](#reference46). suboptimal PLP levels (<36.3 nanomoles/liter) might contribute to an increased risk of CAD independently of inflammation since the risk was unchanged after adjustment for inflammation markers (unadjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.71 vs. multivariate adjusted OR: 1.73). Furthermore, the analysis of inflammation markers in 2,686 participants of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 indicated that serum CRP concentrations were inversely related to total vitamin B6 intakes (from both food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)). Specifically, the risk of having serum CRP levels greater than 10 mg/L (corresponding to high inflammatory activity) was 57% higher in individuals with vitamin B6 intakes lower than 2 mg/day compared to those with intakes equal to and above 5 mg/day [(41)](#reference41). In addition, the prevalence of inadequate vitamin B6 status (plasma PLP levels <20 nanomoles/liter) with intakes lower than 5 mg/day was systematically greater in individuals with high versus low serum CRP concentrations (>10 mg/L vs. 3 mg/L), suggesting that inflammation might impair vitamin B6 [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). These observations were confirmed in the study of another cohort (Framingham Offspring Study) in which vitamin B6 status was linked to an overall inflammatory score based on the levels of 13 inflammation markers (including CRP, fibrinogen, tumor necrosis factor-, and interleukin-6) [(42)](#reference42). Specifically, plasma PLP levels were 24% lower in individuals in the highest versus lowest tertile of inflammatory score. Moreover, the inverse correlation between PLP levels and inflammatory scores remained significant regardless of vitamin B6 intakes, questioning again the nature of this relationship. Interestingly, a recent analysis of data collected in the WENBIT study demonstrated that systemic inflammation was associated with an increased degradation of pyridoxal (PL) to 4-pyridoxic acid (PA), supporting the use of the ratio PA:(PL+PLP) as a marker of both vitamin B6 status and systemic inflammation [(47)](#reference47). Finally, while inflammation may contribute to lower vitamin B6 status, current evidence fails to support a role for vitamin B6 in the control of inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease [(48, 49)](#reference48). A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have linked [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline and [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) in the elderly with inadequate status of [folate](../vitamins/folate), [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12), and vitamin B6 [(50)](#reference50). Yet, the relationship between B vitamins and cognitive health in aging is complicated by both the high prevalence of [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) and signs of systemic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) in elderly people [(51)](#reference51). On the one hand, since inflammation may impair vitamin B6 metabolism, low serum PLP levels may well be caused by processes related to aging rather than by malnutrition. On the other hand, high serum [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) may possibly be a risk factor for cognitive decline in the elderly, although the matter remains under debate. Specifically, the [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 19 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials of B-vitamin supplementation failed to report any difference in several measures of cognitive function between treatment and placebo groups, despite the treatment effectively lowering homocysteine levels [(52)](#reference52). In a recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study of 2,695 [stroke](../glossary#stroke) survivors with or without cognitive impairments, daily supplementation with 2 mg of folic acid, 0.5 mg of vitamin B12, and 25 mg of vitamin B6 for 3.4 years resulted in significant reductions in mean homocysteine levels (by 28% and 43% in cognitively unimpaired and impaired patients, respectively) compared to placebo. Yet, the B-vitamin intervention had no effect on either the incidence of newly diagnosed cognitive impairments or on measures of cognitive performance when compared to placebo [(53)](#reference53). In contrast, another recent placebo-controlled trial found that a daily B-vitamin regimen that led to significant homocysteine lowering in high-risk elderly individuals could limit the progressive [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) of [gray matter](../glossary#gray-matter) brain regions associated with the AD process [(54)](#reference54). Yet, the authors attributed the changes in homocysteine levels primarily to vitamin B12. Because of mixed findings, it is presently unclear whether supplementation with B vitamins might blunt cognitive decline in the elderly. Evidence is needed to determine whether marginal B-vitamin deficiencies, which are relatively common in the elderly, even contribute to age-associated declines in cognitive function, or whether both result from processes associated with aging and/or disease. Late-life depression is a common disorder sometimes occurring after acute illnesses, such as hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) or [stroke](../glossary#stroke) [(55, 56)](#reference55). Coexistence of symptoms of depression and low vitamin B6 status ( [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP level 20 nanomoles/liter) In a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 3,503 free-living people aged 65 and older from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, total vitamin B6 intakes (but not dietary intakes alone) were [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the incidence of depressive symptoms during a mean follow-up period of 7.2 years [(59)](#reference59). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 563 individuals who suffered from a recent stroke, daily supplementation of 2 mg of folic acid, 0.5 mg of vitamin B12, and 25 mg of vitamin B6 halved the risk of developing a major depressive episode during a mean follow-up period of 7.1 years [(60)](#reference60). This reduction in risk was associated with a 25% lower level of plasma [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in supplemented patients compared to controls. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate whether B vitamins could be included in the routine management of older people at high risk for depression. Chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) that underlies most [cancers](../glossary#cancer) may enhance vitamin B6 degradation (see [Vitamin B6 and inflammation](#inflammation)). In addition, because PLP is the [methionine](../glossary#methionine) cycle, [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism), and thymidylate [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), low vitamin B6 status might affect these pathways and potentially increase the risk for chronic conditions. The [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of nine [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found either inverse or associations between vitamin B6 intakes and [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) (CRC) risk [(61)](#reference61). Inconsistent evidence regarding the link between vitamin B6 intakes and breast cancer was also recently reported in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(62)](#reference62). Yet, a prospective study that followed nearly 500,000 older adults for nine years observed that the risk of [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) and stomach cancers was lower in participants in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of total vitamin B6 intakes (median values, 2.7 mg/day vs. 1.4 mg/day) [(63)](#reference63). Additionally, a meta-analysis of four nested [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) reported a 48% reduction in CRC risk in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of blood PLP level [(61)](#reference61). Another meta-analysis of five nested case-control studies found higher versus lower [serum](../glossary#serum) PLP levels to be associated with a 29% lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, women [(62)](#reference62). Very few [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials investigating the nature of the association between B vitamins and cancer risk have focused on vitamin B6. Two earlier studies conducted in subjects with [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) failed to observe any benefit of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 (40 mg/day) on CRC risk and mortality (reviewed in [64](#reference64)). A recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study conducted in 1,470 women with high [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) risk showed that daily supplementation with 2.5 mg of [folic acid](../vitamins/folate), 1 mg of [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12), and 50 mg of vitamin B6 for a mean treatment period of 7.3 years had no effect on the risk of developing [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) when compared to placebo [(65)](#reference65). A large [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) examined the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and the occurrence of symptomatic [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones) in women. A group of more than 85,000 women without a prior history of kidney stones were followed over 14 years, and those who consumed 40 mg or more of vitamin B6 daily had only two-thirds the risk of developing kidney stones compared with those who consumed 3 mg or less [(66)](#reference66). However, in a group of more than 45,000 men followed for 14 years, no association was found between vitamin B6 intake and the occurrence of kidney stones [(67)](#reference67). Limited experimental data have suggested that supplementation with high doses of pyridoxamine may help decrease the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones and reduce urinary oxalate levels, an important determinant of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation [(68, 69)](#reference68). Presently, the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and the risk of developing kidney stones requires further study before any recommendations can be made. Vitamin B6 [supplements](../glossary#supplement) at [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) (i.e., doses much larger than those needed to prevent deficiency) have been used in an attempt to treat a wide variety of conditions, some of which are discussed below. A few rare inborn metabolic disorders, including pyridoxine-dependent [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) (PDE) and cause of early-onset epileptic encephalopathies that are found to be responsive to [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of vitamin B6. In individuals affected by PDE and PNPO deficiency, PLP [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) is limited, and treatment with pyridoxine and/or PLP have been used to alleviate or abolish epileptic [seizures](../glossary#seizure) characterizing these conditions [(70, 71)](#reference70). Pyridoxine therapy, along with dietary protein restriction, is also used in the management of vitamin B6 responsive homocystinuria caused by the deficiency of the PLP-dependent enzyme, cystathionine synthase [(72)](#reference72). Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), often referred to as morning sickness, can affect up to 85% of women during early pregnancy and usually lasts between 12 and 16 weeks [(73)](#reference73). Vitamin B6 has been used since the 1940s to treat nausea during pregnancy. Vitamin B6 was originally included in the medication Bendectin, which was prescribed for NVP treatment and later withdrawn from the market due to unproven concerns that it increased the risk for birth defects. Vitamin B6 itself is considered safe during pregnancy and has been used in pregnant women without any evidence of fetal harm [(74)](#reference74). The results of two [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials, including 401 pregnant women that used 25 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for three days [(75)](#reference75) or 10 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for five days [(76)](#reference76), suggested that vitamin B6 may be beneficial in reducing nausea. A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) on NVP symptoms during early pregnancy found [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 to be somewhat effective [(77)](#reference77). It should be noted that NVP usually resolves without any treatment, making it difficult to perform well-controlled trials. More recently, NVP symptoms were evaluated using Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) scores in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 256 pregnant women gestation) suffering from NVP [(78)](#reference78). Supplementation with pyridoxine and the drug doxylamine significantly improved NVP symptoms, as assessed by lower PUQE scores compared to placebo. Moreover, more women supplemented with pyridoxine-doxylamine (48.9%) than placebo-treated (32.8%) asked to continue their treatment at the end of the 15-day trial. The American and Canadian Colleges of Obstetrics and Gynecology have recommended the use of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride, 10 mg) and doxylamine succinate (10 mg) as first-line therapy for NVP [(73)](#reference73). Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a cluster of symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, irritability, moodiness/depression, fluid retention, and breast tenderness, that begin sometime after ovulation (mid-cycle) and subside with the onset of [menstruation](../glossary#menstruation) (the monthly period). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials suggested that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6, up to 100 mg/day, may be of value to treat PMS, including mood symptoms; however, only limited conclusions could be drawn because most of the studies were of poor quality [(79)](#reference79). Another more recent review of 13 randomized controlled studies also emphasized the need for conclusive evidence before recommendations can be made [(80)](#reference80). The importance of PLP-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of several [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) (see [Nervous system function](#nervous-system-function)) has led researchers to consider whether vitamin B6 deficiency may contribute to the onset of depressive symptoms (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). There is limited evidence suggesting that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 may have therapeutic efficacy in the management of depression. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial conducted in 225 elderly patients hospitalized for acute illness, a six-month intervention with daily multivitamin/mineral supplements improved nutritional B-vitamin status and decreased the number and severity of depressive symptoms when compared to placebo [(81)](#reference81). In addition, while supplement intake effectively reduced [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels compared to placebo, the effect of supplementation on depressive symptoms at the end of the trial was greater in treated subjects in the lowest versus highest quartile of homocysteine levels (10 micromoles/liter vs. 16.1 micromoles/liter) [(82)](#reference82). Yet, the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of late-onset depression is unclear and evidence is currently lacking to suggest whether supplemental B vitamins (including vitamin B6) could relieve depressive symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) causes numbness, pain, and weakness of the hand and fingers due to compression of the median nerve at the wrist. It may result from repetitive stress injury of the wrist or from soft-tissue swelling, which sometimes occurs with pregnancy or [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism). Early studies by the same investigator suggested that supplementation with 100-200 mg/day of vitamin B6 for several months might improve CTS symptoms in individuals with low vitamin B6 status [(83, 84)](#reference83). In addition, a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 137 men not taking [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) found that decreased blood levels of PLP were associated with increased pain, tingling, and nocturnal awakening\u2014all symptoms of CTS [(85)](#reference85). However, studies using electrophysiological measurements of median nerve conduction have largely failed to find an association between vitamin B6 deficiency and CTS [(86)](#reference86). While a few studies have noted some symptomatic relief with vitamin B6 supplementation, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have not generally found vitamin B6 to be effective in treating CTS [(86)](#reference86). Yet, despite its equivocal effectiveness, vitamin B6 supplementation is sometimes used in complementary therapy in an attempt to avoid hand surgery. Patients taking high doses of vitamin B6 should be advised by a physician and monitored for vitamin B6-related toxicity symptoms (see [Toxicity](#safety)) [(87)](#reference87). The analysis of data collected in the US NHANES 2003-2004 has indicated that vitamin B6 intakes from food only averaged about 1.9 mg/day [(88)](#reference88). Yet, despite values well above the current [RDA](../glossary#RDA), total vitamin B6 intakes (combining food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) below 2 mg/day appear to be associated with relatively high proportions of low vitamin B6 status in all age groups (see [Supplements](#supplements)). Many plant foods contain a unique form of vitamin B6 called pyridoxine glucoside; this form of vitamin B6 appears to be only about half as [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) as vitamin B6 from other food sources or supplements [(7)](#reference7). Vitamin B6 in a mixed diet has been found to be approximately 75% bioavailable [(14)](#reference14). In most cases, including foods in the diet that are rich in vitamin B6 should supply enough to meet the current RDA. However, those who follow a very restricted vegetarian diet might need to increase their vitamin B6 intake by eating foods [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with vitamin B6 or by taking a supplement. Some foods that are relatively rich in vitamin B6 and their vitamin B6 content in milligrams (mg) are listed in Table 2. For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, serving of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| Vitamin B6 is available as pyridoxine hydrochloride in nanomoles/liter) was reported in 24% of non users of supplements and 11% of supplement users. Moreover, total vitamin B6 intakes (from food and supplements) lower than 2 mg/day were associated with high proportions of low plasma PLP levels: 16% in men aged 13-54 years, 24% in [menstruating](../glossary#menstruation) women, and 26% in individuals aged 65 years and older. Finally, the prevalence of low PLP levels was found to be greater in individuals consuming less than 2 mg/day of vitamin B6 compared to higher intakes. For example, only 14% of men and women aged 65 and older had low PLP values with total vitamin B6 intakes of 2-2.9 mg/day compared to 26% in those consuming less than 2 mg/day of vitamin B6 [(88)](#reference88). Because adverse effects have only been documented from vitamin B6 [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and never from food sources, safety concerning only the supplemental form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is discussed. Although vitamin B6 is a water-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) and is excreted in the urine, long-term supplementation with very high doses of pyridoxine may result in painful [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms known as sensory [neuropathy](../glossary#neuropathy). Symptoms include pain and numbness of the extremities and in severe cases, difficulty walking. Sensory neuropathy typically develops at doses of pyridoxine in excess of 1,000 mg per day. However, there have been a few [case reports](../glossary#case-reports) of individuals who developed sensory neuropathies at doses of less than 500 mg daily over a period of months. Yet, none of the studies in which an objective neurological examination was performed reported evidence of sensory nerve damage at intakes below 200 mg pyridoxine daily [(90)](#reference90). To prevent sensory neuropathy in virtually all individuals, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for pyridoxine at 100 mg/day for adults (Table 3) [(14)](#reference14). Because [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies have generally failed to show therapeutic benefits of high doses of pyridoxine, there is little reason to exceed the of intake should be from food and formula only.| Certain medications interfere with the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of vitamin B6; therefore, some individuals may be vulnerable to a vitamin B6 deficiency if [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 is not taken. In the NHANES 2003-2004 analysis, significantly more current and past users of oral contraceptives (OCs) among [menstruating](../glossary#menstruation) women had low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP levels compared to women who have never used OCs, suggesting that the [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) content of OCs may interfere with vitamin B6 metabolism (see [Side effects of oral contraceptives](#side-effects-oral-contraceptives)) [(88)](#reference88). and anti- [parkinsonian](../glossary#parkinson-disease) drugs like L-Dopa can all form complexes with vitamin B6 and limit its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability), thus creating a functional deficiency. PLP bioavailability may also be reduced by methylxanthines, such as theophylline used to treat certain respiratory conditions [(7)](#reference7). The long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g. celecoxib and naproxen) may also impair vitamin B6 metabolism [(91)](#reference91). Conversely, high doses of vitamin B6 have been found to decrease the efficacy of two [anticonvulsants](../glossary#anticonvulsant), phenobarbital and phenytoin, and of L-Dopa [(6](#reference6), [90)](#reference90). Because of the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) the tryptophan load test (an assay of tryptophan metabolites after an oral dose of tryptophan) has been used as a functional assessment of vitamin B6 status. Abnormal tryptophan load tests in women taking high-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that these women were vitamin B6 deficient, which led to the prescription of high doses of vitamin B6 (100-150 mg/day) to women taking OCs. However, most other indices of vitamin B6 status were normal in women on high-dose OCs, and the [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) content of OCs appeared to be more likely responsible for the abnormality in tryptophan metabolism [(88)](#reference88). Yet, more recently, the use of lower dose formulations has also been associated with vitamin B6 inadequacy [(88](#reference88), [92)](#reference92). Although it is not known whether OCs actually impair vitamin B6 metabolism or merely affect the tissue distribution of PLP, the use of OCs may place women at higher risk of vitamin B6 deficiency when they discontinue OCs and become pregnant [(93)](#reference93). Whether OC users are at higher risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) despite normal [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels also needs to be determined. Finally, although high doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) have demonstrated no benefit in preventing the risk of side effects from OCs [(94)](#reference94), the use of vitamin B6 supplements may be warranted in current and past OC users. The Linus Pauling Institute supports the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin B6. LPI recommends that all adults take a daily [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which usually contains at least 2 mg of vitamin B6. This amount is slightly above the RDA but still 50 times lower than the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) set by the Food and Nutrition Board (see [Safety](#safety)). Early metabolic studies have indicated that the requirement for vitamin B6 in older adults is approximately 2 mg daily [(95)](#reference95). Yet, the analysis of the US population survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 showed that adequate vitamin B6 status and low [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels were associated with total vitamin B6 intakes equal to and above 3 mg/day in people aged 65 years and older [(88)](#reference88). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that older adults take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which provides at least 2.0 mg of vitamin B6 daily.

It is unique among vitamins in that it contains a metal [ion](../glossary#ion), cobalt. For this reason cobalamin is the term used to refer to compounds having vitamin B12 activity. Methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the forms of vitamin B12 used in the human body [(1)](#references). The form of cobalamin used in most nutritional supplements and fortified foods, cyanocobalamin, is readily converted to 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin in the body. In mammals, cobalamin is a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for only L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase [(2)](#reference2). the folate-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), methionine synthase. This enzyme [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid), [methionine](../glossary#methionine), from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine). Methionine in turn is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor used in many biological [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, including the methylation of a number [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [RNA](../glossary#RNA), and [proteins](../glossary#protein) [(3)](#reference3). Aberrant methylation of DNA and which causes alterations in [chromatin](../glossary#chromatin) structure and [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), are a common feature of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) cells. Inadequate function of methionine synthase can lead to an accumulation of homocysteine, which has been associated with increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (Figure 1). 5-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin is required by the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the conversion of L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A to succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA), which then enters the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) (Figure 2). Succinyl-CoA plays an important role in the production of energy from [lipids](../glossary#lipid) and [proteins](../glossary#protein) and is also required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin), the oxygen-carrying pigment in red blood cells [(3)](#reference3). In healthy adults, vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommon, mainly because total body stores can exceed 2,500 g, daily turnover is slow, and dietary intake of only 2.4 g/day is sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin B12 status (see [RDA](#RDA)) [(4)](#reference4). In elderly individuals, vitamin B12 deficiency is more common mainly because of impaired intestinal absorption that can result in marginal to severe vitamin B12 deficiency in this population. Intestinal [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), rather than inadequate dietary intake, can explain most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency [(5)](#reference5). Absorption of vitamin B12 from food requires normal function of the stomach, [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine). Stomach acid and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) free vitamin B12 from food, allowing it to bind to R-protein (also known as transcobalamin-1 or haptocorrin), found in saliva and [gastric](../glossary#gastric) fluids. In the [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline) environment of the small intestine, R-proteins are degraded by pancreatic enzymes, freeing vitamin B12 to bind to intrinsic factor (IF), a protein secreted by specialized cells in the stomach. [Receptors](../glossary#receptor) on the surface of the ileum (final part of the small intestine) take up the IF-B12 complex only in the presence of calcium, which is supplied by the pancreas [(5)](#reference5). Vitamin B12 can also be absorbed by passive diffusion, but this process is very inefficient\u2014only about 1% absorption of the vitamin B12 dose is absorbed passively [(2)](#reference2). The prevalent causes of vitamin B12 deficiency are (1) an [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) condition known as [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia), and (2) a disorder called food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption. Both conditions have been associated with a chronic [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) disease of the stomach known as [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis). [Atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis) is thought to affect 10%-30% of people over 60 years of age [(6)](#reference6). The condition is frequently associated with the presence of autoantibodies directed toward stomach cells (see [Pernicious anemia](#pernicious-anemia)) and/or infection the [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria), Helicobacter [(7)](#reference7). H. pylori infection induces chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the which may to [peptic ulcer disease](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease), atrophic gastritis, and/or [gastric](../glossary#gastric) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) in Diminished gastric function in individuals with atrophic gastritis can result in bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and cause food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption. Vitamin B12 levels in [serum](../glossary#serum), [plasma](../glossary#plasma), and gastric fluids are significantly decreased in individuals with H. pylori infection, and eradication of the bacteria has been shown to significantly improve vitamin B12 serum concentrations [(8)](#reference8). [Pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia) has been estimated to be present in approximately 2% of individuals over 60 years of age [(9)](#reference9). Although [anemia](../glossary#anemia) is often a symptom, the condition is actually the end stage of an [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the stomach known as autoimmune [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis), resulting in destruction of stomach cells by one's own [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) (autoantibodies). Progressive destruction of the cells that line the stomach causes decreased secretion of acid and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) required to release food-bound vitamin B12. Antibodies to intrinsic factor (IF) bind to IF preventing formation of the IF-B12 complex, further inhibiting vitamin B12 absorption. About 20% of the relatives of pernicious anemia patients also have the condition, suggesting a genetic predisposition. It is also thought that H. pylori infection could be involved in initiating the autoimmune response in a subset of individuals [(10)](#reference10). Further, co-occurrence of autoimmune atrophic gastritis with other autoimmune conditions, especially autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), has been reported [(11, 12)](#reference11). Treatment of pernicious anemia generally requires injections of vitamin B12 to bypass intestinal absorption. High-dose oral supplementation is another treatment option, because consuming 1,000 g (1 mg)/day of vitamin B12 orally should result in the absorption of about 10 g/day (1% of dose) by passive diffusion. In fact, high-dose oral therapy is considered to be as effective as intramuscular injection [(4)](#reference4). Food-bound vitamin B12 [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) is defined as an impaired ability to absorb food- or [protein](../glossary#protein)-bound vitamin B12; individuals with this condition can fully absorb the free form [(13)](#reference13). While the condition is the major cause of poor vitamin B12 status in the elderly population, it is usually associated with [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis), a chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the lining of the stomach that ultimately results in the loss of glands in the stomach ( [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy)) and decreased stomach acid production (see [Atrophic gastritis](#atrophic-gastritis)). Because stomach acid is required for the release of vitamin B12 from the proteins in food, vitamin B12 absorption is diminished. Decreased stomach acid production also provides an environment conducive to the overgrowth of [anaerobic](../glossary#anaerobic) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) in the stomach, which further interferes with vitamin B12 absorption [(3)](#reference3). Because vitamin B12 in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) is not bound to protein, and because intrinsic factor (IF) is still available, the absorption of supplemental vitamin B12 is not reduced as it is in [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia). Thus, individuals with food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption do not have an increased requirement for vitamin B12; they simply need it in the crystalline form found in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods and dietary supplements. Other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include surgical resection of the stomach or portions of the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) where [receptors](../glossary#receptor) for the IF-B12 complex are located. Conditions affecting the small intestine, such as [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) ( [celiac disease](../glossary#celiac-disease) and tropical sprue), may also result in vitamin B12 deficiency. Because the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) provides critical [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), as well as calcium required for vitamin B12 absorption, pancreatic insufficiency may contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency. Since vitamin B12 is found only in foods of animal origin, a strict vegetarian (vegan) diet has resulted in cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. Moreover, alcoholics may experience reduced intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 [(2)](#reference2), and individuals with [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)](../glossary#AIDS) appear to be at increased risk of deficiency, possibly related to a failure of the IF-B12 receptor to take up the IF-B12 complex [(3)](#reference3). Further, long-term use of acid-reducing drugs has also been implicated in vitamin B12 deficiency (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Rare cases of inborn errors of vitamin B12 [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) have been reported in the literature (reviewed in [5](#reference5)). Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome is an inherited vitamin B12 [malabsorption syndrome](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) that causes [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorders of variable severity in affected subjects. Similar clinical symptoms are found in individuals with hereditary IF deficiency (also called congenital pernicious anemia) in whom the lack of IF results in the defective absorption of vitamin B12. Additionally, [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting vitamin B12 transport in the body have been identified [(14)](#reference14). Vitamin B12 deficiency results in impairment of the activities of vitamin B12-requiring [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Impaired activity of methionine synthase results in elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels, while impaired activity of L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase results in increased levels of a [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) of methylmalonyl-CoA called methylmalonic acid (MMA). While individuals with mild vitamin B12 deficiency may not experience symptoms, blood levels of homocysteine and/or MMA may be elevated [(15)](#reference15). Diminished activity of methionine synthase in vitamin B12 deficiency inhibits the regeneration of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and traps [folate](../vitamins/folate) in a form that is not usable by the body (Figure 3), resulting in symptoms of folate deficiency even in the presence of adequate folate levels. Thus, in both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies, folate is unavailable to participate in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). This impairment of DNA synthesis affects the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow earlier than other cells, resulting in the production of large, immature, [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin)-poor red blood cells. The resulting [anemia](../glossary#anemia) is known as [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and is the symptom for which the disease, [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia), was named [(3)](#reference3). Supplementation with folic acid will provide enough usable folate to restore normal red blood cell formation. However, if vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause, it will persist despite the resolution of the anemia. Thus, megaloblastic anemia should not be treated with folic acid until the underlying cause has been determined [(16)](#reference16). The [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency include numbness and tingling of the hands and, more commonly, the feet; difficulty walking; memory loss; disorientation; and [dementia](../glossary#dementia) with or without mood changes. Although the progression of neurologic complications is generally gradual, such symptoms may not be reversed with treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency, especially if they have been present for a long time. Neurologic complications are not always associated with [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and are the only clinical symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency in about 25% of cases [(17)](#reference17). Although vitamin B12 deficiency is known to damage the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath covering cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves, the biochemical processes leading to neurological damage in vitamin B12 deficiency are not yet fully understood [(18)](#reference18). Tongue soreness, appetite loss, and constipation have also been associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. The origins of these symptoms are unclear, but they may be related to the stomach [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) underlying some cases of vitamin B12 deficiency and to the progressive destruction of the lining of the stomach [(17)](#reference17). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin B12 was revised by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine in 1998 (Table 1). Because of the increased risk of food-bound vitamin B12 [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) in older adults, the FNB recommended that adults over 50 years of age get most of the RDA from [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food or chronic [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis) and infection by H. pylori can cause deficiency in vitamin B12 secondary to [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) disorders (see [Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency](#deficiency-causes)). However, the occurrence of H. pylori infection and chronic atrophic gastritis did not modify the incidence of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) accidents ( [stroke](../glossary#stroke) and [heart attack](../glossary#myocardial-infarction)) or mortality in a large cohort study of nearly 10,000 men and women over 50 years old [(19)](#reference19). Yet, vitamin B12 status was not assessed in this study, despite the high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in older individuals. [Epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) indicate that even moderately elevated levels of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in the blood raise the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) [(20)](#reference20), though the mechanism by which homocysteine may increase the CVD risk remains the subject of a great deal of research [(21)](#reference21). The amount of homocysteine in the blood is regulated by at least three vitamins: [folate](../vitamins/folate), [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6), and vitamin B12 (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). An early analysis of the results of 12 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) showed that folic acid supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) had the lowering blood homocysteine levels (25% decrease); co-supplementation with folic acid and (500 g/day) provided an additional 7% reduction (32% decrease) in blood homocysteine concentrations [(22)](#reference22). The results of a sequential supplementation trial in 53 men and women indicated that after folic acid supplementation, vitamin B12 became the major determinant of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine levels [(23)](#reference23). It is thought that the elevation of homocysteine levels might be partly due to vitamin B12 deficiency in individuals over 60 years of age. Two studies found blood methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels to be elevated in more than 60% of elderly individuals with elevated homocysteine levels. In the absence of impaired kidney function, an elevated MMA level in conjunction with elevated homocysteine suggests either a vitamin B12 deficiency or a combined vitamin B12 and folate deficiency [(24)](#reference24). Thus, it appears important to evaluate vitamin B12 status, as well as kidney function, in older individuals with elevated homocysteine levels prior to initiating homocysteine-lowering therapy. For more information regarding homocysteine and CVD, see the article on [Folate](folate#homocysteine). Although increased intake of folic acid and vitamin B12 is effective in decreasing [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels, the combined intervention of these B vitamins did not lower risk for [CVD](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Indeed, several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have been conducted to determine whether homocysteine-lowering through folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 supplementation reduces the incidence of CVD. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of data from 11 trials, including nearly 45,000 participants at risk of CVD, showed that B-vitamin supplementation had no significant effect on risk of [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (heart attack) or [stroke](../glossary#stroke), nor did it modify the risk of all-cause mortality [(25)](#reference25). Other meta-analyses that included patients with chronic kidney disease have confirmed the lack of effect of homocysteine-lowering on risk of myocardial infarction and death. However, stroke risk was significantly reduced by 7%-12% with the B-vitamin supplementation (FMD; a surrogate marker of vascular health) in response to homocysteine reduction revealed that B-vitamin supplementation was accompanied by an improved FMD in short-term <8 weeks) but not in long-term studies conducted in subjects with preexisting vascular diseases [(28)](#reference28). Yet, some of the studies included in these meta-analyses did not use vitamin B12, and folate administration on its own has shown a protective role on vascular function and stroke risk [(29)](#reference29). Besides, the high prevalence of [malabsorption disorders](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) and vitamin B12 deficiency in elderly individuals might warrant the use of higher doses of vitamin B12 than those used in these trials [(30)](#reference30); in cases of malabsorption, only high-dose oral therapy or intramuscular injections can overcome vitamin B12 deficiency [(4)](#reference4). [Folate](../vitamins/folate) is required for [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [DNA](../glossary#DNA), and there is evidence that decreased availability of folate results in strands of DNA that are more susceptible to damage. Deficiency of vitamin B12 traps folate in a form that is unusable by the body for DNA synthesis. Both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies result in a diminished capacity for [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions (see [Figure 3](#figure-3) above). Thus, vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to an elevated rate of DNA damage and altered methylation of DNA, both of which are important risk factors for [cancer](../glossary#cancer). A series of studies in young adults and older men indicated that increased levels of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) and decreased levels of vitamin B12 in the blood were associated with a [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) breakage in white blood cells (reviewed in [31](#reference31)). In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, the same biomarker of chromosome breakage was minimized in young adults who were supplemented with 700 g of folic acid and 7 g of vitamin B12 daily in cereal for two months [(32)](#reference32). A compared B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6), and vitamin B12 in 195 women later diagnosed with breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and 195 age-matched, cancer-free women. Among postmenopausal women, the association between blood levels of vitamin B12 and breast cancer suggested a [threshold](../glossary#threshold) effect. The risk of breast cancer was more than doubled in women with [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin B12 levels in the lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) compared to women in the four highest quintiles [(33)](#reference33). However, the [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of this study with three additional case-control studies found no protection associated with high compared to low vitamin B12 serum levels [(34)](#reference34). A case-control study in Mexican women (475 cases and 1,391 controls) reported that breast cancer risk for women in the highest quartile of vitamin B12 intake (7.3-7.7 g/day) was 68% lower than those in the lowest quartile (2.6 g/day). Stratification of the data revealed that the inverse association between dietary vitamin B12 intake and breast cancer risk was stronger in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women, though both associations were statistically significant. Moreover, among postmenopausal women, the apparent protection conferred by folate was only observed in women with the highest vitamin B12 quartiles of intake [(35)](#reference35). However, more recent case-control and [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have reported weak to no risk reduction with vitamin B12 intakes in different populations, including Hispanic, African American and European American women [(36, 37)](#reference36). A meta-analysis of seven case-control and seven prospective cohort studies concluded that the risk of breast cancer was not modified by high versus low vitamin B12 intakes [(34)](#reference34). There was no joint association between folate and vitamin B12 intakes and breast cancer risk. Presently, there is little evidence to suggest a relationship between vitamin B12 [status](../glossary#status) and breast cancer. In addition, results from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) are not consistently in support of an association between high dietary folate intakes and reduced risk for breast cancer (see the article on [Folate](folate#breast-cancer-prevention)). There is a need to evaluate the effect of folate and vitamin B12 supplementation in well-controlled, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial), while considering various factors that modify breast cancer risk, such as menopausal status, ethnicity, and alcohol intake. [Neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTD) may result in [anencephaly](../glossary#anencephaly) or [spina bifida](../glossary#spina-bifida), which are mostly fatal [congenital malformations](../glossary#congenital-malformation) of the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system). The defects arise from failure of embryonic neural tube to close, which occurs between the 21st and 28th days after conception, a time when many women are unaware of their pregnancy [(38)](#reference38). [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have demonstrated 60% to 100% reductions in NTD cases when women consumed folic acid supplements in addition to a varied diet during the month before and the month after conception. Increasing evidence indicates that the [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine)-lowering effect of folic acid plays a critical role in reducing the risk of NTD [(39)](#reference39). Homocysteine may accumulate in the blood when there is inadequate folate and/or vitamin B12 for effective functioning of the methionine synthase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme). Decreased vitamin B12 levels and elevated homocysteine concentrations have been found in the blood and amniotic fluid of pregnant women at high risk of NTD [(40)](#reference40). The recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), including 567 mothers with current or prior NTD-affected pregnancy and 1,566 unaffected mothers, showed that low maternal vitamin B12 status was associated with an increased risk of NTD [(41)](#reference41). Yet, whether vitamin B12 supplementation may be beneficial in the prevention of NTD has not been evaluated [(42)](#reference42). The occurrence of vitamin B12 deficiency prevails in the elderly population and has been frequently associated with [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (reviewed in [43](#reference43)). One study found lower vitamin B12 levels in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of patients with Alzheimer's disease than in patients with other types of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), though blood levels of vitamin B12 did not differ [(44)](#reference44). The reason for the association of low vitamin B12 status with Alzheimer's disease is not clear. Vitamin B12 deficiency, like [folate](../vitamins/folate) deficiency, may lead to decreased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [methionine](../glossary#methionine) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), thereby adversely affecting [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions. Methylation reactions are essential for the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of components of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath of nerve cells as well as for synthesis of [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) [(18)](#reference18). Other metabolic implications of vitamin B12 deficiency include the accumulation of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, which might contribute to the neuropathologic features of dementia [(43)](#reference43). A large majority of [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have associated elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations with measures of poor [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) scores and increased risk of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), including [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (reviewed in [45](#reference45)). A [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) of 164 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type included 76 cases in which the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was confirmed by examination of brain cells after death. Compared to 108 control subjects without evidence of dementia, subjects with dementia of Alzheimer's type and confirmed Alzheimer's disease had higher blood homocysteine levels and lower blood levels of folate and vitamin B12. Measures of general nutritional status indicated that the association of increased homocysteine levels and diminished vitamin B12 status with Alzheimer's disease was not due to dementia-related malnutrition [(46)](#reference46). In a sample of 1,092 men and women without dementia followed for an average of 10 years, those with higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine levels at baseline had a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Specifically, those with plasma homocysteine levels greater than 14 mol/L had nearly double the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease [(47)](#reference47). A study in 650 elderly men and women reported that the risk of elevated plasma homocysteine levels was significantly higher in those with lower cognitive function scores [(48)](#reference48). A prospective study in 816 elderly men and women reported that those with [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) (homocysteine levels >15 mol/L) had a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Although raised homocysteine levels might be partly due to a poor vitamin B12 status, the latter was not related to risk of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in this study [(49)](#reference49). A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 35 prospective cohort studies assessing the association between vitamin B12 status and cognitive deterioration in older individuals with or without dementia at baseline did not support a relationship between vitamin B12 serum concentrations and cognitive decline, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease [(50)](#reference50). Nevertheless, studies utilizing more sensitive [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of vitamin B12 [status](../glossary#status), including measures of holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC; a vitamin B12 carrier) and methylmalonic acid, showed more consistent results and a trend toward associations between poor vitamin B12 status and faster cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's disease [(51-55)](#reference51). Besides, it cannot be excluded that the co-occurrence of potential confounders like elevated homocysteine level and poor folate status might mitigate the true contribution of vitamin B12 status to cognitive functioning [(45)](#reference45). High-dose B-vitamin supplementation has been proven effective for treating [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) in elderly individuals with or without [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment. However, [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine)-lowering trials have produced equivocal results regarding the prevention of cognitive deterioration in this population. A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials examining the effect of B-vitamin supplementation did not find that the decrease in homocysteine level prevented or delayed cognitive decline among older subjects [(56)](#reference56). A more recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled clinical trial in 900 older individuals at high risk of cognitive impairment found that daily supplementation of 400 g of folic acid and 100 g of vitamin B12 for two years significantly improved measures of immediate and delayed memory and slowed the rise in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine concentrations [(57)](#reference57). However, supplemented subjects had no reduction in homocysteine concentrations compared to baseline, nor did they perform better in processing speed tests compared to placebo. Another two-year, randomized, placebo-controlled study in elderly adults reported that a daily regimen of 800 g of folic acid, 500 g of vitamin B12, and 20 mg of vitamin B6 significantly reduced the rate of brain [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) compared to placebo treatment (0.5% vs. 3.7%). Interestingly, a greater benefit was seen in those with high compared to low homocysteine concentrations at baseline, suggesting the importance of lowering homocysteine levels in prevention of brain atrophy and cognitive decline [(58, 59)](#reference58). The authors attributed the changes in homocysteine levels primarily to vitamin B12 [(59)](#reference59). Finally, the most recent randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in over 2,500 individuals who suffered a [stroke](../glossary#stroke) showed that the normalization of homocysteine concentrations by B-vitamin supplementation (2 mg of folic acid, 500 g of vitamin B12, and 25 mg of vitamin B6) did not improve cognitive performance or decrease incidence of cognitive decline compared to placebo [(60)](#reference60). Currently, there is a need for larger trials to evaluate the effect of B-vitamin supplementation on long-term outcomes, such as the incidence of [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found as many as 30% of patients hospitalized for depression are deficient in vitamin B12 [(61)](#reference61). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 700 community-living, physically disabled women over the age of 65 found that vitamin B12-deficient women were twice as likely to be severely depressed as non-deficient women [(62)](#reference62). A population-based study in 3,884 elderly men and women with depressive disorders found that those with vitamin B12 deficiency were almost 70% more likely to experience depression than those with normal vitamin B12 [status](../glossary#status) [(63)](#reference63). The reasons for the relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and depression are not clear but may involve a shortage in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is a methyl group donor for numerous [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions in the brain, including those involved in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) whose deficiency has been related to depression [(64)](#reference64). Severe vitamin B12 deficiency in a mouse model showed dramatic alterations in the level of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) methylation in the brain, which might lead to [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) impairments [(65)](#reference65). This hypothesis is supported by several studies that have shown supplementation with SAM improves depressive symptoms [(66-69)](#reference66). Increased [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) level is another nonspecific [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of vitamin B12 deficiency that has been linked to depressive symptoms in the elderly [(70)](#reference70). However, in a recent cross-sectional study conducted in 1,677 older individuals, higher vitamin B12 [plasma](../glossary#plasma) levels, but not changes in homocysteine concentrations, were correlated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms [(71)](#reference71). Few studies have examined the relationship of vitamin B12 status, homocysteine levels, and the development of depression over time. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) with over 900 older participants experiencing psychological distress, daily supplementation with folic acid (400 g) and vitamin B12 (100 g) for two years did not reduce the occurrence of symptoms of depression despite significantly improving blood folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels compared to placebo [(72)](#reference72). However, in a long-term randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study among sufferers of cerebrovascular accidents at high risk of depression, daily supplementation with 2 mg of folic acid, 25 mg of vitamin B6, and 500 g vitamin B12 significantly lowered the risk of major depressive episodes during a seven-year follow-up period compared to placebo [(73)](#reference73). Although it cannot yet be determined whether vitamin B12 deficiency plays a causal role in depression, it may be beneficial to screen for vitamin B12 deficiency in older individuals as part of a medical evaluation for depression. High [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels may affect [bone remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling) by increasing bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption) (breakdown), decreasing bone formation, and reducing bone blood flow. Another proposed mechanism involves the binding of homocysteine to the [collagenous matrix](../glossary#collagenous-matrix) of bone, which may modify [collagen](../glossary#collagen) properties and reduce bone strength (reviewed in [74](#reference74)). Alterations of bone biomechanical properties can contribute to [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and increase the risk of [fractures](../glossary#fracture) in the elderly. Since vitamin B12 is a determinant of homocysteine metabolism, it was suggested that the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older subjects might be enhanced by vitamin B12 deficiency. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), following a total of 7,475 older individuals for 3 to 16 years, found a weak association between an elevation in vitamin B12 of 50 picomoles/L in blood and a reduction in fracture risk [(75)](#reference75). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 559 elderly individuals with low [serum](../glossary#serum) levels of folate and vitamin B12 and at increased risk of fracture evaluated the combined supplementation of very high doses of folic acid (5 mg/day) and vitamin B12 (1.5 mg/day). The two-year study found that the supplementation improved B-vitamin status, decreased homocysteine concentrations, and reduced risk of total fractures compared to placebo [(76)](#reference76). However, a multicenter study in 5,485 subjects with [cardiovascular or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) showed that daily supplementation with folic acid (2.5 mg), vitamin B12 (1 mg), and vitamin B6 (50 mg) lowered homocysteine concentrations but had no effect on fracture risk compared to placebo [(77)](#reference77). Another small, randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) trial in 93 individuals with low vitamin D status found no additional benefit of B-vitamin supplementation (50 mg/day of vitamin B6, 0.5 mg/day of folic acid, and 0.5 mg/day of vitamin B12) on markers of bone health over a one-year period beyond that associated with vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Yet, the short length of the study did not permit a conclusion on whether the lowering of homocysteine through B-vitamin supplementation could have long-term benefits on bone strength and fracture risk [(78)](#reference78). A large [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) conducted in older people with no preexisting conditions is under way to evaluate the effect of B-vitamin supplementation on markers of bone health and incidence of fracture; this trial might clarify whether B vitamins could have a protective effect on bone health in the elderly population [(79)](#reference79). Only [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin B12 [(80)](#reference80). Vitamin B12 is present in animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish (including shellfish), and to a lesser extent dairy products and eggs [(1)](#references). Fresh pasteurized milk contains 0.9 g per cup and is an important source of vitamin B12 for some vegetarians [(17)](#reference17). Those strict vegetarians who eat no animal products (vegans) need [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B12 to meet their requirements. Recent analyses revealed that some plant-source foods, such as certain fermented beans and vegetables and edible algae and mushrooms, contain substantial amounts of bioactive vitamin B12 [(81)](#reference81). Together with B-vitamin [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food and supplements, these foods may contribute, though modestly, to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency in individuals consuming vegetarian diets. Also, individuals over the age of 50 should obtain their vitamin B12 in supplements or fortified foods (e.g., fortified cereals) because of the increased likelihood of food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption with increasing age. Most people do not have a problem obtaining the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of 2.4 g/day of vitamin B12 in food. According to a US national survey, the average dietary intake of vitamin B12 is 5.4 g/day for adult men and 3.4 g/day for adult women. Adults over the age of 60 had an average dietary intake of 4.8 g/day [(42)](#reference42). However, consumption of any type of vegetarian diet dramatically increases the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in individuals across all age groups [(82)](#reference82). Some foods with substantial amounts of vitamin B12 are listed in Table 2, along with their vitamin B12 content in micrograms (g). For more information on the nutrient content of three-ounce serving of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| Cyanocobalamin is the principal form of vitamin B12 used in oral [supplements](../glossary#supplement), but methylcobalamin is also available as a supplement. Cyanocobalamin is available by prescription in an injectable form and as a nasal gel for the treatment of [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia). Over-the-counter preparations containing cyanocobalamin include and single-nutrient, vitamin B12 supplements [(83)](#reference83). No toxic or adverse effects have been associated with large intakes of vitamin B12 from food or supplements in healthy people. Doses as high as 2 mg (2,000 g) daily by mouth or 1 mg monthly by intramuscular (IM) injection have been used to treat [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia) without significant side effects [(84)](#reference84). When high doses of vitamin B12 are given orally, only a small percentage can be absorbed, which may explain the low toxicity [(4)](#reference4). Because of the low toxicity of vitamin B12, no tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) has been set by the US Food and Nutrition Board [(17)](#reference17). A number of drugs reduce the absorption of vitamin B12. Proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole and lansoprazole), used for therapy of [Zollinger-Ellison syndrome](../glossary#Zollinger-Ellison-syndrome) and [gastroesophageal reflux disease](../glossary#gastroesophageal-reflux-disease) (GERD), markedly decrease stomach acid secretion required for the release of vitamin B12 from food but not from [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors has been found to decrease blood vitamin B12 levels. However, vitamin B12 deficiency does not generally develop until after at least three years of continuous therapy [(85, 86)](#reference85). Another class of gastric acid inhibitors known as histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine), often used to treat [peptic ulcer disease](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease), has also been found to decrease the absorption of vitamin B12 from food. It is not clear whether the long-term use of H2-receptor antagonists could cause overt vitamin B12 deficiency [(87, 88)](#reference87). Individuals taking drugs that inhibit [gastric](../glossary#gastric) acid secretion should consider taking vitamin B12 in the form of a supplement because gastric acid is not required for its absorption. Other drugs found to inhibit vitamin B12 absorption from food include cholestyramine (a [bile acid](../glossary#bile-acids)-binding resin used in the treatment of high [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)), chloramphenicol and neomycin (antibiotics), and colchicine (medicine for [gout](../glossary#gout) treatment). Metformin, a medication for individuals with type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), was found to decrease vitamin B12 absorption by tying up free calcium required for absorption of the IF-B12 complex [(89)](#reference89). However, the clinical significance of this is unclear [(90)](#reference90). It is not known whether calcium supplementation can reverse vitamin B12 malabsorption; therefore, calcium supplementation is not currently prescribed for the prevention or treatment of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency [(91)](#reference91). Previous reports that megadoses of vitamin C destroy vitamin B12 have not been supported [(92)](#reference92) and may have been an artifact of the assay used to measure vitamin B12 levels [(17)](#reference17). Nitrous oxide, a commonly used anesthetic, oxidizes and inactivates vitamin B12, thus inhibiting both of the vitamin B12-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), and can produce many of the clinical features of vitamin B12 deficiency, such as [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) or [neuropathy](../glossary#neuropathy). Since nitrous oxide is commonly used for surgery in the elderly, some experts feel vitamin B12 deficiency should be ruled out prior to its use [(6](#reference6), [15)](#reference15). Large doses of folic acid given to an individual with an undiagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency could correct megaloblastic anemia without correcting the underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leaving the individual at risk of developing irreversible [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) damage [(17)](#reference17). For this reason, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine advises that all adults limit their intake of folic acid (supplements and [fortification](../glossary#fortification)) to 1,000 g (1 mg) daily. A varied diet should provide enough vitamin B12 to prevent deficiency in most individuals 50 years of age and younger. Strict vegetarians and women planning to become pregnant should take a multivitamin [supplement](../glossary#supplement) daily or eat [fortified](../glossary#fortification) cereal, which would ensure a daily intake of 6 to 30 g of vitamin B12 in a form that is easily absorbed. Higher doses of vitamin B12 supplements are recommended for patients taking medications that interfere with its absorption (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Because vitamin B12 malabsorption and vitamin B12 deficiency are more common in older adults, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adults older than 50 years take 100 to 400 g/day of supplemental vitamin B12.

Related to this [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation)-reduction ( [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction)) potential, two major functions of vitamin C are as an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and as an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) [(1)](#references). Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble, non-enzymatic antioxidant in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and tissues. Even in small amounts, vitamin C can protect indispensable molecules in the body, such as [proteins](../glossary#protein), [lipids](../glossary#lipid) (fats), [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), and and [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) that are generated during normal [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), by active immune cells, and through exposure to toxins and pollutants (e.g., certain [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) drugs and cigarette smoke). Vitamin C also participates in redox recycling of other important antioxidants; for example, vitamin C is known to regenerate [vitamin E](vitamin-E) from its [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) form (see the article on [Vitamin E](vitamin-E#nutrient-interactions-vitamin-C)). The role of vitamin C as a cofactor is also related to its redox potential. By maintaining enzyme-bound metals in their reduced forms, vitamin C assists mixed-function oxidases in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of several critical biomolecules [(1)](#references). enzymes are either monooxygenases or dioxygenases (see [Table 1](#table-1)). Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency, such as poor wound healing and lethargy, likely result from the impairment of these vitamin C-dependent enzymatic reactions leading to the insufficient synthesis of [collagen](../glossary#collagen), [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), and [catecholamines](../glossary#catecholamine) (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). Moreover, several dioxygenases involved in the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genome integrity require vitamin C as a cofactor. Indeed, research has recently uncovered the crucial role played by enzymes, such as the TET dioxygenases and Jumonji domain-containing [histone](../glossary#histone) demethylases, in the fate of cells and tissues (see [Table 1](#table-1)). These enzymes contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by catalyzing reactions involved in the demethylation whereas dioxygenases catalyze a reaction that couples the hydroxylation of a specific substrate with the conversion (decarboxylation) of -ketoglutarate into succinate.| The capacity of vitamin C to influence the [methylation](../glossary#methylation) status of DNA and histones in mammalian cells supports a role for the vitamin in health and disease beyond what was previously understood, in particular by safeguarding genome integrity [(3, 4)](#reference3). Vitamin C affects several components of the human immune system [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro); for example, vitamin C has been shown to stimulate both the production [(5-9)](#reference5) and function [(10, 11)](#reference10) of [leukocytes](../glossary#leukocyte) (white blood cells), especially [neutrophils](../glossary#neutrophil), [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte), and [phagocytes](../glossary#phagocyte). Specific measures of functions stimulated by vitamin C include accumulate vitamin C to high concentrations, which can protect these cell types from [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) [(12-14)](#reference12). In response to invading microorganisms, such these [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) kill [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) and, in the process, can damage the leukocytes themselves [(15)](#reference15). Vitamin C, through its [antioxidant ](../glossary#antioxidant)functions, has been shown protect leukocytes from self-inflicted damage [(14)](#reference14). Phagocytic leukocytes also produce release [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), including interferons, which have antiviral activity [(16)](#reference16). Vitamin C has been shown to increase interferon production in vitro [(17)](#reference17). Additional studies have reported that vitamin C enhances the chemotactic and microbial killing capacities of neutrophils and stimulates the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of B- and T-lymphocytes (reviewed in [18](#reference18)). It is widely thought by the general public that vitamin C boosts immune function, yet human studies published to date are conflicting. Disparate results are likely due to study design issues, often linked to a lack of understanding of vitamin C [pharmacokinetics](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) and requirements [(19, 20)](#reference19). Finally, vitamin C increases the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of iron from foods by enhancing intestinal absorption of non- [heme](../glossary#heme) iron (see the article on [Iron](../minerals/iron#food-sources)) [(21)](#reference21). [Depletion-repletion](../glossary#depletion-repletion-study) [pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) experiments demonstrated that [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentration is tightly controlled by three primary mechanisms: intestinal absorption, tissue transport, and [renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption [(22)](#reference22). In response to increasing oral doses of vitamin C, plasma vitamin C concentration rises steeply at intakes between 30 and 100 mg/day. Plasma concentrations of ascorbate reach steady-state at concentrations between 60 and 80 micromoles/L (mol/L). This is typically observed at doses between 200 to 400 mg/day in healthy young adults, with some degree of individual variation [(23, 24)](#reference23). One hundred percent absorption efficiency is observed when ingesting vitamin C at doses up to 200 mg at a time. Higher doses (>500 mg) result in fractionally less vitamin C being absorbed as the dose increases. Once plasma vitamin C concentrations reach saturation, additional vitamin C is largely [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine. Notably, [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of vitamin C bypasses absorptive control in the intestine such that very high concentrations of vitamin C can be achieved in the plasma; within a few hours, renal excretion restores vitamin C to baseline plasma concentrations (see [Cancer Treatment](#cancer-treatment)) [(25)](#reference25). While plasma vitamin C concentration reflects recent dietary intake, [leukocyte](../glossary#leukocyte) (white blood cell) vitamin C is thought to be an indicator of body stores. However, leukocyte vitamin C concentration does not accurately reflect vitamin C in several tissues and may specifically underestimate vitamin C uptake into skeletal muscle [(26)](#reference26). Yet, plasma concentrations of vitamin C 50 mol/L are sufficient to saturate muscle tissue vitamin C. There is also some limited evidence suggesting that individuals who carry certain [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in vitamin C transport and detoxification mechanisms may have lower plasma vitamin C concentrations even with high vitamin C intakes (see also [Vascular complications of diabetes mellitus](#vascular-complications-diabetes-mellitus)) (reviewed in [27](#reference27)). Due to the pharmacokinetics and tight regulation of plasma vitamin C, supplementation with vitamin C will have variable effects in vitamin C- [replete](../glossary#replete) (plasma concentrations near saturation) versus sub-optimal (plasma concentrations <50 mol/L), marginally deficient (plasma concentrations <23 mol/L), or severely deficient (plasma concentrations <11 mol/L) individuals [(28)](#reference28). Scientific studies investigating vitamin C efficacy to prevent or treat disease need to assess baseline vitamin C [status](../glossary#status) before embarking on an intervention or statistical analysis [(22](#reference22), [29-31)](#reference29). For a more detailed discussion on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin C, see the article, [The Bioavailability of Different Forms of Vitamin C](vitamin-C/supplemental-forms). Severe vitamin C deficiency has been known for many centuries as the potentially fatal disease, [scurvy](../glossary#scurvy). By the late 1700s, the British navy was aware that scurvy could be cured by eating oranges or lemons, even though vitamin C would not be isolated until the early 1930s. Symptoms of scurvy include [subcutaneous](../glossary#subcutaneous) bleeding, poor wound closure, and bruising easily, hair and tooth loss, and joint pain and swelling. Such symptoms appear to be related to the weakening of blood vessels, connective tissue, and bone, which all contain [collagen](../glossary#collagen). Early symptoms of scurvy like fatigue may result from diminished levels of [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), which is needed to derive energy from fat, or from decreased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the [catecholamine](../glossary#catecholamine) norepinephrine (see [Function](#function)). Scurvy is rare in developed countries because it can be prevented by as little as 10 mg of vitamin C daily [(32)](#reference32). However, cases have occurred in children and the elderly on very restricted diets [(33, 34)](#reference33). The recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for vitamin C is based on the amount of vitamin C intake necessary to maintain [neutrophil](../glossary#neutrophil) vitamin C concentration with minimal urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of vitamin C and is proposed to provide sufficient [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) protection (Table 2) [(35)](#reference35). The recommended intake for smokers is 35 mg/day higher than for nonsmokers, because smokers are under increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) from the toxins in cigarette smoke and generally have lower blood concentrations of vitamin C [(36)](#reference36). |Life Stage||Age||Males (mg/day)||Females (mg/day)| |Infants||0-6 months|| 40 ( | of vitamin C required to help prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) is higher than the amount required for prevention of [scurvy](../glossary#scurvy). Information regarding vitamin C and the prevention of chronic disease is based on both observational [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(29](#reference29), [37)](#reference37). Prospective cohort studies can examine the incidence of a specific disease in relation to vitamin C intake or body status in a cohort of participants who are followed over time. In contrast, trials are [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) that can establish a causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome, e.g., by evaluating the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the incidence of chronic disease in participants randomly assigned to receive either vitamin C or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for a given length of time. [Endothelial](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis). Alterations in the structure and function of the [vascular endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) that lines the inner surface of all blood vessels are associated with the loss of normal [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide)-mediated endothelium-dependent [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation). Endothelial dysfunction results in widespread The measurement of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is often used as a marker of endothelial function; FMD values are [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(38)](#reference38). A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 44 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in subjects with or without [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) summarized the effect of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C on endothelial function by measuring FMD (19 studies), assessing forearm blood flow (20 studies), or by pulse wave analysis (5 trials) [(39)](#reference39). Short-term supplementation with vitamin C was found to reduce endothelial dysfunction in subjects with [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure), atherosclerosis, or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), but it had no effect in those with [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure). Vitamin C also limited endothelial dysfunction that was experimentally induced in healthy volunteers [(39)](#reference39). Improved endothelial function was observed with daily vitamin C doses above 500 mg [(39)](#reference39). [Hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) is a major [risk](../glossary#risk) factor heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), and [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation). An analysis that combined data from three, large, independent prospective cohorts, (1) Nurses' Health Study 1 (NHS1; 88,540 women, median age 49 years); (2) Nurses' Health Study 2 (NHS2; 97,315 women, median age 36 years); and (3) Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 37,375 men, median age 52 years), found no association between the level of vitamin C intake and risk of developing hypertension [(40)](#reference40). On the other hand, when [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentration was measured, [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have consistently indicated an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between plasma vitamin C concentration and blood pressure in both men and women [(41-43)](#reference41). A 15-year follow-up of about 2,500 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study found that higher plasma vitamin C and a higher diet quality score were independently associated with a reduced risk of developing hypertension [(44)](#reference44). Interestingly, there was no relationship between diet score and risk of hypertension in those with the lowest plasma vitamin C, and plasma vitamin C was positively associated with risk of hypertension in those with low diet scores [(44)](#reference44). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 29 small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of short durations (median duration, 8 weeks) in 1,407 participants (10 to 120 subjects per trial; including both normotensive and hypertensive subjects) found that daily supplementation with 60 to 4,000 mg of vitamin C (median dose, 500 mg) reduced [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) by 3.84 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) by 1.48 mm Hg [(45)](#reference45). Good quality long-term trials are needed to examine whether the anti-hypertensive effect of vitamin C is sustained over time and eventually results in a reduced risk of cardiovascular events. It is important for individuals with significantly elevated blood pressure not to rely on vitamin C supplementation alone to reduce their hypertension. They should instead seek or continue treatment with anti-hypertensive medication and make dietary and lifestyle changes in consultation with their health care provider. [Coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) is characterized by the buildup of plaque inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart ( [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis)). Over years of buildup and accumulated damage to the [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-artery), CHD may culminate in a [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or heart attack. Many [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined the relationship between vitamin C intake from diet and [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and CHD [risk](../glossary#risk), the results of which have been pooled and analyzed in two separate analyses [(46, 47)](#reference46). In 2004, a pooled analysis of nine prospective cohort studies found that supplemental vitamin C intake (400 mg/day for a mean of 10 years), but not dietary vitamin C intake, was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with CHD risk [(46)](#reference46). Conversely, a 2008 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 cohort studies concluded that dietary, but not supplemental, vitamin C intake was inversely related to CHD risk [(47)](#reference47). The most recent large prospective cohort study found an inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and CHD mortality in Japanese women, but not in men [(48)](#reference48). In spite of the variable association depending on source, these analyses indicate an overall inverse association between higher vitamin C intakes and CHD risk. Limitations inherent to dietary assessment methodology, such as [recall bias](../glossary#recall-bias), [measurement error](../glossary#measurement-error), and [residual confounding](../glossary#residual-confounding), may account for some of the inconsistent associations between vitamin C intake and CHD risk. In order to overcome such limitations, some prospective studies measured [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of vitamin C as a more reliable index of vitamin C intake and [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of body vitamin C [status](../glossary#status). The European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk prospective cohort study investigated the relationship between vitamin C status and incident [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) in healthy adults (9,187 men and 11,112 women, aged 58.1+/-9.2 years) [(49)](#reference49). After a mean follow-up of 12.8 years, plasma vitamin C was inversely associated with incident cases of heart failure. Specifically, plasma vitamin C ranged from approximately 23 to 70 mol/L in men and 33 to 82 mol/L in women; across this range, every 20 mol/L increase in plasma vitamin C was associated with a 9% reduction in risk of heart failure. Although a primary source of dietary vitamin C, consumption of fruit and vegetables \u2014 assessed by [food frequency questionnaire](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) \u2014 was not found to be associated with a lower risk of congestive heart failure [(49)](#reference49). This highlights the fact that limitations associated with dietary assessment methods such as food frequency questionnaires may be overcome by using biomarkers of nutrient intake [(50, 51)](#reference50). A 2017 review of eight published [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found inconsistent results from seven trials reporting on the effect of vitamin C supplementation on serum [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides), established risk factors for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(52)](#reference52). Only one large trial in more than 14,000 older men participating in the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II) reported on cardiovascular outcomes. PHS II found that vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for an average of eight years had no significant effect on major cardiovascular events, total myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular mortality [(53)](#reference53). Notably, this study had several limitations [(54)](#reference54), including no measurement of vitamin C status and the recruitment of a well-nourished study population. There is a need for better quality studies to examine the effect of vitamin C on cardiovascular endpoints in participants with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. A cerebrovascular event, or [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), can be classified as [hemorrhagic](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) or [ischemic](../glossary#ischemic-stroke). Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain tissue. Ischemic stroke occurs when an obstruction within a blood vessel blocks blood flow to the brain. Most (~80%) cerebrovascular events in high-income countries are ischemic in nature and associated with [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) as an underlying condition [(55, 56)](#reference55). With respect to vitamin C and [cerebrovascular disease](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease), a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed more than 2,000 residents of a rural Japanese community for 20 years found that the [risk](../glossary#risk) of stroke in those with the highest [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of vitamin C was 29% lower than in those with the lowest serum concentrations of vitamin C [(57)](#reference57). Similarly, the EPIC-Norfolk study, a 10-year prospective cohort study in 20,649 adults, found that individuals with [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentrations in the top [quartile](../glossary#quartile) (25%) had a 42% lower risk of stroke compared to those in the lowest quartile (66 mol/L vs. <41 mol/L) [(58)](#reference58). In both the Japanese [(57)](#reference57) and EPIC-Norfolk [(58)](#reference58) populations, blood vitamin C concentrations were highly correlated with fruit and vegetable intake. Therefore, as in many studies of vitamin C intake and [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) risk, it is difficult to separate the effects of vitamin C from the effects of other components of fruit and vegetables. For example, [potassium](../minerals/potassium) \u2014 found at high levels in bananas, potatoes, and other fruit and vegetables \u2014 is known to be important in blood pressure regulation, and elevated blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke (see the article on [Potassium](../minerals/potassium)). A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 prospective cohort studies reported a 19% lower risk of stroke with the highest versus lowest dietary vitamin C intakes and a 38% lower risk with the highest versus lowest circulating vitamin C concentrations [(59)](#reference59). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in more than 14,000 older men participating in the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II) found that vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for an average of eight years had no significant effect on the incidence of or mortality from any type of stroke [(53)](#reference53). Other trials also failed to show any evidence of an effect of vitamin C on the risk of stroke. A meta-analysis of 10 trials that examined [antioxidant ](../glossary#antioxidant)vitamins, of which five included vitamin C, found no association between any antioxidant vitamin (vitamin C, vitamin E, or -carotene), administered alone or in combination, and risk of stroke [(60)](#reference60). Overall, [observational](../glossary#observational-study) [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have reported no or modest [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin C intake and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing a given type of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(37](#reference37), [61-63)](#reference61). Additional detail is provided below for those cancer subtypes with substantial scientific information obtained from prospective cohort studies. [Randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials that have tested the effect of vitamin C supplementation (alone or in combination with other [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients) on cancer incidence or mortality have shown no effect [(64)](#reference64). Two large [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found dietary vitamin C intake to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with breast cancer incidence in certain subgroups. In the Nurses' Health Study, premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer who consumed an average of 205 mg/day of vitamin C from food had a 63% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of breast cancer than those who consumed an average of 70 mg/day [(65)](#reference65). In the Swedish Mammography Cohort, overweight women who consumed an average of 110 mg/day of vitamin C had a 39% lower risk of breast cancer compared to overweight women who consumed an average of 31 mg/day [(66)](#reference66). More recent prospective cohort studies have reported no association between dietary and/or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C intake and breast cancer [(67-69)](#reference67). A number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found increased dietary vitamin C intake to be associated with decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of gastric (stomach) [cancer](../glossary#cancer), and laboratory experiments indicate that vitamin C inhibits the formation of [carcinogenic](../glossary#carcinogen) N-nitroso compounds in the stomach [(70-72)](#reference70). A [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) in the EPIC study found a 45% lower risk of [gastric](../glossary#gastric) cancer incidence in individuals in the highest (51 mol/L) versus lowest (<29 mol/L) [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of plasma vitamin C concentration; no association was observed between dietary vitamin C intake and gastric cancer [(73)](#reference73). Infection with the [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), is known to increase the risk of stomach cancer and is associated with lower vitamin C content of stomach secretions [(74, 75)](#reference74). Although two [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) failed to show a reduction in stomach cancer incidence with vitamin C [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) [(35)](#reference35), some research suggests that vitamin C supplementation may be a useful addition to standard H. pylori eradication therapy in reducing the risk of gastric cancer [(76)](#reference76). Because vitamin C can inactivate urease (an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that facilitates H. pylori survival and of the [gastric mucosa](../glossary#gastric-mucosa) at low [pH](../glossary#pH)) [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro), vitamin C may be most effective as a [prophylactic ](../glossary#prophylaxis)agent in those without [achlorhydria](../glossary#achlorhydria) [(77, 78)](#reference77). By pooling data from 13 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) comprising 676,141 participants, it was determined that dietary intake of vitamin C was not associated with [colon](../glossary#colon) [cancer](../glossary#cancer), while total intake of vitamin C (i.e., from food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) was associated with a 19% reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of colon cancer [(79)](#reference79). Each of the cohort studies used self-administered [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) at baseline to assess vitamin C intake. Although the analysis adjusted for several lifestyle and known risk factors, the authors noted that other healthy behaviors and/or folate intake may have [confounded](../glossary#confounder) the association. A population-based, [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), the Iowa Women's Health Study, collected baseline data on diet and [supplement](../glossary#supplement) use in 35,159 women (aged 55-69 years) and evaluated the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) over 19 years of follow-up [(80)](#reference81). Overall, an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of NHL was observed. Additionally, dietary, but not supplemental, intake of vitamin C and other [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients ( [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids), proanthocyanidins, and [manganese](../minerals/manganese)) was inversely associated with NHL risk. Another large, multi-center, prospective study \u2014 the Women's Health Initiative \u2014 that followed 154,363 postmenopausal women for 11 years found that dietary and supplemental vitamin C intake at baseline was inversely associated with diffuse B-cell lymphoma, a subtype of NHL [(81)](#reference81). The Physicians' Health Study II was a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial that examined the effect of [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) (400 IU/day), vitamin C (500 mg/day), and on the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) in 14,641 middle-aged male physicians over 10.3 years (7.6 years of active treatment plus 2.8 years post-treatment follow-up) [(82)](#reference82). Supplementation with vitamin C had no effect on the overall risk of cancer or on the risk of [prostate](../glossary#prostate), bladder, or [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cancer; there was a marginal reduction in [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) incidence with vitamin C compared to placebo [(82)](#reference82). In the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health study that included 232,007 participants, the use of vitamin C [supplements](../glossary#supplement) for at least seven times a week was associated with a 9% lower risk of developing type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) compared to non-supplement use [(83)](#reference83). In a cohort of 21,831 adults followed for 12 years in the EPIC-Norfolk study, high [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C was found to be strongly associated with a reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of diabetes [(84)](#reference84). Additionally, several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) reported [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating vitamin C concentrations and markers of resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) or have found no effect of vitamin C supplementation on fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c concentrations in healthy individuals [(87)](#reference87). It is not known whether supplemental vitamin C could improve markers of glycemic control in subjects at risk of diabetes. A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 29 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that administration of vitamin C during pregnancy, alone or in combination with a few other [supplements](../glossary#supplement), failed to reduce the risks of stillbirth, perinatal death, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) [(88)](#reference88). Nonetheless, vitamin C supplementation led to a 36% lower risk of [placental abruption](../glossary#placental-abruption) and to a significant increase in [gestational](../glossary#gestation) age at birth [(88)](#reference88). Another meta-analysis of 40 randomized controlled trials in 276,820 women found no effect of vitamin C, alone or combined with [vitamin E](vitamin-E) or multivitamins, when supplemented during pregnancy (starting prior to 20 weeks' gestation), on the risks of overall fetal loss, miscarriage, stillbirth, and [congenital malformation](../glossary#congenital-malformation) [(89)](#reference89). Cigarette smoking during pregnancy causes intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth, among other pregnancy complications [(90, 91)](#reference90), and is the primary cause of childhood respiratory illness [(92)](#reference92). For some still unclear reasons, smoking has been associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy [(93)](#reference93). A secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in nearly 10,000 pregnant women found no reduction in the risk of preeclampsia with supplemental vitamin C (1,000 mg/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day), regardless of women's smoking status during pregnancy. However, [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) supplementation resulted in reduced risks of placental abruption and preterm birth in women who smoked during pregnancy but not in non-smokers [(94)](#reference94). Another [pilot](../glossary#pilot-study) multicenter trial found better lung function during the first week of life and lower risk of wheezing through one year of age in infants whose smoking mothers were randomized to receive vitamin C (500 mg/day) rather than a placebo during pregnancy [(95)](#reference95). The Vitamin C to Decrease the Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function [VCSIP] study is an ongoing trial designed to confirm these preliminary observations using more accurate measurements of pulmonary function in a larger sample of women randomized to receive supplemental vitamin C or placebo [(96)](#reference96). In the US, [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the most common form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), affecting 5.5 million individuals 65 years and over [(97)](#reference97). stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cell death in the brain of subjects affected by AD have been associated with [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline and memory loss. Lower vitamin C concentrations in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) (CSF) and brain extracellular matrix of a mouse model of AD were found to increase oxidative stress and accelerate amyloid deposition and disease progression [(98)](#reference98). In another AD mouse model that was lacking the ability to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin C, supplementation with a high versus low dose of vitamin C reduced amyloid deposition in the cortex and hippocampus and limited blood-brain barrier impairments and [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction [(99)](#reference99). The majority of large, population-based studies examining the relationship of vitamin C intake or supplementation with AD incidence have reported null results [(100)](#reference100). In contrast, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) reported lower [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentrations in AD patients compared to cognitively healthy subjects [(101)](#reference101) and found better cognitive function or lower risk of cognitive impairment with higher plasma vitamin C [(100)](#reference100). Few studies have measured vitamin C concentration in the CSF, which more closely reflects the vitamin C status of the brain. Vitamin C is concentrated in the brain through a combination of active transport into brain tissue and retention via the blood-brain barrier [(100)](#reference100). Although CSF vitamin C is maintained at concentrations several-fold higher than plasma vitamin C, the precise function of vitamin C in cognitive function and AD [etiology](../glossary#etiology) is not yet fully understood [(102)](#reference102). In a small, longitudinal [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) study in 32 individuals with probable AD, a higher CSF-to-plasma vitamin C ratio at baseline was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline at one year of follow-up [(103)](#reference103). Impaired blood-brain barrier integrity may affect the brain's ability to retain vitamin C and thus to maintain a high CSF-to-plasma vitamin C ratio. The significance of the CSF-to-plasma vitamin C ratio in AD progression requires further study. The effect of vitamin C supplementation, in combination with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), on CSF biomarkers and cognitive function has been examined in only a few trials involving AD patients. In a small (n=23), [open-label trial](../glossary#open-label-trial), combined supplementation with vitamin C (1,000 mg/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) to AD patients taking a cholinesterase inhibitor significantly increased antioxidant levels and decreased [lipoprotein](../glossary#lipoprotein) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) in CSF after one year, but had no effect on the clinical course of AD compared to controls [(104)](#reference104). A similar finding was obtained in a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in which combined supplementation with vitamin C (500 mg/day), vitamin E (800 IU/day), and [-lipoic acid](../dietary-factors/lipoic-acid) (900 mg/day) for 16 weeks reduced lipoprotein oxidation in CSF but elicited no clinical benefit in individuals with mild-to-moderate AD (n=78) [(105)](#reference105). In this latter trial, a greater decline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was observed in the supplemented group, however, the significance of this observation remains unclear. A third [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in mildly cognitively impaired older adults (ages, 60-75 years) found that one-year supplementation with vitamin C (400 mg/day) and vitamin E (300 mg/day) improved antioxidant blood capacity but had no effect on MMSE scores [(106)](#reference106). At this time, avoidance of vitamin C deficiency or insufficiency, rather than supplementation in [replete](../glossary#replete) individuals, seems prudent for the promotion of healthy brain aging [(101)](#reference101). The [lens](../glossary#lens) of the eye focuses light, producing a clear, sharp image on the [retina](../glossary#retina), a layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eyeball. Age-related changes to the lens (thickening, loss of flexibility) and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) contribute to the formation of [cataract](../glossary#cataract), i.e., cloudiness or opacity in the lens that interferes with the clear focusing of images on the retina. In humans, vitamin C concentration is about 15 to 20 times higher in the aqueous humor \u2014 fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye \u2014 than in [plasma](../glossary#plasma), suggesting that the vitamin may be playing an important role in the eye [(107)](#reference107). Decreased vitamin C concentrations in the lens of the eye have been associated with increased severity of cataracts [(108)](#reference108). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found that a reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of age-related cataract with higher dietary vitamin C intakes in [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) and with higher circulating vitamin C concentrations in [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study). However, no such associations were found in pooled analyses of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [(109)](#reference109). In fact, two prospective cohort studies in Swedish men [(110)](#reference110) and women [(111)](#reference111) reported that high-dose single nutrient [supplements](../glossary#supplement) of vitamin C were associated with an increased risk of cataract, especially in those on [corticosteroid](../glossary#corticosteroid) therapy. A 2012 review of nine [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no substantial effect of -carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, administered individually or in combination over 2.1 to 12 years, on the risk of cataracts or cataract surgery [(112)](#reference112). Although trials do not currently support the use of high-dose supplementation with vitamin C in cataract prevention, there is a consistent [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) observed between high daily intake of fruit and/or vegetables (>5 servings/day) and risk of cataract [(113)](#reference113). [Gout](../glossary#gout), a condition that afflicts more than 4% of US adults [(114)](#reference114), is characterized by abnormally high blood concentrations of [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid) (urate) [(115)](#reference115). Urate crystals may form in joints, resulting in [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and pain, as well as in the kidneys and urinary tract, resulting in [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones). The tendency to exhibit elevated blood uric acid concentrations and develop gout is often inherited; however, dietary and lifestyle modification may be helpful in both the prevention and treatment of gout [(116)](#reference116). In an [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) that included 1,387 men, higher intakes of vitamin C were associated with lower [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of uric acid [(117)](#reference117). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) conducted in 4,576 African Americans, the odds of having hyperuricemia was associated with dietary intakes high in fructose, low in vitamin C, or with high fructose-to-vitamin C ratios [(118)](#reference118). A [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed a cohort of 46,994 men for 20 years found that total daily vitamin C intake was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with incidence of gout, with higher intakes being associated with greater [risk](../glossary#risk) reductions [(119)](#reference119). The results of this study also indicated that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C may be helpful in the prevention of gout [(119)](#reference119). A 2011 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in healthy individuals with elevated serum uric acid revealed that vitamin C supplementation (a median dose of 500 mg/day for a median duration of 30 days) modestly reduced serum uric acid concentrations by 0.35 mg/dL compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(120)](#reference120). Such a reduction falls within the range of assay variability and is unlikely to be clinically significant [(121)](#reference121). An eight-week, [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), controlled trial randomized 40 subjects with gout to receive either allopurinol (standard-of-care), vitamin C, or both treatments [(122)](#reference122). The effect of vitamin C, alone or with allopurinol, decreasing serum uric acid was modest and much less than that of allopurinol alone. The trial did not examine the effect of vitamin C on other outcomes associated with gout [(122)](#reference122). Although observational studies suggested that supplemental vitamin C may be helpful to prevent incident and recurrent gout, this has not been demonstrated by [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) undertaken thus far. In addition, there is currently little evidence to support a role for vitamin C in the management of patients with gout [(123)](#reference123). Two large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) assessed the relationship between dietary and [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C intakes and mortality. In the Vitamins and Lifestyle Study, 77,719 men and women (ages 50-76 years) were questioned at baseline on their use of dietary supplements during the previous 10 years [(124)](#reference124). After five years of follow-up, vitamin C supplement use was associated with a small decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of total mortality, although no association was found with [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease)- or [cancer](../glossary#cancer)-specific mortality. In the second prospective cohort study, the Diet, Cancer and Health Study, 55,543 Danish adults (ages 50-64 years) were questioned at baseline about their lifestyle, diet, and supplement use during the previous 12 months [(125)](#reference125). No association between dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin C and mortality was found after approximately 14 years of follow-up. In contrast, a 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 prospective cohort studies in 17,696 women with breast cancer found a lower risk of total and breast cancer-specific mortality with higher supplemental and dietary vitamin C intakes [(126)](#reference126). A 2012 meta-analysis of 29 trials found no effect of oral vitamin C, given alone or in combination with other antioxidants, on all-cause mortality [(127)](#reference127). In parallel to these dietary assessment studies, a strong [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (and cancer in men only) was observed in the EPIC-Norfolk multicenter, prospective cohort study [(128)](#reference128). After approximately four years of follow-up in 19,496 men and women (ages 45-79 years), a dose-response relationship was observed such that each 20 mol/L increase in plasma vitamin C was associated with an estimated 20% risk reduction in all-cause mortality. Similarly, higher [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin C concentrations were associated with decreased risks of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in 16,008 adults from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) III nonsurgical procedure for treating obstructive [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), including [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris), acute [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), and multivessel CHD. Angioplasty involves temporarily inserting and inflating a tiny balloon into the clogged artery to help restore the blood flow to the heart. Periprocedural myocardial injury that occurs in up to one-third of patients undergoing otherwise uncomplicated angioplasty increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of morbidity and mortality at follow-up. One [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial has examined the effect of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C administered to patients with stable angina undergoing elective coronary angioplasty [(130)](#reference130). Administration of a 1-gram (g) vitamin C infusion one hour prior to the angioplasty reduced the concentrations of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) markers and improved microcirculatory perfusion compared to placebo [(130)](#reference130). Another trial randomized 532 patients to receive a 3-g vitamin C infusion or a placebo (saline solution) within six hours prior to coronary angioplasty [(131)](#reference131). Vitamin C treatment substantially reduced the incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury, as assessed by a reduction in the concentrations of two markers of myocardial injury, namely creatine kinase and troponin-I [(131)](#reference131). A recent [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) assessed the effect of vitamin C and vitamin E administration on reperfusion damage in patients who experienced acute myocardial infarction and coronary angioplasty (see below) [(132)](#reference132). Myocardial reperfusion injury: Reperfusion injury refers to tissue damage occurring at the time of blood flow restoration (reperfusion) following transient [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia). The heart muscle may become oxygen-deprived (ischemic) as the result of [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or with aortic clamping during [coronary artery bypass graft](../glossary#coronary-artery-bypass-graft) (CABG) surgery. Increased generation of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) when the heart muscle's oxygen supply is restored might be an important contributor to myocardial damage occurring at reperfusion [(133)](#reference133). Myocardial reperfusion injury (see [Atrial fibrillation](#atrial-fibrillation)) and [myocardial stunning](../glossary#myocardial-stunning). Vitamin C is depleted during and following cardiac surgery [(134)](#reference134) and this might be due to the direct quenching of ROS, the regeneration of other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), Two [randomized controlled reported a reduction in reperfusion-induced [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and myocardial injury with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) [(136)](#reference136) or oral [(137)](#reference137) vitamin C administration prior to CABG surgery (reviewed in [135](#reference135)). A more recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial has been designed to examine the effect of vitamin C and vitamin E administration on ischemia-reperfusion damage in 99 patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing coronary angioplasty [(132)](#reference132). Vitamin C infusion (sodium ascorbate: 3.20 mmol/min for 1 hour then 0.96 mmol/min for 2 hours) prior to reperfusion followed by oral supplementation with vitamin C (1 g/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) for 84 days effectively prevented a reduction in antioxidant capacity at reperfusion and for the next six to eight hours. The protocol also limited microvascular dysfunction (i.e., improved microcirculatory perfusion) and improved left ventricular ejection fraction at discharge (on day 84) [(138, 139)](#reference138). However, no difference in the infarct size between antioxidant vitamin treatment and placebo was seen [(138)](#reference138). [Atrial fibrillation: ] [Atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) is the most common type of [cardiac arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia). It is also a common post-cardiac surgery complication, leading to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) morbidity (e.g., [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke)) [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have reported an overall reduction in the risk of post-operative atrial fibrillation following administration of primarily oral vitamin C [(140-142)](#reference140). In most trials, participants received 2 g of vitamin C prior to undergoing CABG or valve replacement surgery and 1 to 2 g/day for five days post-surgery. Although only a minority of trials delivered vitamin C [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous), this administration route appeared to be more effective at reducing the risk of atrial fibrillation \u2014 presumably due to higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations achieved [(140)](#reference140). Of note, a subgroup analysis in one of the meta-analyses showed a reduction of post-operative atrial fibrillation with vitamin C in non US-based trials (10 trials) but no effect of vitamin C in US-based trials (5 trials) [(140)](#reference140). A small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) performed in 60 [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) patients showed that [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C administration (500 mg/day for 10 days, initiated day 1 post-stroke) had no effect on serum markers of [oxidative [(143)](#reference143). [Cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) is the leading cause of death in individuals with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The role of increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative stress) in the occurrence of vascular complications in subjects with diabetes has led to [hypothesis](../glossary#hypothesis) that higher intakes of [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients could help lower the [risk](../glossary#risk) of CVD in diabetic subjects [(144)](#reference144). A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) investigating the effect of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes found that most improvement in markers of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) control could be attributed to [vitamin E](vitamin-E) [(145)](#reference145). Another meta-analysis of trials found no effect of vitamins E and C, alone or in combination, on measures of -cell function and [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) [(146)](#reference146). Yet, most studies were small and of short duration and thus did not assess the consequence of long-term use of antioxidant vitamins on the risk of vascular complications in diabetic patients. One 12-month randomized [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 456 participants with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin examined the effect of vitamin C (500 mg/day) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin; 100 mg/day) on risk factors for diabetes-related complications such as CVD [(147)](#reference147). Both vitamin C and aspirin reduced fasting blood glucose and [HbA1c](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) concentrations and improved blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile in metformin-treated patients. Compared to placebo, both treatments were found to be more likely to limit risk factors contributing to diabetes-related complications, as well as to lower the risk of future cardiovascular events over a 10-year period (estimated using the Framingham risk score) [(147)](#reference147). Of note, it is possible that genetic differences among diabetic patients influence the effect of vitamin C supplementation on cardiovascular risk. In particular, a specific [allele](../glossary#allele) of the haptoglobin [gene](../glossary#gene) (Hp), namely Hp2, appears to be associated with an increased risk of diabetic vascular complications. Carriers of two copies of the Hp2 allele (Hp2-2) express a Hp [protein](../glossary#protein) that has a lower capacity to bind and remove [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant), free hemoglobin (Hb) from [plasma](../glossary#plasma), compared to Hp proteins coded by the Hp1-1 and Hp1-2 [genotypes](../glossary#genotype). When the results of the Women's Antioxidant Vitamin Estrogen (WAVE) trial were reanalyzed based on Hp genotype, antioxidant therapy (1,000 mg/day of vitamin C + 800 IU/day of vitamin E) was associated with improvement of coronary [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) in diabetic women with Hp1-1 genotype but worsening of coronary atherosclerosis in those carrying the Hp2-2 genotype [(148)](#reference148). Results from another study by the same investigators suggested that vitamin C could not prevent the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) nor restore impaired HDL function in diabetic mice carrying the Hp2-2 genotype [(149)](#reference149). Sepsis and septic shock \u2014 defined as persistent sepsis-induced low blood pressure \u2014 are associated with elevated mortality rates in critically ill patients [(150, 151)](#reference150). Because systemic [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) responses involve excessive [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), it has been suggested that providing [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients like vitamin C may improve the outcome of critically ill patients in intensive care units. In addition, hypovitaminosis C is common in critically ill patients, especially in those with septic shock, and persists despite enteral/parenteral nutritional therapy providing recommended amounts of vitamin C [(152)](#reference152). Vitamin C requirements are likely to be increased in this population due to the hypermetabolic response driven by the systemic inflammatory reaction [(152, 153)](#reference152). [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of 50 mg or 200 mg of vitamin C per kg per day for 96 hours to patients with sepsis admitted in intensive care unit was found to correct vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C also prevented the rise of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores \u2014 used to assess severity of illness and [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality \u2014 observed in [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-treated patients [(154)](#reference154). Vitamin C infusion also lowered the concentration of markers of inflammation and endothelial injury in patients compared to placebo [(154)](#reference154). In another [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial in 28 critically ill patients with septic shock, infusion of 25 mg of vitamin C per kg every six hours for 72 hours significantly limited the requirement to vasopressor norepinephrine \u2014 decreasing both the dose and duration of treatment \u2014 and dramatically improved the 28-day survival rate [(155)](#reference155). Similar results have been reported in septic patients given intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g/6 h), hydrocortisone (50 mg/6 h), and [thiamin](thiamin) (200 mg/12 h) until hospital discharge. Compared to standard-of-care, this intervention cocktail more than halved the mean duration of vasopressor use (18.3 h versus 54.9 h) and reduced the odds of mortality by nearly 90% [(156)](#reference156). Although intravenous vitamin C administration appears to be safe and well tolerated, there is a non-negligible risk of oxalate [nephropathy](../glossary#nephropathy) (a rare cause of kidney failure) in these critically ill patients [(157)](#reference157). See also the section on Sepsis in the [Symposium on Vitamin C \u2014 Part of the LPI's 9th International Conference on Diet and Optimum Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745504/). Studies in the 1970s and 1980s conducted by Linus Pauling, Ewan Cameron, and colleagues suggested that large doses of vitamin C (10 g/day infused [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) for 10 days followed by at least 10 g/day orally indefinitely) were helpful in increasing the survival time and improving the quality of life of terminal [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients [(158)](#reference158). Controversy surrounding the efficacy of vitamin C in cancer treatment ensued, leading to the recognition that the route of vitamin C administration is critical [(22](#reference22), [159)](#reference159). Compared to orally administered vitamin C, intravenous vitamin C can result in 30 to 70-fold higher plasma vitamin C concentrations [(25)](#reference25). Higher plasma concentrations achieved via intravenous vitamin C administration are comparable to those that are toxic to cancer cells in culture. The anticancer mechanism of intravenous vitamin C action is under investigation. It may involve the production of high levels of hydrogen peroxide, selectively toxic to cancer cells [(22](#reference22), [160-162)](#reference160), or the deactivation of hypoxia inducible factor, a prosurvival [transcription factor](../glossary#transcription-factor) that protects cancer cells from various forms of stress [(159](#reference159), [163, 164)](#reference163). Vitamin C likely also plays a role in the maintenance of genome integrity and in the protection against cellular transformation through regulating DNA and histone demethylating enzymes (see [Function](#function)) [(165)](#reference165). Current evidence from controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) indicates that [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C is generally safe and well tolerated in cancer patients. Of note, because intravenous administration of 80 g of vitamin C precipitated [hemolytic anemia](../glossary#hemolytic-anemia) in two subjects with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, patients due to receive high-dose vitamin C infusion are systematically screened for this genetic disorder [(166)](#reference166). Four [phase I clinical trials](../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in patients with advanced cancer found that intravenous administration of vitamin C at doses up to 1.5 g/kg of body weight (equivalent to about 100 g/day for an average weight [70 kg] person) and 70 to 80 g/m2 was well tolerated and safe in pre-screened patients [(167-170)](#reference167). A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy reported that complementary intravenous vitamin C treatment was associated with a reduction in treatment-associated side effects and an improved quality of life [(171)](#reference171). A phase I study in nine patients with [metastatic](../glossary#metastasize) [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cancer showed that millimolar concentrations of plasma vitamin C could be reached safely when administered in conjunction with the cancer chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and erlotinib [(168)](#reference168). Retrospective [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) colony formation assays revealed that patient leukemic cells displayed variable sensitivity to vitamin C treatment: leukemic cells from seven out of the nine patients who experienced a significant clinical benefit were sensitive to vitamin C in vitro (i.e., \"responders\"); the leukemic cells from the remaining six patients were not sensitive to vitamin C (i.e., \"non-responders\"). Thus, in vitro vitamin C sensitivity assays may provide predictive value for the clinical response to intravenous vitamin C treatment. The mechanisms underlying differential sensitivity to vitamin C are under investigation. In vitro experiments performed using 11 different cancer cell lines demonstrated that sensitivity to vitamin C correlated with the expression of catalase, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) involved in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [(172)](#reference172). Approximately one-half of the cell lines tested were resistant to vitamin C cytotoxicity, a response associated with high levels of catalase activity. Sensitivity to vitamin C may also be determined by the expression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-2 (SVCT-2), which transports vitamin C into cells [(173)](#reference173). Higher SVCT-2 levels were associated with enhanced sensitivity to vitamin C in nine different breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, SVCT-2 was significantly expressed in 20 breast cancer tissue samples, but weakly expressed in normal tissues. Finally, mutations in genes coding for vitamin C-dependent TET demethylases, mutations that are common in cancer cells, may also contribute to resistance to vitamin C treatment [(165)](#reference165). Current evidence of the efficacy of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients is limited uncontrolled [interventions](../glossary#intervention-study), and [case reports](../glossary#case-report) need for larger, longer-duration [phase II clinical trials](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) that test the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C in disease progression and overall survival [(176)](#reference176). See also the section on Cancer in the [Symposium on Vitamin C \u2014 Part of the LPI's 9th International Conference on Diet and Optimum Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745504/). The work of Linus Pauling stimulated public interest in the use of doses greater than 1 g/day of vitamin C to prevent the common cold [(177)](#reference177). In the past 40 years, numerous [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have examined the effect of vitamin C [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on the prevention and treatment of colds. A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 53 placebo-controlled trials evaluated the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the incidence, duration, or severity of the common cold when taken as a continuous daily supplement (43 trials) or as therapy upon onset of cold symptoms (10 trials) [(178)](#reference178). Regarding the incidence of colds, a difference was observed between two groups of participants. Regular supplementation with vitamin C (0.25 to 2 g/day) did not reduce the incidence of colds in the general population (23 trials); however, in participants undergoing heavy physical stress (e.g., marathon runners, skiers, or soldiers in subarctic conditions), vitamin C supplementation halved the incidence of colds (5 trials). A benefit of regular vitamin C supplementation was also seen in the duration of colds, with a greater benefit in children than in adults: The pooled effect of vitamin C supplementation was a 14% reduction in cold duration in children and an 8% reduction in adults. Finally, no significant effect of vitamin C supplementation (1-8 g/day) was observed in therapeutic trials in which vitamin C was administered after cold symptoms occurred. In addition, a 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) by the same investigators identified only two small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin C on the incidence of respiratory infection-induced [asthma](../glossary#asthma) [(179)](#reference179). One trial found that vitamin C supplementation (1 g/day) for 14 weeks reduced the [risk](../glossary#risk) of asthma attacks precipitated by respiratory infection. The other trial randomized subjects diagnosed with infection-related asthma to receive 5 g/day of vitamin C or a placebo for one week; a lower proportion of participants was found to present with bronchial hypersensitivity to histamine \u2014 which characterizes chronic asthma \u2014 in the vitamin C group compared to the control group (reviewed in [179](#reference179)). These observations need to be confirmed in larger, well-designed trials. A 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified 11 [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that evaluated the effect of vitamin C on [asthma](../glossary#asthma) (eight trials) or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (three trials) [(180)](#reference180). Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is a transient narrowing of the airways that occurs after exercise and is indicated by a 10% decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). In the three trials that included a total of 40 participants with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, vitamin C administration before exercise (a 0.5-g dose on two subsequent days in one trial, a single dose of 2 g in the second trial, and 1.5 g daily for two weeks in the third trial) significantly reduced the exercise-induced decline in FEV1. Among the five out of eight trials in asthmatic subjects that reported on FEV1 outcomes, none found a difference between vitamin C [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) and [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(180)](#reference180). Although the use of lead paint and leaded gasoline has been discontinued in the US, lead toxicity continues to be a significant health problem, especially in children living in urban areas. Abnormal growth and development have been observed in infants of women exposed to lead during pregnancy, while children who are chronically exposed to lead are more likely to develop learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and to have a low IQ. In adults, lead toxicity may result in kidney damage, high blood pressure, and [anemia](../glossary#anemia). Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin C [status](../glossary#status) and blood lead concentration. For instance, in a study of 747 older men, blood lead concentration was significantly higher in those who reported total dietary vitamin C intakes averaging less than 109 mg/day compared to those with higher vitamin C intakes [(181)](#reference181). A much larger study of 19,578 people, including 4,214 children from 6 to 16 years of age, found higher [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin C concentrations to be associated with significantly lower blood lead concentrations [(182)](#reference182). A US national survey of more than 10,000 adults found that blood lead concentrations were inversely related to serum vitamin C concentrations [(183)](#reference183). Cigarette smoking or second-hand exposure to cigarette smoke contributes to increased blood lead concentration and a state of chronic low-level lead exposure. An [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-study) in 75 adult male smokers found that supplementation with 1,000 mg/day of vitamin C resulted in significantly lower blood lead concentration over a four-week treatment period compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(184)](#reference184). A lower dose of 200 mg/day did not significantly affect blood lead concentration, although serum vitamin C concentrations were not different from those in the group who took 1,000 mg/day. The mechanism(s) by which vitamin C reduces blood lead concentration is not known, yet it has been proposed that vitamin C could inhibit intestinal absorption [(184)](#reference184) or enhance urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of lead [(185)](#reference185). Unlike plants and most animals, humans have lost the ability to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin C [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) and therefore have an essential dietary requirement for this vitamin (see [The Recommended Dietary Allowance](#RDA)). Results from 7,277 participants in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 indicated that an estimated 7.1% of individuals ages 6 years were deficient in vitamin C \u2014 based on serum vitamin C concentrations <11.4 mol/L [(36)](#reference36). The national study identified smokers and those of lower socioeconomic status to both be at higher risk for vitamin C deficiency [(36)](#reference36). As shown in Table 3, different [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) vary in their vitamin C content, but five servings (2\u00bd cup-equivalents) of a variety of fruit and vegetables should average out to about 150 to 200 mg of vitamin C, especially if vitamin C-rich fruits are consumed. If you wish to check foods for their vitamin C content, search [USDA's FoodData acid) is available in many forms, but there is little scientific evidence that any one form is better absorbed or more effective than another. Most experimental and clinical research uses ascorbic acid or its sodium salt, called sodium ascorbate. Natural and synthetic L-ascorbic acid are chemically identical and there are no known differences regarding biological activities or [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(186)](#reference186). Mineral salts of vitamin C are considered less acidic than vitamin C and therefore are considered \"buffered.\" Some people find them less irritating to the [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract than ascorbic acid. Sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are the most common forms, although a number of other mineral ascorbates are available. Sodium ascorbate provides 111 mg of sodium (889 mg of ascorbic acid) per 1,000 mg of sodium ascorbate, and calcium ascorbate generally provides 90 to 110 mg of calcium (890-910 mg of ascorbic acid) per 1,000 mg of calcium ascorbate. Flavonoids are a class of water-soluble plant pigments that are often found in vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables, especially citrus fruit and berries (see the article on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids#food-sources)). There is little evidence that the flavonoids in most commercial preparations increase the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) or efficacy of vitamin C [(187)](#reference187). Some, yet not all, studies in animal models such as vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs or genetically scorbutic rats found an increased uptake of vitamin C in peripheral circulation and specific organs in the presence of flavonoids. However, studies conducted in humans found no differences in bioavailability of vitamin C from flavonoid-rich whole fruit or fruit juice and synthetic vitamin C (reviewed in [186](#reference186)). One supplement, Ester-C\u00ae, contains mainly calcium ascorbate and includes small amounts of the vitamin C [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite), dehydroascorbic acid ( [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) ascorbic acid), calcium threonate, and trace amounts of xylonate and lyxonate. Although these metabolites are purported to increase the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of vitamin C, the only published study in humans addressing this issue found no difference between Ester-C\u00ae and commercially available vitamin C tablets with respect to the absorption and urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of vitamin C [(187)](#reference187). Ester-C\u00ae should not be confused with ascorbyl palmitate, which is also marketed as \"vitamin C ester\" (see below). Ascorbyl palmitate is a vitamin C ester (i.e., ascorbic acid linked to a [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid)). In this case, vitamin C is esterified to the [saturated fatty acid](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid), palmitic acid, resulting in a fat-soluble form of vitamin C. Ascorbyl palmitate has been added to a number of skin creams due to interest in its [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) properties, as well as its importance in [collagen](../glossary#collagen) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) (see the separate article, [Vitamin C and Skin Health](../health-disease/skin-health/vitamin-C)) [(188)](#reference188). Although ascorbyl palmitate is also available as an oral supplement, most of it is likely [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) to ascorbic acid and palmitic acid in the digestive tract before it is absorbed [(189)](#reference189). Ascorbyl palmitate is marketed as \"vitamin C ester,\" which should not be confused with Ester-C\u00ae (see above). One small [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in 11 men showed that the oral administration of 4 g of vitamin C resulted in a greater vitamin C concentration in plasma over a four-hour period when vitamin C was encapsulated in liposomes compared to unencapsulated vitamin C [(190)](#reference190). Although liposomal encapsulation could increase vitamin C [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability), plasma vitamin C concentrations were much lower than those achieved with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C administration [(190)](#reference190). For a more detailed review of scientific research on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin C, see [The Bioavailability of Different Forms of Vitamin C](vitamin-C/supplemental-forms). A number of possible adverse health effects of very large doses of vitamin C have been identified, mainly based on [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) experiments or isolated [case reports](../glossary#case-report), and deficiency, and erosion of dental enamel. However, none of these alleged adverse health effects have been confirmed in subsequent studies, and there is no reliable scientific evidence that doses of vitamin C up to 10 g/day in adults are toxic or detrimental to health. The concern of kidney stone formation with vitamin C supplementation is discussed [below](#kidney-stones). With the latest [RDA](#RDA) published in 2000, a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for vitamin C was set for the first time (Table 4). A UL of 2 g (2,000 mg) daily was recommended in order to prevent generally healthy adults from experiencing diarrhea and [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disturbances [(35)](#reference35). Such symptoms are not generally serious, especially if they resolve with temporary discontinuation of vitamin C supplementation. of intake should be from foods or formula only.| Because oxalate is a [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) of vitamin C, there is some concern that high vitamin C intake could increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of calcium oxalate [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones). Some [(24](#reference24), [191, not all have reported that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C increases urinary oxalate concentrations. Whether any increase in oxalate levels would translate to an elevation in risk for kidney stones has been examined in several [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study). Two large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), one following 45,251 men for six years and the other following 85,557 women for 14 years, reported that consumption of 1,500 mg of vitamin C daily did not increase the risk of kidney stone formation compared to those consuming <250 mg daily [(196, 197)](#reference196). On the other hand, two other large prospective studies reported that a high intake of vitamin C was associated with an increased risk of kidney stone formation in men [(198, 199)](#reference198). Specifically, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study collected data on dietary and supplemental vitamin C intake every four years in 45,619 male health professionals (ages 40-75 years) [(198)](#reference198). After 14 years of follow-up, it was found that men who consumed 1,000 mg/day of vitamin C had a 41% higher risk of kidney stones compared to men consuming <90 mg of vitamin C daily. In the Cohort of Swedish Men study, self-reported use of single-nutrient vitamin C supplements (taken seven or more times per week) at baseline was associated with a two-fold higher risk of incident kidney stones among 48,840 men (ages 45-79 years) followed for 11 years [(199)](#reference199). Despite conflicting results, it may be prudent for individuals predisposed to oxalate kidney stone formation to avoid high-dose vitamin C supplementation. Overall, evidence suggesting specific drugs can lower blood vitamin C concentrations in humans is limited. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., nicardipine, nifedipine) can inhibit vitamin C uptake by intestinal cells [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro). However, a reduction in blood vitamin C concentrations with these drugs has not been reported in humans [(200)](#reference200). Aspirin can impair vitamin C [status](../glossary#status) if taken frequently [(201)](#reference201). Conversely, there are [case reports](../glossary#case-report) suggesting that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C may lower blood concentrations of some medications, such as fluphenazine (the antipsychotic drug, Prolixin) and indinavir (the antiretroviral drug, Crixivan) [(200)](#reference200). There is some evidence, though controversial, that vitamin C interacts with [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) medications like warfarin (Coumadin). Large doses of vitamin C may block the action of warfarin and thus lower its effectiveness. Individuals on anticoagulants should limit their vitamin C intake to <1 g/day and have their prothrombin time monitored by the clinician following their anticoagulant therapy [(200)](#reference200). In addition, vitamin C may bind aluminum in the gut and increase the absorption of aluminum-containing compounds (e.g., aluminum-containing antacids, aluminum-containing phosphate binders). People with impaired kidney function may be at [risk](../glossary#risk) for aluminum toxicity when supplemental vitamin C is taken at the same time as these compounds [(200, 201)](#reference200). Finally, supplemental vitamin C may increase blood [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) concentrations in women using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy [(200)](#reference200). The potential effect of [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) during [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) is not well understood, yet only likely to be an issue if a specific chemotherapeutic agent acts through an [oxidative](../glossary#oxidation) mechanism, which is uncommon [(171)](#reference171). It is not clear whether vitamin C given parenterally could diminish or increase the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs \u2014 in particular, akylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, busulfan), antitumor antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, bleomycin), and arsenic trioxide. Patients are advised to discuss with their oncologist before using vitamin C supplements [(200, 201)](#reference200). Because high doses of vitamin C have also been found to interfere with the interpretation of certain laboratory tests (e.g., [serum](../glossary#serum) bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the stool guaiac assay for occult blood), it is important to inform one's health care provider of any recent supplement use. A three-year [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 patients with documented [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) and low blood [HDL](../glossary#HDL) concentrations found that a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and [niacin](niacin) increased HDL concentration, inhibited the progression of [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, such as [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) [(202)](#reference202). Surprisingly, when an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) combination (1,000 mg vitamin C, 800 IU vitamin E, 100 \u00b5g selenium, and 25 mg -carotene daily) was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects were diminished. Since the antioxidants were taken together in this trial, the individual contribution of vitamin C cannot be determined. In contrast, a much larger trial in more than 20,000 men and women with coronary heart disease or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found that simvastatin and an antioxidant combination (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg -carotene daily) did not diminish the cardioprotective effects of simvastatin therapy over a five-year period [(203)](#reference203). These contradictory findings indicate that further research is needed on potential interactions between antioxidant supplements and [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering drugs, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Vitamin C is known to function as a highly effective [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) in living organisms. However, in test tube experiments, vitamin C can interact with some free metal [ions](../glossary#ion) and lead to the generation of potentially damaging [free radicals](../glossary#free-radical). Although free metal ions are not generally found under physiological conditions, the idea that high doses of vitamin C might be able to promote [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) has received a great deal of attention. Widespread publicity has been given to a few studies suggesting a [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant) effect of vitamin C [(204, 205)](#reference204), but these studies turned out to be either flawed or of no physiological relevance. A comprehensive review of the literature found no credible scientific evidence that supplemental vitamin C promotes oxidative damage under physiological conditions or in humans [(206)](#reference206). Combined evidence from [metabolic](../glossary#metabolism), [pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics), and [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), and from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) supports consuming sufficient vitamin C to achieve plasma concentrations of at least 60 mol/L. While most generally healthy young adults can achieve these plasma concentrations with daily vitamin C intake of at least 200 mg/day, some individuals may have a lower vitamin C absorptive capacity than what is currently documented. Thus, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends a vitamin C intake of 400 mg daily for adults to ensure replete tissue concentrations [(29)](#reference29) \u2014 an amount substantially higher than the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) yet with minimal risk of side effects. This recommendation can be met through food if the diet includes at least several servings of vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables (e.g., citrus fruit, kiwifruit, peppers; see [Food sources](#food-sources)) as part of the daily recommended fruit and vegetable intake (see article on [Fruit and Vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables#intake-recommendations)). Most multivitamin supplements provide at least 60 mg of vitamin C. Whether older adults have higher requirements for vitamin C is not yet known with certainty, yet some older populations have been found to have vitamin C intakes considerably below the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of 75 and 90 mg/day for women and men, respectively [(207)](#reference207). A vitamin C intake of at least 400 mg daily may be particularly important for older adults who are at higher [risk](../glossary#risk) for age-related [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease). [Pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies in older adults have not yet been conducted, but there is some evidence suggesting that the efficiency of one of the molecular mechanisms for the cellular uptake of vitamin C declines with age [(208)](#reference208). Because maximizing blood concentrations of vitamin C may be important in protecting against [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to cells and biological molecules, a vitamin C intake of at least 400 mg daily might benefit older adults who are at higher risk for chronic diseases caused, in part, by oxidative damage, such as heart disease, [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), certain [cancers](../glossary#cancer), and [cataract](../glossary#cataract).

Bioavailability refers to the degree to which a nutrient (or drug) becomes available to the target tissue after it has been administered. We reviewed the literature for the results of scientific research on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin C. Natural and synthetic L-ascorbic acid are chemically identical, and there are no known differences in their biological activity. The possibility that the bioavailability of L-ascorbic acid from natural sources might differ from that of synthetic ascorbic acid was investigated in at least two human studies, and no clinically significant differences were observed. A study of 12 males (6 smokers and 6 nonsmokers) found the bioavailability of synthetic ascorbic acid (powder administered in water) to be slightly superior to that of orange juice, based on blood levels of ascorbic acid, and not different based on ascorbic acid in [leukocytes](../../glossary#leukocyte) (white blood cells) [(1)](#references). A study in 68 male nonsmokers found that ascorbic acid consumed in cooked broccoli, orange juice, orange slices, and as synthetic ascorbic acid tablets are equally bioavailable, as measured by [ plasma](../../glossary#plasma) ascorbic acid levels [(2, 3)](#reference2). The [ gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption of ascorbic acid occurs through an active transport process, as well as through passive diffusion. At low gastrointestinal concentrations of ascorbic acid active transport predominates, while at high gastrointestinal concentrations active transport becomes saturated, leaving only passive diffusion. In theory, slowing down the rate of stomach emptying (e.g., by taking ascorbic acid with food or taking a slow-release form of ascorbic acid) should increase its absorption. While the bioavailability of ascorbic acid appears equivalent whether it is in the form of powder, chewable tablets, or non-chewable tablets, the bioavailability of ascorbic acid from slow-release preparations is less certain. A study of three men and one woman found 1 gram of ascorbic acid to be equally well absorbed from solution, tablets, and chewable tablets, but the absorption from a timed-release capsule was 50% lower. Absorption was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of ascorbic acid after an intravenous dose of ascorbic acid and then comparing it to urinary excretion after the oral dosage forms [(4)](#reference4). A more recent study examined the plasma levels of ascorbic acid in 59 male smokers supplemented for two months with either 500 mg/day of slow-release ascorbic acid, 500 mg/day of plain ascorbic acid, or a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo). After two months of supplementation no significant differences in plasma ascorbic acid levels between the slow-release and plain ascorbic acid groups were found [(5)](#reference5). A second placebo-controlled trial also evaluated plain ascorbic acid versus slow-release ascorbic acid in 48 male smokers [(6)](#reference6). Participants were supplemented with either 250 mg plain ascorbic acid, 250 mg slow-release ascorbic acid, or placebo twice daily for four weeks. No differences were observed in the change in plasma ascorbate concentration or area under the curve following ingestion of either formulation. [Mineral](../../glossary#mineral) salts of ascorbic acid (mineral ascorbates) are less [acidic](../../glossary#acidic), and therefore, considered \"buffered.\" Thus, mineral ascorbates are often recommended to people who experience [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) problems (upset stomach or diarrhea) with plain ascorbic acid. There appears to be little scientific research to support or refute the claim that mineral ascorbates are less irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. When mineral salts of ascorbic acid are taken, both the ascorbic acid and the mineral appear to be well absorbed, so it is important to consider the dose of the mineral accompanying the ascorbic acid when taking large doses of mineral ascorbates. For the following discussion, it should be noted that 1 gram (g)= 1,000 milligrams (mg) and 1 milligram (mg) = 1,000 micrograms (g). Mineral ascorbates are available in the following forms: The following mineral ascorbates are more likely to be found in combination with other mineral ascorbates, as well as other minerals. It's a good idea to check the labels of dietary supplements for the ascorbic acid dose as well as the dose of each mineral. Recommended dietary intakes and maximum upper levels of intake (when available) are listed after the individual mineral ascorbates below: Bioflavonoids or [flavonoids](../../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) are polyphenolic compounds found in plants. Vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables, especially citrus fruit, are often rich sources of flavonoids as well. The effect of bioflavonoids on the bioavailability of ascorbic acid has been recently reviewed [(7)](#reference7). Results from the 10 clinical studies comparing the absorption of vitamin C alone or vitamin C in flavonoid-containing foods showed no appreciable differences in bioavailability of ascorbic acid. Only one study, which included five men and three women, found that a 500-mg supplement of synthetic ascorbic acid, given in a natural citrus extract containing bioflavonoids, proteins, and carbohydrates, was more slowly absorbed and 35% more bioavailable than synthetic ascorbic acid alone, when based on plasma levels of ascorbic acid [(8)](#reference8). The remaining studies showed either no change or slightly lower plasma ascorbate levels in subjects who consumed vitamin C with flavonoids compared to flavonoids alone [(7)](#reference7). Another assessment of vitamin C bioavailability is measuring urinary ascorbate levels to approximate rates of vitamin C excretion. One study in six young Japanese males (22-26 years old) showed a significant reduction in urinary excretion of ascorbic acid in the presence of acerola juice, a natural source of both vitamin C and flavonoids [(9)](#reference9). However, three separate studies showed that urinary levels of vitamin C were increased after consumption of kiwifruit [(10)](#reference10), blackcurrant juice [(11)](#reference11), or orange juice [(1)](#references). Overall, the impact of flavonoids on the bioavailability of vitamin C seems to be negligible; however, there is a need for carefully controlled studies using specific flavonoid extracts [(7)](#reference7). Ester-C\u00ae contains mainly calcium ascorbate, but also contains small amounts of the vitamin C metabolites, dehydroascorbic acid (oxidized ascorbic acid), calcium threonate, and trace levels of xylonate and lyxonate. In their literature, the manufacturers state that the metabolites, especially threonate, increase the bioavailability of the vitamin C in this product, and they indicate that they have performed a study in humans that demonstrates the increased bioavailability of vitamin C in Ester-C\u00ae. This study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. A small published study of vitamin C bioavailability in eight women and one man found no difference between Ester-C\u00ae and commercially available ascorbic acid tablets with respect to the absorption and urinary excretion of vitamin C [(12)](#reference12). Ester-C\u00ae should not be confused with ascorbyl palmitate, which is also marketed as \"vitamin C ester\" (see below). Ascorbyl palmitate is a fat-soluble [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) used to increase the shelf life of vegetable oils and potato chips [(13)](#reference13). It is an amphipathic molecule, meaning one end is water-soluble and the other end is fat-soluble. This dual solubility allows it to be incorporated into [cell membranes](../../glossary#cell-membrane). When incorporated into the cell membranes of human red blood cells, ascorbyl palmitate has been found to protect them from oxidative damage and to protect -tocopherol (a fat-soluble antioxidant) from oxidation by free radicals [(14)](#reference14). However, the protective effects of ascorbyl palmitate on cell membranes have only been demonstrated in the test tube. Taking ascorbyl palmitate orally probably doesn't result in any significant incorporation into cell membranes because most of it appears to be hydrolyzed (broken apart into palmitate and ascorbic acid) in the human digestive tract before it is absorbed. The ascorbic acid released by the hydrolysis of ascorbyl palmitate appears to be as bioavailable as ascorbic acid alone [(15)](#reference15). The presence of ascorbyl palmitate in oral supplements contributes to the ascorbic acid content of the supplement and probably helps protect fat-soluble antioxidants in the supplement. The roles of vitamin C in promoting collagen synthesis and as an antioxidant have generated interest in its use on the skin (see the article, [Vitamin C and Skin Health](../../micronutrients-health/skin-health/nutrient-index/vitamin-C)). Ascorbyl palmitate is frequently used in topical preparations because it is more stable than some aqueous (water-soluble) forms of vitamin C [(16)](#reference16). Ascorbyl palmitate is also marketed as vitamin C ester,\" which should not be confused with Ester-C\u00ae (see above). Erythorbic acid is an [isomer](../../glossary#isomer) of ascorbic acid. Isomers are compounds that have the same kinds and numbers of atoms, but different molecular arrangements. The difference in molecular arrangement among isomers may result in different chemical properties. Erythorbic acid is used in the US as an antioxidant food additive and is generally recognized as safe. It has been estimated that more than 200 mg erythorbic acid per capita is introduced daily into the US food system. Unlike ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid does not appear to exert vitamin C activity, for example, it did not prevent scurvy in guinea pigs (one of the few animal species other than humans that does not synthesize ascorbic acid). However, guinea pig studies also indicated that increased erythorbic acid intake reduced the bioavailability of ascorbic acid by up to 50%. In contrast, a series of studies in young women found that up to 1,000 mg/day of erythorbic acid for as long as 40 days was rapidly cleared from the body and had little effect on the bioavailability of ascorbic acid, indicating that erythorbic acid does not diminish the bioavailability of ascorbic acid in humans at nutritionally relevant levels of intake [(17)](#reference17). PureWay-C\u00ae is composed of vitamin C and [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite). Two cell culture studies using PureWay-C\u00ae have been published by the same investigators [(18, 19)](#reference18), but [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) data are currently lacking. A small study in healthy adults found that [serum](../../glossary#serum) levels of vitamin C did not differ when a single oral dose (1 gram) of either PureWay-C\u00ae or ascorbic acid was administered [(20)](#reference20). Another formulation of vitamin C, liposomal-encapsulated vitamin C (e.g., Lypo-spheric vitamin C) is now commercially available. One report suggested that liposomal-encapsulated vitamin C may be better absorbed than the vitamin in a non-encapsulated form [(21)](#reference21). Large-scale, [pharmacokinetic](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies are needed to determine how the bioavailability of these vitamin C formulations compares to that of ascorbic acid. 1.

In developing his recommendations, he used cross-species comparisons, evolutionary arguments, the concept of biochemical individuality, and the amount of vitamin C likely consumed in a raw plant food diet. Using this approach, Dr. Pauling suggested in the early 1970s that the optimum daily intake may be about 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C and that everyone should get at least 200 to 250 mg/day. In a 1974 radio interview, he noted that \"the first 250 mg is more important than any later 250 mg. The first 250 mg leads you up to the level where the blood is saturated. You can achieve a higher volume [concentration] in the blood by a larger intake, but you get much better improvement for the first 250 mg than for additional grams.\" Dr. Pauling significantly increased his recommendation in his 1986 book How To Live Longer and Feel Better. At the Linus Pauling Institute, we have based our vitamin C recommendations on the current body of scientific evidence, which is significantly greater than it was at Pauling's time but remains incomplete owing to the many diverse functions of vitamin C in the human body that have yet to be fully understood. In this context, it is important to note that data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have indicated that vitamin C levels in plasma and circulating cells become fully saturated at intakes of about 400 mg/day in young, healthy nonsmokers. These observations are consistent with other data that intakes of about 400 mg/day are associated with reduced risk of heart disease. While these NIH studies are the best we currently have regarding the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C in the human body, they have numerous limitations, including the fact that they are based on a small number of young, healthy men and women. We currently do not know how much vitamin C is required to achieve saturation of cells and tissues in children, older adults, and diseased or stressed individuals. A meta-analysis of 36 studies on the relationship between vitamin C intake and plasma concentrations found that the elderly require a substantially higher daily intake of vitamin C to attain plasma concentrations that younger adults achieve at a lower intake. Additionally, work by Linus Pauling Institute investigators has shown that cellular uptake of vitamin C declines with age, supporting the notion that vitamin C requirements are increased in the elderly. Therefore, the Linus Pauling Institute's intake recommendation of 400 mg/day of vitamin C for generally healthy adults takes into account the currently available epidemiological, biochemical, and clinical evidence, while acknowledging the extremely low toxicity of vitamin C and the incomplete information regarding optimum intake. It should also be noted that the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation is strictly directed towards prevention of disease in healthy individuals, not treatment of disease. Thus, individuals suffering from certain diseases may require substantially larger amounts of vitamin C to achieve optimum body levels or derive therapeutic benefits, areas that were of great interest to Linus Pauling and need to be further explored. Contents Vitamin D is a fat-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that regulates [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) and is vital for bone health [(1)](#references). While it can also be obtained from dietary sources or [supplements](../glossary#supplement), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the human skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol upon exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation from sunlight (see the separate article on [Vitamin D and Skin Health](../health-disease/skin-health/vitamin-D)). Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is a vitamin D [analog](../glossary#analog) photosynthesized in plants, mushrooms, and yeasts; vitamin D2 is also sometimes used in vitamin D food [fortification](../glossary#fortification) [(2)](#reference2). When vitamin D3 in skin is inadequate due to insufficient exposure to UVB radiation, oral intake of vitamin D is necessary to meet vitamin D requirements. Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are biologically inactive [precursors](../glossary#precursor) of vitamin D and must be converted to biologically active forms in the liver and kidneys (Figure 1). Indeed, following dietary intake or [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) in the [epidermis](../glossary#epidermis) of skin after UVB exposure, both forms of vitamin D enter the circulation and are transported to the liver by the vitamin D-binding [protein](../glossary#protein) (and to a lesser extent by albumin). In [hepatocytes](../glossary#hepatocyte) (liver cells), vitamin D is [hydroxylated](../glossary#hydroxylation) to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol; calcifediol). Exposure to sunlight or dietary intake of vitamin D increases [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D constitutes the major circulating form of vitamin D, and the sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations in serum is used as an indicator of vitamin D nutritional status [(3)](#reference3). The [renal](../glossary#renal) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) (also known hydroxylation that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). The production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidneys is regulated by several factors, including serum [phosphorus](../minerals/phosphorus), [calcium](../minerals/calcium), parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D itself. While the kidney is the main source of 1-hydroxylase activity, extra-renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has also been demonstrated in a variety of tissues, including skin, [parathyroid gland](../glossary#parathyroid-glands), breast, [colon](../glossary#colon), [prostate](../glossary#prostate), as well as cells of the immune system and bone cells [(2)](#reference2). Most of the physiological effects of vitamin D in the body are related to the activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [(4)](#reference4). Various forms of vitamin D are listed in Figure 1. Most, if not all, actions of vitamin D are mediated through a nuclear [transcription factor](../glossary#transcription-factor) known as the vitamin D [receptor](../glossary#receptor) (VDR) (Figure 2) [(5)](#reference5). Upon entering the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) of a cell, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binds to the VDR and recruits another nuclear receptor known as retinoid X receptor (RXR). In the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the VDR/RXR complex binds small sequences of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) known as vitamin D [response elements](../glossary#response-element) (VDREs) and initiates a cascade of molecular interactions that modulate the [transcription](../glossary#transcription) of specific [genes](../glossary#gene). Thousands of VDREs have been identified throughout the [genome](../glossary#genome), and VDR activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is thought to directly and/or indirectly regulate 100 to 1,250 genes [(6)](#reference6). Maintenance of [serum](../glossary#serum) [calcium](../minerals/calcium) concentrations within a narrow range is vital for normal functioning of the nervous system, as well as for bone growth and maintenance of bone density. Vitamin D is essential for the efficient utilization of calcium by the body [(1)](#references). The [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) sense serum calcium concentrations and secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) if calcium concentrations decrease below normal (Figure 3). Elevations in PTH stimulate the activity of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) in the kidney, resulting in the increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The active vitamin D form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, is released into the circulation and transported to target tissues. Within target cells, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binds to and induces the activation of VDR, which leads to changes in [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) that normalize serum calcium by (1) increasing the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, (2) increasing the reabsorption of calcium filtered by the kidneys, and (3) mobilizing calcium from bone when there is insufficient dietary calcium to maintain normal serum calcium concentrations [(7)](#reference7). The regulations of calcium and [phosphorus](../minerals/phosphorus) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) are closely related, and the calciotropic hormones, PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, can also control [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus. Specifically, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D increases [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) phosphorus absorption by stimulating the expression of a sodium-phosphate cotransporter in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine). While PTH increases urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of phosphorus by reducing reabsorption in the kidney, it is not yet clear whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D can directly regulate renal phosphorus transport. The fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) (bone-forming production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by inhibiting 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase (Figure 3) (reviewed in [8](#reference8)). Cells that are dividing rapidly are said to be [proliferating](../glossary#proliferation). [Differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) results in the specialization of cells for specific functions. In general, differentiation of cells leads to a decrease in proliferation. While cellular proliferation is essential for growth and wound healing, uncontrolled proliferation of cells with certain [mutations](../glossary#mutation) may lead to [cancer](../glossary#cancer). The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, inhibits proliferation and stimulates the differentiation of cells through binding to the VDR [(1)](#references). Acting through the VDR, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is a potent immune system modulator. The VDR is expressed by most cells of the immune system, including regulatory T cells and [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells, such as [dendritic cells](../glossary#dendritic-cell) and [macrophages](../glossary#macrophage) [(9)](#reference9). Under specific circumstances, [monocytes](../glossary#monocyte), T cells can express the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) and produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which acts locally to regulate the immune response [(10, 11)](#reference10). There is considerable scientific evidence that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has a variety of effects on immune system function, which may enhance [innate immunity](../health-disease/immunity#innate-immunity) and inhibit the development of [autoimmunity](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) [(12)](#reference12). Conversely, vitamin D deficiency may compromise the integrity of the immune system and lead to inappropriate immune responses (see [Autoimmune diseases](#autoimmune-diseases-prevention)). The VDR is expressed by [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-secreting cells of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and the results of animal studies suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D plays a role in insulin secretion under conditions of increased insulin demand [(13, 14)](#reference13). [Cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) suggest that insufficient vitamin D status may have an adverse effect on insulin secretion and [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance) in type 2 mellitus) (reviewed in [15](#reference15)). The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure [(16)](#reference16). Renin is an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the cleavage (splitting) of a small [peptide](../glossary#peptide) (angiotensin I) from a larger [protein](../glossary#protein) (angiotensinogen) produced in liver. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin I to form angiotensin II, a peptide that can increase blood pressure by inducing the constriction of small arteries and by increasing [sodium](../minerals/sodium) and water retention. The rate of angiotensin II [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) is dependent on renin [(17)](#reference17). Research in mice lacking the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding the VDR indicates that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreases the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of the gene encoding renin through its interaction with the VDR [(18)](#reference18). Since inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system can contribute to the development of [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), achieving adequate vitamin D status may be important for decreasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of high blood pressure (see [Hypertension](#hypertension-prevention)). In vitamin D deficiency, [calcium](../minerals/calcium) absorption cannot be increased enough to satisfy the body's calcium needs [(4)](#reference4). Consequently, PTH production by the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) is increased and calcium is mobilized from the skeleton to maintain normal [serum](../glossary#serum) calcium concentrations \u2014 a condition known as secondary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism). Although it has long been known that severe vitamin D deficiency has serious consequences for bone health, research suggests that less obvious states of vitamin D deficiency are common and increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and various other health problems (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). In infants and children, severe vitamin D deficiency results in the failure of bone to mineralize. The process of mineralization, which involves the production of crystals of calcium phosphate by bone-forming cells, determines the hardness and strength of bones. Vitamin D deficiency severely affects rapidly growing bones. The growth plates of bones continue to enlarge, but in the absence of adequate mineralization, weight-bearing limbs (arms and legs) become bowed. In infants, [rickets](../glossary#rickets) may result in delayed closure of the fontanels (soft spots) in the skull, and the rib cage may become deformed due to the pulling action of the diaphragm. In severe cases, low [serum](../glossary#serum) calcium concentrations (hypocalcemia) may cause [seizures](../glossary#seizure). Although [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of food has led to complacency regarding vitamin D deficiency, nutritional rickets is still being reported throughout the world [(19, 20)](#reference19). Although adult bones are no longer growing, they are in a constant state of turnover, or \" [remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling).\" In adults with severe vitamin D deficiency, the [collagenous bone matrix](../glossary#collagenous-matrix) is preserved, but bone mineral is progressively lost, resulting in a softening of bones ( [osteomalacia](../glossary#osteomalacia)), bone pain, and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) [(21)](#reference21). Vitamin D deficiency causes muscle weakness and pain in children and adults. Muscle pain and weakness were prominent symptoms of vitamin D deficiency in a study of Arab and Danish Muslim women living in Denmark [(22)](#reference22). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 150 consecutive patients referred to a clinic in Minnesota for the evaluation of persistent, nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, 93% had [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations equal to or below 20 ng/mL, with a mean concentration of 12.1 ng/mL, which is indicative of vitamin D insufficiency [(23)](#reference23). Loss of muscle strength greatly contributes to increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of falling and bone [fractures](../glossary#fracture), especially in older people [(24)](#reference24). In addition, long-term vitamin D insufficiency may be a contributing factor to [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) in the elderly (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)). Both environmental factors and cultural practices result in variations in vitamin D status: The efficiency of vitamin D [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), absorption, and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) also depends on a variety of biological factors: Growing awareness that vitamin D insufficiency has serious health consequences beyond [rickets](../glossary#rickets) and [osteomalacia](../glossary#osteomalacia) highlights the need for accurate assessment of vitamin D nutritional status. It is currently agreed that the measurement of total [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (1 ng/mL corresponding to 2.5 nmol/L) is the best indicator to evaluate vitamin D status. However, high-quality evidence is still needed to ensure that the current cutoff values are optimal to define states of insufficiency and deficiency [(40)](#reference40). Moreover, only recently, efforts have been made toward the standardization of commercially and laboratory-developed 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays, such that guidelines have been developed using largely unstandardized research data [(49)](#reference49). Although laboratory reference values for sufficient vitamin D status were initially based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations from cohorts of healthy individuals, additional studies have suggested that health-based cutoff values aimed at preventing secondary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism) and bone loss should be considerably higher. Indeed, while it is considered that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 8 to 10 ng/mL (20 to 25 nmol/L) indicate severe deficiency associated with rickets and osteomalacia, several studies have observed that PTH concentrations [(50, 51)](#reference50) and [calcium](../minerals/calcium) absorption [(52)](#reference52) were not optimized with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L). Yet, more recent studies have failed to find threshold values of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in relation to PTH suppression and optimal calcium absorption. On the one hand, a [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 312,962 clinical samples did not find any evidence of threshold for PTH suppression in the well-fitted curve displaying the [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between paired measurements of serum PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, even with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations beyond 70 ng/mL (175 nmol/L) [(53)](#reference53). This contradicted an analysis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003-2006) that estimated maximum PTH suppression for 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 40 ng/mL (100 nmol/L) and above [(54)](#reference54). In addition, both studies identified evidence of mild hyperparathyroidism (serum PTH >65 pg/mL) in individuals with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations well beyond 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), questioning the use of serum PTH as a sensible indicator of vitamin D insufficiency [(53, 54)](#reference53). On the other hand, a randomized, placebo-controlled in postmenopausal women D <20 ng/mL) supplemented with daily vitamin D3 doses from 400 to 4,800 IU found little change (6%) in calcium absorption over a normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration range of 20 to 66 ng/mL [(55)](#reference55). The current cutoffs proposed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) are as follows: deficiency as serum D 12 to 19 ng/mL (30 to 49 nmol/L), and sufficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values of 20 to 50 ng/mL (50 to 125 nmol/L) [(56)](#reference56). The dietary reference intakes ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR), [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) set by the IOM are based on achieving circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (20 to 50 ng/mL) that are adequate to maintain bone health and optimal calcium absorption [(57)](#reference57). Yet, considering the potential role of circulating concentrations lower than 30 ng/mL in the burden of many chronic diseases [(6)](#reference6), the US Endocrine Society has suggested to define cutoff values as follows: deficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), insufficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values of 21 to 29 ng/mL (51 to 74 nmol/L), and sufficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values of 30 to 100 ng/mL (75 to 250 nmol/L) [(40)](#reference40). This alternate target range is supported by some [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), but it is not based on data from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(47)](#reference47). With these latter cutoff values, studies from across the world have estimated that hypovitaminosis D is widespread and that children and adults of all ages are equally at [risk](../glossary#risk) of insufficiency and deficiency [(58)](#reference58). Data from supplementation studies indicate that vitamin D intakes of at least 800 to 1,000 IU/day are required by adults living in temperate latitudes to achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) [(40)](#reference40). Finally, total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations may not always adequately reflect vitamin D [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(59)](#reference59), and additional evidence is needed to improve the determination of vitamin D status in different ethnic populations. In 2010, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the IOM set a Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) based on the amount of vitamin D needed for bone health. While the RDA was increased from the adequate intake (AI) set in 1997, the optimal levels of recommended intakes and [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D to minimize [hyperthyroidism](../glossary#hyperthyroidism) and maximize bone health in the general population remain controversial [(40)](#reference40). The RDA for vitamin D is listed in Table 1 by life stage and gender. |Life Stage||Age||Males||Females| |g/day||IU/day||g/day||IU/day| | Infants ( | In a nine-year follow-up analysis of the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) that included 15,099 participants (of which 77% were Caucasians), [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D \u2014 standardized as per the methodology developed by the Vitamin D Standardization Program [VDSP] \u2014 were examined in relation to mortality. The analysis suggested an increase in all-cause mortality with decreasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <16 ng/mL [(60)](#reference60). In contrast, the of all-cause mortality varied little for baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in the range of 16 to 40 ng/mL [(60)](#reference60). Similar results were obtained in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that considered the relationship between standardized 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and mortality during a median follow-up period of 10.5 years. The risk of death was found to be 19% higher with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations between 12 and 15.99 ng/mL and 56% higher with concentrations <12 ng/mL compared to the risk associated with concentrations between 30 and 39.99 ng/mL [(61)](#reference61). A meta-analysis of 73 prospective cohort studies, including >800,000 participants, found that the lowest versus highest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was associated with greater risks of all-cause mortality (+35%), mortality due to [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (+35%), randomization to [confounding](../glossary#confounder) and [reverse causation](../glossary#reverse-causation) [(63)](#reference63) \u2014 of data from three large Danish cohorts of 95,766 adults found a significant association of genetically low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with all-cause and cancer-related mortality, but not with cardiovascular disease-related mortality [(64)](#reference64). Finally, two meta-analyses of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have suggested a modest reduction in all-cause mortality in older people supplemented with vitamin D and calcium, but not vitamin D alone [(62, 65)](#reference62). Additional [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials need to examine further whether supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium might help prevent premature death in [replete](../glossary#replete) individuals. Although the causes of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) are [multifactorial](../glossary#multifactorial), vitamin D insufficiency can be an important [etiological](../glossary#etiology) factor in older adults. Osteoporosis affects one-third of women aged 60 to 70 years and two-thirds of women aged 80 years and above [(66)](#reference66). A multinational (18 different countries with latitudes ranging from 64 degrees north to 38 degrees south) survey of more than 2,600 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis revealed that 31% of subjects had 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) [(67)](#reference67). In addition, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 111 hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) patients and 73 controls (median age, 83 years) found that lower serum concentrations of both 25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin K1 in patients compared to controls were associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip fracture [(68)](#reference68). Without sufficient vitamin D from sun exposure or dietary intake, intestinal calcium absorption can be significantly reduced. This increases PTH secretion by the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands); sustained PTH elevation may result in increased [bone resorption](../glossary#bone-resorption), which in turn may increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture [(69)](#reference69). The progressive loss of [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) leading to [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia) (pre-osteoporosis) and [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) is commonly observed in older adults, especially the elderly. The results of a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 23 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) with more than 4,000 participants (mean age, 59 years) showed little evidence for an effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD at any of the five skeletal sites examined, including lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter, forearm, and total body. A significant increase in BMD was reported only at the femoral neck [(70)](#reference70). It was, however, suggested that individuals in this age group would have adequate calcium intake and thus normal bone [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), explaining the lack of an effect of vitamin D in strengthening bone mass [(71)](#reference71). Conversely, in older individuals, vitamin D supplementation is essential to correct and maintain adequate concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and to prevent secondary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism) and BMD loss [(72)](#reference72). A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed more than 72,000 postmenopausal women in the US for 18 years found that those who consumed at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D from diet and [supplements](../glossary#supplement) had a 37% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporotic](../glossary#osteoporosis) hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) than women who consumed less than 140 IU/day of vitamin D [(73)](#reference73). However, daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D3, in combination with 1,000 mg calcium, did not significantly reduce risk of hip fracture compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in 36,282 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative trial [(74)](#reference74), suggesting that there might be a threshold of vitamin D intake that is necessary to observe reductions in fracture risk. Results of a genetic analysis of data from this trial also suggested that beneficial effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on fracture risk might be limited to women with the lowest genetic risk of low [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) [(75)](#reference75). Yet, this trial has been questioned for reasons that include poor adherence and the fact that participants were allowed to take additional vitamin D and calcium supplements that might have [confounded](../glossary#confounder) the results. In addition, use of hormone replacement therapy was not considered in the study of the effect of vitamin D and calcium on skeletal health in postmenopausal women despite being a major confounding factor in this population [(57](#reference57), [76)](#reference76). Another trial, the Randomised Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D (RECORD) study, reported that oral supplemental vitamin D3 (800 IU/day) alone, or in combination with calcium (1,000 mg/day), did not prevent the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures in elderly adults who had already experienced a low-trauma, osteoporotic fracture [(77)](#reference77). In this latter study as well, a number of limitations, including poor adherence and/or the fact that vitamin D supplementation did not raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations to a level that would protect against fractures, might explain the lack of an effect [(78)](#reference78). Despite high adherence to treatment, the incidence of non-vertebral fracture was similar in postmenopausal women supplemented with vitamin D3 (initial dose of 200,000 IU followed by 100,000/month) or placebo for over three years in the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) trial [(79)](#reference79). Nevertheless, the US Preventive Services Task Force that conducted the [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 11 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trials, including 52,915 older people (of whom 69% were postmenopausal women), found that the supplementation of vitamin D (300-1,000 IU/day) and calcium (500-1,200 mg/day) for up to seven years resulted in a 12% reduction in the risk of any new fracture [(80)](#reference80). Another meta-analysis of 11 randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trials on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in 31,022 individuals (91% women) 65 years and older indicated that those with the highest vitamin D intake (792-2,000 IU/day) had a 30% lower risk of hip fracture and a 14% lower risk of any non-spine fracture [(81)](#reference81). Finally, a third meta-analysis of trials that examined the effect of combined vitamin D and calcium in preventing fractures in older men and postmenopausal women also concluded that the risk of new fractures, including hip fractures, was significantly reduced in those supplemented compared to controls [(82)](#reference82). Interestingly, the three meta-analyses have found that the prevention of fractures by supplemental vitamin D and calcium was limited to institutionalized, older people. Indeed, the risk of fracture was not significantly reduced by vitamin D in community-dwelling seniors [(80-82)](#reference80). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) 1,330 found significantly 25-hydroxyvitamin D in fallers than in non-fallers [(83)](#reference83). Moreover, another meta-analysis of four cohorts from three observational studies reported a modest yet significant [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin D status and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of fall [(83)](#reference83). Several [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the impact of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength, postural balance, or risk of fall in older subjects. A meta-analysis of these trials found limited evidence of an effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength and mobility, based on only one type of test for each outcome. Nevertheless, in a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 160 postmenopausal women (ages, 50-65 years) with suboptimal vitamin D status (mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration <20 ng/mL), supplementation with 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 significantly improved vitamin D status, as well as upper and lower limb muscle strength and postural balance parameters [(84, 85)](#reference84). The risks of fall and recurrent falls were found to be two- to three-fold greater in women in the control group than in those supplemented with vitamin D3 [(85)](#reference85). In contrast, another 12-month randomized controlled study in 200 older adults (of which 58% had a baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration <20 ng/mL) showed no benefits regarding lower extremity function or odds of falling in those supplemented with 2,000 IU/day (+/- 10 \u00b5g of calcidiol) compared to those who received 800 IU/day [(86)](#reference86). The recently published post-hoc analysis of the ViDA trial found no differences in odds of falling and number of falls reported by 5,108 community-dwelling participants (ages, 50-84 years) regardless of whether they were randomized to receive supplemental vitamin D (100,000 IU/month, i.e. ~3,350 IU/day) or a placebo for a mean 3.4 years [(79)](#reference79). Most ViDA participants had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations 20 ng/mL, which might at least partly explain the lack of an effect of vitamin D on falls [(87)](#reference87). Overall, the current evidence suggests that vitamin D3 supplements of 800-1,000 IU/day may be helpful in reducing falls and fracture rates in older adults. In order for vitamin D supplementation to be effective in preserving bone health, adequate dietary calcium (1,000 to 1,200 mg/day) should be consumed (see the article on [Calcium](../minerals/calcium)) [(88)](#reference88). [Ecologic studies](../glossary#ecologic-study) first suggested an association between Northern latitudes, vitamin D deficiency, and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) incidence [(89)](#reference89). Since the 1980s, several [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined the association of vitamin D intake or status and various types of cancer. A 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 16 prospective studies, including 137,567 subjects, reported an 11% reduction in total cancer incidence and a 17% reduction in cancer mortality with each 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) increase in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Yet, a sex-based subgroup analysis of eight studies found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating vitamin D and cancer mortality in women, but not in men [(90)](#reference90). In addition, increasing evidence suggests that a few variations in the [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for the vitamin D [receptor](../glossary#receptor) (VDR) might influence individual vitamin D status and subsequently modify the susceptibility to site-specific cancers [(91)](#reference91) and influence cancer survival [(92)](#reference92). Finally, many [malignant](../glossary#malignant) tumors have been found to express the VDR, including breast, lung, skin (melanoma), [colon](../glossary#colon), and bone [(93)](#reference93), suggesting that they might be susceptible to the effects of vitamin D. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that biologically active forms of vitamin D, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and its [analogs](../glossary#analog), upon binding to the VDR, can control cell fate by inhibiting [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and/or inducing cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) or death ( [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis)) of a number of cancerous cell types [(94)](#reference94). The geographic distribution of [colon](../glossary#colon) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) mortality resembles the historical geographic distribution of [rickets](../glossary#rickets) [(95)](#reference95), providing circumstantial evidence that decreased sunlight exposure and diminished vitamin D nutritional status may be related to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of colon cancer. Evidence from observational studies has largely supported this hypothesis. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), four [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating vitamin D and incidence of [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) \u2014 a benign tumor that may transform to become [malignant](../glossary#malignant) [(96)](#reference96). The analysis identified a 32% risk reduction between top versus bottom quantiles of [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [(96)](#reference96). Additionally, there is strong evidence from meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies to suggest that higher vitamin D intakes and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with reductions in colorectal cancer risk [(97-99)](#reference97). The most recent meta-analysis of four prospective cohort, 17 [nested case-control](../glossary#nested-case-control-study), and three case-control studies found a 38% reduced risk of colorectal cancer with high versus low quantiles of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [(100)](#reference100). A dose-response analysis estimated that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of ~20 to 30 ng/mL (compared to 12 ng/mL) were associated with a 17% lower risk of colorectal cancer, and the risk was even lower (-35%) with a serum concentration of 55 ng/mL [(100)](#reference100). An earlier dose-response analysis based on five nested case-control studies had estimated that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations 33 ng/mL (compared to 12 ng/mL) were associated with a 50% lower risk of colorectal cancer [(101)](#reference101). However, in a seven-year, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 36,282 postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative study, a combination of supplemental vitamin D3 (400 IU/day) and calcium (1,000 mg/day) did not lower incidence of colorectal cancer [(102)](#reference102). Another [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of vitamin D3 (1,000 IU/day), with or without calcium supplementation (1,200 mg/day), found no reduction in the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence over a three-to-five year period, compared to placebo, after initial adenoma removal in participants [(103)](#reference103). Whether these daily vitamin D doses are too low to detect any effect on cancer incidence is not clear [(101, 104)](#reference101). Additional randomized [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation could help prevent colorectal cancer. Moreover, it is uncertain whether genetic variations ( [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism)) in the sequence of [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in vitamin D [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and function can influence the relationship between vitamin D status and risk of colorectal adenoma or colorectal cancer [(105-107)](#reference105). Finally, growing evidence suggests that adequate vitamin D status may be linked to better survival of colorectal cancer patients. A meta-analysis of five prospective studies found a 35% reduced risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality in cancer patients with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. A dose-response analysis estimated that every 8 ng/mL increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with a 10% decrease in colorectal cancer mortality [(108)](#reference108). Although [ecologic](../glossary#ecologic-study) evidence suggests that breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) mortality rises with increasing latitudes and decreasing sunlight exposure [(109)](#reference109), the most current [observational](../glossary#observational-study) data provide little support for an association between vitamin D nutritional status and risk of breast cancer. An early [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of women who participated in the First US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) found that Caucasian women with adequate sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D intake had a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer 20 years later [(110)](#reference110). Nonetheless, when this study was included in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) with nine more recent prospective studies, there was no significant difference in the risk of developing breast cancer between the highest and lowest levels of vitamin D intakes [(111)](#reference111). Moreover, whether an association exists between circulating vitamin D concentrations and risk of breast cancer is unclear. One meta-analysis of 14 observational studies (9,110 cases and 16,244 controls) reported an overall risk reduction of 16% when the highest quantile of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was compared to the lowest. This [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) was statistically significant in postmenopausal women but not in premenopausal women [(112)](#reference112). Yet, another meta-analysis that included a similar set of 14 prospective studies (two studies were different) found no overall association [(111)](#reference111). Additionally, a meta-analysis of studies conducted in patients in the early stage of breast cancer identified associations between inadequate vitamin D status and increased risks of recurrence and death [(113)](#reference113). Evidence from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) is currently too limited to conclude whether vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may reduce breast cancer incidence (reviewed in [114](#reference114)). Nonetheless, three meta-analyses have found an inverse association between circulating vitamin D concentrations and breast cancer-related mortality [(111](#reference111), [115, 116)](#reference115). In one meta-analysis of one [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) and five prospective cohort studies, the highest versus lowest categories of serum vitamin D concentrations was associated with a 33% reduction in mortality; a dose-response analysis found a 12% reduction per 8 ng/mL increase in serum vitamin D [(115)](#reference115). Finally, current evidence does not suggest that specific genetic variations in the [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for the VDR may influence the risk of breast cancer [(117, 118)](#reference117). Evidence associating vitamin D status with other types of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) is currently limited. While incidence of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer appears to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the availability of sunlight, [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have not generally found significant relationships between [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and subsequent [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing prostate cancer [(119, 120)](#reference119). In fact, some studies have suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer with higher circulating vitamin D concentrations. For example, a [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) of men (622 cases and 1,451 controls) from Scandinavia found a U-shaped relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and prostate cancer risk. In that study, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 7.6 ng/mL or lower, or 32 ng/mL or higher, were associated with increased prostate cancer risk [(121)](#reference121). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 nested case-control studies, three prospective cohort studies, and one retrospective cohort study found a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer in individuals in the highest versus lowest categories of blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [(122)](#reference122). Potential [confounding](../glossary#confounder) factors that might explain the detection of a slight increase in prostate cancer cases in men with high circulating vitamin D concentrations have been highlighted in a recent publication [(123)](#reference123). Finally, recent meta-analyses of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and risk of lung cancer [(124, 125)](#reference124) and bladder cancer [(126, 127)](#reference126). Yet, in the few and often [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) studies published to date, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were not associated with other cancer types, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [(128)](#reference128), ovarian cancer are examples of [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease). Autoimmune diseases occur when the body mounts an immune response against its own tissue, rather than a foreign [pathogen](../glossary#pathogen). In type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin-producing -cells of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) are the target of an inappropriate immune response. In MS, the targets are the [myelin](../glossary#myelin)-producing cells of the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), and in RA, the targets are the [collagen](../glossary#collagen)-producing cells of the joints [(132)](#reference132). SLE is characterized by the presence of a large spectrum of autoantibodies resulting in potential damage to multiple tissues [(133)](#reference133). Autoimmune responses are mediated by immune cells called T cells. The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has been found to modulate T cell responses, such that the autoimmune responses are diminished. [Ecologic studies](../glossary#ecologic-study) have found that the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of autoimmune diseases (particularly for MS; [134](#reference134)) increases as latitude increases, suggesting that lower exposure to UVB radiation and associated decreases in skin vitamin D [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) may play a role in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of these diseases. Results of several [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) also suggest that adequate vitamin D status at different ages (including in utero, early childhood, and during adolescence) could possibly decrease the [risk](../glossary#risk) of autoimmune diseases. Lower levels of circulating vitamin D have been reported in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) compared to age- and sex-matched non-diabetic A greater [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency has also been observed in prediabetic children who developed multiple islet autoantibodies (antibodies against [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-secreting [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cells) compared to autoantibody-negative children. However, a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed the cohort of prediabetic children found that their vitamin D status, defined as either insufficient, deficient, or sufficient, was not associated with rate of progression to type 1 diabetes after 5 or 10 years of follow up [(137)](#reference137). An earlier prospective cohort study of children born in Finland during the year 1966 and followed for 30 years found that children supplemented with vitamin D during the first year of life had an 88% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 1 diabetes compared to those receiving no supplementation. Moreover, children suspected of having had [rickets](../glossary#rickets) (severe vitamin D deficiency) during the first year of life showed a significantly higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes [(138)](#reference138). Thus, vitamin D supplementation appears protective against type 1 diabetes onset, and suboptimal vitamin D status in infancy may have long-term effects on immune responses later in life. There are also limited data suggesting that maternal vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy may influence the risk of type 1 diabetes in offspring. In a recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study), the risk of childhood onset of type 1 diabetes was more than two-fold greater in children whose mothers had [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <21.6 ng/mL (54 nmol/L) during the last trimester of pregnancy compared to children born from women with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D >35.6 ng/mL (89 nmol/L) [(139)](#reference139). Other case-control studies have found that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of their children developing diabetes-related autoantibodies [(140, 141)](#reference140). However, a larger study conducted in mothers of children at increased genetic risk for diabetes reported no association between the appearance of islet autoantibodies and/or diabetes onset in offspring in the first year of life and maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy [(142)](#reference142). Another case-control study failed to observe a relationship between serum 25-dihydroxyvitamin D during early pregnancy and type 1 diabetes diagnosis in offspring [(143)](#reference143). Large prospective studies are needed to establish whether maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy can influence the risk of type 1 diabetes in offspring. Finally, the relationship of [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in vitamin D [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism)-related [genes](../glossary#gene) and type 1 diabetes is currently under investigation. It has been proposed that specific polymorphisms in genes, such as CYP27B1 (coding for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase) and VDR, may be functionally relevant to the action of vitamin D and may thus affect disease susceptibility. In a study conducted in 8,517 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and 7,320 control subjects, polymorphisms in genes involved in [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and vitamin D [hydroxylation](../glossary#hydroxylation) were linked to circulating vitamin D concentrations and diabetic status [(26)](#reference26). Low levels of sun exposure and vitamin D deficiency appear to be associated with the development of [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) (MS). Poor vitamin D status may compromise the function of specific immune cells critical in the regulation of various immune responses and help trigger autoimmunity in MS [(144)](#reference144). Genetic determinants of low vitamin D status have been recently linked to an increased susceptibility to adult-onset MS in a [Mendelian randomization analysis](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) of data from the Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium [(145)](#reference145). This echoed the results of several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that suggested an association between vitamin D sufficiency and decreased MS [risk](../glossary#risk). A [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) of levels of ambient UV radiation and cases of MS conducted in Australia revealed that MS incidence in offspring was [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) to maternal exposure to UV during early pregnancy [(146)](#reference146). Sun exposure was also used as a surrogate marker for vitamin D exposure in a recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 1,660 MS patients and 3,050 controls. The authors found that infrequent outdoor activities and the use of sunscreen during early childhood and adolescence were associated with an increased risk of developing MS later in life [(147)](#reference147). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study), sun exposure and intake of cod liver oil (rich in vitamin D) during childhood were linked to later symptom onset among veterans with relapsing MS [(148)](#reference148). Additionally, a case-control study in US military personnel, including 257 cases of diagnosed MS, found that Caucasian subjects in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (>39.6 ng/mL) had a 62% lower risk of developing MS compared to the lowest quintile (<25.3 ng/mL) (149). Further, in two large cohorts of over 187,000 US women followed for at least 10 years, vitamin D [supplement](../glossary#supplement) use (400 IU/day) was associated with a 41% reduction in the risk of developing MS [(150)](#reference150). Another prospective, uncontrolled study monitored incidence of relapse in relation to vitamin D status in 156 patients with relapsing-remitting MS before and after they were given supplemental vitamin D (100,000 IU/month; 6-42 months, median of 31 months), in addition to first-line immunomodulatory therapy [(151)](#reference151). Each 4 ng/mL increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with a 14.9% decrease in incidence of relapse [(151)](#reference151). In a multicenter study conducted in patients newly diagnosed with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and treated with interferon (IFN)-, vitamin D status was predictive of MS disease activity and progression. Higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L) in the first year following CIS diagnosis predicted a longer time to MS diagnosis, lower number of new lesions, and lower changes in lesion and brain volume during the subsequent four years of follow-up [(152)](#reference152). However, a retrospective study suggested that vitamin D status in patients with relapsing-remitting MS had no predictive value regarding the time to conversion to secondary progressive MS, which is characterized by a worsening of disability [(153)](#reference153). [Clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have failed to demonstrate any benefit of vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination with IFN- treatment, with respect to relapse rates and disability-related symptoms in MS patients [(154, 155)](#reference154). In other trials, supplemental vitamin D3 also failed to demonstrate immunomodulary activities [(156-159)](#reference156). In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 53 IFN--treated patients with relapsing-remitting MS, supplementation with vitamin D3 (7,000 IU/day for four weeks, followed by 14,000 IU/day until week 48) showed little effect on the proportion of some regulatory T and B [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) over the 48-week study period. Vitamin D3 only appeared to help maintain the proportion of anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cells \u2014 which decreased in patients given placebo \u2014 but failed to enhance their reactivity when stimulated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) trial, supplementation with vitamin D3 (10,400 IU/day for three months) to patients with relapsing-remitting MS was found to reduce the proportion of pro-inflammatory IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells, which are thought to play a central role in MS development [(160)](#reference160). Vitamin D deficiency may also be implicated in the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) and/or progression of [rheumatoid arthritis](../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis) (RA), although evidence is mainly from animal studies. The absence of vitamin D [receptors](../glossary#receptor) (VDR) in genetically modified mice has been linked to higher levels of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and increased susceptibility to [autoimmunity](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) [(161)](#reference161). When transgenic mice that spontaneously develop inflammatory arthritis are also deficient in VDR, they develop a more aggressive form of chronic arthritis [(162)](#reference162). Also, specific [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in the VDR [gene](../glossary#gene) have been linked to an increased susceptibility to RA in certain populations, although how these genetic variants influence vitamin D functionality is not fully understood [(163-165)](#reference163). The current data, however, point to a role for vitamin D in modulating the inflammatory process that underlies many [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease), including RA. Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in individuals with moderate-to-high levels of inflammation have reported either no association or an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and markers of inflammation. Nonetheless, there is a lack of [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) to show whether vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) could limit inflammation and reduce disease [risk](../glossary#risk) (including RA) in subjects with high inflammation levels [(166)](#reference166). At this time, it remains unclear whether the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D deficiency is linked to RA incidence. In a large cohort study of nearly 30,000 postmenopausal US women, subjects with the highest total vitamin D intakes (467.7 IU/day) had a 33% lower risk of developing RA after 11 years of follow-up than those with the lowest intakes (<221.4 IU/day) [(167)](#reference167). Yet, more recent analyses of two large cohorts of nearly 200,000 US women followed for several decades found no association between reported vitamin D dietary intakes (using [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) during adolescence or adulthood and incidence of RA later in life [(168, 169)](#reference168). Moreover, several studies that explored the relationship between circulating vitamin D and disease activity in RA patients have reported mixed results (reviewed in [170](#reference170)). Yet, two recent meta-analyses of observational studies found an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and disease activity in RA patients, assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28 ( [DAS28](http://www.nras.org.uk/the-das28-score)) [(171, 172)](#reference171). Finally, there is a dearth of studies exploring the effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease activity in arthritis subjects. A small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 22 RA patients failed to demonstrate improvements in disease activity and inflammation level in subjects supplemented with [calcium](../minerals/calcium) (1,500 mg/day) and high doses of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol; averaging over 4,500 IU/day) for a year compared to placebo [(173)](#reference173). Another three-month, randomized controlled trial in 41 women with early RA found no additional benefits of supplemental vitamin D3 (one bolus dose of 300,000 IU) to standard care (methotrexate and glucocorticoids) regarding T-helper lymphocyte enumeration, cytokine production, or clinical parameters including disease activity [(174)](#reference174). Supplemental vitamin D also failed to reduce disease recurrence rate in RA patients enrolled in two small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(175, 176)](#reference175). Since these studies have several limitations, including small sample size, additional research is warranted. More [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) and severe in non-Caucasian populations (Hispanics, African descendants, and Asians) [(177)](#reference177), [systemic lupus erythematosus](../glossary#systemic-lupus-erythematosus) (SLE) is an [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) with [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) clinical manifestations. The disease can potentially affect most tissues and organs, including skin (skin rash and photosensitivity), kidneys (nephritis), and joints (arthritis). There is evidence of a role for vitamin D in the prevention of SLE in animal models [(178)](#reference178). Interestingly, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 11 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found that specific VDR [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) were linked to SLE in Asians particularly [(179)](#reference179). However, the functional relevance of such genetic variants is not known [(180)](#reference180). Analyses of two large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of nearly 200,000 US women failed to show an association between dietary vitamin D intake (measured by [food frequency questionnaire](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) during adolescence or adulthood and incidence of SLE later in life [(168, 169)](#reference168). Yet, a suboptimal vitamin D status is commonly observed in subjects with SLE, and this is partly explained by the lack of sunlight exposure, which tends to aggravate disease symptoms [(181, 182)](#reference181). [Serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with measures of disease activity in a cohort of 378 patients with SLE [(183)](#reference183). The correction of vitamin D insufficiency with high levels of vitamin D3 (100,000 IU/week for one month followed by 100,000 IU/month for six months) in 20 subjects with SLE was linked to a reduction in signs of immune imbalance and in levels of autoantibodies typically detected in SLE, suggesting a therapeutic value for vitamin D in disease treatment [(184)](#reference184). Another prospective study conducted in 52 vitamin D-deficient patients with [cutaneous](../glossary#cutaneous) lupus erythematosus (a type of lupus with skin disorders only) reported a reduction in disease severity in the group [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with vitamin D3 (1,400 IU/day initially, followed by 800 IU/day) and [calcium](../minerals/calcium) for one year compared to untreated patients [(185)](#reference185). Supplementation with vitamin D3 (200 IU/day for one year) was also able to reduce the level of inflammatory [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study conducted in 267 patients with SLE [(186)](#reference186). In another randomized, placebo-controlled trial, supplementation with vitamin D3 (50,000 IU/week for six months) improved SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) scores, as well as some measures of fatigue in young adults with juvenile-onset SLE [(187)](#reference187). However, in two other recent studies, supplementation with vitamin D3 (weekly/monthly bolus doses equivalent to ~800 to 7,000 IU/day for 6 to 24 months) improved vitamin D status in SLE patients but failed to show any benefit regarding disease activity [(188, 189)](#reference188). While oral vitamin D administration to SLE patients is well tolerated, its efficacy remains questionable and deserves further investigation in [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). Thus, evidence from human [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) suggests that while it cannot yet be concluded that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in prevention or treatment of [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease), it is reasonable to assume that correcting vitamin D insufficiency and maintaining sufficient levels could possibly help decrease disease [risk](../glossary#risk) [(190)](#reference190). [Hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) [observational](../glossary#observational-study) and [clinical studies](../glossary#clinical-trial) suggest a role for vitamin D in lowering blood pressure, which may be partly explained by the fact that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D inhibits renin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) (see [Function](#function)). Thus, vitamin D deficiency and subsequent upregulation of the renin-angiotensin system may contribute to high blood pressure and CVD risk. It has also been suggested that elevated PTH concentrations may increase the risk of [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) and CVD [(6)](#reference6). Yet, in a recent [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 3,002 individuals (mean age, 59 years at baseline), the incidence of hypertension, which affected 41% of participants during the nine year follow-up period, was not higher in those with [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations lower than 20 ng/mL and was only marginally associated with elevated PTH concentrations [(192)](#reference192). Nevertheless, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven prospective studies, including a total of 48,633 participants with nearly 5,000 incident hypertension cases, found a 30% lower risk of hypertension in those in the top versus bottom [tertiles](../glossary#tertile) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The dose-response analysis estimated that every 10 ng/mL increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with a 12% lower risk of hypertension [(193)](#reference193). Another meta-analysis of four prospective and 14 [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) also reported an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and hypertension [(194)](#reference194). [Vascular endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction, which contributes to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD), is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [(195)](#reference195). In CKD patients, abnormal endothelial function is associated with low values of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, a surrogate marker of vascular health. In a recent study conducted in subjects with mild-to-moderate CKD, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were positively associated with FMD values, suggesting a link between suboptimal vitamin D status and endothelial dysfunction [(196)](#reference196). In a preliminary [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial), 26 patients with moderate CKD and vitamin D insufficiency (mean value, 17.2 ng/mL) were supplemented twice with 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 (at weeks 1 and 8) and followed for a total of 16 weeks. Vitamin D supplementation nearly doubled [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and decreased PTH concentrations by 68.5%; improved vitamin D status was accompanied by increased FMD values and reduced levels of endothelial dysfunction markers [(197)](#reference197). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in participants at high risk for CVD found a significant increase in FMD with vitamin D supplementation (daily doses, 2,500-5,000 IU; weekly dose, 50,000 IU; monthly dose, 60,000 IU; single-bolus doses, 100,000-200,000 IU) for eight weeks to six months [(198)](#reference198). To date, the many [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) investigating the relationship between vitamin D and outcomes of CVD have provided mixed results (reviewed in [199](#reference199)). Recent [Mendelian randomization studies](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) found no association between genetically low [serum](../glossary#serum) D concentrations and [risks](../glossary#risk) of disease, or suggesting that associations reported in may be due to [confounding](../glossary#confounder) or [reverse causation](../glossary#reverse-causation). In the RECORD trial in 5,292 older people (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)), supplementation with 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 (\u00b1 calcium) reduced the risk of first cardiac failure but had no effect on the risk of myocardial infarction and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) compared to supplementation with calcium alone or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(202)](#reference202). Data on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular events were collected from 21 [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (including the RECORD trial) in 13,033 participants (60 years old) and combined in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(202)](#reference202). No effect of vitamin D (including vitamin D [analogs](../glossary#analog)) was found for major [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, including [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure), myocardial infarction, and stroke over follow-up periods of 1 to 6.2 years [(202)](#reference202). However, caution is advised when interpreting these results since the trials were initially designed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D on bone health, and cardiovascular outcomes were not primary endpoints. Several randomized controlled trials exploring the effect of vitamin D supplementation on CVD risk are currently underway [(203)](#reference203), including two large trials, the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) in the US [(204)](#reference204) and the D-Health trial in Australia [(205)](#reference205). The results of one randomized controlled trial, the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) trial in New Zealand, were recently published. The total number of CVD events and time to first CVD event during follow-up did not differ between those supplemented with vitamin D3 (initial dose of 200,000 IU for the first month followed by monthly doses of 100,000 IU) and those given a placebo for a median 3.3 years [(206)](#reference206). People with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), and [obesity](../glossary#obesity). A recent study found that the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of type 2 diabetes was associated with low levels of [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (<30 ng/mL) in 1,801 patients with metabolic During an eight-year follow-up period, lower risks of all-cause mortality (72% lower risk) and CVD-specific mortality (64% lower risk) were reported in individuals with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations over 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) when compared to those with concentrations below 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) [(207)](#reference207). In healthy people, vitamin D sufficiency is positively correlated with [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) and adequate [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) -cell function. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency might affect [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) and cause [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and insulin resistance [(208)](#reference208). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) conducted in 12,719 adults, of whom 4,057 had prediabetes (i.e., an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes), the prevalence of prediabetes was associated with lower concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (32.4 ng/mL). Subjects with the lowest concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (17.7 ng/mL) were more likely to be current smokers, obese, and have hypertension [(209)](#reference209). Vitamin D insufficiency in high-risk individuals may accelerate the progression to overt diabetes. In a prospective study of 2,378 middle-aged men and women followed for 8 to 10 years, the risk for progression to type 2 diabetes from prediabetes was 62% lower in women and 60% lower in men in the highest compared to the lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of circulating vitamin D (>28.4 ng/mL vs. <18.5 ng/mL). A dose-response analysis measured an average 23% reduction in the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes for every 4 ng/mL (10 nmol/L) increment in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [(210)](#reference210). A recent review and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including over 210,000 participants followed for a median period of 10 years, found that individuals in the top third of vitamin D levels (reported as either circulating vitamin D or dietary intakes) had lower risks of developing type 2 diabetes (19% lower risk) and metabolic syndrome (14% lower risk) compared to those in the bottom third [(211)](#reference211). In another meta-analysis of nine prospective studies, including 28,258 older people (mean age, 67.7 years), lower versus higher circulating vitamin D concentrations at baseline were found to be associated with a 17% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes over a median follow-up period of 7.3 years [(212)](#reference212). Currently, limited evidence suggests that vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with glucose intolerance or manifest type 2 diabetes [(213-216)](#reference213). There is a need for well-designed [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) to examine whether maintaining adequate vitamin D levels can prevent adverse metabolic outcomes in healthy and at-risk individuals. [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the most common form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), characterized by the presence of extra- [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) - [amyloid and intra-neuronal Tau [protein](../glossary#protein) aggregates (known as neurofibrillary tangles) in the brain. Mechanistic models currently investigated in animal research suggest that vitamin D deficiency or disorders of vitamin D [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and/or the disruption of the vitamin D-VDR pathway in the [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) regions of the cortex and hippocampus may be involved in the degeneration of [neurons](../glossary#neuron) and loss of [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) functions [(217)](#reference217). Experimental evidence supporting a role for vitamin D in calcium channel regulation, neuroprotection, and immunomodulation in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) also implies that low vitamin D status may precede or contribute to cognitive dysfunction with age [(218)](#reference218). A number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined cognitive decline and degenerative brain disease in the elderly in relation to dietary intake of vitamin D and [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. In a large French cohort study on [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and hip [fractures](../glossary#fracture) in postmenopausal women, impairments in global cognitive performance, assessed with the Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ), were associated with lower dietary intakes of vitamin D (<1,400 IU/week vs. 1,400 IU/week) in 5,596 elderly women (mean age, 80.5 years) [(219)](#reference219). A seven-year follow-up study of a subgroup of 498 women indicated that the [risk](../glossary#risk) of Alzheimer's disease (but not other types of dementia) was 77% lower in those in the highest versus the lowest [quintiles](../glossary#quintile) of vitamin D dietary intakes at baseline [(220)](#reference220). Some, but not all, observational studies have found an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and mild cognitive impairment in older adults [(219, 221, 222)](#reference219). The [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and longitudinal analysis of two [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), which included 1,604 men [(223)](#reference223) and 6,257 women [(224)](#reference224) aged 65 and over, reported a 60% greater odds of cognitive impairment at baseline and a 58% increased risk of cognitive decline during a four-year follow-up period in women, but not in men, with vitamin D deficiency (circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D <10 ng/mL vs. 30 ng/mL). In the [nested case-control](../glossary#nested-case-control-study), multiethnic, Singapore Kidney Eye Study, which included 2,273 individuals (mean age, 70.4 years), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with cognitive deficits affecting retrograde episodic memory, semantic memory, and orientation in time, as assessed by the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) [(225)](#reference225). Yet, [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies have given mixed results regarding the association of vitamin D status with cognitive performance and AD [(226-230)](#reference226). Moreover, the recent analysis of data from 1,182 men followed for 18 years in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) failed to find associations of genetic determinants of vitamin D synthesis, vitamin D intakes, and [plasma](../glossary#plasma) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with risks of cognitive impairments, AD, vascular dementia, or all-cause dementia [(231)](#reference231). In contrast, another [Mendelian randomization study](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) associated genetic determinants of low vitamin D status to higher risk of AD in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project dataset (17,008 AD cases and 37,154 healthy cases) [(232)](#reference232). Nevertheless, the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency ranges between 70% and 90% in older adults, and correcting low concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D may help improve cognitive processes, in particular [executive functions](../glossary#executive-function) [(233)](#reference233). In a small, non-randomized controlled study in an outpatient clinic, global cognitive function was assessed at baseline and after 16 months in 20 patients [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with 800 IU/day (or 100,000 IU/month) of vitamin D and in 24 control subjects. The supplementation of outpatients with vitamin D resulted in the correction of low vitamin D status (average serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 16.8 ng/mL at baseline and 30 ng/mL at 16 months) and was associated with a significantly improved scoring in cognition tests compared to the non-supplemented group [(234)](#reference234). In a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled 32 mild-to-moderate AD patients receiving nasal [insulin](../glossary#insulin), high doses of vitamin D2 supplementation for eight weeks (up to 36,000 IU/day) did not significantly improve cognitive performance compared to low doses (1,000 IU/day) [(235)](#reference235). More research is needed to investigate a causal relationship between vitamin D [repletion](../glossary#replete) and potential long-term cognitive benefits in older adults. Further, it is of great importance to evaluate whether correcting vitamin D deficiency in cognitively impaired subjects can improve the impact of anti-dementia therapy [(236)](#reference236). [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) (PD) has been associated with a high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D insufficiency among patients, especially those with greater mobility problems [(237)](#reference237). A [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) of 296 outpatients with a mean age of 65 years indicated that 23% of PD subjects had [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations lower than 20 ng/mL compared to 16% and 10% of AD and healthy individuals, respectively [(238)](#reference238). In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted among 3,173 men and women aged 50-79 years and free of PD at baseline, individuals in the highest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (20 ng/mL for women and 22.8 ng/mL for men) had a 67% lower risk of PD compared to those in the lowest quartile (10 ng/mL for women and 11.2 ng/mL for men) [(239)](#reference239). [Meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) pooling data from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) all showed that vitamin D inadequacy was more likely reported in subjects with PD than in healthy controls [(240-242)](#reference240). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, 112 PD patients (mean age, 72 years) on standard PD treatment were [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with 1,200 IU/day of vitamin D or a placebo for 12 months. Vitamin D supplementation nearly doubled serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (from mean of 22.5 ng/mL to 41.7 ng/mL) in supplemented subjects and limited the progression of PD, as indicated by a greater proportion of patients who showed no worsening (as assessed by the Hoehn and Yahr stage and the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part II) in the supplemented group compared to the placebo group [(243)](#reference243). It is not known whether vitamin D insufficiency has a role in the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of the disease, but the [repletion](../glossary#replete) of vitamin D may provide health benefits that go beyond the prevention and/or the treatment of PD. For example, vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the increased risk of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and bone [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in individuals with [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorders, including PD and [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) [(244-246)](#reference244). Interestingly, sunlight exposure was found to be associated with improved vitamin D status, higher [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) of the second metacarpal bone, and lower incidence of hip fracture in a prospective study conducted in 324 elderly people with PD [(247)](#reference247). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 31 [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) on maternal vitamin D status and pregnancy outcomes indicated that vitamin D insufficiency may be associated with [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), and [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) vaginosis in pregnant women. Low maternal serum vitamin D during pregnancy was also linked to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for small-for-gestational age infants and low-birth-weight infants, but not for Cesarean section [(248)](#reference248). However, the number of [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) is currently too limited to draw conclusions as to whether vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy might reduce the incidence of the above-mentioned adverse outcomes [(249)](#reference249). Abnormal [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) due to [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) characterizes the onset of [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) (GDM) in pregnant women without known type 2 diabetes mellitus. This condition is associated with serious adverse maternal outcomes, including [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), high [risk](../glossary#risk) of Cesarean delivery, and life-long increased risk of developing [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. GDM may also contribute to increased risks of fetal macrosomia (excessive birth weight), neonatal [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia), infant respiratory distress, and increased life-long risk for [glucose intolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) the offspring (reviewed in [250](#reference250)). A recent [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted in 655 pregnant women found that the mean [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration during the first trimester of pregnancy was significantly lower in 54 women who developed incident GDM compared to the rest of the cohort (23 ng/mL vs. 25.4 ng/mL). After multiple adjustments for [confounding](../glossary#confounder) factors of vitamin D status and GDM risk (including overweight/obesity and prior history of type 2 diabetes and GDM), the study found each 7.5 ng/mL decrease in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration during early pregnancy was associated with a 48% higher risk of developing GDM [(251)](#reference251). Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (<29.4 ng/mL) during the second trimester of pregnancy were also associated with GDM incidence in a [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) of 118 women with GDM and 219 subjects [(252)](#reference252). Five [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(248](#reference248), [253-256)](#reference253), including [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) of moderate-to-high quality, also reported that maternal serum vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy were [inversely related](../glossary#inverse-association) to the risk of developing GDM despite evidence of [bias](../glossary#bias) amongst studies, such as the use of different methods for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, measures done in different trimesters, and different criteria to assess GDM (reviewed in [257](#reference257)). Further, evidence for the role of vitamin D in [glucose](../glossary#glucose) regulation during pregnancy was reported in a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 54 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM. The [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 twice during a six-week period (at day 1 and day 21) resulted in significantly lower fasting [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose and serum [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentration, reduced [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), and improved [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) compared to placebo [(258)](#reference258). This suggests that vitamin D deficiency may adversely affect glucose tolerance during pregnancy and contribute to the onset of GDM. Yet, the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of glucose intolerance and GDM during pregnancy have not been assessed. A multicentered, [randomized controlled trial ](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial)(DALI) is ongoing in Europe to evaluate the effects of vitamin D and lifestyle interventions (healthy eating and physical activity) on the metabolic status of pregnant women at risk of GDM (inclusion criteria: pre-pregnancy BMI 29 kg/m2) [(259)](#reference259). Preliminary findings suggest that healthy eating and physical activity can help lower gestational weight gain, when compared to standard-of-care; however, these lifestyle changes are unlikely to reduce the risk of GDM among obese pregnant women [(260)](#reference260). The results regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the DALI study are yet to be published. During pregnancy, increased [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) [calcium](../minerals/calcium) absorption and mobilization of calcium from the skeleton allows accretion of calcium within the fetal skeleton. Yet, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that examined the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and measures of fetal bone growth have not provided consistent results [(261, 262)](#reference261). In addition, recent data from the Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study (MAVIDOS) suggested no difference in whole-body bone mineral content (BMC) of newborns from mothers randomized to daily supplementation with either vitamin D3 (1,000 IU) or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) from <17 weeks' gestation until delivery [(263)](#reference263). Further, the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in Danish children ages 10 to 18 years was similar regardless of whether their mothers were exposed to extra vitamin D from [fortification](../glossary#fortification) during pregnancy [(264)](#reference264). While maternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy effectively prevents the neonate's risk of vitamin D deficiency at birth [(265)](#reference265), there is little evidence that neonatal vitamin D status influences the risk of fracture later during childhood [(266)](#reference266). A few observational studies have given rather weak evidence in support of a relationship between maternal vitamin D sufficiency during pregnancy and incidence of respiratory conditions and allergies in children [(267)](#reference267). A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that the supplementation of 108 pregnant women in the third trimester (at week 27 of gestation until delivery) with either 800 IU/day or a bolus dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 did not decrease the risk of wheezing, allergic rhinitis, food allergy diagnosis, lower respiratory tract infections, or eczema in offspring at three years of age compared to placebo (N=50) [(268)](#reference268). A more recent [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), randomized controlled trial found that vitamin D3 supplementation of 295 Danish pregnant women, from weeks 22 to 26 of gestation until delivery, with 2,800 IU/day (70 g/day) \u2014 compared to 400 IU/day (10 g/day) of vitamin D3 (i.e., the current recommendation in Denmark) (N=286) \u2014 reduced the risk of troublesome episodes of lung symptoms by 17% in offspring during the first three years of life [(269)](#reference269). However, no differences were reported regarding the risk of persistent wheeze, [asthma](../glossary#asthma), allergic sensitization, respiratory tract infections, or eczema between treatment and control groups [(269)](#reference269). In a similar randomized, double-blind, controlled trial \u2014 the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial \u2014 conducted in 777 US pregnant women with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema (or whose partner had such an history), supplementation with 2,400 IU/day (60 g/day) or 400 IU/day (10 g/day) did not result in differences in the risk of developing asthma or recurrent wheezing in their children at age three years [(270)](#reference270). Despite the lack of significance reported in individual studies, the pooled analysis of the three trials found a 19% reduction in the risk of recurrent wheeze in children whose mothers received high-dose versus low-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy [(271)](#reference271). In a cohort of 378 mother-child pairs, high [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations measured in the 34th week of pregnancy were associated with an increase in food allergy of the child during the first two years of life, warranting careful evaluation of the safety of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy [(272)](#reference272). Since vitamin D insufficiency has been linked to [autoimmunity](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) (see [Autoimmune diseases](#autoimmune-diseases-prevention)), it has also been proposed that poor maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may contribute to an increased risk of autoimmune diabetes ( [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus) in the offspring. Yet, the results of a study of 3,723 children at high genetic risk for type 1 diabetes and followed for a mean 4.3 year-period found that maternal intake of vitamin D (from food and/or supplements) during the third trimester of pregnancy (assessed through [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) was not associated with advanced -cell autoimmunity or clinical diabetes [(142)](#reference142). In a [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study), there was no difference in mean serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D during the first trimester of pregnancy between 343 mothers of children with type 1 diabetes and 343 control mothers [(143)](#reference143). A follow-up study suggested that specific maternal VDR polymorphisms, rather than vitamin D status, may be linked to an increased susceptibility to developing type 1 diabetes in children [(273)](#reference273). Another nested case-control study (119 mothers of children with type 1 diabetes and 129 control mothers) found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between maternal vitamin D-binding protein \u2014 but not 25-hydroxyvitamin D \u2014 concentration during the third trimester of pregnancy and the risk of type 1 diabetes in children [(274)](#reference274). At present, there is no established causality between maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and risk of autoimmune disease in offspring. More than 200 [viruses](../glossary#virus) are responsible for causing familiar infections of the upper respiratory tract (URT), known as the [common cold](../health-disease/common-cold), resulting in symptoms of nasal congestion and discharge, cough, sore throat, and sneezing [(275)](#reference275). The analysis of [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data from 18,883 participants (ages 12 years and older) of the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reported an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and recent (self-reported) URT infection (URTI). Compared to levels of circulating vitamin D of 30 ng/mL or above, the [risk](../glossary#risk) of URTI was 24% higher in individuals with concentrations between 10 and 29 ng/mL and 36% higher in those with levels below 10 ng/mL [(276)](#reference276). A subgroup analysis indicated that low concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in subjects with [asthma](../glossary#asthma) and [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](../glossary#chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease) (COPD) were linked to a greater susceptibility to URTI when compared to people without pulmonary disease. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial conducted in 322 healthy adults (ages 18 years), supplementation with monthly doses of vitamin D3 (200,000 IU for the first two months and 100,000 IU for the following 16 months) significantly raised the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (from 29 ng/mL to 48 ng/mL) in the intervention group but did not decrease the occurrence of URTI compared to placebo [(277)](#reference277). Moreover, in a larger, multicenter, four-arm [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) in 2,259 subjects (aged 45-75 history of [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma), daily vitamin D3 supplementation of 1,000 IU did not reduce the number or the duration of URTI episodes during winter or the rest of the year, even among participants with the lowest serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at baseline [(278)](#reference278). In addition, the post-hoc analysis of data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 644 individuals (ages 60-84 years) found that monthly supplementation with 30,000 IU or 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 for a maximum period of one year did not significantly decrease the rate of antibiotic prescriptions for [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) airway infections. The stratified analysis, however, found that doses of 60,000 IU/month reduced the risk of using antibiotics in participants 70 years old by 47% [(279)](#reference279). In addition, compared to placebo, the supplementation of pregnant women with vitamin D3 (with 2,000 IU/day) for three months until birth followed by the supplementation of their infants (800 IU/day) from birth to six months of age significantly reduced the number of acute respiratory infections after the intervention period in children 6 to 18 months old [(280)](#reference280). Interestingly, despite significant [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among trials, the pooled analysis of these data with that of 21 additional trials suggested an overall 12% reduction in incidence of URTI with vitamin D3 given as bolus doses (every week, month, or every three months), daily doses, or a combination of bolus and daily doses [(281)](#reference281). Subgroup analyses revealed a 42% reduction in URTI risk with vitamin D3 supplementation in subjects with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <10 ng/mL, while there was no protective effect of vitamin D3 in those with concentrations 10 ng/mL. Moreover, large bolus doses (30,000 IU) were found to be ineffective compared to daily or weekly doses such that, in subgroup analyses that excluded bolus doses, daily and weekly vitamin D3 regimens appeared to be protective against URTI regardless of baseline vitamin D status. Finally, the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on URTI did not appear to vary with age, [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index), the presence of asthma or COPD, and flu vaccination status [(281)](#reference281). The findings of a large clinical trial in New Zealand, the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study, confirmed the ineffectiveness of large bolus doses of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute respiratory infections [(282)](#reference282). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 5,110 older adults (ages 50-84 at baseline), supplementation with an initial dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 followed by 100,000 IU/month of vitamin D3 for a median of 3.3 years had no effect on the incidence of (self-reported) acute respiratory infections (HR, 1.01; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval), 0.94-1.07). Upon data stratification by vitamin D status, a similar null result (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.95-1.23) was seen in study participants with blood vitamin D concentrations 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L; [282](#reference282)). The recently completed VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial) may provide additional evidence of an effect of daily dosing (2,000 IU/day of vitamin D) on risk of airway infections in older adults, although the prevention of infectious disease is a secondary outcome in the trial [(204](#reference204), [283, 284)](#reference283). In a trial in preschool-age children, vitamin D supplementation with 2,000 IU/day for at least four months did not decrease the incidence [(285)](#reference285) or severity [(286)](#reference286) of URTI in winter compared to supplementation with 400 IU/day for at least four months. Supplementation with 2,000 IU/day led to significantly higher mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations compared to the lower dose (48.7 ng/mL vs. 36.8 ng/mL), but the 400 IU dose may have been sufficient to prevent URTI in these young children [(285)](#reference285). In a placebo-controlled trial in 1,300 healthy children and adolescents in rural Vietnam (baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 26 ng/mL for both the control and intervention group), supplementation with 14,000 IU/week of vitamin D for eight months significantly reduced the incidence of non-influenza viral respiratory infections by 24%, but not the incidence of influenza A or B infection [(287)](#reference287). The coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world causing a global pandemic. Flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, fatigue, and difficulty breathing, as well as several other diverse symptoms characterize COVID-19 (see the websites of the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)). The effects of the disease vary widely, with the most severe resulting in pneumonia, respiratory distress, and death. Some individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, however, are asymptomatic but can transmit virus to others [(288)](#reference288). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals can spread disease before they experience symptoms (i.e., presymptomatic transmission) [(289)](#reference289), placing importance on public health measures like hand washing, face mask wearing, social distancing, and testing and contact tracing to curtail the pandemic. A number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined the correlation of vitamin D status and COVID-19 incidence, with most \u2014 but not all [(290-292)](#reference290) \u2014 finding vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) cohort study of more than 191,000 US residents administered a SARS-CoV-2 test during a three-month period in spring 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was strongly associated with a lower [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, measured at a single point in the 12 months prior to the viral test [(293)](#reference293). In this study, each 1 ng/mL increment of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was linked to a 1.6% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with the risk being the lowest at serum concentrations of 55 ng/mL and above [(293)](#reference293). In a retrospective, population-based study among 7,807 people in Israel, including 782 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, [plasma](../glossary#plasma) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 30 ng/mL were associated with a 50% higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to higher vitamin D concentrations [(294)](#reference294). The vitamin D status assessment in this study was done prior to the viral testing, but details on the time frame are lacking. The temporal relationship of the vitamin D status measure and COVID diagnostic test is also a concern in an analysis of a large dataset from the UK Biobank, which found vitamin D status was not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: the study utilized vitamin D status assessments done 10 to 14 years prior to the COVID-19 diagnostic test [(291)](#reference291). Consistent with findings of most available studies, a small retrospective cohort study [(295)](#reference295) and five [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) [(296-300)](#reference296) reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) vitamin D status and SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 2021 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 observational studies, including 361,934 participants, reported an association between vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and increased risk of COVID-19 ( [OR](../glossary#odds-ratio), 1.43; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval): 1.00-2.05), although [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) across studies was high [(301)](#reference301). Further, in an analysis of data from the UK Biobank, regular use of vitamin D supplements was found to be associated with a 34% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared nonusers of vitamin D supplements [(292)](#reference292). Additionally, most of the available observational research suggests an association between low vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity, with studies finding vitamin D deficiency linked to an increased risk of disease severity, as measured by need for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission [(302)](#reference302), stage of pneumonia (in men but not in women; [303](#reference303)), need for non-invasive ventilation [(304)](#reference304), need for invasive mechanical ventilation [(305)](#reference305), or a combination of these and other indicators [(297)](#reference297). Another study found that insufficient vitamin D status, defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 30 ng/mL, was associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-related hospitalization, but the association failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.061) except in a subanalysis of individuals over 50 years of age (OR, 2.71; 95% CI: 1.55-4.78; p<0.001) [(294)](#reference294). In contrast to most of the evidence to date, one case-control study found vitamin D deficiency was not linked to COVID-19 severity [(298)](#reference298). Further, a few studies have looked at the relationship of vitamin D status and COVID-19 mortality, with three finding vitamin D deficiency to be associated with an increased risk of death [(303](#reference303), [305, 306)](#reference305) and two finding no association [(304](#reference304), [307)](#reference307), although one of the studies finding no association used vitamin D status measurements more than 10 years prior to the COVID-19 diagnostic testing [(307)](#reference307). Since there are several known risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19, including advanced age, obesity, and preexisting type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease [(308)](#reference308), it is important for observational studies to control for potential [confounders](../glossary#confounder). Two quasi-experimental studies reported that bolus supplementation with vitamin D3 (either 50,000 IU per month or 80,000-100,000 IU every two to three months) prior to or during SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a less severe illness and improved survival in frail elderly COVID-19 patients [(309, 310)](#reference309). A number of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 prevention and treatment are currently underway; the results of these trials will inform on the causality of the association. Nevertheless, the currently available data indicate that improving vitamin D status through supplementation represents a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19. Atopic dermatitis or eczema is particularly [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) in industrialized countries, affecting 10%-20% of children and 1%-3% of adults. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) skin disorder characterized by dry and pruritus (itchy) areas of the skin in affected subjects. Local skin inflammation and immune dysfunction can damage the [epidermal](../glossary#epidermis) barrier and increase the susceptibility to skin infections and atopic reactions in affected individuals. The disease is often associated with other atopic diseases, including food allergies, [asthma](../glossary#asthma), and allergic rhinitis [(311)](#reference311). While the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of the disease is not fully elucidated, it has been suggested that vitamin D deficiency might contribute to the onset and/or the severity of the disease [(312)](#reference312). Recently, using large-scale datasets from Caucasian people of European descent, including the UK Biobank resource [(313)](#reference313) and the SUNLIGHT [(35)](#reference35), the GABRIEL asthma and EAGLE eczema [(315)](#reference315) consortia, a [Mendelian randomization study](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) found no association between genetically low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and [risks](../glossary#risk) of number of [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined whether vitamin D might be an effective [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) tool in disease management, possibly through regulating local inflammatory reactions and stimulating [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) activities in the skin. Moreover, the beneficial effect of phototherapy observed in specific cases of atopic dermatitis may be partly mediated by the action of vitamin D [(311)](#reference311). In a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 45 patients with atopic dermatitis and low vitamin D status (70% of subjects had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <20 ng/mL), daily administration of 1,600 IU of oral vitamin D3, alone or together with 600 IU/day of [vitamin E](vitamin-E), for a period of 60 days significantly reduced the extent and intensity of eczema, as assessed by the SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) score [(317)](#reference317). Vitamin D3 (1,600 IU/day for 60 days) also improved vitamin D status and reduced disease severity in 53 patients with atopic dermatitis in another small randomized trial [(318)](#reference318). More recently, vitamin D3 (1,000 IU/day for one month) improved the severity of winter-related atopic dermatitis in Mongolian children, as shown by changes in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores [(319)](#reference319). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four small trials (including those cited above) confirmed that supplemental vitamin D can lead to measurable clinical improvements in affected individuals [(320)](#reference320). Larger trials are needed to strengthen these preliminary findings and determine the most appropriate and effective supplementation regimen. Of note, [topical](../glossary#topical) treatment of [psoriasis](../glossary#psoriasis) with vitamin D [analogs](../glossary#analog) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may be effective in the management of other skin disorders [(321)](#reference321). Several ill-defined environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute to the development of the inappropriate immune response to the [intestinal microbiota](../glossary#intenstinal-microbiota) that causes [ulcerative colitis](../glossary#ulcerative-colitis) (UC) and [Crohn's disease](../glossary#crohn-disease) (CD). While specific VDR [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) may be linked to an increased susceptibility to developing UC and CD [(322)](#reference322), higher vitamin D intakes and predicted circulating levels were found to be associated with a reduced incidence of UC and CD in a large cohort of 72,719 women [(323)](#reference323). A meta-analysis of six [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin D status and severity of CD [(324)](#reference324). Three studies have investigated whether vitamin D3 could benefit patients with CD, possibly through reducing intestinal [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation). In one multicenter, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, the relapse rate in CD patients in remission after one year of treatment was significantly lower in those supplemented daily with 1,200 IU of vitamin D3 and 1,200 mg of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) compared to those who received calcium alone (13% vs. 29%) [(325)](#reference325). In a second [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study), incremental daily doses of vitamin D3, from 1,000 IU up to 5,000 IU, were administrated over a 24-week period to 18 CD patients in order to achieve circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations >40 ng/mL. Although half of the patients failed to achieve 40 ng/mL, the mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was raised to 45 ng/mL (from a baseline mean of 16 ng/mL), and the overall improvement in vitamin D status was associated with a significant decrease in disease severity as assessed by Crohn's Disease Activity (CDAI) scores [(326)](#reference326). In a three-month, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 27 CD patients in remission, daily supplementation with vitamin D3 (2,000 IU) improved vitamin D status but had no significant effect on intestinal permeability ('leaky gut') or measures of inflammation and disease activity [(327)](#reference327). Yet, the study suggested that achieving serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations 30 ng/mL might help reduce intestinal inflammation and improve patients' quality of life. Additional studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D in [inflammatory bowel diseases](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease). The [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) analysis of 41,504 electronic medical records in the Intermountain Heart Collaborative study found that only one-third of patients had adequate [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (>30 ng/mL); vitamin D insufficiency (serum D concentrations 30 ng/mL) was associated with increased [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) and incidence of many [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) conditions, [(328)](#reference328). D status also been linked to arterial stiffness and [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction \u2014 strong determinants of incident hypertension and adverse cardiovascular outcomes [(329)](#reference329). Several [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have evaluated the effect of vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on blood pressure. An early controlled [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) in 18 men and women with untreated mild [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) living in the Netherlands found that exposure to UVB radiation three times weekly for six weeks during the winter increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations by 162%, lowered PTH concentrations by 15%, and decreased 24-hour ambulatory [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) measurements by an average of 6 mm Hg [(330)](#reference330). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 16 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) involving 1,879 participants, either healthy or with pre-existing cardiometabolic conditions (including hypertension), found no significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures with vitamin D supplementation (800-8,571 IU/day for five weeks to one year). However, a subgroup analysis of six trials found a significant reduction of 1.31 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure in individuals with preexisting conditions. While improvements in blood pressure may be expected in cases of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, the authors noted that suboptimal vitamin D status in participants was not exclusively observed in those with cardiometabolic conditions [(331)](#reference331). In contrast, in two recent intervention studies \u2014 the Styrian vitamin D hypertension trial [(332)](#reference332) and the Vitamin D therapy in individuals at high risk of hypertension trial [DAYLIGHT] [(333)](#reference333) \u2014 subjects with (pre)hypertension supplemented with vitamin D3 (400 to 4,000 IU/day for two to six months) showed no evidence of blood pressure lowering, regardless of their baseline vitamin D status (insufficient or adequate, according to the IOM's current cutoffs). Conditions that decrease vitamin D [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) in the skin, such as having dark-colored skin, living in temperate latitudes, and aging, are associated with increased [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of hypertension [(334)](#reference334), suggesting that vitamin D may reduce blood pressure levels in selected groups of individuals. In the above-mentioned meta-analysis, one four-arm, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 283 African Americans randomized to receive daily vitamin D3 supplements of 1,000 IU, 2,000 IU, or 4,000 IU for a period of three months. Systolic blood pressure was decreased by 0.66 mm Hg with 1,000 IU/day, 3.4 mm Hg with 2,000 IU/day, and by 4 mm Hg with 4,000 IU/day while it increased by 1.7 mm Hg in the placebo group when compared to baseline. A significant reduction of 0.2 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) in systolic blood pressure was detected per 1 ng/mL incremental increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. However, there was no statistical difference on three-month change in blood pressure between vitamin D3 and placebo [(335)](#reference335). Another randomized, placebo-controlled study in 150 elderly participants (mean age, 77 years) showed that supplementation with 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 every three months for one year did not significantly lower blood pressure compared to placebo [(336)](#reference336). Further research is needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is helpful in the prevention or management of hypertension. [Congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) (also called cardiac insufficiency) is characterized by increased heart rate and subsequent [hypertrophy](../glossary#hypertrophy) of the left heart [ventricle](../glossary#ventricles). Cardiac insufficiency is associated with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), assessed by [echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography). Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (see [Blood pressure regulation](#blood-pressure-regulation)) are currently used as first-line therapy for patients with heart failure. In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in healthy patients who underwent [coronary](../glossary#coronary-artery) angiography, [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <30 ng/mL were associated with poorer coronary flow rates [(337)](#reference337). Suboptimal vitamin D status has also been linked to poorer [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) in patients with heart failure [(338)](#reference338). Over the past several years, a number of [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation in those with cardiac insufficiency. In a 12-week [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, daily supplementation with 1,200 IU of vitamin D3 in children with chronic congestive heart failure led to a significant increase in vitamin D status accompanied by an improved heart muscle performance (increased LVEF), as well as by lower levels of PTH and pro- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) [(339)](#reference339). In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 64 elderly patients with heart failure, participants receiving 800 mg/day of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) and 50,000 IU/week of vitamin D3 did not perform significantly better at physical performance tasks (used as proxy to assess aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle strength) compared to those supplemented with calcium only [(340)](#reference340). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven small randomized placebo-controlled trials in 573 subjects with heart failure showed that vitamin D supplementation (from 1,000 IU/day to 50,000 IU/week) for six weeks to nine months could reduce serum concentrations of PTH, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP). Yet, there were no differences in LVEF, circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration, and renin concentration between patients treated with vitamin D and those given a placebo [(341)](#reference341). Finally, in the EVITA (Effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality) trial in patients with end-stage heart failure and inadequate vitamin D status (baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values, 8.6-19.7 ng/mL), supplementation with 4,000 IU/day for three years did not reduce the risk of mortality compared to placebo [(342)](#reference342). Solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB; wavelengths of 290 to 315 nanometers) stimulates the production of vitamin D3 in the [epidermis](../glossary#epidermis) of the skin [(343)](#reference343). Sunlight exposure can provide most people with their entire vitamin D requirement. Children and young adults who spend a short time outside two or three times a week will generally [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) all the vitamin D they need to prevent deficiency. One study reported that [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin D concentrations following exposure to one [minimal erythemal dose](../glossary#minimal-erythemal-dose) of simulated sunlight (the amount required to cause a slight pinkness of the skin) to the whole body was equivalent to ingesting approximately 10,000 to 25,000 IU of vitamin D [(344)](#reference344). People with dark-colored skin synthesize markedly less vitamin D on exposure to sunlight than those with lighter complexion [(34)](#reference34). Additionally, older adults have diminished capacity to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight exposure and frequently use sunscreen or protective clothing in order to prevent skin [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and sun damage. The application of sunscreen with an SPF factor of 10 reduces production of vitamin D by 90% [(30)](#reference30). In latitudes around 40 degrees north or 40 degrees south (Boston is 42 degrees north), there is insufficient UVB radiation available for vitamin D synthesis from November to early March. Ten degrees farther north or south (Edmonton, Canada), the \"vitamin D winter\" extends from mid-October to mid-March. It has been estimated that up to 15 minutes of daily sun exposure on the hands, arms, and face around 12 pm throughout the year at 25 degrees latitude (Miami, FL) and during the spring, summer, and fall at 42 degrees (Boston, MA) latitude may provide a light-skinned individual with 1,000 IU of vitamin D [(345)](#reference345). Vitamin D is found naturally in only a few foods, such as some fatty fish (mackerel, salmon, sardines), fish liver oils, eggs from hens that have been fed vitamin D, and mushrooms exposed to sunlight or UV light. In the US, milk and infant formula are [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with vitamin D so that they contain 400 IU (10 g) per quart. However, other dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, are not always fortified with vitamin D. Some cereal, bread, and fruit juices may also be fortified with vitamin D. Accurate estimates of average dietary intakes of vitamin D are difficult because of the high variability of the vitamin D content of fortified foods [(346)](#reference346). The vitamin D content (sum of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3) of some vitamin D-rich foods is listed in Table 2 in both international units (IU) and micrograms (g). For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) is also present at low levels is certain foods, including meats, dairy products, and eggs [(347, 348)](#reference347). with vitamin large||37||0.9| vitamin D [supplements](../glossary#supplement) available without a prescription contain cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Multivitamin supplements generally provide 400 IU-1,000 IU (10 g-25 g) of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3. Single-ingredient vitamin D supplements may provide 400 to 50,000 IU of vitamin D3, but 400 IU is the most commonly available dose [(66)](#reference66). A number of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) supplements may also provide vitamin D. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) suggested that bolus doses of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) may not always be as effective as vitamin D3 in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, yet no difference in efficacy was found with daily supplementation with vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 [(349)](#reference349). Nonetheless, a 25-week, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled supplementation with 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 initiated at the end of summer to be more efficacious than vitamin D2 in maintaining summertime concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D during fall and winter months [(350)](#reference350). There is growing interest in using the [hydroxylated](../glossary#hydroxylation) form of cholecalciferol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcidiol; calcifediol), as a supplement. This vitamin D [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) is synthesized by the liver of humans and animals from cholecalciferol produced in skin or consumed in the diet, and is present in some foods (e.g., meats, milk, eggs) at low levels [(347, 348)](#reference347). In general, clinical studies have found calcifediol is two to five times more potent at increasing blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared to supplementation with equivalent doses of cholecalciferol [(351-359)](#reference351). Supplementation with calcifediol may thus represent a means to improve vitamin D status rapidly and consistently with lower doses than cholecalciferol and may benefit those individuals with conditions that decrease intestinal absorption of cholecalciferol [(359)](#reference359). However, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 form is presently not available as an over-the-counter supplement in the United States. Vitamin D toxicity (hypervitaminosis D) has not been observed to result from sun exposure. The reason is that excessive sunlight exposure generates a number of biologically inert photoproducts from 7-dehydrocholesterol and induces abnormally high [serum](../glossary#risk) [calcium](../minerals/calcium) concentration (hypercalcemia), which could result in bone loss, [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones), and calcification of organs like the heart and kidneys if untreated over a long period of time. Hypercalcemia has been observed following daily doses of greater than 50,000 IU of vitamin D [(360)](#reference360). Overall, research suggests that vitamin D toxicity is very unlikely in healthy people at intake levels lower than 10,000 IU/day [(361-363)](#reference361). However, the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM conservatively set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) at 4,000 IU/day (100 g/day) for all adults (Table 3). Certain medical conditions can increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypercalcemia in response to vitamin D, including primary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism), sarcoidosis, [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis), and lymphoma [(361)](#reference361). People with these conditions may develop hypercalcemia in response to any increase in vitamin D nutrition and should consult a qualified health care provider regarding any increase in vitamin D older||100||4,000| The following medications should not be taken at the same time as vitamin D because they can decrease the intestinal absorption of vitamin D: cholestyramine (Questran), colestipol (Colestid), orlistat (Xenical), and The following medications increase the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of vitamin D and may suppresses stomach acid secretion, inhibits the [hydroxylation](../glossary#hydroxylation) of vitamin D in the liver [(366)](#reference366). Treating acid reflux, [gastroesophageal reflux disease](../glossary#gastrointestinal-reflux-disease) (GERD), or ulcers with proton-pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole) might interfere with calcium absorption and increase the risk of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) such that patients are advised to take calcium and vitamin D supplements [(367)](#reference367). The oral antifungal medication, ketoconazole, inhibits the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) and has been found to reduce serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in healthy men [(368)](#reference368). The Endocrine Society also recommends monitoring vitamin D status of patients on glucocorticoids and [HIV](../glossary#HIV) treatment drugs because these medications increase the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [(40)](#reference40). The use of some cytostatic agents (cell growth inhibitors) may also increase the degradation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients under [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) [(6)](#reference6). The induction of hypercalcemia by toxic levels of vitamin D may precipitate cardiac arrhythmia in patients on digoxin (Lanoxin) [(366)](#reference366). Hypercalcemia (Cardizem) in [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) [(366)](#reference366). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that generally healthy adults take 2,000 IU (50 g) of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin D daily. Most multivitamins contain 400 IU (10 g) of vitamin D, and single-ingredient vitamin D supplements are available for additional supplementation. Sun exposure, diet, skin color, and [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) have variable, substantial impact on body vitamin D levels. To adjust for individual differences and ensure adequate body vitamin D status, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends aiming for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggest that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations between 30 ng/mL and 60 ng/mL are associated with lower [risks](../glossary#risk) of adverse health outcomes, including [cancers](../glossary#cancer) and [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease). The American Academy of Pediatrics currently suggests that all infants, children, and adolescents receive 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily [(19)](#reference19). Consistent with the recommendations of the Endocrine Society [(40)](#reference40), the Linus Pauling Institute recommends daily intakes of 400 to 1,000 IU (10 to 25 g) of vitamin D in infants and 600 to 1,000 IU (15 to 25 g) of vitamin D in children and adolescents. Given the average vitamin D content of breast milk, infant formula, and the diets of children and adolescents, supplementation may be necessary to meet these recommendations. Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU (50 g) of vitamin D is especially important for older adults because aging is associated with a reduced capacity to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin D in the skin upon sun exposure.

Traber, Ph.D. [The term vitamin E describes a family of eight fat-soluble molecules with ] [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activities: four tocopherol isoforms (-, -, -, and -tocopherol) and four tocotrienol isoforms (-, -, -, and -tocotrienol) (Figure 1). Only one form, -tocopherol, meets human vitamin E requirements (see [The RDA](#RDA)). In the human liver, -tocopherol is the form of vitamin E that is preferentially bound to -tocopherol transfer protein (-TTP) and incorporated into [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) that transport -tocopherol in the blood for delivery to extrahepatic tissues. Therefore, it is the predominant form of vitamin E found in the blood and tissues [(1)](#references). In addition, -tocopherol appears to be the form of vitamin E with the greatest nutritional significance, such that it will be the primary topic of the following discussion. Natural -tocopherol made by plants found in food has an RRR-configuration at the 2, 4', and 8'-position of the -tocopherol molecule (wrongly referred to as d--tocopherol) (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). Chemically synthesized all-rac--tocopherol (all-racemic--tocopherol; incorrectly labeled dl--tocopherol) is a mixture of eight stereoisomers of -tocopherol, which arose from the three chiral equal [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activity, only the forms in the R-conformation at position 2 (noted 2R) meet the vitamin E requirements in humans [(2)](#reference2). The main function of -tocopherol in humans is that of a fat-soluble [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant). Fats, which are an integral part of all [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), are vulnerable to damage through [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) by [free radicals](../glossary#free-radical). -Tocopherol is uniquely suited to intercept peroxyl radicals and thus prevent a chain reaction of [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) (Figure 2). When a molecule of -tocopherol neutralizes a free radical, it is oxidized and its antioxidant capacity is lost. Other antioxidants, such as [vitamin C](vitamin-C), are capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of -tocopherol (Figure 2) (reviewed in [1](#references)). Aside from maintaining the integrity of cell membranes throughout the body, -tocopherol protects the fats in low-density lipoproteins ( [LDLs](../glossary#LDL)) from oxidation. Lipoproteins are particles composed of lipids and [proteins](../glossary#protein) that transport fats through the bloodstream. LDLs specifically transport [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) from the liver to the tissues of the body. Oxidized LDLs have been implicated in the development of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(3)](#reference3). Other functions of -tocopherol are likely to be related to its [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity [(1)](#references). For instance, -tocopherol can protect the physiological properties of [lipid](../glossary#lipid) bilayer membranes and may influence the activity of membrane [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) [(4)](#reference4). In cell culture studies, -tocopherol was found to improve the formation of an adhesive junction (known as immune synapse) between na\u00efve T [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) and [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells (APC), which eventually prompted cell activation and [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) (see [Disease Prevention](#aging-immune-function)) [(5, 6)](#reference5). Vitamin E forms other than -tocopherol are also known to be potent [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant). Tocotrienols and -tocopherol are thought to be better scavengers of peroxyl radicals and [reactive nitrogen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), respectively, than -tocopherol [(7)](#reference7). Yet, in the body, (1) -tocopherol is preferentially retained in the liver by the binding to -tocopherol transfer protein (-TTP), which incorporates -tocopherol into [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) for delivery to extrahepatic tissues; and (2) forms of vitamin E other than -tocopherol are actively [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) and [excreted](../glossary#excretion). Hence, while -tocopherol is the most common form of vitamin E in the American diet [(8)](#reference8), its [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and tissue concentrations are generally significantly lower than those of -tocopherol, and more -tocopherol is excreted in urine than -tocopherol, suggesting less -tocopherol is needed for use by the body [(1)](#references). Studies conducted [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) and in animals have indicated that -tocopherol and its major metabolite, -carboxyethyl hydroxychroman (-CEHC), may play a role in protecting the body from [free radical](../glossary#free-radical)-induced damage in various conditions of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and (reviewed in [7](#reference7)). Limited [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) (highlighted in [7](#reference7)) have not convincingly demonstrated a potential anti-inflammatory effect of -tocopherol in humans. Yet, in two recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies, the supplementation of smokers with -tocopherol potentiated short-term benefits of smoking cessation (with or without nicotine replacement therapy) on [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function [(9, 10)](#reference9). Numerous preclinical studies have also suggested that tocotrienols might be beneficial in the prevention of [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) [(11)](#reference11). For instance, tocotrienols (especially -tocotrienol) have [proliferative](../glossary#proliferation) and pro- [apoptotic](../glossary#apoptosis) effects than tocopherols in [malignant](../glossary#malignant) cell lines [(12)](#reference12). However, a number of factors, including dose, formulation, and type of study population, affect the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of tocotrienols and may undermine their putative efficacy in humans [(13)](#reference13). There are currently no data available on the effectiveness of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) tocotrienols in humans [(11)](#reference11). The mechanism of vitamin E digestion and uptake into intestinal cells ( [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte)) is unclear but requires [bile acids](../glossary#bile-acids) and [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), and the packaging along with dietary fat into [chylomicrons](../glossary#chylomicron). The efficiency of vitamin E absorption increases with the amount of fat in ingested food, such that vitamin E absorption from supplements is likely to be minimal with low-fat meals [(14, 15)](#reference14). In the circulation, all [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) (i.e., VLDLs, [LDLs](../glossary#LDL), and [HDLs](../glossary#HDL)) are involved in the transport and tissue distribution of -tocopherol [(1)](#references). Increased concentrations of [lipids](../glossary#lipid) ( [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides)) the blood have been correlated to higher [serum](../glossary#serum) -tocopherol concentrations. However, if a high blood concentration of lipids is associated with a slower turnover of lipoproteins, then the distribution of -tocopherol to tissues may be substantially altered [(16)](#reference16). A few human studies using conditions of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) have demonstrated the importance of [vitamin C](vitamin-C) (ascorbic acid) in the recycling of [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) -tocopherol back to its reduced state (see [Figure 2](#figure-2)). Oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking accelerates the depletion of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) -tocopherol in smokers compared to nonsmokers [(17)](#reference17). In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 11 smokers and 13 nonsmokers given -tocopherol and -tocopherol that was labeled with deuterium (hence traceable), supplementation with vitamin C reduced the rate of vitamin E loss in plasma, most probably by regenerating tocopheryl radicals back to nonoxidized forms [(18)](#reference18). One study in adults with normal coagulation (clotting) status found that daily supplementation with 1,000 IU (670 mg) of RRR--tocopherol for 12 weeks decreased -carboxylation of prothrombin, a [vitamin K](vitamin-K)-dependent factor in the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade [(19)](#reference19). Individuals taking [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs like warfarin and those who are vitamin K deficient should not take vitamin E [supplements](../glossary#supplement) without medical supervision because of the increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of bleeding (see [Safety](#safety)) [(20)](#reference20). Severe vitamin E deficiency rarely occurs in humans but has been observed as a result of malnutrition [(21)](#reference21). Severe vitamin E deficiency has been associated with specific genetic defects affecting the transport of -tocopherol by -tocopherol transfer protein (-TTP) and [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein). Vitamin E deficiency has also been observed in individuals with fat [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), which impair the absorption of dietary fats and therefore fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin E (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)) [(21)](#reference21). Severe vitamin E deficiency results mainly in [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms, including impaired balance and coordination (spinocerebellar [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia)), injury to the sensory nerves ( [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy)), muscle weakness ( [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy)), and damage to the [retina](../glossary#retina) of the eye (retinopathy). For this reason, people who develop peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, or retinitis pigmentosa (RP) of unknown causes should be screened for vitamin E deficiency [(21)](#reference21). The results of one [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 601 patients with common forms of RP indicated that daily [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 400 IU of all-rac--tocopherol (180 mg of RRR--tocopherol) modestly but significantly increased the loss of retinal function [(22)](#reference22). In contrast, daily supplementation with 15,000 IU of vitamin A (4,500 g RAE) significantly slowed the loss of retinal function over a period of four to six years, suggesting that patients with common forms of RP may benefit from long-term vitamin A supplementation but should avoid high-dose supplemental vitamin E. Inherited defects in -TTP are associated with a characteristic syndrome called AVED (Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency). A recent case study reported that visual impairment in a middle-age patient with AVED was caused by both RP and early-onset macular degeneration [(23)](#reference23). Supplementation with high-dose vitamin E used to prevent neurologic deterioration in AVED subjects [(21)](#reference21). Moreover, the developing nervous system appears to be especially vulnerable to vitamin E deficiency. For instance, children with severe vitamin E deficiency at birth rapidly experience irreversible neurologic symptoms if not treated with vitamin E. In contrast, individuals who develop [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disorders affecting vitamin E absorption in adulthood may not develop neurologic symptoms for 10-20 years [(21)](#reference21). It should also be noted that neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin E deficiency have not been reported in healthy individuals who consume diets low in vitamin E. Although frank vitamin E deficiency is rare, marginal intake of vitamin E is relatively common. Between 1988 and 1994, the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) examined the dietary intake and blood concentrations of -tocopherol in 16,295 adults. The study reported that about one-third of all participants had blood concentrations of -tocopherol below 20 micromoles/liter (mol/L) \u2014 a cutoff value chosen because of its initial association with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(24)](#reference24). More recent data from 18,063 participants in NHANES 2003-2006 indicated an average dietary intake of -tocopherol from food (including enriched and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) sources) among Americans adults of 7.2 mg/day [(25)](#reference25). This intake is well below the current recommended dietary allowance of 15 mg/day (see [the RDA](#RDA)). At this level of dietary intake, more than 93% of American adults do not meet the estimated average requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) of 12 mg/day for vitamin E [(25)](#reference25). In addition, a recent [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) in Bangladeshi women suggested that inadequate vitamin E status during early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage [(26)](#reference26). Cigarette smoking is thought to increase the utilization of -tocopherol such that smokers might be at increased risk of deficiency compared with nonsmokers [(17)](#reference17). Also, the 19-year follow-up analysis of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene cancer (ATBC) trial in older, male smokers indicated that participants in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of [serum](../glossary#serum) -tocopherol concentrations (>31 mol/L vs. <23 mol/L) at baseline had reduced risks of total and cause-specific mortality [(27)](#reference27). It is not known whether marginal vitamin E deficiency increases the risk of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) [(1)](#references). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin E was last revised by the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine in 2000 (Table 1) [(2)](#reference2). The RDA is based largely on the results of studies done in the 1950s in men fed vitamin E-deficient diets. In a test-tube analysis, vitamin E suppresses the breakdown of red blood cells (known as [hemolysis](../glossary#hemolysis)) induced by hydrogen peroxide. Because hemolysis has also been reported in children with severe vitamin E deficiency, the preventive effect of vitamin E against oxidative damage-induced hemolysis was considered to be a clinically relevant [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) analysis to assess vitamin E status. Importantly, this means that the latest RDA for vitamin E continues to be based on the prevention of deficiency symptoms rather than on health promotion and prevention of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). The forms of -tocopherol that meet the recommended intakes are RRR--tocopherol \u2014 the only naturally occurring form of vitamin E \u2014 and the three synthetic isomers, RRS-, RSR-, and RSS--tocopherol, which are found in nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food. Table 1 lists the RDA for -tocopherol expressed in both milligrams (mg) and international units (IU). Stage||Age||Males||Females| |mg/day||IU/day||mg/day||IU/day| | ( | to 2R-stereoisomeric forms of -tocopherol. #One mg of 2R--tocopherol is equivalent to 1.5 IU, and one IU is equivalent to 0.67 mg of 2R--tocopherol. The natural age-related decline of the immune function is accompanied by an increased susceptibility to infections, a poorer response to immunization, and higher [risks](../glossary#risk) of developing [cancers](../glossary#cancer) and [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease). -Tocopherol has been shown to enhance specifically the T cell-mediated immune response that declines with advancing age (reviewed in [28](#reference28)). T cell impaired response has been partly associated with a reduced capacity of na\u00efve T cells to be activated during [antigen](../glossary#antigen) presentation, and to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and [proliferate](../glossary#proliferation) as a result [(6)](#reference6). However, very few studies have addressed the potential association between -tocopherol and immune function in humans [(28)](#reference28). In a small [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) in older adults (mean age, 70 years), supplementation with 200 mg/day of all-rac--tocopherol (equivalent to 100 mg of RRR--tocopherol) for three months improved [natural killer](../glossary#natural-killer-cells) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production compared to baseline [(29)](#reference29). In an earlier trial, daily supplementation of healthy older adults (65 years of age) with 200 mg of all-rac--tocopherol for 235 days also improved T lymphocyte-mediated immunity \u2014 as measured with the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test \u2014 and increased the production of [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) in response to [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis) B and tetanus vaccines [(30)](#reference30). Lower -tocopherol doses failed to improve the DTH response compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in another study in healthy participants (ages, 65-80 years) [(31)](#reference31). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trial in 617 nursing home residents (65 years of age) reported that daily supplementation with 200 IU of synthetic -tocopherol (90 mg of RRR--tocopherol) for one year significantly lowered the risk of contracting upper respiratory tract infections, especially the common cold, but had no effect on lower respiratory tract (lung) infections [(32)](#reference32). More research is needed to examine whether supplemental vitamin E might enhance immune function and reduce risk of infection in older adults. Observational studies: Results of several large [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in both men and women have suggested an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin E consumption and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) or death from heart disease. Each study had a [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) design that measured vitamin E intake in generally healthy people who were followed over a period of time to determine the onset of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events and analyze the association between the exposure and the outcome(s). In two of the studies, individuals who consumed more than 7 mg/day of dietary -tocopherol were 35% less likely to die from heart disease than those who consumed less than 3-5 mg/day of -tocopherol [(33, 34)](#reference33). Two other large studies observed a significantly reduced risk of heart disease only in women and men who consumed at least 100 IU (67 mg)/day of 39,876 women (aged 45 years) participating in the Women's Health Study (WHS) found that supplementation with 600 IU (400 mg) of RRR--tocopherol every other day for 10 years resulted in a 34% reduction in nonfatal [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) and a 49% reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths but only in women aged at least 65 years at baseline (representing 10% of study participants) [(37)](#reference37). Further analyses of WHS data showed that women in the vitamin E arm of the study experienced a 21% reduction in [risk](../glossary#risk) of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to placebo: the reduction was of 12% in women younger than 55 years old, 26% in women aged 65 years and older, and 44% in women with a history of VTE [(38, 39)](#reference38). Another large [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) \u2014 the Physicians' Health Study II (PHSII) \u2014 conducted in healthy middle-aged men found no significant effect of 400 IU of synthetic -tocopherol (180 mg of RRR--tocopherol), given every other day for eight years, on the risk of major cardiovascular events in the entire cohort and in subgroup analyses [(40)](#reference40). Besides, concerns were raised regarding a possible harmful effect of high-dose vitamin E supplementation on the risk of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) in this cohort [(40)](#reference40). Conventional risk factors for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) include cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia), and being overweight or [obese](../glossary#obesity). Other factors such as [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) are also thought to contribute to increasing CVD risk, especially in patients with chronic conditions like type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and chronic kidney disease. Although trials do not appear to support any [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) benefit in healthy middle-aged and older subjects, vitamin E supplementation might help improve cardiovascular health and/or lower the risk of CVD in specific, higher risk subjects. Observational studies: The presence of [atherosclerotic](../glossary#atherosclerosis) plaques in arterial walls is one of the hallmarks of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Plaque rupture that causes blood clot formation is the usual cause of myocardial and cerebrovascular infarctions. The [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) Asymptomatic an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between [carotid](../glossary#carotid-arteries) intima-media thickness (CIMT) \u2014 a marker of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) \u2014 and circulating concentrations of [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), including vitamin E [(41)](#reference41). However, other observational studies found no association between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin E concentrations and CIMT (reviewed in [42](#reference42)). [Intervention studies: A small ] [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) controlled study assessing the effect of lipid-lowering drugs in men who had previously undergone a coronary artery bypass surgery found that the use of at least 100 IU/day (compared to less than 100 IU/day) of supplemental -tocopherol (45 mg of RRR--tocopherol) was associated with reduced CIMT progression over a two-year period but only among participants in the [placebo](../glossary#placebo) arm of the study (i.e., those who did not receive lipid-lowering drugs) [(43)](#reference43). However, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven small placebo-controlled trials found little evidence that vitamin E supplementation may improve flow-mediated vascular dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, a marker of [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) health that is adversely affected by CVD risk factors [(44)](#reference44). In the Cambridge Heart AntiOxidant Study (CHAOS), a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 2,002 patients with [coronary heart daily supplementation with either 400 IU or 800 IU of synthetic -tocopherol (180 mg or 360 mg of RRR--tocopherol) for a median 18 months dramatically reduced the occurrence of nonfatal [myocardial infarctions](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) by 77%. However, vitamin E supplementation did not significantly reduce total or cardiovascular-related deaths [(45)](#reference45). Another small trial in patients with [renal](../glossary#renal) failure \u2014 the Secondary Prevention with Antioxidants of cardiovascular disease in End-stage renal disease (SPACE) \u2014 found that supplementation with 800 IU (536 mg)/day of RRR--tocopherol for an average of 1.4 years significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction compared to placebo [(46)](#reference46). A more recent randomized controlled study suggested that vitamin E supplementation may benefit a subgroup of patients with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The multicenter study by Milman et al. [(47)](#reference47) was conducted in 1,434 type 2 diabetics (55 years old) carrying a specific variant of the haptoglobin [protein](../glossary#protein) (Hp), Hp2-2, which has a lower efficacy to bind and remove [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant), free [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) from [plasma](../glossary#plasma), compared to Hp1-1 and Hp1-2 variants. The daily supplementation with 400 IU (268 mg) of RRR--tocopherol for 18 months resulted in a lower risk of myocardial infarction compared to placebo [(47)](#reference47). Other larger intervention trials conducted in cigarette smokers (the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene cancer prevention [ATBC] study [(48)](#reference48)), in individuals at-risk of CVD (the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation [HOPE]-The Ongoing Outcomes [HOPE-TOO study] [(49)](#reference49)), or in patients who have suffered a (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della trial [(50)](#reference50)) failed to find significant CVD risk reductions with -tocopherol supplementation. Besides, potentially harmful effects of supplemental vitamin E were reported on the risk of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) in the ATBC trial and on the risk of heart failure in the HOPE and GISSI trials (see [Safety](#safety)) [(48-50)](#reference48). [Oxidative radicals](../glossary#free-radical) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) that may contribute to causing [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(51)](#reference51). Because of its ability to neutralize free radicals, vitamin E has been suggested to possess anticancer activity by protecting cells against oxidative damage. Yet, several large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have failed to find significant associations between vitamin E intake and the incidence of lung or breast cancer [(2)](#reference2). More recently, the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) study prospectively assessed the association between long-term use of supplemental vitamins (10-year intake) and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of lung cancer in a cohort of 77,126 men and women [(52)](#reference52). No relationships were reported between intake of multivitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, or folate and the risk of lung cancer. However, the use of supplemental vitamin E in current but not in former smokers was associated with an 11% increased risk of lung cancer for every 100 mg/day increase, and intakes greater than 215 mg/day were specifically linked to a 29% increase in risk for non-small cell lung cancer [(52)](#reference52). To date, most [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have failed to find any beneficial effects of vitamin E supplementation on the risk of various cancers. A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial (RCT) in 39,876 women participating in the Women's Health Study found that supplementation with 600 IU (400 mg) of RRR--tocopherol every other day for 10 years had no effect on overall cancer incidence, tissue-specific cancer incidence, or cancer-related deaths [(37)](#reference37). Yet, the results of a few large [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have suggested that vitamin E supplementation might affect the risk of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer. The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene cancer (ATBC) prevention study was a four-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to investigate the effect of -tocopherol supplementation on lung cancer development in 29,133 male smokers. The study found a 32% reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer in participants given daily supplements of 50 mg of synthetic -tocopherol (equivalent to 25 mg of RRR--tocopherol) alone or in combination with -carotene compared to those given -carotene alone or a placebo [(53)](#reference53). However, no differences in the incidence of prostate cancer were found between -tocopherol recipients and nonrecipients during the 18-year post-intervention period [(54)](#reference54). In the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II), which followed 14,641 healthy men aged 50 years and older, supplementation with 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg of RRR--tocopherol) every other day for eight years had no effect on the risk of prostate cancer, other site-specific cancers, or total cancer [(55)](#reference55). The supplementation of vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol), alone or in combination with selenium, in the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled SELECT trial (SELenium and vitamin E Cancer prevention Trial) was halted because there was no evidence of benefit in preventing prostate cancer in 35,533 healthy men aged 50 years and older [(56)](#reference56). After a median of seven years' follow-up, the risk of prostate cancer was found to be significantly increased by 17% in participants supplemented with vitamin E alone during the trial period \u2014 but not when vitamin E was combined with selenium \u2014 compared to placebo [(57)](#reference57). A study of cases versus subcohort individuals drawn from the SELECT study assessed the effect of vitamin E and/or selenium supplementation on prostate cancer risk in relation to the selenium status of participants at baseline [(58)](#reference58). Supplemental selenium with or without vitamin E was associated with a significant increase in the risk of advanced prostate cancer in individuals with higher versus lower selenium status. In addition, the risks of total and advanced prostate cancer were significantly elevated with vitamin E supplementation in subjects with low versus high selenium status [(58)](#reference58). Recent investigations have suggested that sequence variations ( [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism)) in vitamin E-related [genes](../glossary#gene) and genes coding for [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), including selenoproteins, might modify the impact of high-dose vitamin E and selenium on the risk of prostate cancer [(59-61)](#reference59). Age-related [cataracts](../glossary#cataract) appear to be the result of [protein](../glossary#protein) in the [lens](../glossary#lens) of the eye; [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) like may protect the lens against [oxidative from [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species). In a recent [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study), vitamin E concentrations were found to be significantly lower in the lens and blood of subjects with age-related nuclear, but not cortical, cataracts when compared with an age-matched control group [(62)](#reference62). However, earlier studies reported higher vitamin E concentrations in the lenses and blood of patients with cataracts [(63, 64)](#reference63). The results of several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that examined the association between vitamin E consumption and the incidence or severity of cataracts are also mixed. Some reported that increased vitamin E intake protected against cataract development, while others found no association [(65)](#reference65). Yet, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight studies, including 15,021 participants, found a 17% reduction in the risk of age-related cataract in subjects in the highest versus lowest quantile of dietary vitamin E intake [(66)](#reference66). A recent [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 31,120 Swedish men followed for a mean of 8.4 years observed a greater risk of developing cataract in occasional and regular users of high-dose (about 100 mg/day) vitamin E supplements only, when compared with non-supplement users [(67)](#reference67). However, the use of supplemental high-dose vitamin E with additional supplements or the use of low-dose vitamin E-containing multivitamin supplements was not found to be associated with an elevated cataract risk. A meta-analysis based on data from over 350,000 participants in 10 studies \u2014 including the above-cited study by Zheng Selin et al. [(67)](#reference67) \u2014 found no association between supplemental vitamin E and risk of cataract [(66)](#reference66). In clinical settings, the supplementation of high-dose vitamin E \u2014 alone or in addition to other supplements \u2014 was found to be safe, yet the benefits regarding cataract risk or progression were limited. An early intervention trial found that a daily supplement of 50 mg of synthetic -tocopherol (equivalent to 25 mg of RRR--tocopherol) did not alter the incidence of cataract surgery in male smokers [(68)](#reference68). A randomized, placebo-controlled [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 4,629 men and women found that a daily antioxidant supplement containing 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of all-rac--tocopheryl acetate (equivalent to 180 mg of RRR--tocopherol), and 15 mg of -carotene did not affect development and progression of age-related cataracts over a seven-year period [(69)](#reference69). Similarly, a four-armed, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 11,267 men from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer prevention trial (SELECT) failed to observe a reduction in cataract incidence with 400 IU/day of supplemental all-rac--tocopheryl acetate (180 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol), alone or in combination with selenium (200 g/day), during a mean 5.6 years of follow-up [(70)](#reference70). Daily antioxidant supplementation with 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU (268 mg) of RRR--tocopherol, and 15 mg of -carotene did not limit the progression of cataract in a five-year intervention trial [(71)](#reference71). Another four-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial reported that supplements containing 500 IU/day (335 mg/day) of RRR--tocopherol did not reduce the incidence or progression of cataract in older adults [(72)](#reference72). Current available data from [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) do not support a preventative effect of vitamin E on cataracts. A recent pooled analysis of four [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 62,520 subjects found that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin E or -carotene did not reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a multifactorial disease affecting the central area of the [retina](../glossary#retina) [(73)](#reference73). However, a review of currently available data suggested that supplements of [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) plus [zinc](../minerals/zinc) may reduce the progression of AMD and vision loss in affected individuals [(74)](#reference74). The main evidence came from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). In this clinical trial, participants with borderline to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were randomized to receive (1) [placebo](../glossary#placebo); (2) antioxidant vitamins (15 mg/day -carotene, of acetate); (3) zinc (80 mg/day) and copper (2 mg/day); or (4) both antioxidant vitamins and zinc and copper [(75)](#reference75). The five-year results indicated that the risk of developing advanced AMD was significantly reduced in those taking zinc with or without antioxidant vitamins. Antioxidant vitamins alone failed to prevent the progression to advanced AMD, even in individuals at higher risk. It was concluded from this study that a combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals may benefit people with intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye [(74, 76)](#reference74). [Oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) contributes to the progression of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and causes damage to many organs and tissues, including the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), brain, eyes, peripheral nerves, and kidneys. Evidence from animal studies suggests that vitamin E supplementation could mitigate the role of [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) in the occurrence of diabetes complications (reviewed in [77](#reference77)). In the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene cancer prevention (ATBC) trial in male smokers, supplementation with 50 mg/day of synthetic -tocopherol (25 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) had no effect on the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus during the 19-year post-intervention follow-up. Likewise, supplemental vitamin E intake during the trial made no difference on the incidence of macrovascular complications or mortality in participants with established type 2 diabetes [(78)](#reference78). In addition, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including 714 type 2 diabetic individuals, found that supplementation with vitamin E (200-1,800 IU/day for 6-27 weeks) had no effect on markers of glycemic control, including [glycated hemoglobin A1c](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) (HbA1c) level and measures of fasting glucose and fasting insulin concentrations [(79)](#reference79). Further subgroup analyses indicated that higher doses of vitamin E (>400 IU/day) supplemented for longer periods (>12 weeks) significantly reduced HbA1c level and fasting insulin concentration, suggesting that vitamin E could possibly enhance insulin action and glucose disposal in type 2 diabetic individuals [(79)](#reference79). Another recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that endothelial function in normal-weight and overweight \u2014 but not obese \u2014 patients with type 2 diabetes was significantly improved by supplementation with vitamin E and/or vitamin C [(80)](#reference80). Although there is reason to suspect that vitamin E supplementation may have utility in the management of type 2 diabetes, evidence for benefit from large, well-controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) is still lacking. The increasing incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children and adults in industrialized countries is mainly attributed to the ongoing epidemic of [obesity](../glossary#obesity) and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). NAFLD results from the abnormal accumulation of fat (steatosis) in the liver in the absence of heavy alcohol consumption. Although the condition is considered to be largely benign, NAFLD can progress to a more severe disease called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with increased [risks](../glossary#risk) [Oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) is thought to be one of the possible mechanisms responsible for prompting [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) processes that can lead to the progression of NAFLD to NASH. There is currently no established treatment for NAFLD and NASH other than interventions that encourage lifestyle changes and the use of medicines to control or treat metabolic disorders [(82)](#reference82). In the multicenter PIVENS (PIoglitazone versus Vitamin E versus placebo for the treatment of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis) trial, 247 nondiabetic subjects with NASH were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive 30 mg/day of pioglitazone (an insulin-sensitizing IU/day (536 RRR--tocopherol, or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for 96 weeks [(83)](#reference83). Only vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the overall rate of improvement in [histological](../glossary#histology) abnormalities that characterize NASH on liver biopsies (i.e., hepatocellular ballooning, steatosis, and lobular [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation)) [(84)](#reference84). Both active treatments improved some markers of liver function (i.e., alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) [(84)](#reference84). Yet, results from another two-year, [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) \u2014 called TONIC for Treatment Of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease In Children \u2014 in 173 children (ages, 8-17 years) with NAFLD failed to observe any significant reduction in blood concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases either with supplemental vitamin E or with metformin (an anti-diabetic drug; mg/day) compared to placebo [(85)](#reference85). However, vitamin E supplementation significantly improved the overall disease activity score \u2014 used to quantify the severity of the disease. In addition, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of another six trials found that vitamin E significantly lowered circulating aminotransferase concentrations in NAFLD and NASH patients, suggesting liver function improvements [(86)](#reference86). Finally, in a small nonrandomized, unblinded, controlled study in 42 obese children (mean age, 8 years) with NAFLD, lifestyle recommendations combined with 600 mg/day of supplemental RRR--tocopheryl acetate for six months reduced markers of oxidative stress and liver dysfunction and improved [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) and the profile of lipid in the blood, when compared to baseline. No such changes in markers of oxidative stress, liver function, and glucose utilization were reported in the lifestyle intervention only group [(87)](#reference87). Further randomized and well-controlled studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. [Mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) are thought to contribute to the onset and/or progression of several [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease), especially [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) [(88)](#reference88). The progressive degeneration of [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cells that accompanies the decline of memory and other [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) functions in subjects with Alzheimer's disease is associated with an intracellular aggregation of Tau fibrils, an extraneuronal accumulation [reduction](../glossary#reduction) ( [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction)) imbalance of complex [etiology](../glossary#etiology). In the brain of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those with AD, the level of markers of oxidative damage to [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [proteins](../glossary#protein), and [lipids](../glossary#lipid) is increased, while the expression and activities of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione) and [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) are reduced (reviewed in [88](#reference88)). In addition, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) reported that circulating concentrations of vitamins, including vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E, were significantly lower in AD patients than in cognitively healthy individuals [(89)](#reference89). Other studies have documented low concentrations of vitamin E in [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of cognitively impaired patients (reviewed in [90](#reference90)). Because a reduction in oxidative stress may help maintain cognitive status and/or prevent deterioration, the effects of vitamin E supplementation have been assessed in a few [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial). An early multicenter, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in individuals with AD of moderate severity found that supplementation with 2,000 IU/day of all-rac--tocopherol (equivalent to 900 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) for two years significantly delayed cognitive decline, slowed disease progression, and increased median survival [(91)](#reference91). However, a placebo-controlled trial in 769 patients with MCI found that the same dosage of vitamin E did not affect the probability of progression from MCI to AD over a three-year period [(92)](#reference92). In another [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial, an improvement in cognitive performance \u2014 measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scoring system \u2014 was reported in AD patients randomized to receive 800 IU/day of all-rac--tocopherol (360 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) for six months only when the treatment effectively reduced oxidative stress (as assessed by the measure of total glutathione and markers of [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) in the blood) [(93)](#reference93). Conversely, a failure to reduce oxidative stress resulted in supplemental vitamin E being more detrimental to the cognitive function of AD patients than placebo. In the most recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, supplemental vitamin E (2,000 IU/day; form of vitamin E not mentioned in the publication) for over two years significantly delayed functional decline \u2014 determined by the (in)ability to perform basic activities of daily living \u2014 and reduced the annual mortality rate in mild and moderate AD patients [(94)](#reference94). Yet, vitamin E failed to affect cognitive performance measured with MMSE scores and other cognitive ability tests. While there is currently little evidence to suggest that long-term supplementation of vitamin E provides any cognitive benefits in healthy older adults [(95)](#reference95), additional research needs to confirm whether vitamin E supplementation could benefit the management of patients with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments. Major sources of -tocopherol in the American diet include vegetable oils (olive, sunflower, and safflower oils), nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables. All eight forms of vitamin E (-, -, -, and -tocopherols and -, -, -, and -tocotrienols) occur naturally in mostly plant-based foods but in varying amounts. Table 2 lists the content of -tocopherol and -tocopherol (in milligrams) in some rich sources of vitamin E. For more information on the vitamin E content of foods, In the US, the average intake of -tocopherol from food (including enriched and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) sources) for adults (19 years of age) is 7.2 mg/day [(25)](#reference25); this level is well below the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of 15 mg/day of -tocopherol (see [Table 1](#table-1)). While it appears feasible for individuals to meet the RDA from food only, Americans would have to depart from their current dietary practices and include greater intakes of nuts, seeds, fruit, and vegetables without increasing fat intake above recommended levels [(96)](#reference96). RRR--tocopherol is the only stereoisomeric form of -tocopherol found in unfortified foods. The same is not always true for nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Vitamin E supplements generally contain 100 IU to 1,000 IU of -tocopherol. Supplements made from entirely natural sources contain only RRR--tocopherol (wrongly labeled d--tocopherol). RRR--tocopherol is the most [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) form of -tocopherol in the body. Synthetic -tocopherol, which is often found in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food and nutritional supplements and usually labeled all-rac--tocopherol or dl--tocopherol, include all eight possible stereoisomers of -tocopherol (see [Function](#Function)). Because half of the [isomers](../glossary#isomer) present as a mixture in synthetic -tocopherol are not usable by the body, synthetic -tocopherol is less bioavailable than natural -tocopherol (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). To calculate the amount (in milligrams) of -tocopherol bioavailable in a supplement, the conversion factors are as follows: In addition, vitamin E-fortified foods often contain synthetic -tocopherol, and amounts of vitamin E are provided as a percentage of the daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of 30 IU (approximately 20 mg of RRR--tocopherol). -Tocopheryl succinate and -tocopheryl acetate are the main esterified forms of vitamin E in nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Tocopherol [esters](../glossary#ester) are more resistant to [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) during storage than unesterified tocopherols [(1)](#references). When taken orally, the succinate or acetate moieties are removed from -tocopherol in the intestine. The [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of -tocopherol from -tocopheryl succinate and -tocopheryl acetate is equivalent to that of free -tocopherol [(97)](#reference97). Hence, the conversion factors used to determine the amount of bioavailable -tocopherol provided by -tocopheryl succinate and -tocopheryl acetate are the same as those used for -tocopherol (see [above](#formula)) [(2)](#reference2). Cell culture studies indicated that the vitamin E ester, -tocopheryl succinate, could inhibit [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and induce [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) in a number of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) cell lines [(12)](#reference12). Limited data from animal models of cancer found that -tocopheryl succinate administered by injection inhibited tumor growth [(98)](#reference98). There is currently no evidence in humans that taking oral -tocopheryl succinate supplements delivers -tocopheryl succinate to tissues. Of note, current research investigates nanomedicines to increase -tocopheryl succinate bioavailability before exploring putative nicotinate is another acid ( -tocopheryl nicotinate can be prescribed as a [lipid](../glossary#lipid)-lowering agent in Europe and Japan, it is marketed as a supplement only in the US [(99)](#reference99). There is currently no published evidence that [supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing -tocopheryl phosphates are more efficiently absorbed or have greater [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) in humans than those containing -tocopherol [(99)](#reference99). [Supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing -tocopherol, mixed tocopherols, or tocotrienols are also commercially available [(99)](#reference99). The amounts of - and -tocopherol in mixed tocopherol supplements vary, so it is important to read the label to determine the amount of each tocopherol form present in a capsule. Few side effects have been noted in adults taking [supplements](../glossary#supplement) of less than 2,000 mg of -tocopherol daily (either natural or synthetic vitamin E). However, most studies assessing safety issues or toxicity of -tocopherol supplementation have lasted only a few weeks to a few months, and side effects associated with long-term -tocopherol supplementation have not been adequately studied. The most worrisome possibility is that of impaired blood clotting, which increases the likelihood of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) in some individuals. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that daily vitamin E supplementation \u2014 equivalent to 25 to 536 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol \u2014 for several years resulted in a significant, 10% reduction in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) (five trials, 91,393 participants) and a nonsignificant trend towards an increased risk of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) (five trials, 100,748 participants) [(100)](#reference100). A tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for any form of supplemental -tocopherol (all possible stereoisomers) has been established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to avoid the potential risk of bleeding (Table 3). Specifically, the UL of 1,000 mg/day of -tocopherol in any supplemental form (equivalent to 1,500 IU/day of RRR--tocopherol or 1,100 IU/day of all-rac--tocopherol) corresponds to the highest dose unlikely to result in hemorrhage in almost all adults [(2)](#reference2). Although only certain [isomers](../glossary#isomer) of -tocopherol are retained in the circulation, all forms are absorbed and [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) by the liver. Hence, the rationale for a UL that refers to all stereoisomers of -tocopherol is based on the fact that any form of -tocopherol (natural or synthetic) can be absorbed and thus be potentially harmful. |Age for -tocopherol applies to all stereoisomers of -tocopherol (natural and synthetic) found in supplements and fortified food. Some physicians recommend discontinuing high-dose vitamin E supplementation two to four weeks before elective surgery \u2014 including dental procedures \u2014 to decrease the risk of hemorrhage [(99)](#reference99). Because dietary vitamin E is essential to prevent vitamin E deficiency in the newborn, vitamin E must be supplied in [parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) solutions in infants who cannot be given enteral feeding, such as prematurely born infants. Yet, preterm infants appear to be especially vulnerable to adverse effects of -tocopherol supplementation, and supplemental vitamin E should be administered only under controlled supervision by a pediatrician [(101)](#reference101). Finally, the results of only one randomized controlled trial in 601 patients with common forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) indicated that supplementation with 400 IU/day of synthetic vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) modestly but significantly accelerated the loss of [retinal](../glossary#retina) function compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(22)](#reference22). Patients with common forms of RP should therefore avoid taking high-dose vitamin E supplements if they are not deficient in vitamin E (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). A [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) in over 4,000 participants of the Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study \u2014 with or without preexisting [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) \u2014 found no statistically significant association between vitamin E supplement intake and [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) or all-cause mortality after a 10-year follow-up period [(102)](#reference102). However, in addition to reports of increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) and heart failure with supplemental vitamin E in several [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)), a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) by Miller et al. [(103)](#reference103) suggested an increased risk of death with the use of large doses of vitamin E, yet lower than the UL. Specifically, this meta-analysis combined the results of 19 clinical trials of vitamin E supplementation that mostly focused on secondary prevention and, as such, included subjects with pre-existing conditions including heart disease, end-stage [renal](../glossary#renal) failure, and [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease). The study found that daily supplementation with at least 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg of RRR--tocopherol) resulted in a 4% increase in risk of death from any cause compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(103)](#reference103). However, further dose-response analysis and adjustment for intake of other vitamin and mineral supplements indicated that all-cause mortality risk was significantly increased by 7% only at a dose of 2,000 IU/day, which is notably higher than the UL for adults (1,100 IU/day of synthetic tocopherol or 1,500 IU/day of natural tocopherol; see [Table 3](#table-3)). Additionally, a more recent meta-analysis of 46 randomized trials, including 171,244 participants, found that supplemental vitamin E, singly or in combination with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), did not significantly alter the risk of all-cause mortality [(104)](#reference104). At present, there is no convincing evidence that vitamin E supplementation below the UL increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease or other causes, especially in generally healthy subjects. Yet, individuals with pre-existing conditions may be at increased risk of serious adverse effects (including death) if one considers the possibility that large doses of supplemental vitamin E might interfere with medications, and possibly lower their efficacy or increase their toxicity [(1)](#references). Large doses of vitamin E may inhibit [vitamin K](vitamin-K)-dependent carboxylase activity and interfere with the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade (see the article on [Vitamin K](vitamin-K#nutrient-interactions)) [(19)](#reference19). Hence, the use of vitamin E [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may increase the risk of bleeding in individuals taking [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs (blood thinners), such as heparin and the vitamin including aspirin, ibuprofen, and others. In addition, individuals who may be vitamin K deficient due to liver failure, those with a propensity to bleed (e.g., bleeding [peptic ulcers](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease)), and those with inherited bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia) or a history of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke), should not take -tocopherol supplements without close medical supervision because of the increased risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) [(20](#reference20), [99)](#reference99). Finally, it cannot be excluded that vitamin E would potentiate the antithrombotic activity of supplemental fish oils and herbal products, such as garlic, curcumin, or Ginkgo biloba [(99)](#reference99). A number of colestipol), as well as orlistat, sucralfate, mineral oil, and the fat substitute, olestra, which interfere with fat absorption, may theoretically decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin E. The [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) drugs phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), and carbamazepine (Tegretol), may also [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations in individuals with [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) [(105)](#reference105). A three-year [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) and low high-density-lipoprotein ( [HDL](../glossary#HDL)) levels found that a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and [niacin](niacin) increased the HDL2 subfraction level (considered most cardioprotective), inhibited the progression of [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, such as [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) and [stroke](../glossary#stroke) [(106)](#reference106). Surprisingly, when an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) combination of 1,000 mg of vitamin C, 800 IU (536 mg) of RRR--tocopherol, 100 g of selenium, and 25 mg of -carotene daily, was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects were diminished. However, in a much larger randomized controlled trial of simvastatin and an antioxidant combination of 600 mg of all-rac--tocopherol (297 mg of RRR--tocopherol), 250 mg of vitamin C, and 20 mg of -carotene daily in more than 20,000 men and women with CHD or diabetes, the antioxidant combination did not adversely affect the cardioprotective effects of simvastatin therapy over a five-year period [(107)](#reference107). These contradictory findings indicate that further research is needed on potential interactions between antioxidant supplementation and cholesterol-lowering agents like statins. The Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for vitamin E for adult men and women is 15 mg (22.5 IU) per day. Notably, more than 90% of individuals two years of age and older in the US do not meet the daily requirement for vitamin E from food sources alone. Therefore, LPI recommends that generally healthy adults (aged 19 years and older) take a daily [multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which usually contains 30 IU of synthetic vitamin E \u2014 equivalent to 13.5 mg of RRR--tocopherol and 90% of the RDA. The Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a daily [multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) containing vitamin E is also appropriate for generally healthy older adults. MVMs typically contain 30 IU of synthetic vitamin E, covering 90% of the [RDA](../glossary#RDA).

Vitamin K-dependent -carboxylation that occurs only on specific glutamic acid residues in identified vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDP) is critical for their ability to bind [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [(5)](#reference5). Although vitamin K is a [fat](../glossary#lipid)-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), the body stores very small amounts that are rapidly depleted without regular dietary intake. Perhaps because of its limited ability to store vitamin K, the body recycles it through a process called the vitamin K-epoxide cycle (Figure 2). The vitamin K cycle allows a small amount of vitamin K to be reused many times for [protein](../glossary#protein) [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation), thus decreasing the dietary requirement. Briefly, vitamin K hydroquinone (reduced form) is [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to vitamin K epoxide (oxidized form). The reaction enables -glutamylcarboxylase to carboxylate selective glutamic acid residues on vitamin K-dependent proteins. The recycling of vitamin K epoxide (oxidized form) to hydroquinone (reduced form) is carried out by two reactions that reduce vitamin K epoxide (KO) to vitamin K quinone and then to vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2; Figure 2). Additionally, the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) vitamin K-epoxide reductase (VKOR) [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the reduction of KO to vitamin K quinone and may be involved \u2014 as well as another yet-to-defined reductase \u2014 in the production of KH2 from vitamin K quinone [(6, 7)](#reference6). The [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drug warfarin acts as a vitamin K [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) by inhibiting VKOR activity, hence preventing vitamin K recycling (see [Coagulation](#coagulation)). The ability to bind [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [ions](../glossary#ion) (Ca2+) is required for the activation of the several vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, or [proteins](../glossary#protein), in the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) (clotting) cascade. The term 'coagulation cascade' refers to a series of events, each dependent on the other, that stops bleeding through clot formation. Vitamin K-dependent - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of specific glutamic acid residues in those proteins makes it possible for them to bind calcium. Factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X make up the core of the coagulation cascade. Protein Z appears to enhance the action of thrombin (the activated form of prothrombin) by promoting its association with [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) in [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Protein C and protein S are [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) proteins that provide control and balance in the coagulation cascade; protein Z also has an anticoagulatory function. Control mechanisms for the coagulation cascade exist since uncontrolled clotting may be as life threatening as uncontrolled bleeding. Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors are [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the liver. Consequently, severe liver disease results in lower blood levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for uncontrolled bleeding ( [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage)) [(8)](#reference8). Some people are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of forming clots, which could block the flow of blood in arteries of the heart, brain, or lungs, resulting in [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (heart attack), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), or pulmonary embolism, respectively. Abnormal clotting is not related to excessive vitamin K intake, and there is no known toxicity associated with vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)). Some oral [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant), such as warfarin (Jantoven, formerly known as Coumadin), inhibit [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) by [antagonizing](../glossary#antagonist) the action of vitamin K. Warfarin prevents the recycling of vitamin K by blocking VKOR activity, thus creating a functional vitamin K deficiency (Figure 2). Inadequate -carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins interferes with the coagulation cascade, which inhibits blood clot formation. Large quantities of dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin K can overcome the anticoagulant effect of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist); thus, patients taking these drugs are cautioned against consuming very large or highly variable quantities of vitamin K (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Experts now advise a reasonably constant dietary intake of vitamin K that meets current dietary recommendations (90-120 g/day) for patients taking vitamin K antagonists like warfarin [(9, 10)](#reference9). Vitamin K-dependent - protein) by [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) (bone-forming cells); the synthesis of osteocalcin is regulated by the active form of [vitamin D](vitamin-D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). The calcium-binding vitamin K-dependent -carboxylation of three glutamic acid residues. Although its function in bone mineralization is not fully understood, osteocalcin is required for the growth and maturation of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)) [(11)](#reference11). Protein S appears to play a role in the breakdown of bone mediated by [osteoclasts](../glossary#osteoclast). Individuals with inherited protein S deficiency suffer complications related to increased blood clotting, as well as [osteonecrosis](../glossary#osteonecrosis) [(12, 13)](#reference12). Protein S can bind and activate [receptors](../glossary#receptor) of the TAM family that are involved in [phagocytosis](../glossary#phagocytosis). [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in TAM receptors can result in visual impairment, defective [spermatogenesis](../glossary#spermatogenesis), [autoimmune disorders](../glossary#autoimmune-disease), and [platelet](../glossary#platelet) disorders [(14)](#reference14). MGP has been found in [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage), bone, and soft tissue, including blood vessel walls, where it is synthesized and secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells. MGP is involved in the inhibition of [calcification](../glossary#calcification) at various sites, including cartilage, vessel wall, skin elastic fibers, and the trabecular meshwork in the eye (see [Vascular calcification](#vascular-calcification-prevention)) [(15, 16)](#reference15). several VKDPs, including MGP, have been associated with calcification sites in arteries, skin, kidneys, and eyes in certain inherited conditions, such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum and beta-thalassemia [(17, 18)](#reference17). The vitamin K-dependent proteins, GRP and periostin, are also synthesized in bone tissue, but their roles in bone metabolism are still unclear [(19, 20)](#reference19). Expressed in normal human skin and vascular tissues, GRP has been colocalized with abnormal mineral deposits in the extracellular matrix in calcified arteries and calcified skin lesions [(21)](#reference21). Expressed in most connective tissues, including skin and bone, periostin was initially associated with cell adhesion and migration. This VKDP also appears to promote [angiogenesis](../glossary#angiogenesis) (formation of new blood vessels) during cardiac valve degeneration and tumor growth [(22, 23)](#reference22). Current research suggests that reduced -glutamylcarboxylase activity and/or lower vitamin K [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) may impair the activity of VKDPs and contribute to bone mineralization defects and abnormal soft tissue calcification (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(24)](#reference24). Growth arrest-specific gene 6 [protein](../glossary#protein) (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein that was identified in 1993. It has been found throughout the nervous system, as well in the heart, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage). Identified as a ligand of the TAM family of transmembrane tyrosine kinase [receptors](../glossary#receptor), Gas6 appears to be a cellular growth regulation factor with [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) activities. Gas6 has been involved in diverse cellular functions, including [phagocytosis](../glossary#phagocytosis), cell adhesion, cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), and protection against [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) [(5)](#reference5). It may also play important roles in the developing and aging nervous system (reviewed in [25](#reference25)). Further, Gas6 appears to regulate [platelet](../glossary#platelet) signaling and vascular [hemostasis](../glossary#hemostasis) [(26)](#reference26). Expressed in most tissues and involved in many cellular functions, Gas6 has also been linked to several pathological conditions, including clot formation (thrombogenesis), [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis), chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) growth [(27-29)](#reference27). Overt vitamin K deficiency results in impaired blood clotting, usually demonstrated by laboratory tests that measure clotting time. Symptoms include easy bruising and bleeding that may be manifested as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in the urine, blood in the stool, tarry black stools, or extremely heavy menstrual bleeding. In infants, vitamin K deficiency may result in life-threatening bleeding within the skull (intracranial [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage)) [(8)](#reference8). Multiple [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) exist (reviewed in [30](#reference30)), but only impaired blood [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) is used as a measure of clinical vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency is uncommon in healthy adults for a number of reasons: (1) vitamin K is widespread in foods (see [Food sources](#food-sources)); (2) the vitamin K cycle conserves vitamin K (see [Vitamin K oxidation-reduction cycle](#vitamin-K-oxidation-reduction-cycle)); and (3) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally inhabit the large intestine [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) menaquinones (vitamin K2), although it is unclear whether significant amounts are absorbed and utilized (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Adults at [risk](../glossary#risk) for vitamin K deficiency include those taking vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) and individuals with significant liver damage or disease [(8)](#reference8). Additionally, individuals with [fat](../glossary#lipid) [malabsorption disorders](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), including [inflammatory bowel disease](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease) and [cystic fibrosis,](../glossary#cystic-fibrosis) may be at increased risk of vitamin K deficiency [(31-34)](#reference31). Newborn babies who are exclusively breast-fed are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for vitamin K deficiency because human milk is relatively low in vitamin K compared to formula. Newborn infants, in general, have low vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) for the following reasons: (1) vitamin K transport across the [placental](../glossary#placenta) barrier is limited; (2) liver storage of vitamin K is very low; (3) the vitamin K cycle may not be fully functional in newborns, especially premature infants; (4) the vitamin K content of breast milk is low, and immature gut flora [(5](#reference5), [35)](#reference35). Infants whose mothers are on [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) medication to prevent [seizures](../glossary#seizure) are also at risk for vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency in newborns may result in a bleeding disorder called vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) of the newborn (reviewed in [36](#reference36)). Because VKDB is life threatening and easily prevented, the American Academy of Pediatrics and a number of similar international organizations recommend that an intramuscular dose of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) be administered to all newborns shortly after birth (reviewed in [37](#reference37)). Vitamin K and childhood leukemia: In the early 1990s, two [retrospective studies](../glossary#retrospective-study) were published suggesting a possible association between phylloquinone injections in newborns and the development of childhood [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia) and other forms of childhood [cancer](../glossary#cancer). However, two large retrospective studies in the US and Sweden, which reviewed the medical records of 54,000 and 1.3 million children, respectively, found no evidence of a relationship between childhood cancers and phylloquinone injections at birth [(38, 39)](#reference38). Moreover, a pooled analysis of six [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), including 2,431 children diagnosed with childhood cancer and 6,338 cancer-free children, found no evidence that phylloquinone injections for newborns increased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of childhood leukemia [(40)](#reference40). In a policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that routine vitamin K [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) for newborns be continued because VKDB is life threatening and the risks of cancer are unproven and unlikely [(41)](#reference41). In the last decade, physicians have reported a rise in late-onset cases of VKDB due to an increasing trend of parental omission or refusal of newborn vitamin K prophylaxis [(42, 43)](#reference42). Lower doses of vitamin K1 for premature infants: The results of two studies of vitamin K levels in premature infants suggest that the standard initial dose of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) for full-term infants (1.0 mg) may be too high for premature infants [(44, 45)](#reference44). These findings have led some experts to suggest the use of an initial phylloquinone dose of 0.3 mg/kg for infants with birth weights of less than 1,000 g (2 lbs, 3 oz), and an initial phylloquinone dose of 0.5 mg would probably prevent hemorrhagic disease in newborns [(44)](#reference44). Yet, additional studies are needed to determine the best vitamin K prophylaxis in premature infants [(46)](#reference46). In 2001, the US Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) established the adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) level for vitamin K based on phylloquinone intake levels in healthy individuals (Table 1). The AI for infants was based on estimated intake of vitamin K from breast milk [(47)](#reference47). The FNB did not consider menaquinone intakes; and younger||-||75| and older||-||90| The discovery of vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) in bone has led to research on the role of vitamin K in maintaining bone health. Vitamin K1: [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found a relationship between phylloquinone and age-related bone loss ( [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis)). The Nurses' Health Study followed more than 72,000 women for 10 years. In an analysis of this cohort, women whose phylloquinone intakes were lower than 109 micrograms/day (g/day) had a 30% higher [risk](../glossary#risk) for hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) compared to women with intakes equal to or above 109 g/day [(49)](#reference49). Another prospective study in over 800 elderly men and women, followed in the Framingham Heart Study for seven years, found that participants with dietary vitamin K intakes in the highest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) (median, 254 g/day) had a 65% lower risk of hip fracture than those with intakes in the lowest quartile (median, 56 g/day) [(50)](#reference50). Osteoporotic fractures are often linked to a reduction in bone mineralization. Yet, the investigators found no association between dietary phylloquinone intake and [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) in the Framingham subjects [(50)](#reference50). While other studies failed to observe associations between dietary phylloquinone intake and measures of bone strength, BMD, or fracture incidence [(51, 52)](#reference51), the [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of a cohort of 3,199 middle-aged women found that subjects in the highest quartile of dietary phylloquinone intake had significantly greater hip and [lumbar spine](../glossary#lumbar-spine) BMD than those in the lowest quartile (162 vs. 59 g/day) [(53)](#reference53). Moreover, cross-sectional and [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) have reported associations between higher phylloquinone intakes and lower incidence of hip fracture [(54, 55)](#reference54). However, because green leafy vegetables are the primary dietary source of phylloquinone and because they are usually part of a balanced diet, high phylloquinone consumption may simply be an indicator of healthy eating habits, which may \u2014 rather than phylloquinone itself \u2014 account for all or part of the association reported in observational studies [(56)](#reference56). The few studies that measured [plasma](../glossary#plasma) phylloquinone generally found that higher circulating levels were associated with lower fracture risk [(15](#reference15), [57, 58)](#reference57). For example, the incidence of [vertebral](../glossary#vertebral) fractures was inversely correlated with lumbar BMD and plasma phylloquinone in a four-year [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that included 379 Japanese women ages 30-88 years [(57)](#reference57). Yet, observational studies are not designed to making causal inferences, and only [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) can evaluate whether phylloquinone may have beneficial effects on bone health (see [Vitamin K supplementation studies and osteoporosis](#vitamin-K-supplementation-osteoporosis)). Vitamin K2: There are few studies on associations between menaquinones (vitamin K2) and bone health, perhaps because of the limited number of dietary sources of menaquinone-4 (MK-4), the main form of vitamin K2 present in Western diets. The Japanese food natto, made of cooked soybeans fermented by Bacillus subtilis natto, is rich in MK-7. In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 944 Japanese women (ages 20-79 years), total hip [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) at baseline was positively associated with natto intake in postmenopausal women [(59)](#reference59). During the three-year follow-up period, the rate of BMD loss at the [femoral neck](../glossary#femoral-neck) was significantly lower in women consuming natto (>200 g/day of MK-7) compared to non-consumers. No association was found between natto intake and BMD in premenopausal women [(59)](#reference59). Total hip and femoral neck BMD was also reportedly higher in nearly 2,000 Japanese men aged 65 years and older who regularly consumed at least of one pack per day of natto (350 g/day of MK-7) compared to those consuming less than one pack per week (<50 g/day of MK-7) [(60)](#reference60). Yet, increasing natto consumption also maximizes the intake of other dietary compounds (e.g., soy isoflavones) that have potential benefits for skeletal health; thus, there is need to find reliable measures of vitamin K [status](../glossary#status). To date, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have failed to unequivocally support an association between circulating menaquinone (MK-7 and MK-4) levels and fracture risk [(15](#reference15), [61)](#reference61). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that pooled the results of four prospective cohort studies and one [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) found higher total dietary vitamin K intakes to be associated with a lower risk of total fracture ( [RR](../glossary#relative-risk), 0.78; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval): 0.56, 0.99) [(62)](#reference62). In a recent Japanese cohort study not included in this meta-analysis (i.e., the Murakami Cohort Study), a protective association of dietary vitamin K intake was seen for vertebral fractures (p=0.005); vitamin K intake was not associated with total fracture in women or with either vertebral or total fracture in men [(63)](#reference63). [Biomarker of vitamin K status and bone health] Total circulating levels of the bone [protein](../glossary#protein), osteocalcin (OC), have been shown to be sensitive markers of bone formation. Several [hormones](../glossary#hormone) and growth factors, including [vitamin D](vitamin-D) but not vitamin K, regulate osteocalcin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast). However, vitamin K is an essential [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of three glutamic acid residues in osteocalcin. Undercarboxylation of osteocalcin in human bone and [serum](../glossary#serum) has been linked to poor vitamin K [status](../glossary#status). The degree of osteocalcin -carboxylation is responsive to vitamin K nutritional interventions, and thus is used as a relative indicator of vitamin K status [(11)](#reference11). Circulating levels of uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) were found to be higher in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women and markedly higher in women over the age of 70. Also, high ratios of ucOC to total OC (ucOC/OC) appear to be predictive of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) [risk](../glossary#risk) in elderly women [(64, 65)](#reference64). Although vitamin K deficiency would seem the most likely cause of elevated blood ucOC/OC ratio, some investigators have documented an inverse relationship between biochemical measures of vitamin D nutritional status and ucOC levels, as well as a significant lowering of ucOC/OC ratio by vitamin D supplementation [(66)](#reference66). It has been suggested that increased circulating ucOC/OC ratio could reflect a poor overall nutritional status that would include vitamin D inadequacy, which would explain the above-mentioned observations [(67)](#reference67). However, in several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled women [(69)](#reference69), vitamin D supplementation failed to decrease ucOC/OC ratios or show any additive effect on ucOC/OC lowering by supplemental vitamin K. Vitamin K1 supplementation: The review of five [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) that assessed the effect of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on hip [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) using doses ranging from 200 g/day to 5,000 g/day for durations of 12 to 36 months found little promising benefit for bone health [(15)](#reference15). Although supplementation with phylloquinone decreased ucOC levels in all five studies, only one study reported an effect of supplemental phylloquinone on BMD [(70)](#reference70). In this study, 150 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive a [placebo](../glossary#placebo), minerals (500 mg/day of calcium, 150 mg/day of magnesium, and 10 mg/day of zinc) plus vitamin D (320 IU/day), or minerals, vitamin D, and phylloquinone (1,000 g/day). The rate of BMD loss at the [femoral neck](../glossary#femoral-neck), but not at the [lumbar spine](../glossary#lumbar-spine), was significantly lower in subjects with supplemental phylloquinone compared to the other two groups. Thus, evidence of a putative benefit of phylloquinone on bone health in older adults is considered weak. None of the studies were designed to assess the effect of phylloquinone on [osteoporotic](../glossary#osteoporosis)-related [fractures](../glossary#fracture). Further investigation may seek to evaluate whether phylloquinone supplementation could improve skeletal health in subjects at high-risk for vitamin K inadequacy (e.g., individuals with [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) name, menatetrenone) are currently used in Japan in the treatment of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) [(71)](#reference71). Accordingly, most [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) investigating the effect of high-dose MK-4 on bone loss have been conducted in Japanese postmenopausal women. In a three-year [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial among postmenopausal women with [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia), adding a MK-7 supplement (375 g/day) to combined calcium-vitamin D supplementation did not affect BMD or other bone health parameters despite reductions in [serum](../glossary#serum) ucOC [(72)](#reference72). At present, the potential role for supplemental menaquinones on bone health still needs to be established in large, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), and well-controlled trials. A 2019 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) in postmenopausal women or women with osteoporosis found vitamin K supplementation \u2014 of any form \u2014 lowered risk of clinical [fracture](../glossary#fracture) compared to controls (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; 9 trials varying from 6 months to 2 years: 3 using phylloquinone, 5 using MK-4, and 1 using MK-7) [(73)](#reference73). However, no benefit of vitamin K supplementation was seen for vertebral fractures (7 trials) or BMD (22 trials). The authors of this meta-analysis noted that the high [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) of the included trials (i.e., form and dose of vitamin K, use of other supplements and drugs by participants, and treatment length) makes it difficult to inform clinical recommendations [(73)](#reference73). Certain oral [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant), such as warfarin, are known to be [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) of vitamin K (see [Coagulation](#coagulation)). Few studies have examined chronic use of warfarin and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older women. One study reported no association between long-term warfarin treatment and fracture risk [(74)](#reference74), while another one found a significantly higher risk of rib and [vertebral](../glossary#vertebral) fractures in warfarin users compared to nonusers [(75)](#reference75). Additionally, a study in elderly patients with [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) reported that long-term warfarin treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk of [osteoporotic](../health-disease/osteoporosis) fracture in men but not in women [(76)](#reference76). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of the results of 11 published studies found that oral anticoagulation therapy was associated with a very modest reduction in [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) at the wrist and no change in BMD at the hip or spine [(77)](#reference77). The development of new anticoagulants that do not block vitamin K recycling may offer a safer alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists [(78)](#reference78). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) examining vitamin K intake in relation to cardiovascular-related mortality have found conflicting results [(48)](#reference48). An [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin K intake and mortality was reported in a US national survey (NHANES III) of 3,401 participants [(79)](#reference79). Adequate vs. inadequate vitamin K intakes (based on sex-specific [AI](../glossary#AI): 90 g/day for women and 120 g/day for men) were associated with a 22% lower risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD)-related mortality and a 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality. The report also indicated that, while over two-thirds of individuals with chronic kidney disease had vitamin K intakes below the AI, the risk of CVD mortality was 41% lower in those with adequate compared to suboptimal intakes [(79)](#reference79). However, higher vitamin K intakes were not associated with lower CVD mortality in a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 7,216 older adults at risk for developing CVD [(80)](#reference80). This study associated higher intakes of phylloquinone, but not of menaquinones, with lower risk of all-cause mortality. More recently, in a prospective study that followed a cohort of 33,289 Dutch men and women for an average of 16.8 years (the EPIC-Netherlands), neither phylloquinone intake nor menaquinone intake at baseline was associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease, [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), or all causes [(81)](#reference81). Yet, a prospective study of 56,048 men and women participating in the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort reported higher phylloquinone intakes to be associated with lower risks of both cardiovascular disease-related mortality and all-cause mortality [(82)](#reference82). Moreover, a few studies have examined the association of fasting circulating phylloquinone with cardiovascular-related or all-cause mortality. In a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of individual participant data from three prospective cohort studies (the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, and the Framingham Offspring Study), a blood phylloquinone concentration less than or equal to 0.5 nmol/L (n=1,081) was associated with a 19% higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to a blood concentration >1.0 nmol/L (n=1,698; [83](#reference83)). This analysis did not find circulating phylloquinone to be linked with incident cardiovascular disease [(83)](#reference83). Observational studies offer limited support of an inverse relationship between phylloquinone intake and risk of incident cardiovascular disease, despite high intakes being sometimes regarded as a marker of healthy dietary habits associated with low cardiovascular risk (reviewed in [84](#reference84)). A prospective cohort study of 16,057 Dutch women (ages 49-70 years), followed for a mean period of 8.1 years, found a 9% reduction in risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) per each incremental 10 g/day increase in menaquinone intake [(85)](#reference85). In another earlier Dutch study that examined 4,807 healthy men and women 55 years and older, participants in the highest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of menaquinone intake (>32.7 g/day) had a 41% lower risk of incident CHD and a 26% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those in the lowest tertile (<21.6 g/day) [(86)](#reference86). In addition, menaquinone intake was found to be inversely associated with aortic [calcification](../glossary#calcification), a major risk factor for CVD [(86)](#reference86). A smaller prospective study among 2,987 Norwegian adults, followed for an average of 10.8 years, reported higher dietary intakes of vitamin K2, but not of vitamin K1, were associated with a lower risk of CHD [(87)](#reference87). While these data are interesting, it is important to note that vitamin K2 may solely be a marker of a heart-healthy diet and might not itself be cardioprotective. Most recently, the prospective Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study followed 53,372 older adults for an average of 21 years, finding both phylloquinone and menaquinone intake at baseline to be inversely associated with hospitalizations due to [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) cardiovascular events, including ischemic to determine whether vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 reduces the risk of CHD or cardiovascular-related events like [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or stroke. One of the hallmarks of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) is the presence of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaques in arterial walls. Plaque rupture that causes blood clot formation (thrombogenesis) is the usual cause of a [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (heart attack) or [stroke](../health-disease/stroke). While [calcification](../glossary#calcification) of the plaques occurs as the atherosclerosis progresses, it is unclear whether calcification increases plaque instability and could predict [risk](../glossary#risk) of rupture and thrombogenesis [(89)](#reference89). However, calcification may be predictive of future [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, especially in those with chronic kidney disease [(90)](#reference90). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 30 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including a total of 218,080 participants, found that the presence of vascular calcification was associated with an overall three- to four-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality [(91)](#reference91). An early population-based study of postmenopausal women (ages, 60-79 years) observed that the younger women (60-69 years) with aortic calcifications had lower vitamin K intakes than those without aortic calcifications, but this was not true for older women (70-79 years) [(92)](#reference92). A prospective cohort study in 807 men and women, 39-45 years of age, did not find any correlation between dietary phylloquinone intake and [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) calcification, phylloquinone nor menaquinone intake was associated with calcification of breast arteries in a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 1,689 women ages 49-70 years [(94)](#reference94). However, in another cross-sectional study, the upper vs. lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of menaquinone (MK-4 to MK-10) intake (median intakes, 48.5 g/day vs. 18 g/day) was found to be associated with a 20% reduced [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of coronary artery calcification in 564 postmenopausal women [(95)](#reference95). Research has uncovered possible mechanisms by which vitamin K may inhibit mineralization (calcification) of vessels while promoting bone mineralization. The potential mechanisms, although not yet fully understood, implicate vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein), including matrix [(96-98)](#reference96). Secreted by various cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in arterial vessel walls, MGP appears to be important for the prevention of calcification of soft tissues, including [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage), vasculature, skin, and trabecular meshwork cells in the eye [(15](#reference15), [99)](#reference99). In MGP knockout mice, conversion of VSMCs into bone-like cells and extensive vessel calcification results in large vessel rupture and premature death. In humans, defective MGP [gene](../glossary#gene) has been linked to Keutel syndrome, a rare inherited condition characterized in particular by abnormal cartilage calcification and pulmonary artery [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing). Calcification prevention by MGP involved several mechanisms, including the binding to calcium crystals and the inhibition of proteins (bone morphogenic proteins; BMPs) known to promote ectopic bone formation (reviewed in [100](#reference100)). Calcium-binding activity of MGP is regulated by two types of modifications (known as post-translational modifications since they take place after protein [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis)): the vitamin K-dependent [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of up to five Glu residues and the [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of serine residues. A variation in the sequence ( [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism)) of the gene for MGP leading to a threonine-to-alanine transition in one of the five Gla domains of the protein may possibly prevent carboxylation and elicit a change in MGP ability to bind calcium. This polymorphism, known as MGPThr83Ala, has been associated with the progression of coronary artery calcification over a mean period of 10.6 years in a community-based prospective study that followed 605 middle-aged men and women [(101)](#reference101). This association was only observed among participants without detectable calcification at baseline and not in those who had baseline calcification [(101)](#reference101). Interestingly, MGPThr83Ala was also associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and femoral artery calcification in carriers of the genotype [(102)](#reference102). Additionally, a small study initially found that, while undercarboxylated MGP (ucMGP) was absent from the innermost lining of the [carotid arteries](../glossary#carotid-arteries) in healthy subjects, the majority of MGP in the carotid arterial lining of patients with atherosclerosis was undercarboxylated [(103)](#reference103). In another study that examined the association between circulating MGP and incident cardiovascular events in 577 older men and women followed for a mean period of 5.6 years, the risk of cardiovascular disease (i.e., coronary artery disease, [peripheral arterial disease](../glossary#peripheral-arterial-disease), and [cerebrovascular disease](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease)) was two- to three-fold greater in subjects in the highest vs. lowest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) dephosphorylated and undercarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) [(104)](#reference104). The results of another prospective study suggested that circulating dp-ucMGP may be predictive of mortality risk in subjects with overt vascular disease [(105)](#reference105). Indeed, the risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality was found to be nearly doubled in subjects with coronary artery disease or stroke in the highest vs. lowest quartile of dp-ucMGP concentrations [(105)](#reference105). Because suboptimal vitamin K nutritional may limit carboxylation and result in biologically inactive ucMGP, it has been speculated that vitamin K [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may protect against vascular calcification. A three-year, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial investigated the potential effect of vitamin K on the progression of coronary calcification in 401 older, community-dwelling adults (ages, 60-80 years) free of cardiovascular disease at baseline [(106)](#reference106). The participants were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive a daily multivitamin plus calcium and vitamin D with or without 500 mg of phylloquinone. Using measurements of coronary artery calcification at baseline and follow up, it was found that phylloquinone supplementation was able to limit the progression of vascular calcification and reduce plasma dp-ucMGP compared to control [(106, 107)](#reference106). Although circulating dp-ucMGP was correlated to various markers of vitamin K status, no association with measures of coronary artery calcification were found [(107)](#reference107). Smaller trials in those at high risk for coronary artery disease [(108)](#reference108) or with existing aortic valve calcification [(109)](#reference109), mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(110)](#reference110), or kidney disease 112)](#reference111) have reported no benefit of vitamin K2 supplementation on progression of vascular calcification. A meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials found that vitamin K supplementation reduced dp-ucMGP (7 trials), reduced ucOC (4 trials), and decreased progression of vascular calcification (3 trials) [(113)](#reference113). Yet, the authors emphasize that any conclusions from their pooled analysis are limited by the high [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) of the trials with respect to the form and dose of vitamin K utilized, as well as the assays that assessed vascular calcification [(113)](#reference113). Thus, further investigations are necessary to examine the role of other vitamin K-dependent proteins (e.g., GRP, periostin, Gas6) in human atherosclerotic plaque calcification and to evaluate the effect of supplemental vitamin K on the progression of vascular calcification and risk of cardiovascular disease. Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have reported increased vascular calcium scores (a means to quantify vascular calcification) in chronic users of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) compared to nonusers (reviewed in [114](#reference114)). Warfarin therapy has also been associated with higher circulating concentrations of dp-ucMGP in a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that examined vascular [calcification](../glossary#calcification) in subjects with cardiovascular disease [(105)](#reference105). Newly developed direct inhibitors of [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) factors that do not interfere with VKDP activity may be more suitable than vitamin K antagonists, especially with regards to vascular calcification [(114)](#reference114). [Osteoarthritis](../glossary#osteoarthritis), a degenerative joint condition that affects more than 32 million US adults [(115)](#reference115), is characterized by the breakdown of articular [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage) (i.e., cartilage within the joint). Because several vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) are present in cartilage and in bone [(116)](#reference116), vitamin K inadequacy may have a role in the development of osteoarthritis. A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have investigated a possible link between vitamin K intake or status and osteoarthritis. A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) among 719 Japanese older adults found dietary intake of vitamin K to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with knee osteoarthritis [(117)](#reference117). In the Framingham Offspring Study (n=672; mean age, 66 years), higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of phylloquinone were associated with a lower risk of hand, but not knee, osteoarthritis [(118)](#reference118). A longitudinal study of 1,180 US adults (mean age, 62 years) found that low plasma concentrations of phylloquinone (0.5 nM) at baseline \u2014 indicative of a [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) vitamin K deficiency \u2014 were associated with a 56% increase in risk of knee osteoarthritis after 30 months compared to those with higher plasma concentrations [(119)](#reference119). In a more recent longitudinal study among 523 older US adults participating in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, those with extremely low plasma concentrations of phylloquinone (<0.2 nM) at baseline had increased progression of knee osteoarthritis over three years, assessed by [MRI](../glossary#magnetic-resonance-imaging) of articular cartilage and the meniscus; those with higher plasma concentrations experienced no significant progression of knee osteoarthritis [(120)](#reference120). Moreover, recent studies have associated use of the vitamin K [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) drugs with higher risks of osteoarthritis [(121)](#reference121) and joint replacement [(121)](#reference121) of the knee and hip compared to nonusers. While these observational data are interesting, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether vitamin K [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in those with low vitamin K status might help prevent or treat osteoarthritis. In an ancillary study of a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial examining the effects of vitamin K supplementation on bone loss and vascular calcification in older adults, no effects of phylloquinone supplementation (500 g/day) were found on incidence of hand osteoarthritis after three years [(122)](#reference122). Study participants were not screened for vitamin K status, and in a subgroup analysis, those with [serum](../glossary#serum) phylloquinone 1 nM at baseline that reached >1 nM at year 3 had less joint deterioration. These data infer that only those individuals with low vitamin K status benefit from vitamin K supplementation. Unfortunately, no measures were available for knee osteoarthritis, and it is well established that hand and knee osteoarthritis represent different phenotypes. Additional [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) that specifically examine the effect of vitamin K supplementation on osteoarthritis development are needed, especially in those with inadequate vitamin K status. A US national survey, NHANES 2011-2012, found that average dietary intakes of vitamin K (all forms) vary greatly among individuals, with values ranging from 80 to 195 g/day of phylloquinone for men and 78 to 223 g/day of phylloquinone for women [(123)](#reference123). Mean intakes for both men and women were 117 g/day of phylloquinone; however, 57% of men and 37% of women did not meet the Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) level [(123)](#reference123). Phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is the major dietary form of vitamin K in most diets. Green leafy vegetables and some plant oils (soybean, canola, olive, and cottonseed) are major contributors of dietary vitamin K. Mixed dishes have also been found to significantly contribute to vitamin K intake in the US [(123)](#reference123). However, phylloquinone [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) from green vegetables is lower than from oil or [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Also, the phylloquinone content of green vegetables depends on their content in chlorophyll (green pigment), so that outer leaves have more phylloquinone than inner leaves. The efficiency of phylloquinone intestinal absorption varies among plant sources and is increased with the addition of a fat source to a meal. Finally, the hydrogenation of vegetable oils may decrease the absorption and biological effect of dietary phylloquinone (reviewed in [2](#reference2), [9](#reference9)). If you wish to check foods for their nutrient content, including phylloquinone, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). A number of phylloquinone-rich foods are listed in Table 2, with their content in phylloquinone expressed in microbial origins and thus commonly found in [fermented](../glossary#fermentation) foods, such as cheese, curds, and natto (fermented soybeans) [(124, 125)](#reference124). MK-4 is menaquinone that is not produced by [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria). MK-4 is formed from menadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K) found in animal feeds or is converted in a tissue-specific way from multiple dietary forms of vitamin K, including phylloquinone and various menaquinones [(4](#reference4), [126)](#reference126). Menaquinone-4 is found in dairy products, including milk, and in some meats [(125)](#reference125). Longer chain menaquinones are found in limited fermented food products. The Japanese fermented soybean-based, natto, is rich in MK-7 (998 g/100 g) and also contains MK-8 (84 g/100 g). Some cheeses contain MK-8 and MK-9 [(2](#reference2), [125)](#reference125). Additionally, animal livers Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/), have limited data on menaquinone content in foods. Thus, menaquinone contribution to total vitamin K intakes is difficult to estimate and likely to vary between populations with different food consumption practices [(2](#reference2), [125)](#reference125). Bacteria that normally colonize the large intestine ( [colon](../glossary#colon)) can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) menaquinones. It was initially thought that up to 50% of the human vitamin K requirement might be met by bacterial synthesis. However, all forms of vitamin K are absorbed in the small intestine via a mechanism requiring [bile](../glossary#bile) salts, while most of the menaquinone production takes place in the colon where bile salts are lacking. Current research suggests that the contribution of bacterial synthesis to vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) is much less than previously thought, although the exact contribution remains unclear [(16](#reference16), [127)](#reference127). In the US, both phylloquinone and menaquinones are available without a prescription in multivitamin, single-nutrient, or multiple-nutrient [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in varying doses; vitamin K content of multivitamins typically range from 20 to 120 g per tablet [(128)](#reference128). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not authorized any health claims for any forms of vitamin K. Although allergic reactions are possible, there is no known toxicity associated with high doses (dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement)) of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K [(47)](#reference47). The same is not true for synthetic menadione (vitamin K3) and its derivatives. Menadione can interfere with the function of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione), one of the body's natural [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), resulting in [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Menadione given injection has induced liver toxicity, [jaundice](../glossary#jaundice), and [hemolytic anemia](../glossary#hemolytic-anemia) (due to the rupture of red blood cells) in infants; therefore, menadione is no longer used for treatment of vitamin K deficiency [(5)](#reference5). No tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) has been established for vitamin K [(47)](#reference47). Large doses of [vitamin A](vitamin-A) and [vitamin E](vitamin-E) have been found to [antagonize](../glossary#antagonist) vitamin K [(8)](#reference8). Excess vitamin A appears to interfere with vitamin K absorption, whereas vitamin E may inhibit vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity and interfere with the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade [(129)](#reference129). One study in adults with normal coagulation status found that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 1,000 IU/day of vitamin E for 12 weeks decreased - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of prothrombin, a vitamin K-dependent [protein](../glossary#protein) [(130)](#reference130). Individuals taking [anticoagulatory](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs like warfarin and those who are vitamin K deficient should not take vitamin E supplements without close medical supervision because of the increased risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (excessive bleeding) [(131)](#reference131). The [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) effect of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) (e.g., warfarin) may be compromised by very high dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin K intake. Moreover, daily phylloquinone supplements of up to 100 g are considered safe for patients taking warfarin, but therapeutic anticoagulant stability may be undermined by daily doses of MK-7 as low as 10 to 20 g [(132)](#reference132). It is generally recommended that individuals using warfarin try to consume the [AI](../glossary#AI) for vitamin K (90-120 g/day) and avoid large fluctuations in vitamin K intake that might interfere with the adjustment of their anticoagulant dose [(9, 10](#reference9), [133)](#reference133). The prescription and anti- [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis) drugs (e.g., rifampin and isoniazid) to pregnant or breast-feeding women may place the newborn at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin K deficiency [(134)](#reference134). The drug amiodarone, used in the management of certain cardiac [arrhythmias](../health-disease/arrhythmia) (irregular heartbeat), including [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation), can enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and thus increase the risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) [(135, 136)](#reference135). Further, the use of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering medications (like cholestyramine and colestipol), as well as orlistat, mineral oil, and the fat substitute, olestra, may interfere with fat absorption and affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K [(137)](#reference137). It is not clear whether the [AI](../glossary#AI) for vitamin K is enough to optimize the - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) in bone (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)). To consume the amount of vitamin K associated with a decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in the Framingham Heart Study (about 250 g/day) [(50)](#reference50), an individual would need to eat a little more than \u00bd cup of chopped broccoli or a large salad of mixed greens every day. Though the dietary intake of vitamin K required for optimal function of all vitamin K-dependent proteins is not yet known, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends taking a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) and eating at least one cup of dark-green leafy vegetables daily. Replacing dietary [saturated fats](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) like butter and cheese with [monounsaturated fats](../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid) found in olive oil and canola oil will increase dietary vitamin K intake and may decrease the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Because older adults are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) and hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture), the above recommendation for a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) and at least one cup of dark green leafy vegetables daily is especially relevant.

Hendler SS, Rorvik DR, eds. Nutritional Supplements. Montvale: Medical Economics Company, Inc.; 2001.] Minerals are elements that originate in the Earth and cannot be made by living organisms. Plants obtain minerals from the soil, and most of the minerals in our diets come directly from plants or indirectly from animal sources. Minerals may also be present in the water we drink, but this varies with geographic locale. Minerals from plant sources may also vary from place to place, because soil mineral content varies geographically. The information from the Linus Pauling Institute's Micronutrient Information Center on vitamins and minerals is now available in a book titled, An Evidence-based Approach to Vitamins and Minerals: Health Benefits and Intake Recommendations. The book can be purchased from the [Linus Pauling Institute](../../publications/books) or [Thieme Medical Publishers](http://www.thieme.com/books-main/complementary-medicine/product/1040-an-evidence-based-approach-to-vitamins-and-minerals). Select a mineral from the list for more information. Contents Calcium is the most abundant [mineral](../glossary#mineral) in the human body. About 99% of the calcium in the body is found in bones and teeth, while the other 1% is found in the blood and soft tissue. Calcium concentrations in the blood and fluid surrounding the cells ( [extracellular fluid](../glossary#extracellular-fluid)) must be maintained within a narrow concentration range for normal physiological functioning. The physiological functions of calcium are so vital to survival that the body will stimulate bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption) (demineralization) to maintain normal blood calcium concentrations when calcium intake is inadequate. Thus, adequate intake of calcium is a critical factor in maintaining a healthy skeleton [(1)](#references). Calcium is a major structural element in bones and teeth. The mineral component of bone consists mainly of [hydroxyapatite](../glossary#hydroxyapatite) [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] crystals, which contain large amounts of calcium, phosphorus, and oxygen. Bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled throughout life. Bone cells called [osteoclasts](../glossary#osteoclast) begin the process of [remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling) by dissolving or resorbing bone. Bone-forming cells called [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) then [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) new bone to replace the bone that was resorbed. During normal growth, bone formation exceeds bone resorption. [Osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) may result when bone resorption chronically exceeds formation [(1)](#references). Calcium concentrations in the blood and fluid that surround cells are tightly controlled in order to preserve normal physiological function. A slight drop in blood calcium concentration (e.g., in the case of inadequate calcium intake) is sensed by the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands), resulting in their increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In the kidneys, PTH stimulates the conversion of vitamin D into its active form (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; calcitriol), which rapidly decreases urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of calcium but increases urinary excretion of [phosphorus](phosphorus). Elevations in PTH also stimulates bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption), resulting in the release of bone mineral (calcium and phosphate) \u2014 actions that also contribute to restoring [serum](../glossary#serum) calcium concentrations. Increased circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D also triggers intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphorus. Like PTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D stimulates the release of calcium from bone by activating osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells). When blood calcium rises to normal levels, the parathyroid glands stop secreting PTH. A slight increase in blood calcium concentration stimulates the production and secretion of the peptide hormone, calcitonin, by the thyroid gland. Calcitonin inhibits PTH secretion, decreases both bone resorption and intestinal calcium absorption, and increases urinary calcium excretion (Figure 1). Finally, acute changes in blood calcium concentrations do not seem to elicit the secretion of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which is produced by bone-forming cells ( [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast)/ [osteocytes](../glossary#osteocyte)) in response to increases in phosphorus intake (see the article on [Phosphorus](phosphorus)) [(2)](#reference2). While this complex system allows for rapid and tight control of blood calcium concentrations, it does so at the expense of the skeleton [(1)](#references). Calcium plays a role in mediating the constriction and relaxation of blood vessels ( [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction) and [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation)), [nerve impulse](../glossary#nerve-impulse) transmission, of [hormones](../glossary#hormone) like [insulin](../glossary#insulin) [(1)](#references). Excitable cells, such as skeletal muscle and [nerve cells](../glossary#neuron), contain voltage-dependent calcium channels in their [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) that allow for rapid changes in calcium concentrations. For example, when a nerve impulse stimulates a muscle fiber to contract, calcium channels in the cell membrane open to allow calcium [ions](../glossary#ion) into the muscle cell. Within the cell, these calcium ions bind to activator [proteins](../glossary#protein), which help release a flood of calcium ions from storage [vesicles](../glossary#vesicle) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inside the cell. The binding of calcium to the protein troponin-c initiates a series of steps that lead to muscle contraction. The binding of calcium to the protein calmodulin activates [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) that break down muscle [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen) to provide energy for muscle contraction. Upon completion of the action, calcium is pumped outside the cell or into the ER until the next activation (reviewed in [3](#reference3)). Calcium is necessary to stabilize a number of [proteins](../glossary#protein), including [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), optimizing their activities. The binding of calcium [ions](../glossary#ion) is required for the activation of the seven \"vitamin K-dependent\" clotting factors in the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade. The term, \"coagulation cascade,\" refers to a series of events, each dependent on the other that stops bleeding through clot formation (see the article on [Vitamin K](../vitamins/vitamin-K)). Vitamin D is required for optimal calcium absorption (see [Function](#function) or the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D)). Several other nutrients (and non-nutrients) influence the retention of calcium by the body and may affect calcium nutritional status. Dietary sodium is a major determinant of urinary calcium loss [(1)](#references). High- [sodium](sodium) intake results in increased loss of calcium in the urine, possibly due to competition between sodium and calcium for reabsorption in the kidneys or by an effect of sodium on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Every 1-gram (g) increment in sodium (2.5 g of sodium chloride; NaCl salt) [excreted](../glossary#excretion) by the kidneys has been found to draw about 26.3 milligrams (mg) of calcium into the urine [(1)](#references). A study conducted in adolescent girls reported that a high-salt diet had a greater effect on urinary sodium and calcium excretion in White compared to Black girls, suggesting differences among ethnic groups [(4)](#reference4). In adult women, each extra gram of sodium consumed per day is projected to produce an additional rate of bone loss of 1% per year if all of the calcium loss comes from the skeleton. A number of [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have suggested that high-sodium intakes are deleterious to bone health, especially in older women [(5)](#reference5). A two-year longitudinal study in postmenopausal women found increased urinary sodium excretion (an indicator of increased sodium intake) to be associated with decreased [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) at the hip [(6)](#reference6). Another study in 40 postmenopausal women found that adherence to a low-sodium diet (2 g/day) for six months was associated with significant reductions in sodium excretion, calcium excretion, and amino-terminal propeptide of type I [collagen](../glossary#collagen), a [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption). Yet, these associations were only observed in women with elevated baseline urinary sodium excretions [(7)](#reference7). Finally, in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 60 postmenopausal women, potassium citrate supplementation has been found to prevent an increase in calcium excretion induced by the consumption of a high-sodium diet (5,000 mg/day of elemental sodium) for four weeks [(8)](#reference8). Increasing dietary [protein](../glossary#protein) intake enhances intestinal calcium absorption, as well as urinary calcium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) [(9)](#reference9). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for protein is 46 grams (g)/day for adult women and 56 g/day for adult men; however, the average intake of protein in the US tends to be higher (about 70 g/day in adult women and over 100 g per day in adult men) [(10)](#reference10). It was initially thought that high-protein diets may result in a negative calcium balance (when the sum of urinary and fecal calcium excretion becomes greater than calcium intake) and thus increase bone loss [(11)](#reference11). However, most [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have reported either no association or positive associations between protein intake and bone mineral density in children, adults, and elderly subjects (reviewed in [12](#reference12)). The overall calcium balance appears to be unchanged by high dietary protein intake in healthy individuals [(13)](#reference13), and current evidence suggests that increased protein intakes in those with adequate supplies of protein, calcium, and vitamin D do not adversely affect [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) or [fracture](../glossary#fracture) [risk](../glossary#risk) [(14)](#reference14). [Phosphorus](phosphorus), which is typically found in [protein](../glossary#protein)-rich food, tends to increase the [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of calcium in the urine. Diets with low calcium-to-phosphorus ratios (Ca:P 0.5) have been found to increase parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and urinary calcium excretion [(15, 16)](#reference15). Also, the intestinal absorption and fecal excretion of calcium and phosphorus are influenced by calcium-to-phosphorus ratios of ingested food. Indeed, in the intestinal [lumen](../glossary#lumen), calcium salts can bind to phosphorus to form complexes that are excreted in the feces. This forms the basis for using calcium salts as phosphorus binders to lower phosphorus absorption in individuals with kidney insufficiency [(17)](#reference17). Increasing phosphorus intakes from cola soft drinks (high in phosphoric acid) and food additives (high in phosphates) may have adverse effects on bone health [(18)](#reference18). At present, there is no convincing evidence that the dietary phosphorus levels experienced in the US adversely affect bone health. Yet, the substitution of large quantities of phosphorus-containing soft drinks for milk or other sources of dietary calcium may represent a serious [risk](../glossary#risk) to bone health in adolescents and adults (see the article on [Phosphorus](../minerals/phosphorus)). Exposure to caffeine concentrations 400 mg/day have led to increased urinary calcium content in two randomized controlled trials [(19, 20)](#reference19). However, caffeine intakes of 400 mg/day did not significantly change urinary calcium excretion over 24 hours in premenopausal women when compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(21)](#reference21). A systematic review of 14 studies recently concluded that daily intake of 400 mg of caffeine was unlikely to interfere with calcium homeostasis, impact negatively bone mineral density, or increase the risks of osteoporosis and fracture in individuals with adequate calcium intakes [(22)](#reference22). A low blood calcium level (hypocalcemia) usually implies abnormal [parathyroid](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) function since the skeleton provides a large reserve of calcium for maintaining normal blood levels, especially in the case of low dietary calcium intake. Other causes of abnormally low blood calcium concentrations include chronic kidney failure, [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) deficiency, and low blood [magnesium](magnesium) levels often observed in cases of severe alcoholism. Magnesium deficiency can impair parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion by the parathyroid glands and lower the responsiveness of [osteoclasts](../glossary#osteoclast) to PTH. Thus, magnesium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) is required to correct hypocalcemia in people with low serum magnesium concentrations (see the article on [Magnesium](magnesium#deficiency)). Chronically low calcium intakes in growing individuals may prevent the attainment of optimal peak bone mass. Once peak bone mass is achieved, inadequate calcium intake may contribute to accelerated bone loss and ultimately to the development of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(1)](#references). Updated recommendations for calcium intake based on the optimization of bone health were released by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine in 2011 [(9)](#reference9). The Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for calcium is listed in Table 1 by life stage and gender. |Life Stage||Age|| Males | (mg/day) | Females | (mg/day) |Infants||0-6 months|| 200 ( |[Osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) is a skeletal disorder in which bone mass and strength are compromised, resulting in an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture). Sustaining a hip fracture is one of the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. Nearly one-third of those who sustain osteoporotic hip fractures enter nursing homes within a year following the fracture, and one person in four dies within one year of experiencing an osteoporotic hip fracture [(23)](#reference23). Despite being a common diagnosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis also affects 4%-6% of men over the age of 50 years [(24)](#reference24). Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disorder, and nutrition is only one factor contributing to its development and progression [(25)](#reference25). Other factors that increase the risk of developing osteoporosis include, but are not limited to, increased age, female gender, [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) deficiency, smoking, high alcohol intake (three or more drinks/day), metabolic disease (e.g., [hyperthyroidism](../glossary#hyperthyroidism)), and the use of certain medications (e.g., [corticosteroids](../glossary#corticosteroid) and [anticonvulsants](../glossary#anticonvulsant)) [(26)](#reference26). A predisposition to osteoporotic fracture is related to one's peak bone mass and to the rate of bone loss after peak bone mass has been attained. After adult height has been reached, the skeleton continues to accumulate bone until the third decade of life. Genetic factors exert a strong influence on peak bone mass, but lifestyle factors can also play a significant role. Strategies for reducing the risk of osteoporotic fracture include the attainment of maximal peak bone mass and the reduction of bone loss later in life. A number of lifestyle factors, including diet (especially calcium and [protein](../glossary#protein) intake) and physical activity, are amenable to interventions aimed at maximizing peak bone mass and limiting osteoporotic fracture risk [(27)](#reference27). Physical exercise is a lifestyle factor that has been associated with numerous health benefits and is likely to contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture. There is evidence to suggest that physical activity early in life contributes to the attainment of higher peak bone mass [(27)](#reference27). Moreover, lifelong participation in physical activities in the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin D supply (from dietary sources and/or sunlight exposure) may have a modest effect on slowing the rate of bone loss later in life [(28)](#reference28). Current National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include recommendations of regular muscle-strengthening and weight-bearing exercise to all postmenopausal women and men ages 50 and older [(29)](#reference29). Although benefits in reducing bone loss might be limited, muscle-strengthening exercise, including weight training and other resistive exercises (e.g., yoga and Pilates) and weight-bearing exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, and stair climbing), may improve strength, posture, balance, and coordination, thus contributing to reduced risk of falls [(29)](#reference29). One compilation of published calcium trials indicated that the beneficial skeletal effect of increased physical activity was achievable only at calcium intakes above 1,000 mg/day in women in late menopause (reviewed in [28](#reference28)). The progressive loss of [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) leading to [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia) (pre-osteoporosis) and osteoporosis is usually assessed by [dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry](../glossary#DEXA) (DEXA) at the Several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have evaluated the effect of supplemental calcium in the preservation of BMD and the prevention of fracture risk in men and women aged 50 years and older. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 15 randomized controlled trials, including 1,533 men and women >50 years of age, found that increasing calcium intake from dietary sources (i.e., milk, milk powder, dairy products, or hydroxyapatite preparations) increased BMD by 0.6%-1% at the hip (+0.6%) and total body (+1.0%) after one year and by 0.7%-1.8% at the lumbar spine (+0.7%), femoral neck (+1.8%), total hip (+1.5%), and total body (+0.9%) sites after two years [(31)](#reference31). A meta-analysis of 51 randomized controlled trials in 12,257 adults (>50 years) found that BMD at all bone sites (lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, forearm) increased by 0.7%-1.4% after one year and 0.8%-1.5% after two years of supplemental calcium, alone or in combination with vitamin D [(31)](#reference31). Such modest increases may help limit the average rate of BMD loss after menopause but are unlikely to translate into meaningful fracture risk reductions. A meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials that reported on total fracture risk found an 11% risk reduction associated with supplemental calcium with or without vitamin D [(32)](#reference32). However, there was no effect when the analysis was restricted to the largest trials with the lowest risk of [bias](../glossary#bias). Additionally, no reductions were found in risks of hip, vertebral and forearm fractures with calcium supplementation [(32)](#reference32). Because estrogen withdrawal significantly impairs intestinal absorption and [renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption of calcium, the level of calcium requirement might depend on whether postmenopausal women receive hormone replacement therapy [(28)](#reference28). The US Preventive Services Task Force conducted a meta-analysis of 11 randomized placebo-controlled trials that included 52,915 older people (of whom 69% were postmenopausal women) and reported that the supplementation of vitamin D (300-1,000 IU/day) and calcium (500-1,200 mg/day) for up to seven years resulted in a 12% reduction in the risk of any new fracture [(33)](#reference33). There was no significant effect of vitamin D without calcium [(33)](#reference33). A recently updated meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials commissioned by the National Osteoporosis Foundation found a 15% reduction in risk of total fracture (8 studies) and a 30% reduction in risk of hip fractures (six studies) with calcium and vitamin D supplementation in older people [(34)](#reference34). The National Osteoporosis Foundation advises that adequate intake of calcium (1,000-1,200 mg/day) and vitamin D (800-1,000 IU/day) be included in the diet of all middle-aged men and women [(35)](#reference35). The role and efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in strengthening bone and preventing fracture in older people remain controversial topics. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, stimulates calcium absorption by promoting the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of calcium-binding proteins in the intestine. While no amount of vitamin D can compensate inadequate total calcium intake, vitamin D insufficiency (defined as circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 20 ng/mL [50 nmol/L]) can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism and an increased risk of osteoporosis [(9](#reference9), [36)](#reference36). Conversely, in postmenopausal women (ages 57-90 years) with adequate total calcium intakes (1,400 IU/day), [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ranging from 20 ng/mL to 66 ng/mL had little effect on calcium absorption (only 6% increase over the range) [(37)](#reference37). In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the supplementation of 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D to postmenopausal women (mean age, 77.2 years) for one year was found to significantly increase circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations by 34% from baseline but failed to enhance calcium absorption in the presence of high total calcium intakes (dietary plus supplemental calcium corresponding to an average 2,100 mg/day) [(38)](#reference38). This study also reported no significant difference in measures of BMD at the hip and total body between placebo- and vitamin D-treated women. In addition, the pooled analysis of seven randomized controlled trials, including 65,517 older individuals living in the community or in an institution, found that vitamin D (400-800 IU/day) could reduce the risk of any fracture only when combined with calcium (1,000 mg/day) [(39)](#reference39). Interestingly, the results of a series of trials included in three recent meta-analyses [(33](#reference33), [40, 41)](#reference40) have suggested that supplemental vitamin D and calcium may have greater benefits in the prevention of fracture in institutionalized, older people who are also at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and fractures compared to community dwellers [(42, 43)](#reference42). For more information about bone health and osteoporosis, see the article, [Micronutrients and Bone Health](../micronutrients-health/bone-health), and visit the [National Osteoporosis Foundation](http://nof.org/) website. Approximately 6% of women and 15% of men in industrialized countries will have a [kidney stone](../glossary#kidney-stones) during their lifetime. Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. Subjects with an abnormally high level of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) are at higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing kidney stones (a process called nephrolithiasis) [(44)](#reference44). High urinary oxalate level is another risk factor for calcium oxalate stone formation. Most subjects with a history of kidney stones and/or idiopathic hypercalciuria have increased intestinal calcium absorption [(45)](#reference45). Although it was initially recommended to limit dietary calcium intake in these patients, a number of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have reported associations between lower total dietary calcium intake and increased risk of incident kidney stones [(46-48)](#reference46). The prospective analyses of three large cohorts, including a total of 30,762 men and 195,865 women followed for a combined 56 years, have indicated that the risk of kidney stones was significantly lower in individuals in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of dietary calcium intake from dairy or nondairy sources [(49)](#reference49). Additionally, a five-year randomized intervention study that enrolled 120 men with idiopathic hypercalciuria (mean age, 45 years) reported that those assigned to a low-calcium diet (approximately 400 mg/day) had a 51% higher risk of kidney stone recurrence compared to those on a normal-to-high calcium (1,200 mg/day), low animal-protein, low-salt diet [(50)](#reference50). Mechanisms by which increased dietary calcium might reduce the risk of incident kidney stones are not fully understood. An [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) was reported between total calcium intake and intestinal calcium absorption in the recent [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of a cohort of 5,452 postmenopausal women [(45)](#reference45). Moreover, women with higher [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) calcium intake and lower calcium absorption were less likely to report a history of kidney stones [(45)](#reference45). Adequate intake of calcium with food may reduce the absorption of dietary oxalate and lower urinary oxalate through formation of the insoluble oxalate salt 52)](#reference51). A recent small [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 10 non-stone-forming young adults observed that the ingestion of large amounts of oxalate did not increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone occurrence in the presence of recommended level of dietary calcium [(53)](#reference53). However, a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 36,282 postmenopausal women reported that a combination of supplemental calcium (1,000 mg/day) and [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) (400 IU/day) was associated with a significantly increased incidence of self-reported kidney stones during a seven-year treatment period. More controlled trials may be necessary to determine whether supplemental calcium affects kidney stone risk [(54)](#reference54). However, a [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) and [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that primarily reported on bone-related outcomes failed to find an effect of calcium supplementation on stone incidence [(55)](#reference55). A potential kidney stone risk associated with calcium supplementation may likely depend on whether supplemental calcium is co-ingested with oxalate-containing foods or consumed separately. Further research is needed to verify whether [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) treatment drugs (e.g., biphosphonates) rather than calcium supplements might influence the risk of stone occurrence [(56)](#reference56). Current data suggest that diets providing adequate dietary calcium and low levels of animal protein, oxalate, and [sodium](sodium) may benefit the prevention of stone recurrence in subjects with idiopathic hypercalciuria [(57-59)](#reference57). Pregnancy-induced [hypertensive](../glossary#hypertension) [eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia), complicate approximately 10% of pregnancies and are a major health [risk](../glossary#risk) for pregnant women and their offspring [(60)](#reference60). Gestational hypertension is defined as an abnormally high blood pressure that usually develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is characterized by poor [placental](../glossary#placenta) perfusion and a systemic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) that may involve several organ systems, including the [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) system, kidneys, liver, and [hematological](../glossary#hematology) system [(61)](#reference61). In addition to gestational hypertension, preeclampsia is associated with the development of severe swelling ( [edema](../glossary#edema)) and the presence of [protein](../glossary#protein) in the urine (proteinuria). Eclampsia is the occurrence of [seizures](../glossary#seizure) in association with the syndrome of preeclampsia and is a significant cause of maternal and [perinatal](../glossary#perinatal) mortality. Although cases of preeclampsia are at high risk of developing eclampsia, one-quarter of women with eclampsia do not initially exhibit preeclamptic symptoms. Risk factors for preeclampsia include genetic predisposition, advanced maternal age, first pregnancies, multiple pregnancies (e.g., twins or triplets), obesity, [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and some [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) [(61)](#reference61). While the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not entirely understood, nutrition and especially calcium [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) appear to play a role. Data from [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) have suggested an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between calcium intake during pregnancy and the incidence of preeclampsia (reviewed in [62](#reference62)). Impairment of calcium metabolism when circulating vitamin D concentration is low and/or when dietary calcium intake is inadequate may contribute to the risk of hypertension during pregnancy. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (high PTH level) due to vitamin D deficiency in young pregnant women has been associated with high maternal blood pressure and increased risk of preeclampsia [(63)](#reference63). The risk for elevated PTH concentration was also found to be increased in vitamin D-sufficient women with low-calcium intakes (<480 mg/day) during with adequate-to-high calcium intakes (1,000 mg/day) [(64)](#reference64). In addition, vitamin D deficiency may trigger hypertension through the inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system (see the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D)). Potential beneficial effects of calcium in the prevention of preeclampsia have been investigated in several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies. The most recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 trials in 15,730 pregnant women found that calcium supplementation with at least 1,000 mg/day (mostly 1,500-2,000 mg/day) from about 20 weeks of pregnancy (34 weeks of pregnancy at the latest) was associated with significant reductions in the risk of high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and preterm birth [(62)](#reference62). Greater risk reductions were reported among pregnant women at high risk of preeclampsia (5 trials; 587 women) or with low dietary calcium intake (8 trials; 10,678 women). Another meta-analysis of nine [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in high-risk women indicated that lower doses of calcium supplementation (800 mg/day), alone or with a co-treatment (i.e., vitamin D, linoleic acid, or [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant)), could also lower the risk of preeclampsia by 62% [(65)](#reference65). Yet, based on the [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of high-quality randomized controlled trials, which used mostly high-dose calcium supplements, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended that all pregnant women in areas of low-calcium intake (i.e., low-income countries with intakes around 300-600 mg/day) be given 1.5 to 2 g (1,500 to 2,000 mg)/day of elemental calcium from the 20th week of pregnancy [(66)](#reference66). Because excessive calcium supplementation may be harmful (see [Safety](#safety)), further research is required to verify whether calcium supplementation above the current IOM recommendation (1,000 mg/day for pregnant women, ages 19-50 years) would provide greater benefits to women at high risk of preeclampsia. Finally, the lack of effect of supplemental calcium on proteinuria (reported in two trials only) suggested that calcium supplementation from mid-pregnancy might be too late to oppose the genesis of preeclampsia [(67, 68)](#reference67). A randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study \u2014 the WHO Calcium and Pre-eclampsia (CAP) trial \u2014 is ongoing to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation with 500 mg/day, starting before pregnancy and until the 20th week of pregnancy, on the risk of preeclampsia in high-risk women [(69, 70)](#reference69). [Colorectal cancer ](../glossary#colorectal-cancer)(CRC) is the most common [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and the second leading cause of cancer death in the US [(71)](#reference71). CRC is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but the degree to which these two types of factors influence CRC [risk](../glossary#risk) in individuals varies widely. In individuals with polyposis](../glossary#familial-adenomatous-polyposis) (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), cause of CRC is almost entirely genetic, while modifiable lifestyle factors, including dietary habits, tobacco use, and physical activities, greatly influence the risk of sporadic (non-hereditary) CRC. [Prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have consistently reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between dairy food consumption and CRC risk. Experimental studies in cell culture and animal models have suggested plausible mechanisms underlying a role for calcium, a major nutrient in dairy products, in preventing CRC [(72)](#reference72). In the multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) prospective study of 477,122 individuals, followed for an average of 11 years, 4,513 CRC cases were documented [(73)](#reference73). Intakes of milk, cheese, and yogurt, were inversely associated with CRC risk. The highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of total dairy intake (490 g/day vs. <134 g/day) was associated with a 23% lower risk of CRC. Similarly, CRC risk was 25% lower in those in the top versus bottom quintile of calcium intake from dairy food (839 mg/day vs. <308 mg/day). The 16-year follow-up of 41,403 women (ages 26-46 years at inclusion) from the prospective Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) documented 2,273 diagnoses of [colorectal adenomas](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) (precancerous [polyps](../glossary#polyp)). The analysis of the prospective cohort found that women with total calcium intake of 1,001-1,250 mg/day had a 76% lower risk of developing advanced adenomas (i.e., adenomas more likely to become malignant) compared to those with intakes equal to and below 500 mg/day [(74)](#reference74). In addition, a dose-response analysis using data from eight prospective studies (11,005 CRC cases) estimated that an increase of 300 mg/day in total calcium intake was associated with a 5% reduction in CRC risk [(75)](#reference75). Total daily intake of calcium ranged from 333 to 2,229 mg in the examined studies. In addition, the dose-response analysis of six prospective studies (8,839 CRC cases among 920,837 participants) showed 11% lower odds of high-risk adenomas for each 300 mg/day increment in total calcium [(75)](#reference75). However, the [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies found no evidence of an effect of calcium supplementation (500 mg/day) for a median period of 45 months on total cancer risk and CRC risk [(76)](#reference76). In addition, the re-analysis of the Women's Health Initiative placebo-controlled trial failed to show a reduction in CRC risk in postmenopausal women supplemented with both [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) (400 IU/day) and calcium (1,000 mg/day) for seven years [(77)](#reference77). Finally, the results of the meta-analysis of four randomized, placebo-controlled trials have suggested that calcium supplementation (1,200-2,000 mg/day) may reduce the risk of adenoma recurrence by 13% over three to five years in subjects with a history of adenomas [(78)](#reference78). At present, it is not clear whether calcium supplementation is beneficial in CRC prevention. Larger trials designed to assess primarily the effect of long-term calcium supplementation on the incidence of adenomas and/or CRC are needed before conclusions can be drawn. Children who are chronically exposed to lead, even in small amounts, are more likely to develop learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and to have low IQs. Deficits in growth and [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) development may occur in the infants of women exposed to lead during pregnancy and lactation. In adults, lead toxicity may result in kidney damage and high blood pressure. Although the use of lead in paint products, gasoline, and food cans has been discontinued in the US, lead toxicity continues to be a significant health problem, especially in children living in urban areas [(79)](#reference79). In 2012, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set the reference value for blood lead concentration at 5 micrograms per deciliter (mg/dL) to identify children at [risk](../glossary#risk) [(80)](#reference80). Yet, there is no known blood lead concentration below which children are 100% safe. An early study of over 300 children in an urban neighborhood found that 49% of children ages 1 to 8 years had blood lead levels above the threshold of 10 mg/dL, indicating excessive lead exposure. In this study, only 59% of children ages 1 to 3 years and 41% of children ages 4 to 8 years met the recommended levels for calcium intakes [(81)](#reference81). Adequate calcium intake could be protective against lead toxicity in at least two ways. Increased dietary intake of calcium is known to decrease the [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption of lead. Once lead enters the body it tends to accumulate in the skeleton, where it may remain for more than 20 years. Adequate calcium intake also prevents lead mobilization from the skeleton during bone demineralization. A study of circulating concentrations of lead during pregnancy found that women with inadequate calcium intake during the second half of pregnancy were more likely to have elevated blood lead levels, probably because of increased bone demineralization, leading to the release of accumulated lead into the blood [(82)](#reference82). Lead in the blood of a pregnant woman is readily transported across the [placenta](../glossary#placenta) resulting in fetal lead exposure at a time when the developing nervous system is highly vulnerable. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 670 pregnant women (14 weeks' gestation) with average dietary calcium intakes of 900 mg/day, daily supplementation of 1,200 mg of calcium throughout the pregnancy period resulted in 8%-14% reductions in maternal blood lead concentrations [(83)](#reference83). Similar reductions in maternal lead concentrations in the blood and breast milk of lactating mothers supplemented with calcium were reported in earlier trials [(84, 85)](#reference84). In postmenopausal women, factors known to decrease bone demineralization, including [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) replacement therapy and physical activity, have been inversely associated with blood lead levels [(86)](#reference86). High dietary calcium intake, usually associated with dairy product consumption, has been [inversely related](../glossary#inverse-association) to body weight and central obesity in a number of [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) (reviewed in [87](#reference87)). Cross-sectional baseline data analyses of a number of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that were not designed and powered to examine the effect of calcium intake or dairy consumption on obesity or body fat have given inconsistent results [(87)](#reference87). Yet, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 cross-sectional and prospective studies predicted a reduction in body mass index (a relative measure of body weight; [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index)) of 1.1 kg/m2 with an increase in calcium intake from 400 mg/day to 1,200 mg/day [(87)](#reference87). In a [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled intervention study, 32 [obese](../glossary#obesity) subjects were randomized to energy restriction regimens (500 kCal/day deficit) for 24 weeks with (1) a standard diet providing 400 to 500 mg/day of dietary calcium and a placebo (\"low calcium\" diet), (2) a standard diet and 800 mg/day of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) calcium (\"high calcium\" diet), or (3) a high-dairy diet providing 1,200 mg/day of dietary calcium and a placebo [(88)](#reference88). Energy-restricted diets resulted in significant body weight and fat loss in all three groups. Yet, body weight and fat loss were significantly more reduced with the high-calcium diet compared to the standard diet, and further reductions were measured with the high-dairy diet compared to both high-calcium and low-calcium diets. These results suggested that while calcium intake may play a role in body weight regulation, additional benefits might be attributable to other bioactive components of dairy products, such as [proteins](../glossary#protein), [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid), and branched chain [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid). Yet, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the potential impact of calcium on body weight (reviewed in [87](#reference87)). The most-cited mechanism is based on studies in the agouti mouse model showing that low-calcium intakes, through increasing circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) and [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D), could stimulate the accumulation of fat ( [lipogenesis](../glossary#lipogenesis)) in adipocytes (fat cells) [(89)](#reference89). Conversely, higher intakes of calcium may reduce fat storage, stimulate the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and drive fat [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation). A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials estimated that high (1,300 mg/day) versus low (488 mg/day) calcium intake for a minimum of seven days increased fat oxidation by 11% [(90)](#reference90). consuming overweight obese individuals reported that the supplementation with 800 mg/day of calcium for 5 weeks failed to modify the expression of key factors involved in fat [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(91)](#reference91). Moreover, while the model suggests a role for vitamin D in lipogenesis (fat storage), human studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency \u2014 rather than sufficiency \u2014 is often associated with obesity, and supplemental vitamin D might be effective in lowering body weight when caloric restriction is imposed [(92, 93)](#reference92). Another mechanism suggests that high-calcium diets may limit dietary fat absorption in the intestine and increase fecal fat [excretion](../glossary#excretion). Indeed, in the [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract, calcium may trap dietary fat into insoluble calcium soaps of fatty acids that are then excreted [(94)](#reference94). In addition, despite very limited evidence, it has also been proposed that calcium might be involved in regulating appetite and energy intake [(95)](#reference95). To date, there is no consensus regarding the effect of calcium on body weight changes. A meta-analysis of 29 randomized controlled trials in 2,441 participants (median age, 41.4 years) found that calcium supplementation was only associated with body weight and fat loss in short-term studies (<1 year) that used energy-restricted diets [(96)](#reference96). Another of 41 randomized controlled trials (4,802 participants) found little-to-no effect of increased calcium intake from supplements or dairy foods for >12 weeks on body weight and body composition [(97)](#reference97). Finally, a meta-analysis of 33 randomized controlled trials (4,733 participants) found no overall effect of calcium supplementation (from food or supplements) for >12 weeks on body weight changes. Yet, further subgroup analyses showed weight reductions in children and adolescents (mean, -0.26 kg), in adults (mean, -0.91 kg), and in those with normal BMI (mean, -0.53 kg). Supplemental calcium did not lead to weight loss in postmenopausal women or in overweight/obese individuals [(98)](#reference98). At present, additional research is warranted to examine the effect of calcium intake on fat metabolism, as well as its potential benefits in the management of body weight with or without caloric restriction [(99)](#reference99). PMS refers to a cluster of symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, irritability, moodiness/depression, fluid retention, and breast tenderness, that begins sometime after ovulation (mid-cycle) and subsides with the onset of [menstruation](../glossary#menstruation) (the monthly period) [(100)](#reference100). A severe form of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) has been described in 3%-8% of women of childbearing age. PMDD interferes with normal functioning, affecting daily activities and relationships [(101)](#reference101). Low dietary calcium intakes have been linked to PMS in early reports, and [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) calcium has been shown to decrease symptom severity [(102)](#reference102). A [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) within the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) found that women in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of dietary (but not supplemental) calcium intake (median of 1,283 mg/day) had a 30% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing PMS compared to those in the lowest quintile (median of 529 mg/day). Similarly, women in the highest versus lowest quintile of skim or low-fat milk intake (4 servings/day vs. 1 serving/week) had a 46% lower risk [(103)](#reference103). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) of with moderate-to-severe premenstrual symptoms, supplemental calcium (1,200 mg/day) for three menstrual cycles was associated with a 48% reduction in total symptom scores, compared to a 30% reduction observed in the placebo group [(104)](#reference104). Similar positive effects were reported in earlier double-blind, placebo-controlled, [cross-over trials](../glossary#cross-over-trial) that administered 1,000 mg of calcium daily [(105, 106)](#reference105). Recent small randomized controlled trials also reported that supplemental calcium (400-500 mg/day) for three weeks to three months reduced severity and/or frequency of symptoms in women with mild-to-moderate PMS [(107-110)](#reference107). Currently available data indicate that daily calcium intakes from food and/or supplements may have therapeutic benefits in women diagnosed with PMS or PMDD [(111, 112)](#reference111). The relationship between calcium intake and blood pressure has been investigated extensively over the past decades. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 23 large [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) conducted in different populations worldwide found a reduction in [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) of 0.34 millimeters of mercury ( [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg)) per 100 mg of calcium consumed daily and a reduction in [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) of 0.15 mm Hg per 100 mg calcium [(113)](#reference113). In the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) study, 549 people were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to one of three diets for eight weeks: (1) a control diet that was low in fruit, vegetables, and dairy products; (2) a diet rich in fruit (~5 servings/day) and vegetables (~3 servings/day); and (3) a combination diet rich in fruit and vegetables, as well as low-fat dairy products (~3 servings/day) [(114)](#reference114). The combination diet represented an increase of about 800 mg of calcium/day over the control and fruit/vegetable-rich diets for a total of about 1,200 mg of calcium/day. Overall, the reduction in systolic blood pressure was greater with the combination diet than with the fruit/vegetable diet or the control diet. Among participants diagnosed with [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), the combination diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 11.4 mm Hg and diastolic pressure by 5.5 mm Hg more than the control diet, while the reduction for the fruit/vegetable diet was 7.2 mm Hg for systolic and 2.8 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure compared to the control diet [(115)](#reference115). This research suggested that calcium intake at the recommended level (1,000-1,200 mg/day) may be helpful in preventing and treating moderate hypertension [(116)](#reference116). Yet, two large [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analyses of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the effect of calcium supplementation on blood pressure compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in either [normotensive](../glossary#normotensive) or hypertensive individuals [(117, 118)](#reference117). Neither of the analyses reported any significant effect of supplemental calcium on blood pressure in normotensive subjects. A small but significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, but not in diastolic blood pressure, was reported in participants with hypertension. Of note, calcium supplementation in these randomized controlled trials ranged from 400 to 2,200 mg/day, with 1,000 to 1,500 mg/day being the more common dosages. A more recent meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled studies in 485 individuals with elevated blood pressure found a significant reduction of 2.5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure but no change in diastolic blood pressure with calcium supplementation [(119)](#reference119). The modest effect of calcium on blood pressure needs to be confirmed in larger, high-quality, well-controlled trials before any recommendation is made regarding the management of hypertension. Finally, a review of the literature on the effect of high-calcium intake (dietary and supplemental) in postmenopausal women found either no reduction or mild and transient reductions in blood pressure [(120)](#reference120). More information about the DASH diet is available from the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash/). Data analysis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 found inadequate calcium intakes (defined as intakes below the Estimated Average Requirement [ [EAR](../glossary#EAR)]) in 37.7% of non-supplemented adults (ages, 19 years) and 19.6% of adults taking multivitamin/mineral supplements [(121)](#reference121). Dairy foods provide 75% of the calcium in the American diet. However, it is typically during the most critical period for peak bone mass development that adolescents tend to replace milk with soft drinks [(122)](#reference122). Dairy products represent rich and absorbable sources of calcium, but certain vegetables and grains also provide calcium. However, the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the calcium must be taken into consideration. The calcium content in calcium-rich plants in the kale family (broccoli, bok choy, cabbage, mustard, and turnip greens) is as bioavailable as that in milk; however, other plant-based foods contain components that inhibit the absorption of calcium. Oxalic acid, also known as oxalate, is the most potent inhibitor of calcium absorption and is found at high concentrations in spinach and rhubarb and somewhat lower concentrations in sweet potatoes and dried beans. Phytic acid (phytate) is a less potent inhibitor of calcium absorption than oxalate. Yeast possess an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) (phytase) that breaks down phytate in grains during [fermentation](../glossary#fermentation), lowering the phytate content of breads and other fermented foods. Only concentrated sources of phytate, such as wheat bran or dried beans, substantially reduce calcium absorption [(123)](#reference123). Additional dietary constituents may affect calcium absorption (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). Table 2 lists a number of calcium-rich foods, along with their calcium content. For more information on the nutrient content of foods, search [USDA's FoodData Most experts recommend obtaining as much calcium as possible from food because calcium in food is accompanied by other important nutrients that assist the body in utilizing calcium. However, calcium [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may be necessary for those who have difficulty consuming enough calcium from food [(124)](#reference124). No multivitamin/mineral tablet contains 100% of the recommended daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for calcium because it is too bulky, and the resulting pill would be too large to swallow. The \"Supplement Facts\" label, required on all supplements marketed in the US, lists the calcium content of the supplement as elemental calcium. Calcium preparations used as supplements include calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, calcium citrate malate, calcium lactate, and calcium gluconate. To determine which calcium preparation is in your supplement, you may have to look at the ingredient list. Calcium carbonate is generally the most economical calcium supplement. To maximize absorption, take no more than 500 mg of elemental calcium at one time. Most calcium supplements should be taken with meals, although calcium citrate and calcium citrate malate can be taken anytime. Calcium citrate is the preferred calcium formulation for individuals who lack stomach acids ( [achlorhydria](../glossary#achlorhydria)) or those treated with drugs that limit stomach acid production (H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors) (reviewed in [125](#reference125)). Several decades ago, concern was raised regarding lead concentrations in calcium supplements obtained from natural sources (oyster shell, bone meal, dolomite) [(126)](#reference126). In 1993, investigators found measurable quantities of lead in most of the 70 different preparations they tested [(127)](#reference127). Since then, manufacturers have reduced the amount of lead in calcium supplements to less than 0.5 micrograms (mg)/1,000 mg of elemental calcium [(128)](#reference128). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed provisional total tolerable intake levels (PTTI) for lead for specific age and sex groups [(129)](#reference129). Because lead is so widespread and long lasting, no one can guarantee entirely lead-free food or supplements. A study found measurable lead in 8 out of 21 supplements, in amounts averaging 1 to 2 mg/1,000 mg of elemental calcium, which is below the tolerable limit of 7.5 mg/1,000 mg of elemental calcium [(130)](#reference130). A more recent survey of 324 multivitamin/mineral supplements labeled for use in children or women found that most supplements would result in lead exposure ranging from 1%-4% of the PTTI [(131)](#reference131). Calcium inhibits intestinal absorption of lead, and adequate calcium intake is protective against lead toxicity, so trace amounts of lead in calcium supplementation may pose less of a [risk](../glossary#risk) of excessive lead exposure than inadequate calcium consumption. While most calcium sources today are relatively safe, look for supplements approved or certified by independent testing (e.g., [US Pharmacopeia](http://www.usp.org/), [ConsumerLab.com](https://www.consumerlab.com/)) [(125)](#reference125), follow label instructions, and avoid large doses of supplemental calcium (1,500 mg/day). [Malignancy](../glossary#malignant) and primary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism) are the most common causes of elevated calcium concentrations in the blood (hypercalcemia) [(132)](#reference132). Hypercalcemia has not been associated with the over consumption of calcium occurring naturally in food. Hypercalcemia has been initially reported with the consumption of large quantities of calcium [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in combination with antacids, particularly in the days when [peptic ulcers](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease) were treated with large quantities of milk, calcium carbonate (antacid), and sodium bicarbonate (absorbable alkali). This condition is termed calcium-alkali syndrome (formerly known as milk-alkali syndrome) and has been associated with calcium supplement levels from 1.5 to 16.5 g/day for 2 days to 30 years. Since the treatment for peptic ulcers has evolved and because of the widespread use of over-the-counter calcium supplements, the demographic of this syndrome has changed in that those at greater [risk](../glossary#risk) are now postmenopausal women, pregnant women, transplant recipients, patients with bulimia, and patients on [dialysis](../glossary#dialysis), rather than men with peptic ulcers (reviewed in [133](#reference133)). Supplementation with calcium (0.6 g/day-2 g/day for two to five years) has been associated with a higher risk of adverse gastrointestinal events like constipation, cramping, bloating, pain, diarrhea [(134)](#reference134). Mild hypercalcemia may be without symptoms or may result in loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, fatigue, frequent urination (polyuria), and [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) [(132)](#reference132). More severe hypercalcemia may result in confusion, delirium, coma, and if not treated, death [(1)](#references). In 2011, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine updated the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for calcium [(9)](#reference9). The UL is listed in the risk of forming [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones) is increased in individuals with abnormally elevated urinary calcium (hypercalciuria), this condition is not usually related to calcium intake, but rather to increased absorption of calcium in the intestine or increased [excretion](../glossary#excretion) by the kidneys [(9)](#reference9). Overall, increased dietary calcium intake has been associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones (see [Kidney stones](#kidney-stones-prevention)). Concerns have also been raised regarding the risks of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and vascular disease with high intakes of calcium. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide [(135)](#reference135). Several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have raised concern that high-dairy associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) The analysis of a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (2,268 men followed for nearly 25 years) conducted in Iceland, a country with a high incidence of prostate cancer, found a positive association between the consumption of milk (at least once daily) during adolescence and developing prostate cancer later in life [(139)](#reference139). Another large prospective cohort study in the US followed 21,660 male physicians for 28 years and found that men with daily skim or low-fat milk intake of at least 237 mL (8 oz) had a higher risk of developing prostate cancer compared to occasional consumers [(140)](#reference140). The risk of low-grade, early-stage prostate cancer was associated with higher intake of skim milk, and the risk of developing fatal prostate cancer was linked to the regular consumption of whole milk [(140)](#reference140). In a cohort of 3,918 male health professionals diagnosed with prostate cancer, 229 men died of prostate cancer and 69 developed [metastasized](../glossary#metastasis) prostate cancer during a median follow-up of 7.6 years [(141)](#reference141). The risk of prostate cancer death was found to be increased in men with high (>4 servings/week) versus low (3 servings/month) intakes of whole milk. Yet, no increase in risk of prostate cancer-related mortality was associated with consumption of skim and low-fat milk, total milk, low-fat dairy products, full-fat dairy products, or total dairy products [(141)](#reference141). A recent meta-analysis of 32 prospective cohort studies found high versus low intakes of total dairy product (15 studies), total milk (15 studies), whole milk (6 studies), low-fat milk (5 studies), cheese (11 studies), and dairy calcium (7 studies) to be associated with modest, yet significant, increases in the risk of developing prostate cancer [(142)](#reference142). However, there was no increase in prostate cancer risk with nondairy calcium (4 studies) and calcium from supplements (8 studies). Moreover, high dairy intakes were not linked to fatal prostate cancer [(142)](#reference142). There is some evidence to suggest that milk consumption may result in higher circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a [protein](../glossary#protein) known to regulate cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) [(143)](#reference143). Circulating IGF-I concentrations have been positively correlated to the risk of developing prostate cancer in a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) [(144)](#reference144). Milk-borne IGF-I, as well as dairy proteins and calcium, may contribute to increasing circulating IGF-I in milk consumers [(143)](#reference143). In the large EPIC study, which examined the consumption of dairy products in relation to cancer in 142,520 men, the risk of prostate cancer was found to be significantly higher in those in the top versusbottom [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of both protein and calcium intakes from dairy foods [(145)](#reference145). Another mechanism underlying the potential relationship between calcium intake and prostate cancer proposed that high levels of dietary calcium may lower circulating concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D), thereby suppressing vitamin D-mediated cell differentiation [(146)](#reference146). However, studies to date have provided little evidence to suggest that vitamin D status can modify the association between dairy calcium and risk of prostate cancer development and progression [(147-149)](#reference147). In a multicenter, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial, 672 healthy men (mean age of 61.8 years) were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to daily calcium supplementation (1,200 mg) for four years. While no increase in the risk for prostate cancer has been reported during a 10.3-year follow-up, calcium supplementation resulted in a significant risk reduction in the period spanning from two years after treatment started to two years after treatment ended [(150)](#reference150). In a review of the literature published in 2009, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality indicated that not all [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) found an association between calcium intake and prostate cancer [(151)](#reference151). The review reported that 6 out of 11 observational studies failed to find statistically significant positive associations between prostate cancer and calcium intake. Yet, in five studies, daily intakes of 921 to 2,000 mg of calcium were found to be associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer when compared to intakes ranging from 455 to 1,000 mg/day [(151)](#reference151). Inconsistencies among studies suggest complex interactions between the risk factors for prostate cancer, as well as reflect the difficulties of assessing the effect of calcium intake in free-living individuals. For example, the fact that individuals with higher dairy and/or calcium intakes were found to be more likely to be engaged in healthy lifestyles or more likely to seek medical attention can mitigate the statistical significance of an association with prostate cancer risk [(152)](#reference152). Until the relationship between calcium and prostate cancer is clarified, it is reasonable for men to consume a total of 1,000 to 1,200 mg/day of calcium (diet and supplements combined), which is recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (see [RDA](#RDA)) [(9)](#reference9). Several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) and [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have raised concerns regarding the potential adverse effects of calcium [supplements](../glossary#supplement) on [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) [risk](../glossary#risk). The analysis of data from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that users of calcium supplements amongst 10,555 Finnish women (ages 52-62 years) had a 14% greater risk of developing [coronary artery disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) compared to non-supplement users during a mean follow-up of 6.75 years [(153)](#reference153). The prospective study of 23,980 participants (35-64 years old) of the Heidelberg cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort (EPIC-Heidelberg) observed that supplemental calcium intake was positively associated with the risk of [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (heart attack) but not with the risk of [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) or [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD)-related mortality after a mean follow-up of 11 years [(154)](#reference154). Yet, the use of calcium supplements (400 mg/day vs. 0 mg/day) was associated with an increased risk of CVD-related mortality in 219,059 men, but not in 169,170 women, included in the National Institute of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health study and followed for a mean period of 12 years. CVD mortality in men was also found to be significantly higher with total (dietary plus supplemental) calcium intakes of 1,500 mg/day and above [(155)](#reference155). In addition, the secondary analyses of two randomized placebo-controlled trials initially designed to assess the effect of calcium on bone health outcomes also suggested an increased risk of CVD in participants daily supplemented with 1,000 mg of calcium for five to seven years [(156, 157)](#reference156). In the Auckland Calcium Study of 1,471 healthy postmenopausal women (ages 55 years), calcium supplementation resulted in increased risks of myocardial infarction and of a composite cardiovascular endpoint, including myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death [(156)](#reference156). The analysis of data from 36,282 healthy postmenopausal women [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive a combination of calcium (1,000 mg/day) and [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) (400 IU/day) or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in the Women's Health Initiative/Calcium-Vitamin D supplementation study (WHI/CaD study) initially reported no adverse effect on any cardiovascular endpoints with calcium (and vitamin D) compared to placebo [(158)](#reference158). A re-analysis was performed with data from 16,718 women who did not take personal calcium supplements (outside protocol) during the five-year study [(157)](#reference157). Although criticized on the approach taken [(134](#reference134), [159)](#reference159), the investigators estimated that women supplemented with calcium and vitamin D had a 16% increased risk of clinical myocardial infarction or stroke and a 21% increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to those who received a placebo [(157)](#reference157). However, in another randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial \u2014 the Calcium Intake Fracture Outcome (CAIFOS) study \u2014 in elderly women (median age, 75.1 years), the supplementation of 1,200 mg/day of calcium for five years was not found to increase the risk of vascular disease or related mortality [(160)](#reference160). The WHI/CaD data re-analysis also failed to show an increased risk of mortality due to myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease with calcium therapy [(156)](#reference156). Also, after an additional follow-up of 4.5 years at the end of the treatment period in the CAIFOS trial, the investigators reported fewer cases of heart failure-related deaths with supplemental calcium compared to placebo [(160)](#reference160). In another randomized, placebo-controlled trial of calcium and/or vitamin D3 (RECORD trial), the evaluation of the effect of 1,000 mg/day of calcium (alone or with 800 IU/day of vitamin D) reported no significant increase in the rate of mortality due to vascular disease in 5,292 participants ages 70 years and older [(161)](#reference161). A recent [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) evaluated the association between calcium intakes and cardiovascular mortality in 18,714 adults with no history of heart disease. No evidence of an association was observed between dietary calcium intake, supplemental calcium intake, or total calcium intake and cardiovascular mortality in either men or women [(162)](#reference162). A few prospective studies have reported positive correlations between high calcium concentrations in the blood and increased rates of cardiovascular events [(163, 164)](#reference163). Because supplemental calcium may have a greater effect than dietary calcium on circulating calcium concentrations (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)), it has been speculated that the use of calcium supplements might promote vascular [calcification](../glossary#calcification) \u2014 a surrogate marker of the burden of atherosclerosis and a major risk factor for cardiovascular events \u2014 by raising calcium [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations. In 1,471 older women from the Auckland Calcium Study and 323 healthy older men from another randomized, placebo-controlled trial of daily calcium supplementation (600 mg or 1,200 mg) for two years, serum calcium concentrations were found to be positively correlated with abdominal aortic calcification or coronary artery calcification [(165)](#reference165). However, there was no effect of calcium supplementation on measures of vascular calcification scores in men or women. Data from 1,201 participants of the Framingham Offspring study were also used to assess the relationship between calcium intake and vascular calcification. Again, no association was found between coronary calcium scores and total, dietary, or supplemental calcium intake in men or women [(166)](#reference166). Nonetheless, in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a US multicenter prospective study in 6,814 participants followed for a mean 10 years, the greatest risk of developing coronary artery calcification was found in supplement users with the lowest total calcium intake (~306 mg/day of dietary calcium and ~91 mg/day of supplemental calcium), when compared to supplement users with higher total calcium intakes and nonusers [(167)](#reference167). Finally, an assessment of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) lesions in the [carotid artery](../glossary#carotid-arteries) wall of 1,103 participants in the CAIFOS trial was also conducted after three years of supplementation [(168)](#reference168). When compared with placebo, calcium supplementation showed no effect on carotid artery atherosclerosis (but not CIMT) was significantly reduced in women in the highest versus lowest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of total (diet and supplements) calcium intakes (1,795 mg/day vs. <1,010 mg/day) [(168)](#reference168). The most recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 randomized clinical trials, including a total of 63,563 postmenopausal women, found no evidence of an increased risk for coronary artery disease and all-cause mortality with calcium (500 mg/day) supplementation for at least one year [(169)](#reference169). Because these clinical trial data are limited to analyses of secondary endpoints, meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution. There is a need for studies designed to examine the effect of calcium supplements on CVD risk as a primary outcome before definite conclusions can be drawn. Based on an updated review of the literature that included four randomized controlled trials, one nested case-control study, and 26 prospective cohort studies [(170)](#reference170), the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC) concluded that the use of supplemental calcium for generally healthy individuals was safe from a cardiovascular health standpoint when total calcium intakes did not exceed the [UL](../glossary#UL) [(171)](#reference171). NOF and ASPC support the use of calcium supplements to correct shortfalls in dietary calcium intake and meet current recommendations [(171)](#reference171). Taking calcium [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in combination with thiazide [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing hypercalcemia due to increased reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. High doses of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) calcium could increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms in people taking digoxin (Lanoxin) for [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) [(172)](#reference172). Calcium, when provided [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous), may decrease the efficacy of calcium channel blockers [(173)](#reference173). However, dietary and oral supplemental calcium do not appear to affect the action of calcium channel blockers [(174)](#reference174). Calcium may decrease the absorption of tetracycline, quinolone class antibiotics, bisphosphonates, sotalol (a -blocker), and levothyroxine; therefore, it is advisable to separate doses of these medications and calcium-rich food or supplements by two hours before calcium or four-to-six hours after calcium [(175)](#reference175). Supplemental calcium can decrease the concentration of dolutegravir (Tivicay), elvitegravir (Vitekta), and raltegravir (Isentress), three antiretroviral medications, in blood such that patients are advised to take them two hours before or after calcium supplements [(175)](#reference175). Intravenous calcium should not be administrated within 48 hours following intravenous ceftriaxone (rocephine), a cephalosporin antibiotic, since a ceftriaxone-calcium salt precipitate can form in the lungs and kidneys and be a cause of death [(175)](#reference175). Use of H2 blockers (e.g., cimetidine) and proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) may decrease the absorption of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate (reviewed in [176, 177](#reference176)), whereas lithium may increase the risk of hypercalcemia in patients [(175)](#reference175). The [topical](../glossary#topical) use of calcipotriene, a vitamin D analog, in the treatment of [psoriasis](../glossary#psoriasis) places patients at risk of hypercalcemia if they take calcium supplements. The presence of calcium decreases [iron](iron) absorption from nonheme sources (i.e., most [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and food sources other than meat). However, calcium supplementation up to 12 weeks has not been found to change iron nutritional status, probably due to a compensatory increase in iron absorption [(1)](#references). Individuals taking iron supplements should take them two hours apart from calcium-rich food or supplements to maximize iron absorption. Although high calcium intakes have not been associated with reduced zinc absorption or zinc nutritional status, an early study in 10 men and women found that 600 mg of calcium consumed with a meal halved the absorption of zinc from that meal (see the article on [Zinc](zinc#calcium-interaction)) [(178)](#reference178). Supplemental calcium (500 mg calcium carbonate) has been found to prevent the absorption of lycopene (a nonprovitamin A carotenoid) from tomato paste in 10 healthy adults randomized into a [cross-over study](../glossary#cross-over-trial) [(179)](#reference179). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) set by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Following these recommendations should provide adequate calcium to promote skeletal health and may also decrease the risks of some chronic diseases. To promote the attainment of maximal peak bone mass, children and adolescents should consume a total (diet plus [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) of 1,300 mg/day of calcium. After adult height has been reached, the skeleton continues to accumulate bone until the third decade of life when peak bone mass is attained. To promote the attainment of maximal peak bone mass and to minimize bone loss later in life, adult women (50 years of age and younger) and adult men (70 years of age and younger) should consume a total (diet plus supplements) of 1,000 mg/day of calcium. To minimize bone loss, postmenopausal women should consume a total (diet plus supplements) of 1,200 mg/day of calcium. Taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement containing at least 10 g (400 IU)/day of vitamin D will help to ensure adequate calcium absorption (see the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D)). To minimize bone loss, older men should consume a total (diet plus supplements) of 1,200 mg/day of calcium. Taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement containing at least 10 g (400 IU)/day of vitamin D will help to ensure adequate calcium absorption (see the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D)). Pregnant and breast-feeding adolescents (<19 years) should consume a total of 1,300 mg/day of calcium, while pregnant and breast-feeding adults (19 years) should consume a total of 1,000 mg/day of calcium.

The most stable ] [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) state of chromium in biological systems is trivalent chromium (Cr3+), which forms relatively inert complexes with [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) [(1)](#references). The essentiality of trivalent chromium is questioned, and its proposed function in the body remains poorly understood. In fact, in 2014 the European Food Safety Authority concluded that a dietary requirement \u2014 or even an [Adequate Intake](../glossary#AI) \u2014 cannot be set for trivalent chromium as no conclusive evidence exists that chromium is essential at any dietary intake [(2)](#reference2). Trivalent chromium appears to have health effects only at [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) (reviewed in [3](#reference3)), and a dietary deficiency of the mineral has not been observed. Another common and stable form of chromium in the environment is hexavalent chromium (Cr6+). Hexavalent chromium is derived from trivalent chromium by heating at [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline) [pH](../glossary#pH) and is used as a source of chromium for industrial purposes. Hexavalent chromium is highly toxic and is classified as a human [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen) when inhaled [(4)](#reference4). In the [acidic](../glossary#acidic) environment of the stomach, hexavalent chromium can be readily reduced to trivalent chromium by reducing substances present in food, which limits the ingestion of hexavalent chromium [(5-7)](#reference5). Trivalent chromium has been proposed to be the [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for a biologically active molecule that could enhance the effects of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) on target tissues. Insulin is secreted by specialized cells in the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) in response to increased blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentration, such as after a meal. Insulin binds to insulin [receptors](../glossary#receptor) on the surface of cells, activating the receptors and stimulating glucose uptake by cells. Through its interaction with insulin receptors, insulin provides cells with glucose for energy and helps maintain blood glucose within a narrow range of concentrations. In addition to its effects on [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) (glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), insulin also influences the metabolism of fat and [protein](../glossary#protein) [(8)](#reference8). Together, a decreased response to insulin or decreased [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitivity) in peripheral tissues ( [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose), muscle, and liver) and a progressive defect in insulin secretion may result in [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), frequently leading to overt type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The body initially increases the secretion of insulin by specialized pancreatic cells to overcome the decrease in insulin sensitivity. However, the pancreas eventually fails to produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(9)](#reference9). The precise composition and structure of the biologically active form of chromium is not known. One model postulates that trivalent chromium might be the [cofactor](#cofactor) of a low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance known as LMWCr or chromodulin [(10)](#reference10). Chromodulin has been shown to play a role in the transport of chromium from the tissues to the bloodstream for ultimate elimination in the urine [(11)](#reference11). When chromium is consumed at high levels, such as from dietary supplements, levels of chromodulin in tissues rise. At these high levels, chromodulin is proposed to enhance the cascade of signaling events induced by the binding of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) to extracellular -subunit of the insulin receptor (IR) [(12)](#reference12). Upon insulin binding, the tyrosine kinase domain of the intracellular -subunit of the IR becomes activated and causes the [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of tyrosine residues in the -subunit itself. Subsequently, IR activation triggers a series of rapid phosphorylation reactions that activate many downstream effectors, eventually resulting in an increase in glucose uptake and storage [(10)](#reference10). While this model is supported by [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) studies, this mode of action for chromodulin has not been confirmed to date by [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) studies. Some, but not all, studies conducted in cell-based and animal models of [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) and [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) have found that chromium inhibits the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) and other negative regulators of insulin signaling, suggesting that chromium might improve insulin sensitivity under insulin-resistant conditions (reviewed in [10](#reference10)). A study in diabetic mice also suggested that chromium may reduce insulin clearance and enhance insulin signaling by inhibiting the [proteolysis](../glossary#proteolysis) (degradation) of insulin and some downstream effectors [(13)](#reference13). Additional mechanisms that may underlie the effect of chromium on insulin sensitivity, such as the reduction of markers of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) known to contribute to insulin resistance, are under investigation (reviewed in [10](#reference10), [14](#reference14)). Chromium competes for one of the binding sites on the iron transport [protein](../glossary#protein), transferrin. However, supplementation of older men with 925 g/day of chromium for 12 weeks did not significantly affect measures of iron nutritional [status](../glossary#status) [(15)](#reference15). A study of younger men found an insignificant decrease in transferrin saturation with iron after supplementation of 200 g/day of chromium for eight weeks, but no long-term studies have addressed this issue [(16)](#reference16). In a 12-week, [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), supplementation with chromium picolinate (200 g/day) did not affect iron nutritional status in premenopausal women when compared to picolinic acid or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(17)](#reference17). Iron overload in [hereditary hemochromatosis](../glossary#hereditary-hemochromatosis) may interfere with chromium transport by competing for transferrin binding. It has been [hypothesized](../glossary#hypothesis) that decreased chromium transport might contribute to the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis [(5)](#reference5). Chromium uptake is enhanced in animals when given at the same time as [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) [(7)](#reference7). In a study of three women, administration of 100 mg of vitamin C together with 1 mg of chromium resulted in higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) levels of chromium than 1 mg of chromium without vitamin C [(5)](#reference5). Compared to diets rich in complex [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) (e.g., whole grains), diets high in simple sugars (e.g., sucrose) result in increased urinary chromium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) in adults. This effect may be related to increased [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion in response to the consumption of simple sugars compared to complex carbohydrates [(5)](#reference5). Dietary chromium deficiency has not been observed in humans. Potential cases of chromium deficiency were thought to have been observed in a few patients on long-term [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) feeding ( [parenteral nutrition](../glossary#parenteral-nutrition)) who did not receive [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) chromium in their intravenous solutions. The subjects developed abnormal [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization and increased [insulin](../glossary#insulin) requirements that responded to chromium supplementation [(18)](#reference18). However, because intravenous solutions provide chromium at doses well above dietary levels, it has been suggested that chromium might produce biological effects only at [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) [(3](#reference3), [14)](#reference14). However, the differences in symptoms among subjects, the range of doses of chromium utilized over varying windows of time, and the different reported outcomes are now realized to make interpretation of these results difficult, even in terms of any potential pharmacological effects from the chromium supplementation. Because chromium appeared to enhance the action of insulin and chromium deficiency has been proposed to result in impaired glucose tolerance, chromium insufficiency has been [hypothesized](../glossary#hypothesis) to be a contributing factor to the development of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(5](#reference5), [19)](#reference19). However, evidence for this is ambiguous at best. Urinary chromium loss was reportedly increased by endurance exercise in male runners, suggesting that chromium needs may be greater in individuals who exercise regularly [(20)](#reference20). In one study, weightlifting (resistive exercise) was found to increase urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of chromium in older men. However, chromium absorption also increased, leading to little or no net loss of chromium as a result of resistive exercise [(21)](#reference21). The absence of animal models for chromium deficiency makes it difficult to study possible biochemical, physiological, and functional abnormalities associated with inadequate intakes of chromium (if chromium is nutritionally essential) [(2)](#reference2). Because there was not enough information to set an estimated average requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)), the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) established an adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) based on the chromium content younger||-||44| and older||-||45| The case of trivalent chromium essentiality has been questioned in both animals and humans in the last decades, and in 2014 the European Food Safety Authority's Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies \u2014 which provides dietary guidelines for the EU community \u2014 concluded that requirements for chromium could not be established [(2)](#reference2). The FNB, which sets dietary intake recommendations for the United States and Canada, is not currently reconsidering the AI level for chromium [(22)](#reference22). Early controlled studies in subjects with [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) reported that chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) improved some measure of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization or had beneficial effects on blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles [(23)](#reference23). Impaired glucose tolerance refers to a prediabetic state and is currently defined by the presence of impaired fasting glucose (fasting [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose concentration of 100-125 mg/dL) and impaired glucose tolerance status (plasma glucose concentration of 140-199 mg/dL during a two-hour challenge test with a 75-g oral glucose load) [(24)](#reference24). Impaired glucose tolerance is associated with modest increases in risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease), as well as other traditional microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus [(25)](#reference25). Current estimates suggest that up to 70% of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance eventually develop type 2 diabetes [(26)](#reference26). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 56 subjects at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, six months of daily chromium picolinate supplementation (500 g or 1,000 g) had no effect on glucose and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentrations, [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitivity), and blood lipid profiles [(27)](#reference27). Another randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 31 individuals without diabetes reported a great variability in [serum](../glossary#serum) and urinary chromium concentrations in response to a daily supplementation with 1,000 g of chromium picolinate for 16 weeks. Also, in the chromium-supplemented group, participants with higher vs. lower serum chromium concentrations (>3.1 g/L vs. 3.1 g/L) exhibited a decline in insulin sensitivity that could not be explained by expression changes in the [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in insulin signaling [(28)](#reference28). Additionally, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine randomized [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) published between 1992 and 2010 reported that chromium at doses of 200-1,000 g/day for 8-16 weeks had no effect on fasting glucose concentrations in 309 individuals without diabetes [(29)](#reference29). [Impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) are associated with adverse changes in [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Studies examining the effects of chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on lipid profiles have given inconsistent results. While some studies have observed reductions in serum total [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), [LDL](../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol, and [triglyceride](../glossary#triglyceride) levels or increases in [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol levels, others have observed no effect. Such mixed responses of lipid and [lipoprotein](../glossary#lipoprotein) levels to chromium supplementation may reflect differences in chromium nutritional [status](../glossary#status). It is possible that only individuals with insufficient dietary intake of chromium will experience beneficial effects on lipid profiles after chromium supplementation [(6, 7](#reference6), [30)](#reference30). Moreover, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), mostly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome, found chromium supplementation had no effect on either systolic or diastolic blood pressure [(31)](#reference31). Yet, another meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found chromium supplementation decreased circulating levels of two proinflammatory [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) associated with increased cardiovascular risk, hs-CRP and TNF-, but not blood levels of IL-6 [(32)](#reference32). Claims that chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) increases lean body mass and decreases body fat are based on the relationship between chromium and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) action (see [Function](#function)). In addition to regulating [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), insulin is known to affect fat and [protein](../glossary#protein) metabolism [(8)](#reference8). At least 12 [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies have compared the effect of chromium supplementation (172-1,000 g/day of chromium as chromium picolinate) with or without an exercise program on lean body mass and measures of body fat (reviewed in [33](#reference33)). In general, the studies that used the most sensitive and accurate methods of measuring body fat and lean mass ( [dual energy x-ray absorbtiometry](../glossary#DEXA) or DEXA and hydrodensitometry or underwater weighing) did not find a beneficial effect of chromium supplementation on body composition [(6](#reference6), [30)](#reference30). In the US, the claim that chromium picolinate increases lean body mass is not allowed on supplement labels because it is not substantiated by the available research [(34, 35)](#reference34). Controlled studies of chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) have demonstrated little if any beneficial effect on weight or fat loss, and claims of weight loss in humans appear to be exaggerated. In 1996, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled that there was no scientific basis for claims that chromium picolinate could promote weight loss and fat loss in humans [(36)](#reference36). A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 11 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in 866 overweight or obese subjects found a significant 0.50-kilogram (1.10-pound) reduction in body weight with supplemental chromium (most exclusively in the form of chromium picolinate) at doses between 137 g/day and 1,000 g/day for 8 to 24 weeks [(37)](#reference37). However, such a small change did not reach a clinically significant weight loss of 5% of the initial body weight [(38)](#reference38). A 2019 meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials found similar results: chromium supplementation at doses between 20 g/day and 1,000 g/day for 4 to 24 weeks decreased body weight in overweight or obese subjects by only 0.75 kg, a clinically insignificant amount [(39)](#reference39). Some reports have suggested that supplemental chromium may reduce food craving and intake in overweight or obese women [(40, 41)](#reference40). Yet, current available data remain insufficient to support the use of chromium supplements as a weight-loss strategy [(42)](#reference42). In the US, the claim that chromium picolinate promotes weight loss is not allowed on supplement labels because it is unsubstantiated [(34, 35)](#reference34). Despite stating that scientific evidence is severely limited, the US FDA allows a single claim on supplement labels: \"One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain.\" [(35](#reference35), [43)](#reference43). Type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) is characterized [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) (elevated blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentration) and [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance). Because resistance to [insulin](../glossary#insulin) is usually associated with a compensatory rise in insulin secretion, circulating insulin concentrations in people with type 2 diabetes may be higher than in healthy individuals. Yet, the resistance of peripheral tissues (especially liver and skeletal muscle) to insulin also implies that the physiological effects of insulin are reduced. Since cell culture and rodent models of diabetes have implicated chromium in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels, the relationship between chromium nutritional [status](../glossary#status) and type 2 diabetes mellitus has generated considerable scientific interest. Early reports observed that individuals with overt type 2 diabetes for over two years had higher rates of urinary chromium loss than healthy individuals [(44)](#reference44). Small, well-designed studies of chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in individuals with type 2 diabetes showed no improvement in blood glucose control, although they provided some evidence of reduced insulin concentrations and improved blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles [(45)](#reference45). In 1997, the results of a [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial conducted in China indicated that chromium supplementation might be beneficial in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [(46)](#reference46). One hundred and eighty participants were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive either a placebo or chromium supplements in the form of chromium picolinate at either 200 g/day or 1,000 g/day. After four months of treatment, fasting blood glucose concentrations were found to be 15% to 19% lower in those who took 1,000 g/day of chromium compared to those who took the placebo. Yet, blood glucose concentrations in those taking 200 g/day of chromium did not differ significantly from those who took placebo. Chromium picolinate at either 200 g/day or 1,000 g/day was also associated with reduced insulin concentrations compared to placebo. The level of [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) A1c (HbA1c), a measure of glycemic control over the past four months, was also significantly reduced in both chromium-supplemented groups. However, a number of limitations made it difficult to extrapolate the results to the US population [(47)](#reference47). Besides, the study was excluded from [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) due to insufficient data quality [(29](#reference29), [48)](#reference48). In a recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, chromium supplementation (50-1,000 g/day for 4 to 25 weeks) reduced concentrations of fasting [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose (23 trials) and insulin (14 trials), and improved HbA1c values (18 trials) [(49)](#reference49). These effects were not dose dependent [(49)](#reference49). Yet, other meta-analyses in patients with type 2 diabetes did not find significant benefits of chromium supplementation on fasting glucose and insulin [(50)](#reference50) or HbA1C [(51)](#reference51). Moreover, a systematic review on 20 randomized controlled trials found that only a handful of chromium supplementation studies resulted in glycemic changes that are considered clinically meaningful, i.e., consistent with treatment goals of a 7.2-mmol/dL decrease in fasting glucose, a decrease of 0.5% in HbA1c, or reaching 7% HbA1c [(52)](#reference52). Few studies have examined the effects of chromium supplementation on [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), a condition that is estimated to affect 5.8% to 9.2% of pregnant women in the US [(53)](#reference53). The occurrence of gestational diabetes during pregnancy is associated with insufficient [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion and glucose intolerance of variable severity [(54)](#reference54). Peripheral [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) usually increases in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Because elevated maternal blood glucose concentrations can have adverse effects on the developing fetus, women with gestational diabetes are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of pregnancy complications [(55)](#reference55). After delivery, impaired glucose tolerance generally reverts to normal glucose tolerance. However, nearly one-third of women who have had gestational diabetes develop postpartum glucose intolerance (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) [(56, 57)](#reference56). The question also arises as to whether low chromium levels might be an effect rather than a contributing factor in gestational diabetes. An [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) in pregnant women did not find [serum](../glossary#serum) chromium levels to be associated with measures of glucose tolerance or insulin resistance in late pregnancy [(58)](#reference58). However, it is not known whether measures of serum chromium levels truly reflect tissue chromium levels and chromium status during pregnancy. A more recent [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) following 425 pregnant women also failed to find a correlation between serum chromium concentrations and incidence of gestational diabetes [(59)](#reference59). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 90 pregnant women in southern India found that those with gestational diabetes had significantly lower serum chromium concentrations compared to gestational diabetes-free women. Given the above mixed results, it should be noted that different methods were used to measure circulating chromium concentrations in each study. Also, it is possible that nutritional chromium status may vary among ethnically distinct populations so that studies including pregnant women from different ethnic backgrounds and/or geographical areas would give different results. In addition, there is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) chromium on gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes whose diets were supplemented with 4 g of chromium per kilogram of body weight daily as chromium picolinate for eight weeks had decreased fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations compared to those who took a [placebo](../glossary#placebo). Yet, insulin therapy rather than chromium picolinate was required to normalize severely elevated blood glucose levels [(6](#reference6), [60)](#reference60). [Metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) is a combination of medical conditions, including [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia), central obesity, and [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), that places one at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for [cardiovascular type A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 3,648 young US adults for 23 years found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between toenail chromium concentration measured at baseline and risk of developing metabolic syndrome [(61)](#reference61). An inverse association between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) chromium concentration and metabolic syndrome was also observed in a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) in 4,282 Chinese adults [(62)](#reference62). However, low toenail and plasma chromium may be the result of metabolic syndrome, rather than suggesting a cause or contributing factor. Only a few [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined whether chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) might benefit patients with metabolic syndrome. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 65 patients with metabolic syndrome, 300 g/day of supplemental chromium (from chromium-enriched yeast) for 24 weeks had no effect on measured parameters of [glucose](../glossary#glucose), [insulin](../glossary#insulin), and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(63)](#reference63). While large-scale trials would be needed, there is presently no evidence that chromium can help treat metabolic syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common [endocrine](../glossary#endocrine) disorder affecting women of childbearing age, with an estimated worldwide [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of 21% [(64)](#reference64). The disorder has a multifactorial [etiology](../glossary#etiology) and is characterized by menstrual irregularities, polycystic ovaries, and infertility. Similar to metabolic syndrome, women with PCOS often have various metabolic abnormalities, including [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia), [obesity](../glossary#obesity) (especially abdominal obesity), [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), and are at increased 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(65)](#reference65). Several [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have evaluated whether chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) might help treat PCOS, but the results are conflicting. A 2017 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven clinical trials found that chromium picolinate supplementation (of either 200 g/day or 1,000 ug/day) for 8 to 24 weeks decreased [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index) (3 studies), lowered free testosterone concentration (5 studies), and decreased fasting [serum](../glossary#serum) [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentration (5 studies) but had no effect on concentrations of fasting blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) (4 studies), total testosterone (3 studies), luteinizing hormone (3 studies), or follicle-stimulating hormone (2 studies) [(66)](#reference66). However, other recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that chromium supplementation in women with PCOS does not result in significant or clinically meaningful health benefits, including with respect to glucose and insulin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(67-69)](#reference67). The amount of chromium in food is variable and has been measured accurately in relatively few foods. Presently, there is no large database for the chromium content of food. Whole-grain products, high-bran cereals, green beans, broccoli, nuts, and egg yolk are good sources of chromium. Processed meats may also be high in chromium, depending on the processing equipment and method [(70)](#reference70). Foods high in simple sugars, such as [sucrose](../glossary#sucrose) and [fructose](../glossary#fructose), are usually low in chromium and may actually promote chromium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) [(6](#reference6), [71)](#reference71). Estimated average chromium intakes in the US range from 23 g/day-29 g/day for adult women and 39-54 g/day for adult men [(5)](#reference5). The chromium content of some foods is listed in Table 2 and expressed in micrograms (g) [(72)](#reference72). Since chromium content varies significantly between different batches of the same food, the information provided in the table should serve only as a guide to the chromium content of [supplement](../glossary#supplement) in several forms, including chromium chloride, chromium nicotinate, chromium picolinate, and high-chromium yeast. These are available as stand-alone supplements or in combination products, including multivitamin/mineral supplements. Doses typically range from 100 to 300 g of elemental chromium in single-nutrient supplements and from 10 to 180 g in multivitamin/mineral supplements [(73)](#reference73). Much of the research on [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) uses chromium picolinate as the source of chromium, although investigations suggest that its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) may not be greater than that of dietary chromium [(74)](#reference74). Some concerns have been raised over the long-term safety of chromium picolinate supplementation (see [Safety](#safety)). Hexavalent chromium (chromium VI; inhalation causing lung, nasal, and sinus [cancers](../glossary#cancer) [(75)](#reference75). Exposure to hexavalent chromium in dust has been associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer and is known to cause [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the skin ( [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis)). In contrast, there is little evidence that trivalent chromium (chromium III; Cr3+) is toxic to humans. The toxicity from oral intakes is considered to be low because ingested chromium is poorly absorbed, and most absorbed chromium is rapidly [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine [(76)](#reference76). Because no adverse effects have been convincingly associated with excess intake of trivalent chromium from food or [supplements](../glossary#supplement), the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) did not set a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for chromium. Yet, despite limited evidence for adverse effects, the FNB acknowledged the possibility of a negative impact of high oral intakes of supplemental trivalent chromium on health and advised caution [(5)](#reference5). Most of the concerns regarding the long-term safety of trivalent chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) arise from several studies in cell culture, suggesting trivalent chromium, especially in the form of chromium picolinate, may increase [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage [(77-80)](#reference77). A study in 10 women taking 400 g/day of chromium as chromium picolinate found no evidence of increased [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to DNA as measured by [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) to an oxidized DNA base [(81)](#reference81). Many studies have demonstrated the safety of daily doses of up to 1,000 g of chromium for several months [(46](#reference46), [82)](#reference82). However, there have been a few isolated reports of serious adverse reactions to chromium picolinate. Kidney failure was reported five months after a six-week course of 600 g/day of chromium in the form of chromium picolinate [(83)](#reference83), while kidney failure and impaired liver function were reported after the use of 1,200 to 2,400 g/day of chromium in the form of chromium picolinate over a period of four to five months [(84)](#reference84). Additionally, a 24-year old healthy male reportedly developed reversible, acute [renal](../glossary#renal) failure after taking chromium picolinate-containing supplements for two weeks [(85)](#reference85). Individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver disease may be at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of adverse effects and should limit supplemental chromium intake [(5)](#reference5). Little is known about drug interactions with chromium in humans. Large doses of calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids decreased chromium absorption in rats. In contrast, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin and indomethacin, can increase chromium absorption in rats [(7)](#reference7). The lack of any known indicators of chromium nutritional [status](../glossary#status) in humans makes it difficult to determine the level of chromium intake most likely to promote optimum health, if such exists. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) containing 100% of the daily values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of most nutrients may provide 10 to 180 g/day of chromium, which is generally considered safe. Although the requirement for chromium is not known to be higher for older adults, one study found that chromium concentrations in hair, sweat, and urine decreased with age [(86)](#reference86). Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) containing 100% of the daily values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of most nutrients should provide sufficient chromium for older adults. Because [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) are associated with serious health problems, individuals with any of these conditions should seek medical advice if considering the use of high-dose chromium supplements.

In biological systems, copper readily shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms. The [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) properties of copper underlie its important role in [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation)- [reduction](../glossary#reduction) reactions and in [scavenging](../glossary#scavenge) [free radicals](../glossary#free-radicals) [(1)](#references). Although Hippocrates is said to have prescribed copper compounds to treat diseases as early as 400 B.C. [(2)](#reference2), scientists are still uncovering new information regarding the functions of copper in the human body [(3)](#reference3). Copper is critical for the function of several essential [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) known as cuproenzymes, which are integral parts of various metabolic pathways [(4, 5)](#reference4). Physiologic functions of these copper-dependent biochemical pathways in which they function [(6, 7)](#reference6), are outlined below. The copper-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) plays a critical role in cellular energy production in [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) by catalyzing the [reduction](../glossary#reduction) of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), thereby generating an electrical gradient that is required for [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production [(8)](#reference8). Redox-active copper contained within the CCO enzyme complex is required for the [electron](../glossary#electron) transfer reactions that are critical for its function. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase (LOX), is required for the cross-linking of [collagen](../glossary#collagen) and [elastin](../glossary#elastin) fibers, which is essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. LOX function is critical for bone formation and maintenance of connective tissue in the heart and blood vessels [(2)](#reference2). Multi-copper (Fe2+) to the ferric (Fe3+) form, which enables binding to transferrin (the main iron carrier) in the blood, thus allowing iron transport to sites of utilization (e.g., the bone marrow). The MCOs include: (1) [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) (CP), which contains a membrane-bound form of CP (GPI-CP), expressed in brain and other and (3) the membrane-bound ferroxidases hephaestin (HEPH) and zyklopen, [placenta](../glossary#placenta), respectively [(9, 10)](#reference9). CP knockout (Cp-/-) mice accumulate iron but have normal copper [status](../glossary#status) [(11, 12)](#reference11). Similarly, humans with aceruloplasminemia, who lack functional CP, display iron overload in liver, brain, and [retina](../glossary#retina) but have no observable defects in copper homeostasis [(13)](#reference13). Moreover, absorption of dietary iron and iron mobilization from storage sites (e.g., liver) are impaired in copper deficiency, when CP and HEPH activity is reduced, further supporting a role for the MCOs in iron metabolism [(14)](#reference14). Several physiological processes within the brain and nervous system, including [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and formation and maintenance of [myelin](../glossary#myelin), depend upon [catalysis](../glossary#catalyze) mediated by cuproenzymes. Dopamine -hydroxylase, for example, catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine [(15)](#reference15). Also, CCO is required for the biosynthesis of [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid), which are critical structural components of the myelin sheath [(2)](#reference2). The cuproenzyme tyrosinase (TYR) is required for the biosynthesis of [melanin](../glossary#melanin) in melanocytes, which is critical for normal pigmentation of hair, skin, and eyes [(2)](#reference2). Low TYR activity most likely explains the achromotrichia seen in copper-deficient laboratory and agricultural animals, and the depigmentation noted in severely copper-depleted patients with Menkes disease. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) functions as [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) by [catalyzing](../glossary#catalyze) the [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), such as the superoxide anion (O2-) and the hydroxyl radical (OH), to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is subsequently reduced to water by other antioxidant systems [(16)](#reference16). Two forms of SOD contain copper: copper/zinc SOD (SOD1), which is expressed in cells, including red blood cells; and extracellular SOD (EcSOD), which is highly expressed in the lungs and found at lower levels in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [(2)](#reference2). Also, as outlined above, ceruloplasmin has antioxidant properties relating to [iron](iron) metabolism. The ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin may prevent ferrous iron (Fe2+) from participating in harmful free-radical-generating reactions via Fenton chemistry [(16)](#reference16). Copper-related gene expression pathways seem to be mainly regulated at a post- [translation](../glossary#translation) level, in some cases via [protein](../glossary#protein) trafficking-related mechanisms that respond to intracellular copper levels [(17)](#reference17). Cytosolic copper may also influence [mRNA](../glossary#mRNA) expression levels of specific genes, in a dose-dependent manner [(18-20)](#reference18), implicating possible transcriptional regulation. For example, intracellular copper may alter the [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) state of cells and thus induce [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), which can activate [signal transduction](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways that increase the expression of [genes](../glossary#gene) encoding proteins involved in the detoxification of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) [(21)](#reference21). Adequate copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status) is necessary for normal [iron](iron) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and red blood cell production and function. Copper depletion results in an iron deficiency-like [anemia](../glossary#anemia), and iron accumulates in the livers of copper-deficient animals. The development of anemia during copper deficiency may be linked to low CP activity, impaired iron release from stores in the liver, and reduced iron delivery to the erythroid marrow, thus leading to iron-restricted [erythropoiesis](../glossary#erythropoiesis) (see [Iron metabolism](#iron-metabolism)) [(2)](#reference2). However, this may not be the whole story, as was recently suggested by longtime copper researcher, Dr. Joseph R. Prohaska (Univ. of Minnesota, Duluth) [(22)](#reference22). Copper depletion also reduces CP activity in humans, leading to hepatic iron overload and thus increasing [risk](../glossary#risk) for [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) and liver [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) [(14)](#reference14). [serum](../glossary#serum) CP levels and [plasma](../glossary#plasma) ferroxidase activity, and corrected iron metabolism defects in a copper-deficient subject [(23)](#reference23). Moreover, infants fed a formula with a high-iron content absorbed less copper than infants fed a low-iron formulation, suggesting that high iron intakes may interfere with copper absorption in infants [(24)](#reference24). This observation was also confirmed in rats and mice, where high dietary iron caused copper depletion, thus increasing the copper nutritional requirement [(25, 26)](#reference25). Excess intake of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) [zinc](zinc), at doses of 50 mg/day or more for extended periods of time, may result in copper depletion. The mechanism may relate to increased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of metallothionein (MT), an intracellular zinc- and copper-binding protein. MT has a stronger affinity for copper than zinc, so high levels of MT induced by excess zinc may trap copper within [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) thus limiting its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). This postulate, however, was called into question by studies done in MT-deficient mice, in which high enteral zinc still decreased copper absorption, suggesting that high zinc may block a copper transporter [(27)](#reference27). Conversely, elevated copper intakes have not been found to affect zinc nutritional [status](../glossary#status) [(2](#reference2), [24)](#reference24). Moreover, zinc supplementation at 10 mg/day for eight weeks restored normal [plasma](../glossary#plasma) copper/zinc ratios in 65 subjects on long-term [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) who initially exhibited low [serum](../glossary#serum) zinc and high copper. Whether improving zinc and copper status of hemodialysis patients can impact clinical outcomes, however, needs to be assessed [(28)](#reference28). Evidence of copper- [fructose](../glossary#fructose) interactions comes mainly from studies using experimental animals. High-fructose diets exacerbated copper deficiency in male rats, but not in pigs whose [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) system is anatomically and functionally more like humans. Also, very high levels of dietary fructose (20% of total calories) did not result in copper depletion in humans, suggesting that fructose intake does not result in copper depletion at levels relevant to normal diets [(2](#reference2), [24)](#reference24). However, high fructose consumption and low copper availability may be risk factors for functional copper deficiency in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [(29)](#reference29). Although [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) have produced copper deficiency in guinea pigs [(30)](#reference30), the effect of vitamin C supplementation on copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status) in humans is less clear. Two small studies in healthy, young adult men indicated that [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) oxidase activity may be impaired by relatively high doses of supplemental vitamin C. In one study, vitamin C intakes of 1,500 mg/day for two months resulted in a significant decline in CP oxidase activity [(31)](#reference31). In the other study, supplements of 605 mg/day of vitamin C for three weeks resulted in decreased CP oxidase activity, although copper absorption did not decline [(32)](#reference32). Neither of these studies found vitamin C supplementation to adversely affect copper nutritional status. Clinically evident, or frank, dietary copper deficiency is relatively uncommon. [Serum](../glossary#serum) copper and [CP](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) levels may fall to 30% of normal in cases of severe copper deficiency. Hypocupremia is also observed in genetic disorders of copper [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), including Wilson disease (WD) and aceruloplasminemia; however, neither disorder has been linked to low dietary copper intake. One of the most common clinical signs of copper deficiency is an [anemia](../glossary#anemia) that is unresponsive to [iron](iron) therapy but is corrected by copper [supplementation](../glossary#supplement). It was [hypothesized](../glossary#hypothesis) that this anemia could result from defective iron mobilization due to decreased CP activity, yet individuals with inherited aceruloplasminemia do not always develop overt anemia [(33)](#reference33). Moreover, in copper-deficient swine, intestinal iron absorption is impaired but iron distribution among tissues/organs is normal [(34-36)](#reference34). Low serum iron from reduced absorption is an unlikely cause of this anemia since [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) provision of iron did not correct it. An alternative postulate is that copper-deficiency anemia is caused principally by impaired [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) production and red blood cell proliferation, and a shortened [erythrocyte](../glossary#erythrocyte) lifespan. These physiological processes are thus likely to require copper. Copper deficiency may also lead to [neutropenia](../glossary#neutropenia), which can increase susceptibility to infection. Copper depletion studies demonstrated that low copper might affect [erythroid](../glossary#erythroid) and [myeloid](../glossary#myeloid) cell lineages, supporting a role for copper in the regulation of blood cell proliferation and maturation [(37, 38)](#reference37). More research is clearly needed to further define the mechanisms underlying copper deficiency-induced anemia and neutropenia [(4](#reference4), [39)](#reference39). Furthermore, [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) and other abnormalities of bone development have been described in copper-deficient, low-birth-weight infants and young children. Less common features of copper deficiency may include impaired growth, depigmentation, and development of [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) [pathologies](../glossary#pathology) [(2](#reference2), [8)](#reference8). Currently, there is not a sensitive and specific [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) to detect copper inadequacy in humans [(5](#reference5), [40-42)](#reference40). Blood copper [(43)](#reference43) and [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) concentrations are reduced in severe copper deficiency [(3](#reference3), [6)](#reference6). However, both of these parameters are also influenced by pregnancy, [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and infection [(5)](#reference5), thus limiting the usefulness of these assays to estimate body copper [status](../glossary#status). Experimental work has recently identified other copper-related biomarkers, but further experimental validation is required, including clinical testing in humans. Bovine milk is relatively low in copper, and cases of copper deficiency have been reported in infants fed only cow's milk formula [(47)](#reference47). Other individuals at elevated risk for copper deficiency include premature and low-birth-weight infants; individuals with severe burns [(48)](#reference48) or prolonged diarrhea, which accelerate copper losses; infants and children recovering from malnutrition; and individuals and [short bowel syndrome](../glossary#short-bowel-syndrome), possibly due to surgical removal of large portions of the intestine [(48-50)](#reference48). Also, gastric bypass surgery for morbid [obesity](../glossary#obesity) significantly increases the risk for copper depletion [(51-53)](#reference51). Individuals receiving [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) [total parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) lacking copper or those on certain restricted diets may also require [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with copper (and other trace elements) [(2](#reference2), [8)](#reference8). Moreover, copper deficiency in infants with [cholestasis](../glossary#cholestatic-liver-disease) has been linked to long-term parenteral nutrition lacking copper [(54)](#reference54). [Case reports](../glossary#case-report) indicated that [cystic fibrosis](../glossary#cystic-fibrosis) patients may also be at increased risk of copper insufficiency [(55, 56)](#reference55). And finally, excessive [zinc](zinc) intake has been associated with secondary copper deficiency in individuals taking zinc supplements or using zinc-enriched dental creams [(57-59)](#reference57). Copper deficiency is atypical in the general population; however, it was recently suggested that copper deficiency may be more widespread than currently recognized, and that (covert) pathophysiological links exist between low copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status) and [Alzheimer's postmenopausal [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) [(61)](#reference61). Part of the rationale for such an assertion relates to the difficulty in clinically evaluating the copper status of humans, so moderate to even severe copper deficiency is unlikely to be detected in individuals with no notable risk factors [(62)](#reference62). Firmly establishing links between low copper status and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for these, and possibly other, [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) awaits further [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) and clinical testing. Furthermore, a [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) syndrome associated with copper deficiency was recently described in adults [(63)](#reference63). The symptoms included [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) [demyelination](../glossary#demyelination), polyneuropathy, myelopathy, and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the optic nerve. The [etiology](../glossary#etiology) is unknown and risk factors have not been established (see [Individuals at risk of deficiency](#deficiency-risk)). [Case reports](../glossary#case-report) suggested that copper malabsorption underlies this disorder, but [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding the main intestinal copper exporter, ATP7A, were not detected in affected patients (see [Inherited copper deficiency](#inherited-deficiency)) [(64)](#reference64). Oral copper supplementation (2 mg/day) normalized [serum](../glossary#serum) copper and CP concentrations, and stabilized individuals afflicted with the disease and significantly improved their quality of life. Optimal duration and dose of copper administration has not, however, been experimentally evaluated [(63)](#reference63). ATPase copper transporting alpha, or ATP7A, is a dual function Cu1+-transporting ATPase that is expressed in most cell types, except for, notably, [hepatocytes](../glossary#hepatocyte). ATP7A transports copper from the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol) into the trans-Golgi (TGN), where cuproenzymes are [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) within the secretory pathway, and exports copper from cells. [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in ATP7A, which underlie Menkes disease (MD), critically block copper export from [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) and [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells [(65)](#reference65). Impaired absorption of dietary copper results in systemic copper deficiency in MD. Decreased cuproenzyme expression/activity is caused by low intracellular copper, and defective copper transport into the TGN. Copper accumulation in microvascular endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier reduces copper transport into the brain, leading to low brain copper and reduced cuproenzyme activity in [neurons](../glossary#neuron). Other mutations in ATP7A have been linked to a less severe [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) copper deficiency disorder called occipital horn syndrome (OHS). The clinical features of MD include intractable [seizures](../glossary#seizure), connective tissue disorders, subdural [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage), and hair abnormalities (so called \"kinky hair\"). OHS patients exhibit muscular hypotonia and connective tissue abnormalities, including formation of [exostoses](../glossary#exostosis) on occipital bones. [Subcutaneous](../glossary#subcutaneous) injections of copper-histidine improve copper-related metabolic functions in MD and OHS patients. Copper entry into the brain, however, remains limited (reviewed in [66](#reference66)). Furthermore, [gene](../glossary#gene) therapy approaches have been recently validated in a pre-clinical mouse model of MD, with long-term goals of using such treatments in humans with the disease [(67, 68)](#reference67). Recently, another inherited copper-deficiency disorder was described in identical twin male infants, who were [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) for a novel missense variant in the gene encoding copper transporter 1 (CTR1) [(69)](#reference69). This genetic aberration caused a distinctive [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) syndrome of infantile seizures and neurodegeneration, consistent with profound [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) copper deficiency. Disease [pathology](../glossary#pathology) was most likely caused by defective intestinal copper transport which resulted in severe systemic copper deficiency. This outcome is supported by experimental laboratory studies which demonstrated that intestine-specific ablation (deletion) of CTR1 significantly impaired absorption of dietary copper in mice [(70)](#reference70). Patients with Wilson disease (WD) may have increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for copper [toxicosis](../glossary#toxicosis) even at copper intakes in the normal range. WD is an [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorder that is typified by defective copper distribution and storage [(71)](#reference71). The disease is caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the ATP7B [gene](../glossary#gene), which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase that is highly expressed in liver and brain. Dysfunctional ATP7B disrupts copper flux in these organs. A recent review provides a nice summary of this devastating human disease [(72)](#reference72). WD [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) is ~1:30,000 individuals globally [(73)](#reference73), although much higher prevalence rates have been reported. It was suggested that differences in the penetrance of disease-causing genetic variants explain the apparent discrepancy between [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) and genetic prevalence studies of WD [(74)](#reference74). In WD, [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction)-active copper accumulates in liver, brain, and [cornea](../glossary#cornea) due to impaired ATP7B-mediated copper [excretion](../glossary#excretion), which increases [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) leading to eventual tissue and organ damage. Untreated WD patients are likely to develop liver damage, [cancer](../glossary#cancer), and eventual [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) failure, and severe hemolytic crisis. Elevated brain copper content can lead to [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) damage, and copper accumulation in the eye in so-called Kayser-Fleisher rings can result in abnormal eye movements. Blood concentrations of ceruloplasmin are characteristically low in WD patients, since hepatic ATP7B is required for its biosynthesis, and urinary copper losses may be enhanced. Early intervention can prevent development of some of the most severe pathophysiological outcomes. Treatments for WD include [zinc](zinc) supplementation, which attenuates enteral copper with penicillamine or trientine [(75)](#reference75). Additional [pathologies](../glossary#pathology) associated with liver copper loading include Indian childhood [cirrhosis](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#cirrhosis) (ICC) and idiopathic copper [toxicosis](../glossary#toxicosis) (ICT). In ICC, notable liver copper loading and progressive liver failure are observed [(76)](#reference76). In contrast to Wilson disease when ceruloplasmin is low, in ICC, ceruloplasmin is normal or elevated. ICC is most likely caused by inadvertent excess copper ingestion, possibly from the use of copper-lined, food/beverage storage containers in a genetically susceptible individual. It seems likely that the unknown genetic defect in ICC relates to the efficiency of [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of excess copper in the [bile](../glossary#bile), but this has not been definitively established. Also, about one-third of ICC patients have -1-antitrypsin deficiency, which calls into question a primary role for copper in disease outcomes [(77)](#reference77). ICT is another [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) copper overload disorder that predominantly afflicts infants and children. ICT displays [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) inheritance, and an unidentified genetic aberration results in defective copper [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) leading to an increased susceptibility to excess copper. Affected individuals are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for copper-related, hepatic toxicosis due to inadvertent consumption of excess copper. However, the source of extra copper remains unidentified in many ICT patients, perhaps suggesting a more complex disease [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) [(78)](#reference78). A variety of bioindicators were used to establish the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for copper, including [plasma](../glossary#plasma) copper concentration, [serum](../glossary#serum) [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) activity, superoxide dismutase activity in red blood cells, and platelet copper concentration [(24)](#reference24). However, whether these are accurate and sensitive [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status) uncertain [(40)](#reference40). Also, estimates of copper concentrations in various foods and water sources may not be accurate and reliable [(40](#reference40), [62)](#reference62). The RDA for copper reflects the results of [depletion-repletion studies](../glossary#depletion-repletion-study) and is based on the prevention of deficiency (Table 1). For infants up to one year of age, an adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) was established due to the lack of experimental evidence to set a requirement. |Life Stage||Age Range||Males (g/day)||Females (g/day)| |Infants||0-6 deficiency results in [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) in some animal species [(79)](#reference79); however, this [pathology](../glossary#pathology) differs from the [atherosclerotic](../glossary#atherosclerosis) [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) that is [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) humans [(24)](#reference24). Outcomes of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related [clinical studies](../glossary#clinical-trial) in humans are inconsistent, possibly since the copper [status](../glossary#status) of participants is uncertain given the lack of reliable [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of copper nutritional status. Ionic copper is a [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant), and it can [oxidize](../glossary#oxidation) low-density [lipoprotein](../glossary#lipoprotein) ( [LDL](../glossary#LDL)) in the test tube. CP can also stimulate LDL oxidation in the laboratory setting [(80)](#reference80). As such, some researchers have proposed that excess copper could increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) for developing atherosclerosis by promoting the oxidation of LDL in vivo. However, there is scant experimental evidence to support this possibility. Moreover, superoxide dismutase and ceruloplasmin have known [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) properties, leading some experts to propose that copper deficiency, rather than copper excess, increases the risk for cardiomyopathy [(81, 82)](#reference81). Outcomes of [observational](../glossary#observational-study) and [intervention nutritional status to [relative risk](../glossary#relative-risk) for CVD are summarized below. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have linked elevated [serum](../glossary#serum) copper levels to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for developing [CVD](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). For example, a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) examined serum copper levels in more than 4,500 men and women 30 years of age and older in the United States [(83)](#reference83). During the subsequent 16 years, 151 participants died from [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD). After adjusting for other risk factors, those with serum copper levels in the two highest [quartiles](../glossary#quartile) had a significantly greater risk of dying from CHD. [Case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) conducted in Europe also had similar outcomes. For example, a case-cohort study of 2,087 adults in Germany reported an association between higher serum copper concentrations and increased risk of incident CVD, including [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) [(84)](#reference84). Another study in 60 patients with chronic [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) or ischemic heart disease reported that serum copper was a predictor of short-term outcomes [(85)](#reference85). Higher serum copper was also linked to an increased risk of heart failure in a prospective cohort study of 1,866 middle-aged and older men in Finland [(86)](#reference86). Another prospective cohort study in 4,035 middle-aged men in France reported that high serum copper levels were significantly related to a 50% increase in all-cause mortality; however, serum copper was not significantly associated with CVD mortality in this study [(87)](#reference87). Serum copper was also elevated in patients with rheumatic heart disease [(88)](#reference88). In sum, these studies may indicate that high serum copper reflects elevated body copper content, which increases [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and accelerates tissue/organ damage and disease development. Importantly, however, most copper in the serum is contained within CP, up to 90% depending upon the species, with the remaining, smaller proportion of serum copper bound to albumin protein](../glossary#acute-phase-reactant-protein), with levels increasing by up to 50% as a result of trauma or infection and during chronic inflammatory states. Changes in circulating CP are associated with proportional changes in serum copper levels, independent of body copper [status](../glossary#status). Therefore, elevated serum copper in CHD patients may simply reflect increased CP production due to the inflammation that typifies [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis). Collectively, these observations raise concerns about linking elevated serum copper to increased tissue copper content and chronic disease development in humans [(91)](#reference91). In contrast to the observational findings discussed above linking high serum copper levels to heart disease, two autopsy studies found copper levels in cardiac muscle were actually lower in patients who died of CHD than in those who died of other causes [(92)](#reference92). Additionally, the copper content of white blood cells has been positively correlated with the degree of [patency](../glossary#patency) of [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-artery) in CHD patients [(93, 94)](#reference93). Further, patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) had lower concentrations of copper-dependent, extracellular superoxide dismutase than those without a history of MI [(95)](#reference95). Thus, due to the lack of specific, reliable [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of copper nutritional status, it is not clear whether copper is related to cardiovascular disease. It is also important to note that altered copper [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) may be symptomatic of a cardiovascular condition, rather than a factor that primarily influences its development. Studies examining dietary intake of copper are scarce. In a prospective cohort study in Japan, which included 58,646 participants followed for a median of 19 years, dietary copper intake \u2014 measured by a [food frequency questionnaire](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) \u2014 was not associated with CHD mortality [(96)](#reference96). Yet, this study associated higher copper intakes with an increased risk of mortality from stroke and other cardiovascular diseases [(96)](#reference96). Notably, it was suggested that elevated [plasma](../glossary#plasma) copper concentrations could be linked to high circulating [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels in individuals with cardiovascular disease [(97-99)](#reference97). Increased blood homocysteine may precipitate development of arterial wall lesions and increase risk of CVD [(100)](#reference100); however, this matter is currently open to debate [(101)](#reference101). In animal models, copper-homocysteine interactions were linked to impaired [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function [(102, 103)](#reference102). Copper restriction in experimental animals decreased homocysteine levels and reduced incidence of atherogenic lesions [(104, 105)](#reference104), but it is not known whether copper imbalance contributes to a possible [atherogenic](../glossary#atherogenic) effect of homocysteine in humans [(106)](#reference106). Small studies in adults deprived of dietary copper documented adverse changes in blood [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), including increased total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL) cholesterol concentrations and decreased [HDL](../glossary#HDL) cholesterol concentrations [(107)](#reference107), but these outcomes were not confirmed in other studies [(108)](#reference108). For example, in one recent study, copper supplementation of 2 to 3 mg/day for 4 to 8 weeks did not result in clinically significant changes in blood cholesterol levels [(81](#reference81), [109, 110)](#reference109). Additionally, 8 mg/day of copper for six months had no effect on blood cholesterol levels [(111)](#reference111). Interpretation of these outcomes is, however, challenging since the copper [status](../glossary#status) of participants was presumably not well defined. Additional research failed to link increased copper intake to elevated [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress). In a multi-center, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial), copper supplementation of 3 or 6 mg/day for six weeks did not result in increased susceptibility of LDL to oxidation by copper [(112)](#reference112). Moreover, supplementation with 3 or 6 mg/day of copper did not increase [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to red blood cells [(113)](#reference113). Collectively, these studies indicated that copper intakes several times above the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) do not increase oxidative stress, at least as measured by these assays in these populations. Although free copper and [CP](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) can promote [LDL](../glossary#LDL) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) in the laboratory, there is little evidence that high dietary copper increases [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) in the human body. Increased [serum](../glossary#serum) copper levels have been associated with increased [CVD](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [risk](../glossary#risk), as outlined above, but the significance of these findings is unclear due to the complex association among serum copper, CP, and [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) mediators. Clarification of the relationships of copper intake, copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status), CP levels, and CVD risk thus requires further research. Copper is known to play several important roles in the development and maintenance of immune system function, including [innate](../health-disease/immunity#innate-immunity) and [adaptive](../health-disease/immunity#adaptive-immunity) immunity (reviewed in [114](#reference114)). Neutropenia is a clinical sign of copper deficiency in humans. Adverse effects of insufficient copper on immune system function appear most pronounced in infants. For example, infants with Menkes disease, a genetic copper-deficiency disorder, suffer from frequent and severe infections [(115, 116)](#reference115). Moreover, in a study of 11 malnourished infants with evidence of copper deficiency, the ability of white blood cells to engulf [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) increased significantly after one month of copper [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) [(117)](#reference117). Moreover, 11 men on a low-copper diet (0.66 mg/day of copper for 24 days and 0.38 mg/day for another 40 days) showed an impaired [monocyte](../glossary#monocyte) proliferative response in an [ex vivo](../glossary#ex-vivo) immune challenge assay [(118)](#reference118). Mechanistic studies also support a role for copper in the innate immune response to [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) and viral infections (reviewed in [119, 120](#reference119)). Severe copper deficiency thus has adverse effects on immune system function; however, whether marginal copper insufficiency impairs immunity in humans has not been established. Progressive decrease of [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) is commonly observed in the elderly, frequently leading to development of [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia) (pre- [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis)) and osteoporosis. Women are more often affected by osteoporosis than men, (e.g., [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) ratio is 5:1 in non-Hispanic whites) [(121)](#reference121), primarily due to the postmenopausal reduction in the production of [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen), which is essential for maintaining strength of muscle, bone, and connective tissue [(122)](#reference122). Osteoporosis is associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of falls, bone [fracture](../glossary#fracture), and mortality in individuals over 65 years of age [(123)](#reference123). Osteoporosis has been reported in infants with severe copper deficiency [(124, 125)](#reference124), but how copper depletion affects bone and connective tissue health in adults is less certain. One recent investigation documented bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption) (breakdown) in 11 healthy adult males consuming marginal copper for six weeks (0.7 mg/day) [(126)](#reference126). Also, supplementation of 3 to 6 mg/day of copper for six weeks had no effect on biochemical markers of bone resorption or bone formation in two studies of healthy adult men and women [(127, 128)](#reference127). An effect of copper deficiency on bone integrity seems likely, since a copper-dependent enzyme, lysyl oxidase (LOX), is required for the maturation (cross-linking) of [collagen](../glossary#collagen), a key element in the organic matrix of bone. In individuals with marginal copper intake and less efficient copper absorption, such as the elderly, it seems plausible that LOX activity is decreased, possibly increasing risk for bone and connective tissue effects. Collectively, research examining the role of copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status) in age-related osteoporosis is limited. An early study found that [serum](../glossary#serum) copper levels in 46 elderly patients with hip [fractures](../glossary#fracture) were significantly lower than those of age-matched controls [(129)](#reference129). Another study, however, found no differences in serum copper levels among postmenopausal women showed that blood copper concentrations were lower than the normal reference range in postmenopausal women with osteopenia (N=28) and osteoporosis (N=23) [(131)](#reference131). In another cross-sectional study in 728 postmenopausal women, 491 of which had confirmed osteoporosis, lower serum copper concentrations were associated with osteoporosis in the younger women (ages 40-59 years) but not the older women (ages 60-80 years) [(132)](#reference132). Furthermore, in a national survey in the US, including 8,224 adults (compiling data from NHANES 2007-2010, 2013-2014, and 2017-2018), higher daily copper intakes (from diet and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) were associated with higher BMD at the femur and lumbar spine and a lower risk of osteoporosis [(133)](#reference133). Limited studies of copper [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) and bone health outcomes have been undertaken. A small study in [perimenopausal](../glossary#perimenopause) women, who consumed ~1 mg of dietary copper daily, reported decreased loss of [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) from the lumbar spine after copper supplementation of 3 mg/day for two years [(134)](#reference134). Additionally, a two-year, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 59 postmenopausal women found that daily intake of supplemental calcium plus trace minerals, including 2.5 mg of copper, resulted in maintenance of spinal BMD. Supplemental calcium or trace minerals, alone, were not as effective at preventing loss of bone density [(135)](#reference135). Another [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 224 healthy, postmenopausal women ages 51 to 80 years, found daily supplementation with 600 mg of calcium, 2 mg of copper, and 12 mg of zinc for two years decreased whole-body BMD compared to supplemental calcium alone. Another trial showed that BMD was reduced in subjects with dietary copper intakes below the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (0.9 mg/day), but copper supplementation did not prevent the progressive loss of BMD as well as a calcium regimen alone [(136)](#reference136). Finally, several studies have suggested that tooth loss might be related to defects in the maintenance of BMD [(137, 138)](#reference137). When compared with 20 healthy-matched controls, 50 patients (mean age, 47.5 years) with low spinal BMD and advanced tooth wear were found to have significantly lower copper content in tooth enamel. However, despite evidence of bone demineralization, [serum](../glossary#serum) copper levels in this population were similar to those of the healthy group [(139)](#reference139). In sum, additional research is required to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the effects of marginal copper depletion and copper supplementation on bone metabolism and risk for developing age-related osteoporosis. [Cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) deterioration in individuals with [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) (AD) is linked to the presence of - [amyloid plaques](../glossary#amyloid-plaque) and abnormal Tau protein-forming aggregates. The possibility that copper imbalance is involved in the onset of AD is under investigation. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) described higher blood concentrations of copper in AD patients (N=2,929) as compared to healthy subjects (N=3,547), from a total of 46 studies reviewed [(140)](#reference140). Also, 'free' serum copper (i.e., not bound to [CP](../glossary#ceruloplasmin)) was higher in AD patients (N=1,595) than in healthy control subjects (N=2,399), representing 18 total studies. These observations were confirmed in another recent review of published studies [(141)](#reference141). An additional meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies revealed AD patients had lower copper concentrations in various brain regions compared to healthy controls [(142)](#reference142), further exemplifying dysregulation of copper [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) in Alzheimer's disease. Among the many [hypotheses](../glossary#homeostasis) supporting a role for copper in AD onset or progression includes copper involvement in the formation of [senile plaques](../glossary#senile-plaque) through [hypermetallation](../glossary#hypermetallation) of the -amyloid peptides, possibly leading to [zinc](zinc) depletion, enhanced [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and brain damage [(143-145)](#reference143). Recent research has also identified [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in the ATP7B [gene](../glossary#gene) that may be associated with the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing copper imbalance and AD [(140, 142)](#reference140). ATP7B is a copper-transporting ATPase expressed in the liver and brain. Impairment of ATP7B function causes Wilson disease, which is typified by elevated 'free' copper level in blood and copper accumulation in liver and brain. Additional research is required to determine whether genetic variation could influence individual susceptibility to environmental exposure of high copper levels. Copper administered in drinking water was associated with development of enhanced [pathological](../glossary#pathology) features in animal models of AD [(146, 147)](#reference146). One study in a rabbit model reported that combining a high- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) diet and copper (0.12 mg/L in drinking water) impaired [cognition](../glossary#cognition) [(146)](#reference146). A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 3,718 elderly participants in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, followed for 5.5 years, evaluated the impact of fat and copper intakes using food frequency questionnaires on cognitive function. For individuals with high intakes of [saturated](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and [trans fat](../glossary#trans-fat), cognitive decline was greater for those in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of total copper intake compared to the lowest quintile (median intake of 2.75 vs. 0.88 mg copper per day) [(148)](#reference148). Although dysfunctional copper [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) is suggested as a risk factor for AD, it could also be symptomatic of the disease, rather than causative. Moreover, it is still unclear whether copper supplementation or restriction could delay the progression of AD. A small, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 68 individuals with mild AD found that supplementation of 8 mg/day of copper for one year delayed the decrease of the -amyloid peptide A42 in [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid); a decrease in A42 has been linked to cognitive deterioration [(149)](#reference149). This delay, however, was not associated with improved cognitive performance [(150)](#reference150). Relating to the use of [zinc](zinc) supplementation to block copper absorption in Wilson disease, slow-release zinc acetate administration (150 mg/day for six months) in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled study of 60 patients with mild-to-moderate AD resulted in a decrease in serum 'free' copper and stabilization of cognition deficits [(143)](#reference143). A specific role for copper was not, however, determined in these notable outcomes. In summary, additional human studies are needed to clarify the role of copper in AD prevention, development, and progression. [Neurologically](../glossary#neurologic) presenting Wilson disease and inherited aceruloplasminemia are characterized by copper accumulation in the brain and development of neurological symptoms, including dystonia and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment, that resemble [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) (PD) [(151)](#reference151). of copper [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) has been documented in PD [(152)](#reference152). Copper depletion occurs in brain regions with loss of [neurons](../glossary#neuron) in PD patients [(153, 154)](#reference154). Moreover, some studies have documented lower [serum](../glossary#serum) copper and/or [CP](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) concentrations in PD patients compared to healthy controls [(155-157)](#reference155). Dietary copper intake did not, however, relate to the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing PD in two small [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) [(158, 159)](#reference158). As in AD, further research is required to elucidate whether copper imbalance contributes to the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of PD. Similar to findings from animal models [(160)](#reference160), human studies have documented low circulating copper [(161, 162)](#reference161) or low [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) copper content [(161](#reference161), [163, 164)](#reference163) in adults and children nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. An [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between hepatic copper content and liver disease severity has also been observed [(163](#reference163), [165)](#reference165). However, it is not known whether low dietary intake of copper might be a contributor to disease [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) or whether dysregulated copper [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) is only a manifestation of liver disease. Copper is found in a wide variety of foods and is most plentiful in organ meats, shellfish, [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), and seeds. Wheat-bran cereals and whole-grain products are also good sources of copper. According to national surveys (NHANES), the mean dietary intake of copper in the US is 1.1 mg/day for adult women and 1.3 mg/day for adult men [(166)](#reference166), levels that exceed the established [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for copper for adults of 900 \u00b5g/day (see [Table 1](#table-1)). The estimated copper content of some foods that are relatively rich in copper is listed in Table 2. For more information on the nutrient content of of those at risk for copper depletion is challenging since sensitive and specific, copper nutrition-related bioindicators have yet to be identified. Nonetheless, a range of copper [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are available for purchase, including cupric oxide, copper gluconate, copper sulfate, and copper [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) [chelates](../glossary#chelate) [(167)](#reference167). The relative [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of these different chemical forms of copper, however, has not yet been established in humans [(168)](#reference168). Copper supplements may contain a few \u00b5g up to 15 mg of elemental copper, which exceeds the [UL](/glossary#UL) for copper by 1.5 fold [(169)](#reference169). Moreover, copper is typically included in multivitamin/mineral supplements [(169)](#reference169) and added to [fortified](../glossary#fortification) breakfast cereals. Supplementation of adults with 10 mg/day of cupric gluconate for 12 weeks did not cause copper toxicity [(170)](#reference170). Importantly, however, higher copper intakes could be detrimental in some at-risk (unknown) individuals. Copper supplementation of infants should be approached with caution since [homeostatic](../glossary#homeostasis) regulators of copper absorption and [excretion](../glossary#excretion) are not fully developed, thus increasing the potential for copper [toxicosis](../glossary#toxicosis). From a clinical perspective, copper overload most frequently presents in biliary atresia, biliary cirrhosis and in WD patients, and as such, individuals suffering from these conditions should avoid taking supplemental copper. Copper toxicity is rare in the general population. Acute copper poisoning has occurred by storing beverages in copper-containing containers, as well as from contaminated water supplies [(171)](#reference171). Guideline values for copper in drinking water have been set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (1.3 mg/liter) and by the World Health Organization (2 mg/liter) [(172)](#reference172). Symptoms of acute copper toxicity include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; such symptoms help prevent additional ingestion and absorption of copper. More serious signs of acute copper toxicity include severe liver damage, kidney failure, coma, and death. Of more concern from a nutritional standpoint is the possibility of liver damage resulting from long-term exposure to lower doses of copper. In generally healthy individuals, daily doses of up to 10,000 g (10 mg) have not resulted in liver damage. The US Food and Nutrition Board has thus set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) in adults at 10 mg/day of copper from food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement) combined (Table 3) [(24)](#reference24). It should be noted that individuals with genetic disorders affecting copper [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (e.g., Wilson disease, Indian childhood [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis), and idiopathic copper [toxicosis](../glossary#toxicosis)) may be at risk for adverse effects of chronic copper toxicity at significantly lower intake levels. There is some concern that the UL of 10 mg/day might be too high. For example, one study in adult men who consumed 7.8 mg/day of copper for 147 days showed that they loaded excess copper during that time, and some indices of immune function and [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) status suggested that these functions were adversely affected by the high intakes of copper [(173, 174)](#reference173). However, another study did not report any adverse effects in individuals supplemented with 8 mg/day of copper for six should be from food and formula only.| Relatively little is known about the interaction of copper with drugs. Penicillamine is used to bind copper and enhance its elimination in Wilson disease, a genetic disorder resulting in [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) copper overload. Because penicillamine dramatically increases the urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of copper, individuals taking the medication for reasons other than copper overload may have an increased dietary copper requirement. Additionally, antacids may interfere with copper absorption when used in very high amounts [(2)](#reference2). Also, the anti- [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis) drug ethambutol may [chelate](../glossary#chelate) copper in [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) and reduce cytochrome c oxidase activity specifically in optic nerve [axons](../glossary#axon), possibly contributing to optic neuropathy which is a documented side-effect of this drug [(175)](#reference175). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for copper (900 g/day for adults) is sufficient to prevent deficiency, but the lack of clear [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status) in humans makes it difficult to determine the level of copper intake most likely to promote optimum health or prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). A varied diet should provide enough copper for most people. For those who are concerned that their diet may not provide adequate copper, a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) will generally provide at least the RDA for copper. Because aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for copper, our recommendation for older adults is the same as that for adults 50 and younger [(176)](#reference176).

Fluoride is considered a trace [ element](../glossary#element) because only small amounts are present in the body (about 2.6 grams in adults), and because the daily requirement for maintaining dental health is only a few milligrams a day. About 95% of the total body fluoride is found in bones and teeth [(1)](#references). Although its role in the prevention of [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries) (tooth decay) is well established, fluoride is not generally considered an essential [ mineral](../glossary#mineral) element because humans do not require it for growth or to sustain life [(2)](#reference2). However, if one considers the prevention of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) (dental caries) an important criterion in determining essentiality, then fluoride might well be considered an essential trace element [(3)](#reference3). Fluoride is absorbed in the stomach and [ small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine). Once in the bloodstream it rapidly enters mineralized tissue (bones and developing teeth). At usual intake levels, fluoride does not accumulate in soft tissue. The predominant mineral elements in bone are crystals of calcium and phosphate, known as [hydroxyapatite](../glossary#hydroxyapatite) crystals. Fluoride's high chemical reactivity and small radius allow it to either displace the larger hydroxyl (-OH) ion in the hydroxyapatite crystal, forming fluoroapatite, or to increase crystal density by entering spaces within the hydroxyapatite crystal. Fluoroapatite hardens tooth [enamel](../glossary#enamel) and stabilizes bone mineral [(4)](#reference4). Both [calcium](calcium) and [magnesium](magnesium) form [ insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) complexes with fluoride and are capable of significantly decreasing fluoride absorption when present in the same meal. However, the absorption of fluoride in the form of monofluorophosphate (unlike sodium fluoride) is unaffected by calcium. Also, a diet low in chloride (salt) has been found to increase fluoride retention by reducing urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of fluoride [(1)](#references). In humans, the only clear effect of inadequate fluoride intake is an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries) (tooth decay) for individuals of all ages. [Epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) investigations of patterns of water consumption and the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of dental caries across various US regions with different water fluoride concentrations led to the development of a recommended optimum range of fluoride concentration of 0.7-1.2 milligrams/liter (mg/L) or parts per million (ppm); the lower concentration was recommended for warmer climates where water consumption is higher, and the higher concentration was recommended for colder climates. In 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommended that all community water systems adjust the fluoride concentration to 0.7 mg/L, as more recent studies did find a relationship between water intake and outdoor air temperature. This recommendation was made in an effort to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis (see below) and in light of the widespread availability of fluoride from other sources, including fluoride-containing oral-care products [(5)](#reference5). A number of studies conducted prior to the introduction of fluoride-containing toothpastes demonstrated that the prevalence of dental caries was 40% to 60% lower in communities with optimal water fluoride concentrations than in communities with low water fluoride concentrations [(6)](#reference6). The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine updated its recommendations for fluoride intake in 1997. Because data were insufficient to establish a Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)), Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) levels were set based on estimated intakes that have been shown to reduce the occurrence of dental caries most effectively without causing the unwanted side effect of tooth enamel mottling known as dental fluorosis (0.05 mg/kg of body weight) (Table 1; [6](#reference6)). See the section below on [Safety](#safety) for plaque are capable of metabolizing fermentable [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) (sugars) and converting them to organic acids that can dissolve sensitive tooth enamel. If unchecked, the bacteria may penetrate deeper layers of the tooth and progress into the soft pulp tissue at the center. Untreated caries can lead to severe pain, local infection, tooth loss or extraction, nutritional problems, and serious systemic infections in susceptible individuals [(7)](#reference7). Dental caries \u2014 both treated and untreated \u2014 contribute to diminished overall oral health, which, in turn, may affect systemic health. For example, some [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have suggested a link between systemic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) in individuals with periodontal (gum) infection and linked to [rheumatoid arthritis](../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis) [(12, 13)](#reference12). Poor oral health in general may constitute a risk factor for coronary heart disease [(14)](#reference14) and other cardiovascular diseases [(15, 16)](#reference15). Increased fluoride exposure, most commonly through community water fluoridation, has been found to decrease the incidence of [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries) in children and adults [(17, 18)](#reference17). Between 1976 and 1987, clinical studies in several countries demonstrated that the addition of fluoride to community water supplies (0.7-1.2 ppm) reduced caries by 30%-60% in primary (baby) teeth and 15%-35% in permanent teeth [(19)](#reference19). A 2015 review and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of prospective observational studies found a 35% and 26% reduction in number of decayed, missing, and filled primary and permanent teeth with consumption of fluoridated versus non-fluoridated water, respectively [(20)](#reference20). While fluoride's prevention of dental caries is primarily through topical action, fluoride consumed in water appears to have a systemic effect in children before all teeth have erupted \u2014 typically through 12 years of age. Fluoride is incorporated into the developing [enamel](../glossary#enamel) of teeth and increases the resistance to caries. Since the caries preventative effect of fluoride is also [topical](../glossary#topical) (surface) in children after teeth have erupted and in adults, the optimal protection achieved by fluoridated water likely occurs through both systemic exposure before and after tooth eruption and topical exposure after tooth eruption. Research has indicated that the primary action of fluoride occurs [topically](../glossary#topical) after the teeth erupt into the mouth. Ingested fluoride is secreted in the saliva and contributes to topical protection. When [enamel](../glossary#enamel) is partially demineralized by organic acids, fluoride in the saliva can enhance the remineralization of enamel through its interactions with calcium and phosphate. Fluoride containing remineralized enamel is more resistant to acid attack and demineralization. In salivary concentrations associated with optimum fluoride intake, fluoride has been found to inhibit [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), resulting in reduced acid production by cariogenic bacteria [(7](#reference7), [17)](#reference17). The use of topically applied fluoride-containing products, including toothpaste, gel, varnish, and mouth rinse, is thought to have contributed to the substantial decrease in the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of caries over the last decades [(21)](#reference21). A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of fluoride interventions in children and adolescents (up to 16 years of age) found that the application of fluoride varnish for at least one year was associated with a 37% reduction in decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces in decayed tooth surfaces of primary teeth; the anti-caries effect on the permanent teeth corresponded to a 43% decrease compared to no treatment or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(22)](#reference22). A recent (2021) meta-analysis of topical fluoride reviewed 15 clinical trials with 9,541 participants. Specifically, the meta-analysis evaluated 14 trials of fluoride varnish compared to placebo or no fluoride and one trial of fluoride foam, and found that topical fluoride reduced dental caries increment by about one tooth surface over a two-year period [(23)](#reference23). The same meta-analysis also found that fluoride varnish significantly prevented any incident dental caries, but only for children who were younger than 2 years of age [(23)](#reference23). The effects of fluoride-containing toothpaste has been more extensive. A 2017 meta-analysis of 96 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including more than 65,000 participants, found tooth brushing with a fluoridated toothpaste reduced caries in primary teeth of children and in permanent teeth of adults compared to brushing with non-fluoridated toothpaste [(24)](#reference24). In participants overall, use of toothpastes containing 1,000 to 1,500 ppm of fluoride had a caries-preventative effect compared to use of toothpastes with lower fluoride concentrations or with 17 [clinical use of fluoridated toothpaste effectively reduced dental caries in primary teeth of children younger than 6 years who were at high risk of developing dental caries [(25)](#reference25). The attack of dental hard tissue by acids other than those produced by the [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) plaque may lead to the loss of tooth [enamel](../glossary#enamel), also known as dental erosion. Factors involved in dental erosion include acidic foods and beverages (e.g., carbonated drinks) and [acid reflux](../glossary#gastroesophageal-reflux-disease) [(26)](#reference26). The protective effect of fluoridated agents against dental erosion has mainly been observed in [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) studies (reviewed in [26](#reference26)). Nevertheless, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four small, randomized trials examining the effect of fluoride in toothpaste, varnish, and saliva on dental erosion did not find any overall benefit compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(27)](#reference27). Larger clinical studies are needed to evaluate whether [topical](../glossary#topical) fluoride applications can prevent dental erosion and/or reduce the progression of existing erosive lesions. Although fluoride in [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) has been shown to be a potent therapeutic agent for increasing spinal bone mass (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)), there is little evidence that water fluoridation at optimum levels for the prevention of [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries) is helpful in the prevention of [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis). The majority of studies conducted to date have failed to find clinically significant differences in [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) or [fracture](../glossary#fracture) incidence when comparing residents of areas with fluoridated water supplies to residents in areas without fluoridated water supplies [(28, 29)](#reference28). However, two studies found that drinking water fluoridation was associated with decreased incidence of hip fracture in the elderly. In addition, one study in Italy found a significantly greater [risk](../glossary#risk) of femoral (hip) fractures in men and women residing in an area with low water fluoridation (0.05 ppm) compared to the risk in a similar population whose water supply was naturally fluoridated (1.45 ppm) at higher than optimum levels for prevention of dental caries [(30)](#reference30). Another study in Germany found no significant difference in BMD between residents of a community whose water supply had been optimally fluoridated for 30 years (1 ppm) compared with those who resided in a community without fluoridated water. However, this study reported that the incidence of hip fracture in men and women, aged 85 years or older, was significantly lower in the community with fluoridated water compared to the community with non-fluoridated water, despite higher calcium levels in the non-fluoridated water supply [(31)](#reference31). Another community-based study in 1,300 women found that elevated [serum](../glossary#serum) fluoride concentrations were not related to BMD or to osteoporotic fracture incidence [(32)](#reference32). Finally, a nationwide cohort study in Sweden found no association between chronic exposure to fluoridated water and incidence of hip fracture [(33)](#reference33). A 2015 meta-analysis, which pooled results of 13 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and one [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study), found that fluoride exposure in drinking water was not associated with risk of hip fracture [(34)](#reference34). Moreover, because bone mineral accretion early in life affects risk for osteoporosis in later adulthood, studies have examined the association of fluoride intake during adolescence and bone outcomes. Reports from the Iowa Bone Development Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study, indicate little to no association of fluoride intake during childhood and adolescence with measures of bone microstructure throughout adolescence [(35-37)](#reference35) and into early adulthood [(38)](#reference38). [Osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) is characterized by decreased [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) and increased bone fragility and susceptibility to [fracture](../glossary#fracture). In general, decreased BMD is associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of fracture. However, the usual relationship between BMD and fracture risk does not always hold true when very high ( [pharmacologic](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose)) doses of fluoride are used to treat osteoporosis. Most available therapies for osteoporosis (e.g., [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen), calcitonin, and bisphosphonates) decrease bone loss ( [resorption](../glossary#resorption)), resulting in very small increases in BMD. Pharmacologic doses of fluoride are capable of producing large increases in the BMD of the [lumbar spine](../glossary#lumbar-spine). Overall, therapeutic trials of fluoride in patients with osteoporosis have not consistently demonstrated significant decreases in the occurrence of [vertebral](../glossary#vetebral) fracture despite dramatic increases in lumbar spine BMD [(39)](#reference39). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 11 controlled studies, including 1,429 participants, found that fluoride treatment resulted in increased BMD at the lumbar spine but was not associated with a lower risk of vertebral fractures [(40)](#reference40). This meta-analysis also found that higher concentrations of fluoride were associated with increased risk of non-vertebral fractures after four years of treatment. Early studies using high doses of fluoride (>20 mg/day) may have induced rapid bone mineralization in the absence of adequate calcium and vitamin D, resulting in denser bones that were not mechanically stronger [(41, 42)](#reference41). Analysis of bone architecture has also shed some light on the inconsistent effect of fluoride therapy in reducing vertebral fractures. Research has indicated that osteoporosis may be associated with an irreversible change in the architecture of bone known as decreased trabecular connectivity. Normal bone consists of a series of plates interconnected by thick rods. Severely osteoporotic bone has fewer plates, and the rods may be fractured or disconnected (decreased trabecular connectivity) [(43)](#reference43). Despite fluoride therapy increasing bone density, it probably cannot reduce bone resorption and restore connectivity in patients with severe bone loss. Thus, fluoride therapy may be less effective in osteoporotic individuals who have already lost substantial trabecular connectivity [(39](#reference39), [44)](#reference44). On the other hand, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) using lower fluoride doses (20 mg/day), intermittent dosage schedules, or slow-release formulations (enteric coated sodium fluoride) have demonstrated a decreased incidence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures along with increased bone density of the lumbar spine [(45)](#reference45). Yet, bone biopsies from postmenopausal, osteoporotic women treated with 20 mg/day of fluoride showed evidence of abnormal bone mineralization despite calcium and vitamin D supplementation [(46)](#reference46). Additionally, a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study did not find any increase in lumbar spine BMD in 180 postmenopausal women with [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia) (early osteoporosis) who were given daily supplements of up to 10 mg/day of fluoride for one year [(47)](#reference47). Additional studies are required to assess whether a safe dose of fluoride can be found to maximize bone formation while preventing mineralization defects. Serious side effects have been associated with the high doses of fluoride used to treat [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) [(45)](#reference45). They include [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) irritation, joint pain in the lower extremities, and the development of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) deficiency and [stress fractures](../glossary#stress-fracture). The reasons for the occurrence of lower extremity joint pain and stress fractures in patients taking fluoride for osteoporosis remain unclear, but they may be related to rapid increases in bone formation without sufficient calcium to support such an increase [(39)](#reference39). Presently, enteric coated sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate preparations offer a lower side effect profile than the high-dose sodium fluoride used in earlier trials. Additionally, sufficient calcium and vitamin D must be provided to support fluoride-induced bone formation. Although fluoride therapy may be beneficial for the treatment of osteoporosis in appropriately selected and closely monitored individuals, uncertainty about its safety and benefit in reducing fractures has kept the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from approving fluoride therapy for osteoporosis [(48)](#reference48). Combinations of lower doses of fluoride with [antiresorptive agents](../glossary#antiresorptive-agent), such as [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) or bisphosphonates, may improve therapeutic results while minimizing side effects [(49, 50)](#reference49). Yet, randomized studies have shown that the risk of fractures remained unchanged whether treatments include fluoride, antiresorptives, or both [(45, 46)](#reference45). Additional studies are warranted to determine whether any treatment combinations could provide substantial therapeutic benefits over [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy). The major source of dietary fluoride in the US diet is drinking water. Controlled addition of fluoride to water is used by communities as a public health measure to adjust fluoride concentration in drinking water to prevent [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries). Originally, an optimal range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per liter (corresponding to 0.7-1.2 ppm) was established, which was shown to decrease the incidence of dental caries while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis and other adverse effects. In 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the optimal concentration in drinking water be set at 0.7 ppm (see [Safety](#safety)) [(51)](#reference51). Approximately 73% of the US population receives water with sufficient fluoride for the prevention of dental caries [(52)](#reference52). The average fluoride intake for adults living in fluoridated communities ranges from 1.4 to 3.4 mg/day compared to 0.3 to 1 mg/day in non-fluoridated areas [(6)](#reference6). Since well water can vary greatly in its fluoride content, people who consume water from wells should have the fluoride content of their water tested by their local water district or health department. Water fluoride testing may also be warranted in households that use home water treatment systems. While water softeners are not thought to change water fluoride levels, reverse osmosis systems, distillation units, and some water filters have been found to remove significant amounts of fluoride from water. However, Brita-type carbon-charcoal filters do not remove fluoride [(6](#reference6), [48)](#reference48). Bottled water sales have grown exponentially in the US in the last decades, and studies have found that most bottled waters contain sub-optimal levels of fluoride, although there is considerable variation [(53)](#reference53). For example, a study of 105 different bottled water products in the Greater Houston metropolitan area found that over 80% had fluoride concentrations of less than 0.4 ppm; only 5% of the tested products had fluoride concentrations within the recommended range [(54)](#reference54). Several other studies have reported similar findings, with most bottled waters relatively low in fluoride, but a few in the optimal range or higher [(55-57)](#reference55). The FDA-approved claim that \"drinking fluoridated water may reduce the risk of tooth decay\" is only used by bottlers when the water contains greater than 0.6 ppm of fluoride but no more than 1.0 ppm of fluoride. However, bottlers are not required to provide the fluoride concentration in bottled water unless fluoride was added [(58)](#reference58). While consumption of fluoride from water presents very little [risk](../glossary#risk) of adverse effects in adults except in extreme circumstances (see [Safety](#safety)), consumption of relatively large amounts of water mixed with formula concentrates appears to increase the risk for the development of dental fluorosis in infants [(59-61)](#reference59). One study found that, on average, at least half of all fluoride ingested by infants 6 months and younger was from water mixed with formula concentrates [(62)](#reference62). The study of 49 commercially available infant formulas in the Chicago area showed that milk-based ready-to-feed, liquid concentrate, and powdered formulas (reconstituted with deionized water) had mean fluoride concentrations of 0.27 ppm, and 0.12 ppm, respectively [(63)](#reference63). Fluoride content was significantly higher in soy-based compared to milk-based liquid concentrate formulas (0.50 ppm vs. 0.27 ppm). Using average body weights and total formula intakes during the first year of life, the authors estimated that the risk of exceeding the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for fluoride ingestion was minimal when liquid concentrate and powdered formulas were reconstituted with water containing less than 0.5 ppm of fluoride, but the risk was maximal with 1.0 ppm fluoridated \"distilled,\" or \"produced through reverse-osmosis\" can be used in order to minimize the risk for mild fluorosis [(58)](#reference58). However, infants between 6 and 12 months may not reach the adequate intake of fluoride if they are fed ready-to-feed formulas or formulas reconstituted with water containing less than 0.4 ppm [(63)](#reference63). For additional information on fluoride and infant formulas, see the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/infant-formula.html?web=1&wdLOR=c808934EF-40E4-474F-8F9F-AB6FD9A37309). The fluoride content of most foods is low (less than 0.05 mg/100 grams or 0.5 ppm). Rich sources of fluoride include tea, which concentrates fluoride in its leaves, and marine fish that are consumed with their bones (e.g., sardines). Foods made with mechanically separated (boned) chicken, such as canned meats, hot dogs, and infant foods, also add fluoride to the diet [(64)](#reference64). In addition, certain fruit juices, particularly grape juices, often have relatively high fluoride concentrations [(65)](#reference65). Foods generally contribute only 0.3-0.6 mg of the daily intake of fluoride. An adult male residing in a community with fluoridated water has an intake range from 1 mg/day-3 mg/day. Intake is less than 1 mg/day in non-fluoridated areas [(2)](#reference2). Table 2 provides a range of fluoride content for a few fluoride-rich foods. For more information on the fluoride content of foods and beverages, search 1 milligram/liter (mg/L)| Fluoride [supplements](../glossary#supplement) \u2014 available only by prescription in the US \u2014 are intended for infants 6 months and older and children up to 16 years of age living in areas with suboptimal water fluoridation for the purpose of bringing their intake to approximately 1 mg/day [(6)](#reference6). The American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs recommends the prescription of fluoride supplements only to children at high risk of developing dental caries [(66)](#reference66). The supplemental fluoride dosage schedule in Table 3 was recommended by the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [(66, 67)](#reference66). It requires knowledge of the fluoride concentration of local drinking water, as well as other possible sources of fluoride intake. For more detailed information regarding fluoride and the prevention of dental caries, visit the [American Dental Association](https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/fluoride-topical-and-systemic-supplements) website. |Age||Fluoride million milligram/liter (mg/L) | **2.2 mg Fluoridated toothpastes (1,000-1,100 ppm of fluoride) are very effective in preventing dental caries but also add considerably to fluoride intake of children, especially young children who are more likely to swallow toothpaste. Researchers estimate that children under 6 years of age may ingest an average of 0.3 mg of fluoride from toothpaste with each brushing. Children under the age of 6 years who ingest more than two or three times the recommended fluoride intake are at increased risk of a white speckling or mottling of the permanent teeth, known as dental fluorosis (see [Safety](#safety) section below). A major source of excess fluoride intake in this age group comes from swallowing fluoride-containing toothpaste. To prevent dental fluorosis while providing optimum protection from tooth decay, it is recommended that parents supervise children under 6 years of age while brushing with fluoridated toothpaste. In addition to discouraging the swallowing of toothpaste, children should be supervised during teeth brushing, and young children should be encouraged to use very small amounts of toothpaste \u2014 a \"smear amount\" (a thin layer of toothpaste that covers less than half of the bristle surface of a child-size toothbrush; size equivalent to a grain of rice) for children younger than 3 years, and no more than a pea-sized application of toothpaste for children 3 to 6 years of age [(25](#reference25), [68-70)](#reference68). Interestingly, it has been suggested that the management of the fluorosis risk in young children who ingest fluoridated toothpaste could include the use of toothpaste formulation that reduces [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption and [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of fluoride [(71)](#reference71). Fluoridation of salt has been implemented in several countries worldwide as an alternative to water fluoridation to promote the ingestion of fluoride and improve oral care. Since the fluoridation of water is extensively practiced in the US, fluoride is not added to salt. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have shown that the incidence of teeth with caries dramatically decreased in the regions where salt fluoridation programs were developed (reviewed in [72](#reference72)). While concerns around [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) and the monitoring of population intakes should be addressed, no adverse health effects linked to the fluoridation of salt have been reported (reviewed in [73](#reference73)). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), salt fluoridation and, to a lesser extent, milk fluoridation, are affordable alternatives to improve oral hygiene in areas where access to oral health services is limited and fluoridation of public water is not feasible [(74)](#reference74). Mouth rinses that contain fluoride are available over-the-counter in the US. Such products often contain 0.05% sodium fluoride, which translates to about 1 mg of fluoride per 5 mL (one teaspoon) [(70)](#reference70). Due to the risk of accidental ingestion, fluoride-containing mouth rinses are not recommended for young children [(70)](#reference70). Professionally applied fluoride products, including fluoride foams, gels, varnish, to 44,800 ppm of fluoride) and applied topically to the teeth by dentists, dental hygienists, or other healthcare professionals [(75)](#reference75). Because of their high concentrations, they are potential sources of fluoride; however, due to their infrequent use (every 3-6 months) and small amounts used per application, professionally applied fluoride products are not significant sources of fluoride when used as directed [(75)](#reference75). Fluoridation of public drinking water in the US was initiated more than 70 years ago. Since then, a number of adverse effects have been attributed to water fluoridation. However, extensive scientific research has uncovered no evidence of increased [risks](../glossary#risk) of [cancer](../glossary#cancer), heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) disease, [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease), birth defects, number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), mostly published in Chinese journals, have investigated the association between fluoride content in drinking water and children's neurodevelopment. Two [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies, mainly conducted in China, found lower intelligence quotients (IQs) in children exposed to higher fluoride concentrations in drinking water [(78, 79)](#reference78). Serious limitations, including substantial [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among studies and co-occurrence of neurotoxicants in drinking water, hinder the strength of these findings and their application to US settings. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has estimated that only limited evidence supports an association between fluoride content in water and the IQs of children [(58)](#reference58). A prospective study in a New Zealand population-based cohort followed for nearly four decades found no association between fluoride exposure in the context of community water fluoridation programs and IQs measured during childhood and at age 38 years [(80)](#reference80). A series of recent studies by a research group in Canada have raised concern over a possible link between higher maternal fluoride exposures during pregnancy and lower IQ [(81-83)](#reference81), cognitive delay [(84)](#reference84), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [(85)](#reference85) in offspring. However, these studies have been widely criticized for shortcomings in measuring fluoride intake, only reporting significant relationships among subgroups, and being observational and subject to residual confounding. Thus, high-quality prospective studies with more definitive fluoride intake measures and better control of confounders are needed to determine whether fluoride might have neurotoxic effects at usual intake levels. Fluoride is toxic when consumed in excessive amounts, so concentrated fluoride products should be used and stored with caution to prevent the possibility of acute fluoride poisoning, especially in children and other vulnerable individuals. The lowest dose that could trigger adverse symptoms is considered to be 5 mg/kg of body weight, with the lowest potentially fatal dose considered 15 mg/kg of body weight. Nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting almost always accompany acute fluoride toxicity. Other symptoms like diarrhea, excessive salivation and tearing, sweating, and generalized weakness may also occur [(77)](#reference77). In order to prevent acute fluoride poisoning, the American Dental Association has recommended that no more than 120 mg of fluoride (224 mg of sodium fluoride) be dispensed at one time [(48)](#reference48). The use of high doses of fluoride to treat osteoporosis has been associated with some adverse effects, which are discussed in the [Disease Treatment](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/fluoride/#disease_treatment) section above. Dental fluorosis, also called enamel fluorosis, is a result of excess fluoride intake during the period of tooth formation, with the critical window of susceptibility being the first eight years of life, as this corresponds to the eruption of the permanent teeth [(86)](#reference86). Once the tooth enamel has formed, dental fluorosis cannot develop [(87)](#reference87). The mildest form of dental fluorosis is detectable only to the trained observer and is characterized by small opaque white flecks or spots on the enamel of the teeth. Moderate dental fluorosis is characterized by mottling and mild staining of the teeth, and severe dental fluorosis results in marked staining and pitting of the teeth. In its moderate to severe forms, dental fluorosis becomes a cosmetic concern when it affects the incisors and canines (front teeth). Dental fluorosis is a dose-dependent condition, with higher fluoride intakes being associated with more pronounced effects on the teeth. The incidence of mild and moderate dental fluorosis has increased over the past decades, mainly due to increasing fluoride intake from reconstituted infant formula and toothpaste, although inappropriate use of fluoride [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may also contribute [(61)](#reference61). According to a US national survey, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004, 23% of people aged 6 to 49 years (n=16,051) had some degree of dental fluorosis [(88)](#reference88). National data from NHANES 2011-2012 found that the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of fluorosis among children and adolescents (n=2,283), ages 6 to 19 years, was much higher at 57% [(89)](#reference89); however, a quality assessment of these data raised concerns about their validity and suggested such results were not biologically plausible [(90)](#reference90). In 1997, the US Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for fluoride based on the prevention The current US EPA maximum allowable level of fluoride in drinking water is 4 mg/L; the EPA also has a non-enforceable standard fluoride level of 2 mg/L to prevent moderate dental fluorosis [(91)](#reference91). The EPA recently conducted a six-year review of drinking water standards and concluded that the limit of fluoride in drinking water is not a candidate for regulatory revision at this time [(92)](#reference92). Intake of fluoride at excessive levels for long periods of time may lead to changes in bone structure known as skeletal fluorosis. The early stages of skeletal fluorosis are characterized by increased bone mass, detectable by x-ray. If very high fluoride intake persists over many years, joint pain and stiffness may result from the skeletal changes. The most severe form of skeletal fluorosis is known as \"crippling skeletal fluorosis,\" which may result in calcification of ligaments, immobility, muscle wasting, and [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) problems related to spinal cord compression. While skeletal fluorosis is endemic in many world regions with naturally high fluoride concentrations in drinking water, crippling skeletal fluorosis may occur only when fluoride intake exceeds 10 mg/day for at least 10 years [(6](#reference6), [93)](#reference93). Rare cases of skeletal fluorosis in the US have been observed in consumers of large volumes of tea [(94-97)](#reference94). Because of the potential risk for skeletal fluorosis, as well as the risks for pitting of tooth enamel and bone fracture, the US EPA set the maximum level of fluoride allowed in drinking water at 4 mg/L [(98)](#reference98). The agency also recommended limiting fluoride in drinking water at 2 mg/L to prevent dental fluorosis in children; however, this is only a guideline and not enforceable by law (see the [US EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-10/documents/2011_fluoride_questionsanswers.pdf)). [Calcium](calcium) [supplements](../glossary#supplement), as well as calcium and aluminum-containing antacids, can decrease the absorption of fluoride. It is best to take these products two hours before or after fluoride supplements [(99)](#reference99). The safety and public health benefits of optimally fluoridated water for prevention of tooth decay in people of all ages have been well established. The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendations of the [American Dental Association](https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/f/fluoride) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/index.html), which include optimally fluoridated water and the use of fluoride toothpaste, fluoride mouth rinse, fluoride varnish, and when necessary, fluoride [supplementation](../glossary#supplement). Due to the risk of fluorosis, any fluoride supplementation should be prescribed and closely monitored by a dentist or physician.

Iodine deficiency is an important health problem throughout much of the world. Most of the Earth's iodine, in the form of the iodide ion (I-), is found in oceans, and iodine content in the soil varies with region. The older an exposed soil surface, the more likely the iodine has been leached away by erosion. Mountainous regions, such as the Himalayas, Atlas, Andes, and Alps; flooded river valleys, such as the Ganges River plain in India; and many inland regions, such as central Asia and Africa, central and eastern Europe, and the Midwestern region of North America are among the most severely iodine-deficient areas in the world [(1)](#references). Iodine is an essential component of the [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormones](../glossary#hormone), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and is therefore essential for normal thyroid function. To meet the body's demand for thyroid hormones, the thyroid gland traps iodine from the blood and incorporates it into the large (660 kDa) glycoprotein thyroglobulin. The [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) of thyroglobulin by [lysosomal](../glossary#lysosome) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) gives rise to thyroid hormones that are stored and released into the circulation when needed. In target tissues, such as the liver and the brain, T4 (the most abundant circulating thyroid hormone) can be converted to T3 by [selenium](selenium)-containing enzymes known as iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) see also [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). T3 is the physiologically active thyroid hormone that can bind to thyroid [receptors](../glossary#receptor) in the [nuclei](../glossary#nucleus) of cells and regulate [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression). In this manner, thyroid hormones regulate a number of physiologic processes, including growth, development, [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), and reproductive function [(2)](#reference2). The regulation of thyroid function is a complex process that involves the [hypothalamus](../glossary#hypothalamus) and the [pituitary gland](../glossary#pituitary-gland). In response to (TSH), which stimulates iodine trapping, thyroid hormone [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), and release of T4 and T3 by the thyroid gland. The presence of adequate circulating T4 and T3 feeds back at the level of both the hypothalamus and pituitary, decreasing TRH and TSH production (Figure 2). When circulating T4 levels decrease, the pituitary gland increases its secretion of TSH, resulting in increased iodine trapping, as well as increased production and release of both T3 and T4. Iodine deficiency results in inadequate production of T4. In response to decreased blood T4 concentrations, the pituitary gland increases its output of TSH. Persistently elevated TSH levels may lead to hypertrophy (enlargement) of the thyroid gland, also known as [goiter](../glossary#goiter) (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)) [(3)](#reference3). The [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) gland of a healthy adult concentrates 70-80% of a total body iodine content of 15-20 mg and utilizes about 80 g of iodine daily to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) thyroid [hormones](../glossary#hormone). In contrast, chronic iodine deficiency can result in a dramatic reduction of the iodine content in the thyroid well below 1 mg [(1)](#references). Iodine deficiency is recognized as the most common cause of preventable brain damage in the world. The spectrum of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) includes mental retardation, [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism), [goiter](../glossary#goiter), and varying degrees of other growth and developmental abnormalities [(4)](#reference4). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that over 30% of the world's population (2 billion people) have insufficient iodine intake as measured by median urinary iodine concentrations below 100 g/L [(5)](#reference5). Moreover, about one-third of school-age children (6-12 years old) worldwide (241 million children in 2011) have insufficient iodine intake [(6, 7)](#reference6). Major international efforts have produced dramatic improvements in the correction of iodine deficiency in the 1990s, mainly through the use of iodized salt in iodine-deficient countries [(4)](#reference4). Although about 70% of households in the world now have access to iodized salt [(8)](#reference8), mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency remains a public health concern in at least 30 countries; there are no iodine [excretion](../glossary#excretion) data available for 42 other countries, including Israel, Syria, and Sierra Leone [(7)](#reference7). For more information on the international effort to eradicate iodine deficiency, visit the websites of the [Iodine Global Network](http://ign.org/index.cfm) (formerly the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders) and the WHO. More than 90% of ingested iodine is [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine within 24-48 hours such that daily iodine intakes in a population can be extrapolated from measures of median spot urinary iodine concentrations [(9, 10)](#reference9). According to WHO criteria, population iodine deficiency is defined by median urinary iodine concentrations lower than 150 micrograms (g)/L for pregnant women and 100 g/L for all other groups (Table 1). Adequate intakes correspond to median urinary iodine concentrations of 100-199 g/L in school-age children and 150-249 g/L in pregnant women (Table 1). While median urinary iodine concentration is a population indicator of recent dietary iodine intake, multiple collections of 24-hour urinary iodine are preferable to estimate intake in individuals women. In many countries, [serum](../glossary#serum) TSH concentration is used in the screening for [congenital hypothyroidism](../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) in newborns. Newborn TSH can be used as an indicator of population iodine status. Yet, in older children and adults, serum TSH is not a sensitive indicator of iodine [status](../glossary#status) as concentrations are usually maintained within a normal range despite frank iodine deficiency [(12)](#reference12). Serum thyroglobulin concentration in school-age children is a sensitive marker of iodine status in populations [(13)](#reference13). In areas of endemic [goiter](../glossary#goiter), changes in [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) size reflect long-term iodine nutrition (months to years). Assessment of the goiter rate in a population is used to define the severity of iodine deficiency, as well as to monitor the long-term impact of sustained salt iodization programs [(4](#reference4), [10)](#reference10). Finally, serum thyroid [hormone](../glossary#hormone) concentrations do not adequately reflect iodine nutrition in populations [(1)](#references). All the adverse effects of iodine deficiency in animals and humans are collectively termed iodine deficiency disorders (reviewed in [1](#references)). [Thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) enlargement, or [goiter](../glossary#goiter), is one of the earliest and most visible signs of iodine deficiency. It is a physiologic adaptation of the thyroid gland in response to persistent stimulation by TSH (see [Function](#function)). In mild iodine deficiency, thyroid enlargement may be enough to maximize the uptake of available iodine and provide the body with sufficient thyroid [hormones](../glossary#hormone). Yet, large goiters can obstruct the trachea and [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus) and damage the recurrent [laryngeal](../glossary#larynx) nerves. More severe cases of iodine deficiency result in impaired thyroid hormone [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) known as [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism). Adequate iodine intake will generally reduce the size of goiters, but the reversibility of the effects of hypothyroidism depends on an individual's life stage. Iodine deficiency-induced hypothyroidism has adverse effects in all stages of development but is most damaging to the developing brain. In addition to regulating many aspects of growth and development, thyroid hormones are important for the migration, [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of specific neuronal populations, the overall architecture of the brain's cortex, the formation of [axonal](../glossary#axon) connections, and the [myelination](../glossary#myelin) of the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), which occurs both before and shortly after birth (reviewed in [14](#reference14)). The effects of iodine deficiency at different life stages are discussed below. Daily iodine requirements are significantly increased in pregnant and breast-feeding women because of (1) the increased [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) production and transfer to the fetus in early pregnancy before the fetal thyroid gland becomes functional, (2) iodine transfer to the fetus during late [gestation](../glossary#gestation), (3) increased urinary iodine [excretion](../glossary#excretion), and (4) iodine transfer to the infant via breast milk (see also [The RDA](#RDA)) [(12, 15)](#reference12). During pregnancy, the size of the thyroid gland is increased by 10% in women residing in iodine-sufficient regions and increased by 20%-40% in those living in iodine-deficient regions [(16)](#reference16). Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can result in [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) in women. Maternal hypothyroidism has been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, and low-birth-weight infants (reviewed in [16](#reference16)). In addition, severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy may result in [congenital hypothyroidism](../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) and neurocognitive deficits in the offspring (see [Prenatal development](#deficiency-prenatal-development)) [(12)](#reference12). Iodine-deficient women who are breast-feeding may not be able to provide sufficient iodine to their infants who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of iodine deficiency (see [Newborns and infants](#deficiency-newborns-infants)) [(17)](#reference17). A daily prenatal supplement of 150 g of iodine, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) [(16)](#reference16), will help to ensure that US pregnant and breast-feeding women consume sufficient iodine during these critical periods. In iodine-deficient areas where iodized salt is not available, the [Iodine Global Network](http://ign.org/index.cfm) (IGN; formerly the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders), the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/elena/titles/guidance_summaries/iodine_pregnancy/en/) (WHO), and UNICEF recommend that lactating women receive a single annual dose of 400 mg of iodine (or 250 g/day) and exclusively breast-feed for at least six months. When breast-feeding is not possible, direct supplementation of the infant (<2 years old) with a single annual dose of 200 mg of iodine (or 90 g/day) is advised [(4)](#reference4). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) and [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial recently demonstrated that maternal supplementation (with a single 400-mg dose of iodine) improved the iodine status of breast-fed infants more efficiently than direct infant supplementation (with a single 100 mg-dose of iodine) for a period of at least six months [(18)](#reference18). Yet, supplementation of lactating women failed to increase maternal urinary iodine concentrations above 100 g/L, suggesting that supplemented mothers remained deficient in iodine [(18)](#reference18). Fetal iodine deficiency is caused by iodine deficiency in the mother (see [Pregnancy and lactation](#deficiency-pregnancy-lactation)). During pregnancy, before the fetal thyroid gland becomes functional at 16-20 weeks' [gestation](../glossary#gestation), maternal thyroxine (T4) crosses the [placenta](../glossary#placenta) to promote normal embryonic and fetal development. Hence, maternal iodine deficiency and [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) can result in adverse pregnancy complications, including fetal loss, placental abruption, [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), preterm delivery, and [congenital hypothyroidism](../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) in the offspring [(16)](#reference16). The effects of maternal hypothyroidism on the offspring depend on the timing and severity of in utero iodine deficiency. A severe form of congenital hypothyroidism may lead to [cretinism](../glossary#cretinism), a condition associated with irreversible mental retardation. The clinical picture of [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) cretinism in the offspring includes severe mental and physical retardation, deafness, mutism, and motor spasticity. A myxedematous form of cretinism has been associated with coexisting iodine and [selenium](selenium) deficiency in central Africa (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)) and is characterized by a less severe degree of mental retardation than in neurological cretinism. Yet, affected individuals exhibit all the features of severe hypothyroidism, including severe growth retardation and delayed sexual maturation [(12)](#reference12). Two longitudinal cohort studies (one in the UK and one in Australia) recently observed that even mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency during pregnancy was associated with reduced scores of IQ and various measures of literacy performance in children 8 to 9 years of age [(19, 20)](#reference19). Infant mortality is higher in areas of severe iodine deficiency than in iodine- [replete](../glossary#replete) regions, and several studies have demonstrated an increase in childhood survival upon correction of the iodine deficiency [(8](#reference8), [21, 22)](#reference21). Infancy is a period of rapid brain growth and development. Sufficient [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone), which depends on adequate iodine intake, is essential for normal brain development. Even in the absence of [congenital hypothyroidism](../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism), iodine deficiency during infancy may result in abnormal brain development and, consequently, impaired intellectual development [(23, 24)](#reference23). Iodine deficiency in children and adolescents is often associated with [goiter](../glossary#goiter). The incidence of goiter peaks in adolescence and is more common in girls than boys. School-age children in iodine-deficient areas show poorer school performance, lower IQs, and a higher incidence of learning disabilities than matched groups from iodine-sufficient areas. Three [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of mainly [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) concluded that chronic iodine deficiency was associated with reduced mean IQ scores by 7-13.5 points in participants (primarily children) [(25-27)](#reference25). However, these [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) did not distinguish between iodine deficiency during pregnancy and during childhood, and such observational studies may be [confounded](../glossary#confounder) by social, economic, and educational factors that influence child development. Inadequate iodine intake may also result in [goiter](../glossary#goiter) and [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) in adults. Although the effects of hypothyroidism are more subtle in the brains of adults than children, research suggests that hypothyroidism results in poor social and economic achievements due to low educability, apathy, and reduced work productivity [(28)](#reference28). Other symptoms of hypothyroidism in adults include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Finally, because iodine deficiency induces an increase in the iodine trapping capacity of the [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid), iodine-deficient individuals of all ages are more susceptible to radiation-induced thyroid [cancer](../glossary#cancer) (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)), as well as to iodine-induced [hyperthyroidism](../glossary#hyperthyroidism) after an increase in iodine intakes (see [Safety](#safety)) [(2)](#reference2). While the [risk](../glossary#risk) of iodine deficiency for populations living in iodine-deficient areas without adequate iodine [fortification](../glossary#fortification) programs is well recognized, concerns have been raised that certain subpopulations in countries considered iodine-sufficient may not consume adequate iodine [(7](#reference7), [29)](#reference29). The greater use of methods assessing iodine status (see [Biomarkers of iodine status](#biomarkers-status)) has shown that iodine deficiency also occurs in areas where the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of [goiter](../glossary#goiter) is low, in coastal areas, in highly developed countries, and in regions where iodine deficiency was previously eliminated [(4)](#reference4). The US is currently considered to be iodine-sufficient. Yet, in recent years, dietary intakes of iodine in the US population have decreased. Data from the latest US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2009-2010) indicated that the median urinary iodine concentration for the general population was 144 g/L compared to 164 g/L reported in previous assessments (NHANES 2005-2006 and 2007-2008) [(30, 31)](#reference30). In addition to regional differences across the US, ethnic variations have been found. In all age groups, median urinary iodine concentrations were shown to be lower in African Americans than in Hispanics and Caucasians. In addition, median urinary iodine concentrations in nonpregnant women of childbearing age and pregnant women indicate that mild iodine deficiency has re-emerged in the US in recent years [(31)](#reference31). Data from US NHANES 2007-2010 indicated that 37.3% of nonpregnant women (ages 15-44 years) had urinary iodine concentrations lower than 100 g/L, reflecting potentially insufficient iodine intakes (see [Biomarkers of iodine status](#biomarkers-status)) [(31)](#reference31). Only one-fifth of an earlier NHANES (2001-2006) [(32)](#reference32). Yet, adequate intakes of iodine in women of childbearing age (150 g/day; see [The RDA](#RDA)) are essential for optimum stores of iodine, especially if they are considering pregnancy. Some experts suggested a daily consumption of 250 g of iodine before conception to ensure adequate [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) production and iodine supply to the embryo and fetus during pregnancy (see [Pregnancy and lactation](#deficiency-pregnancy-lactation)) [(12)](#reference12). There are no statistics on the global burden of iodine deficiency in pregnant women, but national and regional data suggest that this group is especially vulnerable. Given the increased iodine requirements during pregnancy, the median urinary iodine concentration should be at least of 150 g/L (see [Biomarkers of iodine status](#biomarkers-status)). Pooled data from NHANES 2005-2010 reported that US pregnant women had a median urinary iodine concentration of 129 g/L, and the lowest median concentration (109 g/L) was observed during the first trimester of [gestation](../glossary#gestation), when the embryo/fetus relies exclusively on maternal thyroid hormones [(31)](#reference31). While data regarding the iodine status of breast-feeding women in the US are limited, dietary intakes that were inadequate during pregnancy are likely to be insufficient in a significant fraction of breast-feeding women [(33, 34)](#reference33). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of the literature recently reported suboptimal dietary iodine intakes in breast-feeding women in some countries with a mandatory [fortification](../glossary#fortification) program, including Denmark, Australia, and India [(35)](#reference35). The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends that all North American women who are pregnant or breast-feeding supplement their dietary iodine intake with 150 g/day of iodine [(36)](#reference36). The body of a healthy newborn contains only about 300 g of iodine, which makes newborns extremely vulnerable to iodine deficiency [(28)](#reference28), and breast-fed infants are entirely reliant on maternal iodine intakes for [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). Even in areas covered by a salt iodization program, weaning infants are at high risk of iodine deficiency, especially if they are not receiving iodine-containing infant formula [(17)](#reference17). Diets that exclude iodized salt, fish, and seaweed have been found to contain very little iodine [(9)](#reference9). Individuals consuming branded weight-loss foods may also be at risk of inadequate intakes [(37)](#reference37). A small US [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 78 vegetarians and 63 vegans reported median urinary iodine concentrations of 147 g/L and 78.5 g/L, respectively, suggesting inadequate iodine intakes among vegans [(38)](#reference38). Two cases of [goiter](../glossary#goiter) and/or [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) have also been recently reported in children following restrictive diets to control [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) (eosinophilic esophagitis) [(39)](#reference39) or allergies added to [parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) (PN) solutions, [topical](../glossary#topical) iodine-containing disinfectants and other adventitious sources provide substantial amounts of iodine to some PN patients such that the occurrence of iodine deficiency is unlikely. Yet, deficiency might occur, especially in preterm infants with limited body stores, if chlorhexidine-based antiseptics or [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) may exacerbate the effects of iodine deficiency (reviewed in [42](#reference42)). While iodine is an essential component of [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormones](../glossary#hormone), the [selenium](selenium)-containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) are [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) (or required for the conversion of T4 to the biologically active thyroid hormone, T3 (see the article on [Selenium](selenium#function)). DIO1 activity may also be involved in regulating iodine [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) [(43)](#reference43). In addition, glutathione peroxidases are selenoenzymes that protect the thyroid gland from hydrogen peroxide-induced damage during thyroid hormone [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) [(44)](#reference44). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 151 pregnant women at [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) thyroid disease found that selenium supplementation (200 g/day in the form of selenomethionine) at 12 weeks of gestation until 12 months' postpartum reduced the risk of thyroid dysfunction and permanent [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) [(45)](#reference45). However, another trial (the Selenium in Pregnancy Intervention Trial) found no benefit of selenium supplementation (60 g/day from 12-14 weeks of gestation to delivery) over placebo on circulating autoantibody concentrations in pregnant women mildly deficient in iodine [(46)](#reference46). The [epidemiology](../glossary#epidemiological-study) of coexisting iodine and selenium deficiencies in central Africa has been linked to the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of myxedematous [cretinism](../glossary#cretinism), a severe form of [congenital hypothyroidism](../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) accompanied by mental and physical retardation. Selenium deficiency may be only one of several undetermined factors that might exacerbate the detrimental effects of iodine deficiency [(42)](#reference42). Besides, results from [randomized controlled intervention trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have shown that correcting only the selenium deficiency may have a deleterious effect on thyroid hormone [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in school-age children with co-existing selenium and iodine deficiency [(47, 48)](#reference47). Finally, selenium deficiency in rodents was found to have little impact on DIO activities as it appears that selenium is being supplied in priority for adequate synthesis of DIOs at the expense of other selenoenzymes [(44)](#reference44). Severe [iron](iron)-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) can impair [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in the following ways: (1) by altering the TSH response of the [pituitary gland](../glossary#pituitary-gland); (2) by reducing the activity of thyroid peroxidase that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the iodination of thyroglobulin for the production of thyroid [hormones](../glossary#hormone); and (3) in the liver by limiting the conversion of T4 to T3, increasing T3 turnover, and decreasing T3 binding to nuclear [receptors](../glossary#receptor) [(49)](#reference49). It is estimated that [goiter](../glossary#goiter) and iron-deficiency anemia coexist in up to 25% of school-age children in west and north Africa [(42)](#reference42). A [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in iron-deficient children with goiter showed a greater reduction in thyroid size following the consumption of iodized salt together with 60 mg/day of iron four times per week compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(50)](#reference50). Additional [interventions](../glossary#intervention-trial) have confirmed that correcting iron-deficiency anemia improved the efficacy of iodine supplementation to mitigate thyroid disorders (reviewed in [42](#reference42), [49](#reference49)). In north and west Africa, [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) deficiency and iodine deficiency-induced [goiter](../glossary#goiter) may coexist in up to 50% of children. Vitamin A [status](../glossary#status), like other nutritional factors, appears to influence the response to iodine [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) in iodine-deficient populations [(51)](#reference51). Vitamin A deficiency in animal models was found to interfere with the [pituitary](../glossary#pituitary-gland)- [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) axis by (1) increasing the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) thyroid-stimulating [hormone](../glossary#hormone) (TSH) by the pituitary gland, (2) increasing the size of the thyroid gland, (3) reducing iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and impairing the synthesis and iodination of thyroglobulin, and (4) increasing circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones (reviewed in [52](#reference52)). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 138 children with concurrent vitamin A and iodine deficiencies found that the severity of vitamin A deficiency was associated with higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of goiter and higher concentrations of circulating TSH and thyroid hormones [(51)](#reference51). These children received iodine-enriched salt together with vitamin A (200,000 IU at baseline and at 5 months) or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), 10-month trial. Vitamin A supplementation significantly decreased TSH concentration and thyroid volume compared to placebo [(51)](#reference51). In another trial, vitamin A supplementation alone (without iodine) to iodine-deficient children reduced the volume of the thyroid gland, as well as TSH and thyroglobulin concentrations [(53)](#reference53). Yet, supplemental vitamin A had no additional effect on thyroid function/hormone metabolism when children were also given iodized oil. Some foods contain substances that interfere with iodine utilization or [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) production; these substances are called [goitrogens](../glossary#goitrogen). The occurrence of [goiter](../glossary#goiter) in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been related to the consumption of cassava, which contains linamarin, a compound that is metabolized to thiocyanate and blocks thyroidal uptake of iodine [(1)](#references). In iodine-deficient populations, tobacco smoking has been associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for goiter [(54, 55)](#reference54). Cyanide in tobacco smoke is converted to thiocyanate in the liver, placing smokers with low iodine intake at risk of developing a goiter. Moreover, thiocyanate affects iodine transport into the lactating mammary gland, leading to low iodine concentrations in breast milk and impaired iodine supply to the neonates/infants of smoking mothers [(2)](#reference2). Some species of millet, sweet potatoes, beans, and [cruciferous vegetables](../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels [(1)](#references). Further, the soybean [isoflavones](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones), genistein and daidzein, have been found to inhibit thyroid hormone [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) [(56)](#reference56). Most of these goitrogens are not of clinical importance unless they are consumed in large amounts or there is coexisting iodine deficiency. Industrial pollutants, such as perchlorate (see [Safety](#safety)), resorcinol, and phthalic acid, may also be goitrogenic [(1](#references), [57)](#reference57). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for iodine was reevaluated by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2001 (Table 2). The recommended amounts were calculated using several methods, including the measurement of iodine uptake in the [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) glands of individuals with normal thyroid function [(9)](#reference9). Similar recommendations have been made by several organizations, including the [American Thyroid Association](http://www.thyroid.org/) (ATA) [(16](#reference16), [58)](#reference58), the [Iodine Global Network](http://ign.org/index.cfm) (IGN; formerly the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders), and the [United Nations Children's Fund](http://www.unicef.org/) (UNICEF) [(4)](#reference4). Of note, the WHO, IGN, and UNICEF recommend daily intakes of 250 g of iodine for both pregnant iodine, especially iodine 131 (131I), may be released into the environment as a result of nuclear reactor accidents, such as the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine and the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan. [Thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) accumulation of radioactive iodine increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing thyroid [cancer](../glossary#cancer), especially in children [(59)](#reference59). The increased iodine trapping activity of the thyroid gland in iodine deficiency results in increased thyroid accumulation of radioactive iodine (131I). Thus, iodine-deficient individuals are at increased risk of developing radiation-induced thyroid cancer because they will accumulate greater amounts of radioactive iodine. Potassium iodide administered in [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) (up to 130 mg for adults) within 48 hours before or eight hours after radiation exposure from a nuclear reactor accident can significantly reduce thyroid uptake of 131I and decrease the risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer [(60)](#reference60). The prompt and widespread use of potassium iodide [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) in Poland after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident may explain the lack of a significant increase in childhood thyroid cancer compared to fallout areas where potassium iodide prophylaxis was not widely used [(61)](#reference61). In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires that consideration be given to potassium iodide as a protective measure for the general public in the case of a major release of radioactivity from a nuclear power plant [(62)](#reference62). See also the [US FDA's Potassium Iodide Information](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM080542.pdf). [Fibrocystic breast changes](../glossary#fibrocystic-breast-changes) constitute a benign (non-cancerous) condition of the breasts, characterized by lumpiness and discomfort in one or both breasts. Cyst formation and fibrous changes in the appearance of breast tissue occur in at least 50% of premenopausal women and are not usually associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(63)](#reference63). The cause of fibrocystic changes is not known, but variations in [hormonal](../glossary#hormone) stimulation during menstrual cycles may trigger changes in breast tissue [(63)](#reference63). A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) also suggested an association between benign breast diseases (including but not limited to fibrocystic changes) and [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) disorders. Recently, a small [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) (166 cases vs. 72 controls) showed that the frequency of benign breast diseases was greater in women with nodular goiter (54.9%) or Hashimoto thyroiditis (47.4%) than Conversely, the prevalence of anti-thyroid [autoimmunity](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) and [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) was found to be significantly higher in women with benign breast diseases compared to controls [(65, 66)](#reference65). Interestingly, correcting hypothyroidism with [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) T4 was found to improve some of the benign breast disease symptoms, including breast pain (mastalgia) and nipple discharge [(65)](#reference65). In [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen)-treated rats, iodine deficiency leads to changes similar to those seen in fibrocystic breasts, while iodine [repletion](../glossary#replete) reverses those changes [(67)](#reference67). An uncontrolled study of 233 women with fibrocystic changes found that treatment with aqueous molecular iodine (I2) at a dose of 0.08 mg of I2/kg of body weight daily over 6 to 18 months was associated with improvement in pain and other symptoms in over 70% of participants [(68)](#reference68). About 10% of the study participants reported side effects that were described by the investigators as minor. A [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial of aqueous molecular iodine (0.07-0.09 mg of I2/kg of body weight daily for six months) in 56 women with fibrocystic changes found that 65% of the women taking molecular iodine reported improvement compared to 33% of those taking the placebo [(68)](#reference68). A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 87 women with documented breast pain reported that molecular iodine (1.5, 3, or 6 mg/day) for six months improved overall pain [(69)](#reference69). In this study, 38.5% of the women receiving 1.5 mg/day, 37.9% of those receiving 3 mg/day, and 51.7% of those receiving 6 mg/day reported at least a 50% reduction in self-assessed breast pain compared to 8.3% in the placebo group. Large-scale, controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine the therapeutic value of molecular iodine in fibrocystic breasts. Besides, the doses of iodine used in these studies (1.5 to 6 mg/day for a 60 kg person) are higher than the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine and should only be used under medical supervision (see [Safety](#safety)). Data from the ongoing US [Total Diet Study](http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm), which monitors the levels of some contaminants and nutrients in food products, indicates that dietary iodine intakes in adults range between 138 and 268 micrograms (g)/day. Considerably higher average intakes (304-353 g/day of iodine) were reported for boys 14 to 16 years of age [(70)](#reference70). Seafood is rich in iodine because marine animals can concentrate the iodine from seawater. Certain types of edible seaweed (e.g., wakame) are also very rich in iodine [(71)](#reference71). The iodine content of food that is grown or raised on a particular soil depends on the iodine content of this soil. In the US, dairy products contribute up to 90% of total estimated iodine intakes in infants, at least 70% in children (ages, 2-10 years), 53%-63% in adolescents (ages, 14-16 years), and about 50% in adults [(70)](#reference70). In the UK and northern Europe, iodine levels in dairy products tend to be lower in summer when cattle are allowed to graze in pastures with low soil iodine content [(9)](#reference9). Other good sources of dietary iodine include eggs, fruit, grain products, and poultry [(70)](#reference70). Processed foods can contribute to iodine intake if iodized salt or food additives, such as calcium iodate and potassium iodate, are added during production. Yet, in the US, virtually no iodized salt is used in the manufacturing of processed food and fast food products, and the food industry is not required to list the iodine content on food packaging [(72)](#reference72). Table 3 lists the iodine content of some iodine-rich foods in micrograms (g). Because the iodine content of foods can vary considerably, these values should be considered than 4,500 g (4.5 mg)| |*A three-ounce serving of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.| Potassium iodide is available as a nutritional [supplement](../glossary#supplement), typically in combination products, such as [multivitamin/mineral supplements](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements). Iodine makes up approximately 77% of the total weight of potassium iodide [(56)](#reference56). A multivitamin/mineral supplement that contains 100% of the daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for iodine provides 150 g of iodine. Although most people in the US consume sufficient iodine in their diets (see [Sources](#sources)), an additional 150 g/day is unlikely to result in excessive iodine intake. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends prenatal supplementation with 150 g/day of iodine and advises against the ingestion of 500 g/day of iodine from iodine, potassium iodine, and kelp supplements for children and adults, and during pregnancy and lactation (see also [Safety](#safety)) [(36](#reference36), [74)](#reference74). The [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of salt with iodine is a feasible and inexpensive method to eliminate iodine deficiency, and salt iodization programs have been implemented in almost all countries. In North America, salt fortification with iodine is mandated in Canada and some parts of Mexico, but only voluntary in the US such that only 52% of US table salt is iodized and only one-fifth of the total salt consumed in the US is iodized [(72, 75)](#reference72). Potassium iodide (KI), cuprous iodide (CuI), and potassium iodate (KIO3) are used to iodize salt. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends between 46 and 76 g of iodine per gram of salt in iodized salt. However, the recent analysis of 88 US iodized food-grade salt samples revealed that the iodine content was below the recommended range in 52% of the samples and above the range in 7% of the samples [(76)](#reference76). In other countries, salt commonly contains 20-50 g of iodine per gram of salt, depending on local regulations [(76)](#reference76). In countries like Denmark [(77)](#reference77), Australia [(78, 79)](#reference78), and New Zealand [(80)](#reference80), the use of iodized salt in the bread-making process is mandated. Additional approaches have been explored, including sugar fortification [(81)](#reference81), egg fortification [(82)](#reference82), use of iodized salt in the preparation of [fermented](../glossary#fermentation) fish and fish sauce [(83)](#reference83), and use of iodine-rich crop fertilizers [(84)](#reference84). In addition, fortification of livestock feeds with iodine and the use of iodophors for sanitation during milking contribute to increasing iodine content in dairy products [(85)](#reference85). Finally, annual doses of iodized vegetable oil are administered orally or intramuscularly to individuals in iodine-deficient populations who do not have access to iodized salt [(4](#reference4), [56)](#reference56). Acute iodine poisoning is rare and usually occurs only with doses of many grams. Symptoms of acute iodine poisoning include burning of the mouth, throat, and stomach, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a weak pulse, cyanosis, and coma [(1)](#references). Iodine supplementation programs in iodine-deficient populations have been associated with an increased incidence of iodine-induced [hyperthyroidism](../glossary#hyperthyroidism) (IIH), especially in older Iodine intakes of 150-200 g/day have been found to increase the incidence of IIH in iodine-deficient populations. Iodine deficiency increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing autonomous [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) nodules that are unresponsive to TSH control (see [Function](#function)). These autonomous nodules may then overproduce thyroid [hormones](../glossary#hormone) in response to sudden iodine supply. IIH symptoms include weight loss, tachycardia (high pulse rate), muscle weakness, and skin warmth. IIH can be dangerous in individuals with underlying heart disease. Yet, because the primary cause of nodular goiter and IIH is chronic iodine deficiency, the benefit of iodization programs largely outweighs the risk of IIH in iodine-deficient populations [(1)](#references). In iodine-sufficient individuals, excess iodine intake is most commonly associated with elevated blood concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) that inhibit [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) production, leading to [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) and [goiter](../glossary#goiter). A slightly elevated serum TSH concentration without a decrease in serum T4 or T3 is the earliest sign of abnormal thyroid function when iodine intake is excessive. In iodine-sufficient adults, elevated serum TSH has been found at chronic iodine intakes of 750 g/day in children and 1,700 g/day in adults. Because various edible seaweed species substantially contribute to traditional Asian meals, average Japanese dietary intakes are estimated to range between 1,000 and 3,000 g of iodine/day [(71)](#reference71). Iodine-induced goiter and hypothyroidism are not uncommon in Japan and can be reversed by restricting seaweed intake [(71)](#reference71). Prolonged intakes of more than 18,000 g/day (18 mg/day) increase the incidence of goiter in adults. In newborns, iodine-induced goiter and hypothyroidism can be due to either high maternal intakes or high exposure to iodized antiseptics [(87)](#reference87). In order to minimize the risk of adverse health effects, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine set a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for iodine that is likely to be safe in almost all individuals. The UL values for iodine are listed in Table 4 by age group; the UL does not apply to individuals who are being treated with iodine under medical supervision [(74)](#reference74). of intake should be from food and formula only.| Individuals with iodine deficiency and those with preexisting thyroid disease, including nodular goiter, autoimmune Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, and a history of partial thyroidectomy, may be sensitive to iodine intake levels considered safe for the general population and may not be protected by the [UL](../glossary#UL) for iodine [(9)](#reference9). Infants, the elderly, and pregnant and lactating women may also be more susceptible to excess iodine (see [Supplements](#supplements)) [(74)](#reference74). Over the past decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased worldwide. In the US, the incidence of thyroid cancer \u2014 representing 4% of all newly diagnosed cancers \u2014 has increased from 4.9 cases per persons in 1983 to 14.7 cases per 100,000 persons in 2011, but mortality rate from thyroid cancer has remained low (about 0.5 per 100,000 persons) [(88)](#reference88). Accounting for over 80% of all thyroid cancers, [thyroid papillary cancer](../glossary#thyroid-papillary-cancer) is less aggressive and has a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) than [thyroid follicular cancer](../glossary#thyroid-follicular-cancer) or anaplastic thyroid cancer. The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer worldwide is likely due at least in part to the improved screening and diagnosis activities. However, because it has coincided with the introduction of iodine [fortification](../glossary#fortification) programs, a possible contribution of increased iodine intakes has been hypothesized. Yet, in the US, the increasing incidence of thyroid cancers (primarily papillary cancer) over the last few decades was paralleled with a reduction in average iodine intake [(89)](#reference89). [Ecologic studies](../glossary#ecologic-study) also suggested that iodine [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) in populations that were previously iodine deficient was associated with an increased incidence of the papillary rather than the follicular cancer subtype, and with a reduced incidence of the more aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancer [(89)](#reference89). While changes in iodine intakes appear to affect the [histological](../glossary#histology) type of thyroid cancer, it is not yet clear whether iodine deficiency and/or iodine excess increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of thyroid cancer [(88)](#reference88). Amiodarone, a medication used to prevent abnormal heart rhythms, contains high levels of iodine and may affect [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) function [(90, 91)](#reference90). Antithyroid drugs used to treat [hyperthyroidism](../glossary#hyperthyroidism), such as propylthiouracil (PTU), methimazole, and carbimazole, may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism). Additionally, the long-term use of lithium to treat mood disorders may increase the risk of hypothyroidism [(92)](#reference91). Further, the use of [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of potassium may decrease the [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) warfarin (coumarin) [(56)](#reference56). Perchlorate is an [oxidizing](../glossary#oxidation) agent found in rocket propellants, airbags, fireworks, herbicides, and fertilizer. Mainly as a result of human activity, perchlorate has been found to contaminate drinking water and many foods [(57)](#reference57). Chronic exposure to perchlorate concentrations at levels greater than 20 g per kg body weight (bw) per day interferes with iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and may lead to hypothyroidism [(93)](#reference93). The US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that daily oral exposure to perchlorate should not exceed 0.7 g/kg bw to protect the most sensitive population, i.e., the fetuses of pregnant women who might be deficient in iodine and/or hypothyroid [(94)](#reference94). Among all age groups, children aged two years have the highest estimated perchlorate intakes per day with 0.35-0.39 g/kg bw/day. Average estimated intakes of perchlorate in between 0.08 and 0.11 g/kg bw/day [(70)](#reference70). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for iodine is sufficient to ensure normal [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) function. There is presently no evidence that iodine intakes higher than the RDA are beneficial. Most people in the US consume sufficient iodine in their diets, making [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) unnecessary. Given the importance of sufficient iodine during prenatal development and infancy, pregnant and breast-feeding women should take a supplement that provides 150 g of iodine per day (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). Because aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for iodine, the LPI recommendation for iodine intake is not different for older adults.

It is a key element in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of all living organisms. Iron exists in two biologically relevant [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) states: the ferrous form (Fe2+) and the ferric form (Fe3+). Iron is an essential component of hundreds of [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) supporting essential biological functions, such as oxygen transport, energy production, [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), and cell growth and replication. [Heme](../glossary#heme) is an iron-containing compound found in a number of biologically important molecules (Figure 1). Some, but not all, iron-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) are heme-containing proteins (also called hemoproteins). Iron-dependent proteins that carry out a broad range of biological activities may be classified as follows [(1, 3)](#references): Iron-containing proteins support a number of functions, some of which are listed below. Globin-hemes are [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing [proteins](../glossary#protein) that are involved in the transport and storage of oxygen and, to a lesser extent, may act as [free radical](../glossary#free-radical) [scavengers](../glossary#scavenge) [(1)](#references). [Hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) is the primary protein found in red blood cells and represents about two-thirds of the body's iron [(3)](#reference3). The vital role of hemoglobin in transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body is derived from its unique ability to acquire oxygen rapidly during the short time it spends in contact with the lungs and to release oxygen as needed during its circulation through the tissues. [Myoglobin](../glossary#myoglobin) functions in the transport and short-term storage of oxygen in muscle cells, helping to match the supply of oxygen to the demand of working muscles [(1)](#references). A third globin called neuroglobin is preferentially expressed in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), but its function is not well understood [(4)](#reference4). Cytochromes are [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) that have important roles in [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [electron](../glossary#electron) transport required for cellular energy production and thus life. Specifically, cytochromes serve as electron carriers during the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [ATP](../glossary#ATP), the primary energy storage compound in cells. [Cytochrome P450](../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) is a family of enzymes involved in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of a number of important biological molecules (including organic acids; [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid); [prostaglandins](../glossary#prostaglandin); [steroids](../glossary#steroid); sterols; and vitamins A, D, and K), as well as in the detoxification and metabolism of drugs and pollutants. Nonheme iron-containing enzymes in the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle), such as NADH dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, are also critical to energy metabolism [(1)](#references). Catalase and some peroxidases are [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) that protect cells against the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, a potentially damaging [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS), by [catalyzing](../glossary#catalyst) a reaction that converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. As part of the immune response, some white blood cells engulf [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) and expose them to ROS in order to kill them. The [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of one such ROS, hypochlorous acid, by [neutrophils](../glossary#neutrophil) is catalyzed by the catalyzes the iodination of thyroglobulin the production of thyroid [hormones](../glossary#hormone) such that thyroid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) can be impaired in iron deficiency and iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) (see [Nutrient Interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). Inadequate oxygen (hypoxia), such as that experienced by those who live at high altitudes or those with chronic lung disease, induces compensatory physiologic responses, including increased red blood cell formation ( [erythropoiesis](../glossary#erythropoiesis)), increased blood vessel growth ( [angiogenesis](../glossary#angiogenesis)), and increased production of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) utilized in [anaerobic](../glossary#anaerobic) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). Hypoxia is also observed in conditions and [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) disorders. [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor) known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) bind to response elements in [genes](../glossary#gene) that encode various [proteins](../glossary#protein) involved in compensatory responses to hypoxia and increase their [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). Iron-dependent enzymes [FIH-1]), have been implicated in HIF regulation. When cellular oxygen tension is adequate, newly synthesized HIF- subunits (HIF-1, HIF-2, that degradation. FIH-1-induced asparaginyl recruitment [transcriptional](../glossary#transcription) complex and therefore prevents HIF- transcriptional activity. When cellular oxygen tension drops below a critical threshold, prolyl hydroxylase can no longer target HIF- for degradation, allowing HIF- to bind to HIF-1 and form a transcription complex that enters the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) and binds to specific hypoxia response elements (HRE) on target genes like the required for [DNA](../glossary#DNA) replication. RNRs also facilitate DNA repair in response to DNA damage. Other enzymes essential for DNA synthesis and repair, such as DNA polymerases and DNA helicases, are Fe-S cluster [proteins](../glossary#protein). Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, depletion of intracellular iron was found to inhibit cell cycle progression, growth, and division. Inhibition of [heme](../glossary#heme) synthesis also induced cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells [(6)](#reference6). Iron is required for a number of additional vital functions, including growth, reproduction, healing, and immune function. While iron is an essential [mineral](../glossary#mineral), it is potentially toxic because free iron inside the cell can lead to the generation of [free radicals](../glossary#free-radical) causing [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and cellular damage. Thus, it is important for the body to systemically regulate iron [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis). The body tightly regulates the transport of iron throughout various body compartments, such as developing red blood cells (erythroblasts), circulating [macrophages](../glossary#macrophage), liver cells (hepatocytes) that store iron, and other tissues [(7)](#reference7). Intracellular iron concentrations are regulated according to the body's iron needs (see below), but extracellular signals also regulate iron homeostasis in the body through the action of hepcidin. Hepcidin, a [peptide](../glossary#peptide) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) primarily [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by liver cells, is the key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin can induce the internalization and degradation of the iron-efflux protein, ferroportin-1; ferroportin-1 regulates the release of iron from certain cells, such as [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte), hepatocytes, and iron-recycling macrophages, into [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [(8)](#reference8). When body iron concentration is low and in situations of iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia), hepcidin [expression](../glossary#expression) is minimal, allowing for iron absorption from the diet and iron mobilization from body stores. In contrast, when there are sufficient iron stores or in the case of iron overload, hepcidin inhibits dietary iron absorption, promotes cellular iron sequestration, and reduces iron [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). Hepcidin expression is up-regulated in conditions of deficiency due to [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the hepcidin gene, HAMP, causes abnormal iron accumulation in tissues (see [Iron Overload](#iron-overload)). Of note, hepcidin is also thought to have a major [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) role in the [innate immune response](../micronutrients-health/immunity#innate-immunity) by limiting iron availability to invading microorganisms (see [Iron withholding defense during infection](#iron-withholding-defense-infection)) [(10)](#reference10). Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are in the messenger RNAs ( [mRNAs](../glossary#mRNA)) that code for key [proteins](../glossary#protein) in the regulation of iron storage, transport, and utilization. Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs: IRP-1, IRP-2) can bind to IREs and control mRNA stability and [translation](../glossary#translation), thereby regulating the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of specific proteins, such as ferritin (iron storage protein) and transferrin receptor-1 (TfR; controls cellular iron uptake) [(1, 2)](#references). When the iron supply is low, iron is not available for storage or release into [plasma](../glossary#plasma). Less iron binds to IRPs, allowing the binding of IRPs to IREs. The binding of IRPs to IREs located in the 5'end of mRNAs coding for ferritin and ferroportin-1 (iron efflux protein) inhibits mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Translation of mRNA that codes for the key regulatory [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) of [heme](../glossary#heme) synthesis in immature red blood cells is also reduced to conserve iron. In contrast, IRP binding to IREs in the 3' end of mRNAs code for TfR and divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) stimulates the synthesis of iron transporters, thereby increasing iron uptake into cells [(1, 2)](#references). When the iron supply is high, more iron binds to IRPs, thereby preventing the binding of IRPs to IREs on mRNAs. This allows for an increased synthesis of proteins involved in iron storage (ferritin) and efflux (ferroportin-1) and a decreased synthesis of iron transporters (TfR and DMT1) such that iron uptake is limited [(2)](#reference2). In the brain, IRPs are also prevented from binding to the 5'end of amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA, allowing for APP expression. APP stimulates iron efflux from [neurons](../glossary#neuron) through stabilizing ferroportin-1. In [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) (PD), APP expression is inappropriately suppressed, leading to iron accumulation in dopaminergic neurons [(11, 12)](#reference11). Iron is required by most infectious agents to grow and spread, as well as by the infected host in order to mount an effective immune response. Sufficient iron is critical for the [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) and [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) of T [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) and the generation of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) required for killing [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), hepcidin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) is up-regulated, [serum](../glossary#serum) iron concentrations decrease, and concentrations of ferritin (the iron storage protein) increase, supporting the idea that sequestering iron from pathogens is an important host defense mechanism [(2)](#reference2). Total body content of iron in adults is estimated to be 2.3 g in women and 3.8 g in men [(2)](#reference2). The body [excretes](../glossary#excretion) very little iron; basal losses, [menstrual](../glossary#menstruation) blood loss, and the need of iron for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of new tissue are compensated by the daily absorption of a small proportion of dietary iron (1 to 2 mg/day). Body iron is primarily found in red blood cells, which contain 3.5 mg of iron per g of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin). Senescent red blood cells are engulfed by [macrophages](../glossary#macrophage) in the spleen, and about 20 mg of iron can be recovered daily from [heme](../glossary#heme) recycling. The released iron is either deposited to the ferritin of spleen macrophages or exported by ferroportin-1 (iron efflux protein) to transferrin (the main iron carrier in blood) that delivers iron to other tissues. Iron recycling is very efficient, with about 35 mg being recycled daily [(1)](#references). Measurements of iron stores, circulating iron, and [hematological](../glossary#hematology) parameters may be used to assess the iron status of healthy people in the absence of [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) disorders, parasitic infection, and [obesity](../glossary#obesity). Commonly used iron status [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) include [serum](../glossary#serum) ferritin (iron-storage protein), serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and saturation of transferrin (the main iron carrier in blood; TSAT). Soluble transferrin [receptor](../glossary#receptor) (sTfR) is also an indicator of iron status when iron stores are depleted. In iron deficiency and iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia), the abundance of cell surface-bound transferrin receptors that bind diferric transferrin is increased in order to maximize the uptake of available iron. Therefore, the concentration of sTfR generated by the cleavage of cell-bound transferrin receptors is increased in iron deficiency. Hematological markers, including [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume of red blood cells, and reticulocyte hemoglobin content can help detect abnormality if anemia is present [(9](#reference9), [14)](#reference14). Of note, [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation). Importantly, serum hepcidin concentration is also increased by inflammation to limit iron availability to [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen). Therefore, it is important to include inflammation markers (e.g., [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein), fibrinogen) when assessing iron status to rule out inflammation [(14)](#reference14). [Vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) deficiency often coexists with iron deficiency and may exacerbate iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) by altering iron [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(15)](#reference15). Vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) has been shown to have beneficial effects on iron-deficiency anemia and improve iron nutritional status among children and pregnant women [(15, 16)](#reference15). The combination of vitamin A and iron seems to reduce anemia more effectively than either supplemental iron or vitamin A alone [(17)](#reference17). Vitamin A may facilitate the mobilization of iron from storage sites to developing red blood cells for incorporation into [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) [(15, 16)](#reference15). Moreover, studies in rats have shown that iron deficiency alters [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and liver levels of vitamin A [(18, 19)](#reference18). Adequate [copper](copper) nutritional status is necessary for normal iron [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and red blood cell formation. [Anemia](../glossary#anemia) is a clinical sign of copper deficiency, and iron has been found to accumulate in the livers of copper-deficient animals, indicating that copper (via copper-containing [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin)) is required for iron transport to the bone marrow for red blood cell formation [(20)](#reference20). The connection between copper availability and iron metabolism has also been established in humans; copper deficiency can lead to secondary ceruloplasmin deficiency and hepatic iron overload and/or [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) [(21)](#reference21). Oral copper [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) restored normal ceruloplasmin levels and plasma ferroxidase activity and corrected the iron metabolism disorder in a copper-deficient subject [(22)](#reference22). Moreover, infants fed a high-iron formula absorbed less copper than infants fed a low-iron formula, suggesting that high iron intakes may interfere with copper absorption in infants [(23)](#reference23). [Zinc](zinc) is essential to maintain adequate [erythropoiesis](../glossary#erythropoiesis). When zinc deficiency coexists with iron deficiency, it may exacerbate iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) [(24)](#reference24). On the other hand, high doses of iron [supplements](../glossary#supplement), taken together with zinc supplements on an empty stomach, may inhibit the absorption of zinc. When taken with food, supplemental iron does not appear to inhibit zinc absorption. Iron- [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods have not been found to impair zinc absorption [(25, 26)](#reference25). The presence of [calcium](calcium) decreases iron absorption from both nonheme (i.e., most [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and food sources other than meat, poultry, and seafood) and [heme](../glossary#heme) sources [(27)](#reference27). However, calcium supplementation up to 12 weeks has not been found to change iron nutritional status, probably due to a compensatory increase in iron absorption [(28)](#reference28). Individuals taking iron supplements should take them two hours apart from calcium-rich food or supplements to maximize iron absorption. Severe iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) can impair [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in the following ways: (1) by altering the thyroid-stimulating [hormone](../glossary#hormone) response of the [pituitary gland](../glossary#pituitary-gland); (2) by reducing the activity of thyroid peroxidase that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the iodination of thyroglobulin for the production of thyroid hormones; and (3) in the liver by limiting the conversion of T4 to T3, increasing T3 turnover, and decreasing T3 binding to [nuclear](../glossary#nucleus) [receptors](../glossary#receptor) [(29)](#reference29). It is estimated that [goiter](../glossary#goiter) and iron-deficiency anemia coexist in up to 25% of school-age children in west and north Africa [(30)](#reference30). A [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in iron-deficient children with goiter showed a greater reduction in thyroid size following the consumption of iodized salt together with 60 mg/day of iron four times per week compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(31)](#reference31). Additional [interventions](../glossary#intervention-trial) have confirmed that correcting iron-deficiency anemia improved the efficacy of [iodine](iodine) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) to mitigate thyroid disorders (reviewed in [29, 30](#reference29)). Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in the US and the world. Levels of iron deficiency are listed below from least to most severe. Iron stores are depleted, but the functional iron supply is not limited. Before the development of frank [anemia](../glossary#anemia), the supply of functional iron to tissues, including bone marrow, is inadequate such as to impair [erythropoiesis](../glossary#erythropoiesis). By definition, [anemia](../glossary#anemia) is present when individual [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentrations fall below two standard deviations of the distribution mean for hemoglobin in a healthy population of the same gender and age and living at the same altitude [(32)](#reference32). In 2013, iron-deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability in children and adolescents in the 50 most populous countries. The countries with the highest [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of iron-deficiency anemia in individuals younger than 19 years were Afghanistan (41%) and Yemen (39.8%); India contributed the largest number of cases of anemia (147.9 million). The prevalence in the US was estimated to be 19.3% with nearly 16 million cases of iron-deficiency anemia in children and adolescents [(33)](#reference33). Iron-deficiency anemia occurs when there is inadequate iron to support normal red blood cell formation. The anemia of iron deficiency is usually characterized as microcytic and hypochromic, i.e., red blood cells are measurably smaller than normal and their hemoglobin content is decreased such that they are paler than normal. At this stage of iron deficiency, symptoms may be a result of inadequate oxygen delivery due to anemia and/or suboptimal function of iron-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Changes in [hematological](../glossary#hematology) parameters are used in the clinical diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (see [Assessment of iron status](#iron-status-assessment)). It is important to remember that iron deficiency is not the only cause of anemia, and that the diagnosis or treatment of iron deficiency solely on the basis of anemia may lead to misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment of the underlying cause [(34)](#reference34). See also the articles on [Folate](../vitamins/folate#deficiency) and [Vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12#deficiency) for information on other nutritional causes of anemia. Most of the symptoms of iron deficiency are a result of the associated [anemia](../glossary#anemia) and may include fatigue, rapid heart rate, palpitations, and rapid breathing on exertion. Iron deficiency impairs athletic performance and physical work capacity in several ways. In iron-deficiency anemia, the reduced [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) content of red blood cells results in decreased oxygen delivery to active tissues. Decreased [myoglobin](../glossary#myoglobin) levels in muscle cells limit the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) for [oxidative](../glossary#oxidation) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). Iron depletion also decreases the oxidative capacity of muscle by diminishing the mitochondrial content of cytochromes and other iron-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) [(35)](#reference35). Poor [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) function and impaired thyroid [hormone](../glossary#hormone) synthesis likely disrupt the ability to maintain a normal body temperature on exposure to cold in iron-deficient individuals (see [Function](#function)). Iron deficiency may also impair [neutrophil](../glossary#neutrophil) [phagocytosis](../glossary#phagocytosis) and microbicidal activity and T- [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) [proliferative](../glossary#proliferation) responses to infection [(1)](#references). Severe iron-deficiency anemia may result in brittle and spoon-shaped nails, sores at the corners of the mouth, taste bud [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy), and a sore tongue. In rare cases, advanced iron-deficiency anemia may cause difficulty in swallowing due to the formation of webs of tissue in the throat and [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus) due to a degradation of the pharyngeal muscles [(36)](#reference36). The development of esophageal webs, also known as Plummer-Vinson syndrome, may require a genetic predisposition in addition to iron deficiency. Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia in early childhood have been shown to impair psychomotor development and induce short- and long-term behavioral and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) alterations (reviewed in [37](#reference37)). Further, pica, a behavioral disturbance characterized by the consumption of non-food items, may be a symptom and a cause of iron deficiency [(38)](#reference38). Neonates and infants up to six months of age: Inadequate maternal iron body stores and [anemia](../glossary#anemia) during pregnancy may reduce the duration of [gestation](../glossary#gestation) and birth weight; preterm and/or low body-weight newborns are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of iron-deficiency anemia [(14)](#reference14). Pregnancy complications, including [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) and gestational [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), may also lead to low iron stores in preterm and term infants [(14)](#reference14). Most of the 150 to 250 mg of iron present in a full-term healthy newborn is accumulated during the third trimester of pregnancy and is sufficient for the first four to six months of life [(34)](#reference34). Iron stores are essential for infants less than six months of age because breast milk is relatively poor in iron (0.2 mg/L-0.4 mg/L), and intestinal absorption of iron remains low until six months of age. High iron requirements during this period of sustained and rapid growth rate can worsen the deficit in body iron in preterm infants [(14)](#reference14). Moreover, a review of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) suggested that infants with an early umbilical cord clamping (1 min after birth) are at least twice more likely to be iron-deficient at three to six months compared to those with delayed cord clamping [(39)](#reference39). Yet, healthy full-term infants have little need for external sources of iron before six months of age [(1)](#references). Infants and children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years: A full-term infant's iron stores are usually sufficient to last for the early months of life, but there is an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of iron deficiency for infants older than six months [(1)](#references). Given the sustained need of iron for increasing tissue mass, blood volume, and replenishing iron stores, the recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for iron is 11 mg/day for infants aged seven to 12 months, as established by the US Institute of Medicine (see [Table 1](#table-1)). The RDA for iron is 7 mg/day for toddlers aged 1 to 3 years old. Based on the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 data, the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of iron deficiency in toddlers aged 12 to 35 months varies from 6.6%-15.2%, and the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia is 0.9%-4.4%, depending on ethnicity and socioeconomic status [(14)](#reference14). Of note, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend universal screening for anemia at one year of age. Yet, a recent report by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated there was insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus harms of screening [(34](#reference34), [40)](#reference40). Adolescents: Early adolescence is period of rapid growth. Blood loss that occurs with [menstruation](../glossary#menstruation) in adolescent girls adds to the increased iron requirement of adolescence [(1)](#references). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of iron is 11 mg/day and 15 mg/day for adolescent boys and girls, respectively (see [Table 1](#table-1)). Nonpregnant women of childbearing age: Based on data from NHANES 2003-2006, the percentage of US women with two out of three markers of iron status (i.e., [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin), ferritin, and % transferrin saturation) below cutoff values for deficiency was 9.8% in nonpregnant women [(41)](#reference41). The use of oral contraceptives decreases [menstrual](../glossary#menstruation) blood losses and is thus associated with improved iron status compared to intrauterine devices (copper coil) [(1)](#references). Breast-feeding is associated with lower dietary iron needs, allowing for the [repletion](../glossary#replete) of iron stores depleted during pregnancy and delivery. However, iron repletion may be incomplete in high-parity women who are therefore at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of iron deficiency [(41)](#reference41). Pregnant women: The requirement for iron is significantly increased during pregnancy due to increased iron utilization by the developing fetus and [placenta](../glossary#placenta), as well as maternal blood volume expansion [(42)](#reference42). Analysis of data from NHANES 2005-2006 found that 18.1% of pregnant women (mean age, 27.5 years) were deficient in iron, as assessed by the log ratio of soluble transferrin receptor to [serum](../glossary#serum) ferritin [(43)](#reference43). The [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of iron deficiency was greater during the second (20.7%) and third (29.7%) trimesters compared to the first trimester (4.5%) of [gestation](../glossary#gestation). Further, iron deficiency in pregnancy was found to be more prevalent in Mexican (23.6%) and Black Americans (29.6%) than in non-Hispanic White Americans (13.9%) [(43)](#reference43). Chronic bleeding or acute blood loss may result in iron deficiency. One milliliter (mL) of blood with a [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentration of 150 g/L contains 0.5 mg of iron. Thus, chronic loss of very small amounts of blood may result in iron deficiency. Parasitic infestation: A common cause of chronic blood loss and iron deficiency in developing countries is intestinal parasitic infection [(44)](#reference44). Frequent blood donation: Individuals who donate blood frequently, especially [menstruating](../glossary#menstruation) women, may need to increase their iron intake to prevent deficiency because each 500 mL of blood donated contains between 200 and 250 mg of iron [(45, 46)](#reference45). Regular intense exercise: Daily iron losses have been found to be greater in athletes involved in intense endurance training. This may be due to expanding blood cell mass and muscle mass, increased microscopic bleeding from the [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract (with the regular use of anti-inflammatory drugs), or increased fragility and [hemolysis](../glossary#hemolysis) of red blood cells [(47)](#reference47). The Food and Nutrition Board estimates that the average requirement for iron may be 30% higher for those who engage in regular intense exercise Celiac disease: [Celiac disease](../glossary#celiac-disease) (celiac estimated to occur in 1% of the population. When people with celiac disease consume food or products that contain gluten, the immune system response damages the intestinal mucosa, which may result in nutrient [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption) and iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) [(48)](#reference48). Atrophic gastritis: This condition is usually associated with the presence of [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) directed towards stomach cells and has been implicated in [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia) (see the article on [Vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12#atrophic-gastritis)). [Atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis) impairs the absorption of both vitamin B12 and iron; yet, in [menstruating](../glossary#menstruation) women, iron deficiency may occur years before the depletion of vitamin B12 body stores [(47)](#reference47). Helicobacter pylori infection: H. pylori infection is associated with iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia), especially in children, even in the absence of [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) bleeding. Data from NHANES 2000-2001 in individuals older than three years showed that the presence of iron deficiency (based on [serum](../glossary#serum) ferritin concentrations) was 40% more [prevalent](../glossary#prevalent) in those infected with H. pylori than in H. pylori-free individuals [(49)](#reference49). Occult gastrointestinal bleeding and competition for dietary iron by [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) may explain iron deficiency in infected individuals. Moreover, Helicobacter pylori infection may also play a role in the pathogenesis of [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis) [(47)](#reference47). Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): Iron-deficiency patients with [IBD](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease) (e.g., [ulcerative colitis](../glossary#ulcerative-colitis), [Crohn's disease](../glossary#crohn-disease)), likely due to both impaired intestinal absorption of iron and blood loss from ulcerated mucosa [(50)](#reference50). Gastric bypass surgery: Some types of gastric bypass (bariatric) surgery increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of iron deficiency by causing [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption) of iron, among other nutrients [(51)](#reference51). Obesity: An [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between body weight and iron status has been reported in several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in children and adults [(52, 53)](#reference52). Higher hepcidin expression in [obese](../glossary#obesity) people may impair iron absorption despite adequate dietary intake of iron. Weight loss might lower [serum](../glossary#serum) hepcidin concentration and improve iron status in obese individuals [(9)](#reference9). Anemia of chronic disease: [Acute](../glossary#acute) and chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) may lead to abnormally low circulating concentrations of iron and to the development of [anemia](../glossary#anemia). This type of anemia of inflammation, also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is commonly observed in inflammatory disorders, [cancer](../glossary#cancer), critical illness, trauma, chronic infection, and parasitic infestation. It is thought that anemia develops because dietary iron absorption and iron mobilization from body stores are inhibited by inflammation-induced hepcidin up-regulation (see also [Systemic regulation of iron homeostasis](#systemic-regulation-iron-homeostasis)) [(9)](#reference9). Vegetarian diet with inadequate sources of iron: Because iron from plants (nonheme iron) is less efficiently absorbed than that from animal sources (see [Sources](#sources)), the US Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimated that the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of iron from a vegetarian diet was only 10% versus 18% from a mixed Western diet. Therefore, the recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) of iron for individuals consuming a completely vegetarian diet may be 1.8 times higher than the RDA for non-vegetarians [(25)](#reference25). Yet, a vegetarian diet does not appear to be associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of iron deficiency when it includes [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains), [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), seeds, dried fruit, iron- [fortified](../glossary#fortification) cereal, and green leafy vegetables (see [Sources](#sources)) [(54)](#reference54). Chronic kidney disease (CKD): Iron losses in CKD patients are due to significant [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) blood loss (1.2 L blood loss/year corresponding to ~400 mg iron/year) compared to individuals with normal kidney function (0.83 mL blood loss/day corresponding to ~100 mg iron/year). Estimated blood losses are even larger in patients on [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis), and iron losses may be 1,000 to 2,000 mg/year or higher. Persistent [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) in CKD patients may also contribute to inadequate iron supply for red blood cell formation despite adequate body iron stores [(55)](#reference55). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for iron was revised in 2001 and is based on the prevention of iron deficiency and maintenance of adequate iron stores in individuals eating a mixed diet of iron deficiency or iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) can limit the impact of iron inadequacy and defective [erythropoiesis](../glossary#erythropoiesis) on the following health conditions and diseases. Iron is critical for the development of the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), and iron deficiency is thought to be especially detrimental during the prenatal and early postnatal periods. Iron-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) are required for energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(56)](#reference56). Most [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found relationships between iron deficiency \u2014 with or without [anemia](../glossary#anemia) \u2014 in children and poor [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) development, poor school achievement, and abnormal behavior patterns (reviewed in [37](#reference37)). Whether psychomotor and mental deficits may be attributed to the lack of iron, only, or to a combination effect of iron deficiency and low [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentrations \u2014 like in iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) \u2014 in early childhood remains unclear [(14)](#reference14). A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of six small [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials (published between 1978 and 1989) in children with iron-deficiency anemia younger than 27 months found no convincing evidence that iron therapy (for less than 11 days) had any consistent effect on measures of psychomotor and mental development within 30 days of treatment initiation [(57)](#reference57). Only one [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) trial in anemic, iron-deficient infants examined the impact of iron therapy for four months and found a significant benefit on indices of cognitive development that needs to be further confirmed [(58)](#reference58). A review of five [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in non-anemic, iron-deficient infants (0-9 months old) suggested an improvement in psychomotor (but not mental) development throughout the first 18 months of life [(59)](#reference59). Iron supplementation in early infancy (4 to 6 months) also failed to demonstrate any long-term effect on cognitive performance and school performance at the age of 9 years compared to placebo [(60)](#reference60). At present, evidence supporting any benefits of iron therapy on neurodevelopment outcomes in infants with iron deficiency, with or without anemia, remains limited. Iron therapy might be more effective at improving cognitive outcomes in older children with anemia and/or iron deficiency. A systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials found that iron supplementation had no effect on mental development of children under the age of 27 months but modestly improved scores of mental development in children over seven years of age [(61)](#reference61). A more recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of randomized controlled trials in children older than six years, adolescents, and women with iron deficiency, anemia, or iron-deficiency anemia suggested that supplemental iron could improve attention and concentration irrespective of participants' iron status [(62)](#reference62). A potential improvement in IQ measures with iron therapy was also reported in anemic participants regardless of their iron status. No additional benefits were observed regarding measures of memory performance, psychomotor function, and school achievements. Alterations in brain functions due to iron deficiency are likely to be resistant to iron therapy when they occur in early childhood. Long-term consequences of early life iron deficiency may include poor socioeconomic achievements and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of certain psychopathologies, including anxiety, depression, and [schizophrenia](../glossary#schizophrenia) [(56)](#reference56). [Epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) provide strong evidence of an association between severe [anemia](../glossary#anemia) in pregnant women and adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and neonatal and maternal mortality [(63)](#reference63). Although iron deficiency can be a major contributing factor to severe anemia, evidence that iron-deficiency anemia causes poor pregnancy outcomes is still lacking. In addition, iron supplementation during pregnancy was shown to improve iron status and [hematological](../glossary#hematology) parameters in women but failed to significantly reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight and/or prematurity, neonatal death, and [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) [(64)](#reference64). Moreover, routine supplementation during pregnancy had no effect on the length of gestation or newborn [Apgar scores](../glossary#Apgar-score) [(40)](#reference40). Nevertheless, most experts consider the control of maternal anemia to be an important part of prenatal health care, and the IOM recommends screening for anemia in each trimester of pregnancy [(65)](#reference65). The requirement for iron is greatly increased in the second and third trimesters, and the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for pregnant women is 27 mg/day of iron (see [The Recommended Dietary Allowance](#RDA)) [(25)](#reference25). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend screening all pregnant women for anemia and advise iron supplementation when required [(66)](#reference66). Nonetheless, the US Preventive Services Task Force [(40)](#reference40) and the American Academy of Family Physicians [(67)](#reference67) consider that evidence is lacking to evaluate the harms and benefits of screening for iron-deficiency anemia and supplementing with iron during pregnancy. In [malaria](../glossary#malaria)-endemic regions, however, iron supplementation may improve pregnancy outcomes when provided in conjunction with measures of prevention and management of malaria. Two recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials failed to find an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of malaria infection in both iron-deficient and iron- [replete](../glossary#replete) pregnant women supplemented with iron, supporting the use of universal iron supplementation in malaria-endemic countries that adopt malaria intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) [(68, 69)](#reference68). Children who are chronically exposed to lead, even in small amounts, are more likely to develop learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and have low IQs. Deficits in growth and [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) development may occur in the infants of women exposed to lead during pregnancy and lactation. In adults, lead toxicity may result in kidney damage and high blood pressure. Although the use of lead in paint products, gasoline, and food cans has been discontinued in the US, lead toxicity continues to be a significant health problem, especially in children living in inner cities [(70)](#reference70). In 2012, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set the reference value for blood lead concentration at 5 micrograms per deciliter (g/dL) to identify children at [risk](../glossary#risk). Yet, there is no known blood lead concentration below which children are 100% safe [(71)](#reference71). Iron deficiency and lead poisoning share a number of the same risk factors, including low socioeconomic status, ethnic minority groups, and residence in urban areas. Iron deficiency may increase the risk of lead poisoning in children, especially by increasing the intestinal absorption of lead via the DMT1 intestinal transporter [(72)](#reference72). However, the use of iron [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in lead poisoning might be reserved for children who are truly iron deficient or for iron- [replete](../glossary#replete) children with chronic lead exposure (e.g., living in lead-exposed housing) [(72)](#reference72). Restless legs syndrome (RLS; also called Willis-Ekbom disease) is a [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) movement disorder of unknown [etiology](../glossary#etiology). People with RLS experience unpleasant sensations resulting in an irresistible urge to move their legs and transient relief with movement. These sensations are more common at rest and often interfere with sleep [(73)](#reference73). The [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of RLS is higher in women than in men and increases with age [(74)](#reference74). This syndrome appears to be inherited in about 50% of patients but has also been related to chronic kidney failure [(73)](#reference73). Iron deficiency may be involved in RLS development, possibly by affecting the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate limiting iron-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter), dopamine [(74)](#reference74). The management of RLS includes iron therapy and the use of drugs like dopamine agonists [(73)](#reference73). Current clinical evidence is insufficient to evaluate whether iron therapy may help relieve some RLS symptoms [(74)](#reference74). Yet, the Medical Advisory Board of the Willis-Ekbom Disease Syndrome Foundation suggests that iron status should be assessed in all patients with RLS, and iron therapy be attempted on a case-by-case basis in those who might benefit from it [(73)](#reference73). The amount of iron in food or [supplements](../glossary#supplement) that is absorbed and used by the body is influenced by the iron nutritional status of the individual and whether or not the iron is in the form of [heme](../glossary#heme). Because it is absorbed by a different mechanism than nonheme iron, heme iron is more readily absorbed and its absorption is less affected by other dietary factors [(2)](#reference2). In an attempt to improve body iron status, iron absorption is enhanced in individuals who are [anemic](../glossary#anemia) or iron deficient compared to iron- [replete](../glossary#replete) individuals. [Heme](../glossary#heme) iron comes mainly from [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) and [myoglobin](../glossary#myoglobin) in meat, poultry, and fish. Although heme iron accounts for only 10%-15% of the iron found in the diet, it may provide up to one-third of total absorbed dietary iron [(54)](#reference54). The absorption of heme iron is less influenced by other dietary factors than that of nonheme iron [(27)](#reference27). Plants, dairy products, meat, and iron salts added to food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are all sources of nonheme iron. The absorption of nonheme iron is strongly influenced by enhancers and inhibitors present in the same meal [(27)](#reference27). Enhancers of nonheme iron absorption Inhibitors of nonheme iron absorption National surveys in the US have indicated that the average dietary intake of iron is 16 to 18 mg/day in men, 12 mg/day in pre- and postmenopausal women, and about 15 mg/day in pregnant women [(25)](#reference25). Thus, the majority of premenopausal and pregnant women in the US consume less than the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for iron, and many men consume more than the RDA (see [The Recommended Dietary Allowance](#RDA)). In the US, most grain products are [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with nonheme iron. The iron content of some relatively iron-rich foods is listed in milligrams (mg) in Table 2. For more information on the nutrient content of specific is about the size of a deck of cards.| Iron [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are indicated for the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Individuals who are not at [risk](../glossary#risk) of iron deficiency (e.g., adult men and postmenopausal women) should not take iron supplements without an appropriate medical evaluation. A number of iron supplements are available, and different forms provide different proportions of elemental iron. Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate is 20% elemental iron, ferrous sulfate monohydrate is 33% elemental iron, ferrous gluconate is 12% elemental iron, and ferrous fumarate is 33% elemental iron. If not stated otherwise, the iron discussed in this article is elemental iron. Deregulation of intestinal iron absorption will result in iron overload because the body cannot [excrete](../glossary#excretion) excess iron [(2)](#reference2). However, iron overload due to prolonged iron [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) is very rare in healthy individuals without a genetic predisposition. Several genetic disorders may lead to [pathological](../glossary#pathology) accumulation of iron in the body despite normal iron intake. Supplementation of individuals who are not iron deficient should be avoided due to the frequency of undetected inherited diseases and recent concerns about the more subtle effects of chronic excess iron intake (see [Diseases associated with iron overload](#iron-overload-associated-diseases)). [Hereditary hemochromatosis](../glossary#hereditary-hemochromatosis) [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorders of iron [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) that result in iron accumulation in the liver, heart, and other tissues. Disorders may lead to [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) of the liver, [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) (heart muscle damage), hypogonadism, arthropathy (joint problems), and increased skin pigmentation (reviewed in [78](#reference78)). There are four main types of HH, which are classified according to the specific [gene](../glossary#gene) that is [mutated](../glossary#mutation). The most common type of HH, called Type 1 or HFE-related HH, results from mutations in the HFE gene [(79, 80)](#reference79). The majority of Type 1 HH cases are [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) for mutation C282Y G>A (rs1800560) in the HFE gene. Another mutation found in 4% of patients with Type 1 HH is H63D C>G (rs1799945) in the HFE gene. The [protein](../glossary#protein) encoded by the HFE gene is thought to play a role in regulating intestinal absorption of dietary iron and with sensing the body's iron stores [(81)](#reference81). HFE gene mutations are associated with an increased cellular uptake of iron. With a typical disease onset before age 30, juvenile hemochromatosis (HH Type 2) is much rarer than Type 1 HH and results from genetic mutations affecting either hemojuvelin (Type 2A) or hepcidin (Type 2B) function [(82)](#reference82). HH Type 3 results from mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 gene (TFR2), and HH Type 4 (also called Ferroportin disease) results from mutations in the gene encoding ferroportin-1 (SLC40A1), a protein important in the export of iron from cells (see [Regulation](#regulation)). Type 4 HH is the second most common inherited iron overload disorder after Type 1 HH [(78)](#reference78). Iron overload in HH is treated by [phlebotomy](../glossary#phlebotomy), the removal of 500 mL of blood at a time, at intervals determined by the severity of the iron overload. [Chelation](../glossary#chelate) therapy is an alternate option to deplete iron in HH patients who cannot undergo phlebotomy treatment. Individuals with HH are advised to avoid [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) iron, but generally not told to avoid iron-rich food. High-dose [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) regimens may worsen iron overload in patients with HH [(75)](#reference75). Alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged due to the increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of cirrhosis of the liver [(83)](#reference83). Genetic testing, which requires a blood sample, is available for those who may be at risk for HH, for example, individuals with a family history of hemochromatosis. Other genetic disorders leading to iron overload Friedreich's ataxia, and porphyria cutanea tarda [(2)](#reference2). may develop in individuals with severe hereditary [anemias](../glossary#anemia) that are not caused by iron deficiency. Excessive dietary absorption of iron may occur in response to the body's continued efforts to form red blood cells. Beta-thalassemia is characterized by defective [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) A [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) due to [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the -globin [gene](../glossary#gene). Patients affected by thalassemia intermedia do not require blood transfusion as do those affected by the most severe form of the disease (called thalassemia major), yet they develop iron overload due to increased intestinal iron absorption [(84)](#reference84). Other anemic patients at [risk](../glossary#risk) of iron overload include those with sideroblastic anemia, [hemolytic anemia](../glossary#hemolytic-anemia), pyruvate kinase deficiency, and thalassemia major, especially because they are treated with numerous transfusions. Patients with hereditary spherocytosis and thalassemia minor do not usually develop iron overload unless they are misdiagnosed as having iron deficiency and treated with large doses of iron over many years. Iron overload has also been associated with [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) and chronic liver diseases (metabolic, viral, and alcoholic) [(2)](#reference2). Toxic iron deposition in vital organs in [hereditary hemochromatosis](../glossary#hereditary-hemochromatosis) (HH) has been associated with an increased incidence of liver [cancer](../glossary#cancer), type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and [neurodegenerative disease](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease). Iron overload also increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) in HH-free individuals. Nevertheless, whether iron tissue accumulation in those unaffected by genetic disorders is due to high dietary iron intakes is not yet fully understood [(1)](#references). [Hereditary hemochromatosis](../glossary#hereditary-hemochromatosis) that is characterized by abnormal hepatic iron accumulation is a [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for liver [cancer](../glossary#cancer) (hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC). Iron accumulation is thought to function as a [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen) by increasing [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) that causes damage to and [DNA](../glossary#DNA). [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [observational an increased risk with the C282Y [mutation](../glossary#mutation) in the HFE [gene](../glossary#gene) of healthy participants and patients with chronic liver disease (see [Iron Overload](#iron-overload)) [(85)](#reference85). Other meta-analyses have reported associations between HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D and increased risks of overall cancer [(86, 87)](#reference86). However, studies reporting on HFE gene mutations and risk of cancer at extra-hepatic sites are rather scarce and/or inconsistent. Some, but not all, observational studies found significant associations between the C282Y mutation and risk of [colorectal](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) [(88)](#reference88), breast [(88, 89)](#reference88), and epithelial ovarian cancer [(90)](#reference90). The presence of the H63D mutation in the HFE gene was linked to an increased risk of [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia) [(91, 92)](#reference91) and [gastric](../glossary#gastric) cancer [(93)](#reference93). Whether high dietary iron could increase the risk of cancer in individuals without hemochromatosis has also been investigated. The consumption of red or processed meat (but not white meat), rich in [heme](../glossary#heme) iron, has been linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) [(94)](#reference94). Exposure to carcinogenic compounds (called heterocyclic amines) generated when meat is cooked at high temperatures and to carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds formed in the [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract following consumption of red and processed meat may explain such an association [(95)](#reference95). Several meta-analyses of observational studies have also suggested a potential association of heme iron in red meat with CRC [(96-98)](#reference96). This has been explained by an increased exposure of colonic cells to potentially damaging N-nitroso compounds and derived from heme iron- [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) reactions [(99)](#reference99). Further, recent results from the large European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study suggested a higher risk of [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) adenocarcinoma with high intakes of red/processed meat and heme iron [(100)](#reference100). Experimental studies have suggested a role for iron-induced [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) in vessel wall damage and the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis), which underlies most forms of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(101)](#reference101). However, [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) of iron nutritional status and cardiovascular disease in humans have yielded conflicting results. A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 [prospective cohort or [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) [MI]) did not find evidence to support the existence of strong associations between a number of different measures of iron status and CHD/MI [(102)](#reference102). Only individuals in the highest versus lowest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of [serum](../glossary#serum) transferrin saturation exhibited an 18% lower incidence of CHD/MI meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies found saturation and serum iron to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the [risk](../glossary#risk) of CHD. However, the authors noted that most studies failed to adjust for the [confounding](../glossary#confounder) effects of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) [(103)](#reference103). The review also reported an inverse association between CHD incidence and total dietary iron intake, but dietary [heme](../glossary#heme) iron was positively associated with CHD incidence [(103)](#reference103). Although the relationship between iron stores and CHD/MI requires further clarification, it would be prudent for those who are not at risk of iron deficiency (e.g., adult men and postmenopausal women) to avoid excess iron intake (see the [LPI Rx for Health](../../rx-health)). Individuals with [hereditary hemochromatosis](../glossary#hereditary-hemochromatosis) (HH) are known to be at a heightened [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(104)](#reference104). Increasing evidence also suggests a role for iron excess in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes independent of hemochromatosis. [Cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study), [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study), and [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have reported an increased risk of type 2 diabetes [(105)](#reference105) and [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) [(106)](#reference106) with high versus low ferritin concentrations (reflecting iron body stores) after adjustment for [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation). It is currently unclear how other indices of iron status relate to the risk of type 2 diabetes [(107-110)](#reference107). Iron overload-induced [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) in patients with HH to damage [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) -cells and impair [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion. In subjects free of HH, iron excess might damage the liver, interfering with [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and triggering insulin resistance, rather than impair -cell function [(111, 112)](#reference111). Iron removal by [phlebotomy](../glossary#phlebotomy) has been shown to improve metabolic parameters in subjects with type 2 diabetes [(113)](#reference113) and metabolic syndrome [(114)](#reference114). Additional [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether lowering body stores of iron will aid in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Iron is required for normal brain and nerve function through its involvement in cellular [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), as well as in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) and [myelin](../glossary#myelin). Deregulation of iron [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) has been observed disease) [(115-117)](#reference115). The abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain does not appear to be a result of increased dietary iron, but rather a disruption in the complex process of cellular iron regulation [(117)](#reference117). Brain iron accumulation can result in increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and the brain is particularly susceptible to [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage). Mechanisms behind the disruption of iron homeostasis in the brain of patients affected by neurodegenerative disease are actively being investigated. For example, studies using genetically modified mouse models indicated that the suppression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) by upstream [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) elevation [(11)](#reference11) or loss of Tau protein [(12)](#reference12) could impair [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) export of iron and lead to iron accumulation in specific brain regions affected in Parkinson's disease. A [pilot](../glossary#pilot-study), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease demonstrated oral administration of the iron [chelator](../glossary#chelate), deferiprone, for 12 months reduced iron deposition in the part of the brain called substantia nigra and improved motor performance without compromising systemic iron homeostasis [(118, 119)](#reference118). Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is the single largest cause of poisoning fatalities in children under six years of age. Although the oral lethal dose of elemental iron is approximately 180 to 250 mg/kg of body weight, considerably less has been fatal. Symptoms of [acute](../glossary#acute) toxicity may occur with iron doses of 20 to 60 mg/kg of body weight. Iron overdose is an emergency situation because the severity of iron toxicity is related to the amount of elemental iron absorbed. Acute iron poisoning produces symptoms in four stages: (1) Within one to six hours of ingestion, symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tarry stools, lethargy, weak and rapid pulse, low blood pressure, fever, difficulty breathing, and coma; (2) If not immediately fatal, symptoms may subside for about 24 hours; (3) Symptoms may return 12 to 48 hours after iron ingestion and may include serious signs of failure in the following organ systems: [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular), kidney, liver, [hematologic](../glossary#hematology) (blood), and [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system); and (4) Long-term damage to the central nervous system, liver ( [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis)), and stomach may develop two to six weeks after ingestion [(25](#reference25), [120)](#reference120). At therapeutic levels used to treat iron deficiency, iron [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may cause [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. Stools will often appear darker in color. Iron-containing liquids can temporarily stain teeth, but diluting the liquid helps to prevent this effect [(120)](#reference120). Taking iron supplements with food instead of on an empty stomach may relieve gastrointestinal effects. The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine based the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for iron on the prevention of gastrointestinal distress (Table 3). The UL for adolescents (14-18 years) and adults, including pregnant and breast-feeding women, is 45 mg/day. It should be noted that the UL is not meant to apply to individuals being treated with iron under close medical supervision. Individuals with [hereditary hemochromatosis](../glossary#hereditary-hemochromatosis) or other conditions of iron overload, as well as individuals with alcoholic [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) and other liver diseases, may experience adverse effects at iron intake levels below stomach acidity, such as antacids, histamine (H2) [receptor](../glossary#receptor) omeprazole, lansoprazole), may impair iron absorption. Taking iron [supplements](../glossary#supplement) at the same time as the following medications may result in decreased absorption and efficacy of the Therefore, it is best to take these medications two hours apart from iron supplements. Cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid), used to lower blood [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, should also be taken at least four hours apart from iron supplements because they may interfere with iron absorption [(121)](#reference121). Despite the critical functions of iron in the immune response, the nature of the relationship between iron status and susceptibility to infection, especially with respect to [malaria](../glossary#malaria), has been controversial. Because iron withholding is a recognized defense mechanism against [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) (see [Iron withholding defense during infection](#iron-withholding-defense-infection)), concerns have been raised regarding the safety of iron [supplementation](../glossary#supplement), especially in iron- [replete](../glossary#replete) children living in malaria-endemic regions [(122)](#reference122). Iron supplementation of children residing in the tropics has been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of clinical malaria and other infections like [pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia) [(123, 124)](#reference123). A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 24,076 children (ages, 1-35 months) living in a malaria-endemic region of eastern Africa (Tanzania) investigated the effects of supplemental iron and [folic acid](../vitamins/folate), with or without [zinc](zinc), compared to the effects of zinc alone or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo), on all-cause mortality and hospital admissions [(125)](#reference125). The administration of iron, folic acid, and/or zinc was found to increase the risk of serious adverse effects, hospital admission, and death, and was therefore prematurely halted. Further analyses of the trial revealed that iron-replete children were more likely than iron deficient-children (with or without [anemia](../glossary#anemia)) to be at risk of adverse effects following iron supplementation [(125)](#reference125). Such a potential risk of adverse effects with routine iron supplementation was not observed in preschool children in settings without malaria (southern Nepal) [(126)](#reference126). A recent review of 35 trials indicated that iron supplementation did not increase the risk of clinical malaria or other parasitic diseases, infections, and all-cause mortality in children living in malaria-endemic regions in which prevention and management of malaria are available [(127)](#reference127). Moreover, a pooled analysis of three high-quality trials demonstrated that supplemental iron combined with anti-malarial treatment protected children against clinical malaria and improved [hematological](../glossary#hematology) parameters [(127)](#reference127). The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends the provision of iron supplementation in infants and children, together with measures of malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in malaria-endemic areas [(128)](#reference128). Following the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for iron should provide sufficient iron to prevent deficiency without causing adverse effects in most individuals. Although sufficient iron can be obtained through a varied diet, a considerable number of people do not consume adequate iron to prevent deficiency. A [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) containing 100% of the daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for iron provides 18 mg of elemental iron. While this amount of iron may be beneficial for premenopausal women, it is well above the RDA for men and postmenopausal women. Since [hereditary hemochromatosis](../glossary#hereditary-hemochromatosis) is not uncommon and the effects of long-term dietary iron excess on [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) [risk](../glossary#risk) are not yet clear, men and postmenopausal women who are not at risk of iron deficiency should take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) without iron. A number of multivitamins formulated specifically for men or those over 50 years of age do not contain iron. Moderately elevated iron stores might be much more common than iron deficiency in middle-age and older individuals [(129)](#reference129). Thus, older adults should not generally take nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing iron unless they have been diagnosed with iron deficiency. Moreover, it is extremely important to determine the underlying cause of the iron deficiency, rather than simply treating it with iron supplements (see [The Recommended Dietary Allowance](#RDA)).

[(More information)](#pregnancy-complications) The use of magnesium supplementation is currently being explored in the management of various conditions, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, [asthma](../glossary#asthma) and pain. [(More information)](#disease-treatment) About half of the US adult population may have insufficient magnesium intakes to support nutritional adequacy. Dietary sources rich in magnesium include green leafy vegetables, unrefined grains, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), beans, and [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts). [(More information)](#food-sources) The tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for supplemental magnesium is 350 mg/day. Excessive intake of supplemental magnesium can result in adverse effects, especially in individuals with impaired kidney functions. [(More information)](#safety) Magnesium plays important roles in the structure and the function of the human body. The adult human body contains about 25 grams (g) of magnesium. About 50 to 60% of all the magnesium in the body is found in the skeleton and the remainder is found in soft tissue, primarily in muscle. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular [cation](../glossary#cation) after [potassium](potassium). Blood contains less than 1% of total body magnesium. Only the free, [ionized](../glossary#ion) form magnesium (Mg2+) active. [Protein](../glossary#protein)-bound and of free, ionized magnesium [(1)](#references). Magnesium is involved in more than 300 essential metabolic reactions, some of which are discussed below [(2)](#reference2). The [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [fats](../glossary#fat) to produce energy requires numerous magnesium-dependent chemical reactions. Magnesium is required by the adenosine triphosphate ( [ATP](../glossary#ATP))-synthesizing [protein](../glossary#protein) in [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria). ATP, the molecule that provides energy for almost all metabolic processes, exists primarily as a complex with magnesium (MgATP) [ (3)](#reference3). Magnesium is required for a number steps during of deoxyribonucleic acid acid ( [RNA](../glossary#RNA)), [proteins](../glossary#protein). the synthesis of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [lipids](../glossary#lipid) require magnesium for their activity. [Glutathione](../glossary#glutathione), an important [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), requires magnesium for its synthesis [(3)](#reference3). Magnesium plays a role in bone, [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), and [chromosomes](../glossary#chromosome) [(3)](#reference3). Magnesium is required for the of [ions](../glossary#ion) like [potassium](potassium) and [calcium](calcium) across [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Through its role in ion transport systems, magnesium affects the conduction of [nerve impulses](../glossary#nerve-impulse), muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm [Cell signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) requires MgATP for the [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of formation of the cell-signaling molecule, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP is involved in many processes, including the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) (see the articles on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) and [Calcium](calcium) for information on the role of PTH in the body) [(3)](#reference3). [Calcium](calcium) and magnesium concentrations in the fluid surrounding cells affect the migration of a number of different cell types. Such effects on cell migration may be important in wound healing [(3)](#reference3). High doses of [zinc](../minerals/zinc) in [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) form apparently interfere with the absorption of magnesium. One study reported that zinc supplements of 142 mg/day (well above the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) of 40 mg/day for zinc) in healthy adult males significantly decreased magnesium absorption and disrupted magnesium balance (the difference between magnesium intake and magnesium loss) [(4)](#reference4). Large increases in the intake of [dietary fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) have been found to decrease magnesium utilization in experimental studies. However, the extent to which dietary fiber affects magnesium nutritional status in individuals with a varied diet outside the laboratory is not clear [(2, 3)](#reference2). Dietary [protein](../glossary#protein) intake may affect magnesium absorption. One study in adolescent boys found that magnesium absorption was directly related to protein intake, with magnesium absorption the lowest when protein intake was less than 30 g/day [(5)](#reference5). The active form of [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) (calcitriol) may slightly increase intestinal absorption of magnesium [(6)](#reference6). However, it is not clear whether magnesium absorption is calcitriol-dependent as is the absorption of [calcium](calcium) and phosphate. High calcium intake has not been found to affect magnesium balance in most studies. Inadequate blood magnesium concentrations are known to result in low blood calcium concentrations, resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) action, and resistance to some of the effects of vitamin D [(2, 3)](#reference2). Magnesium deficiency in healthy individuals who are consuming a balanced diet is quite rare because magnesium is abundant in both plant and animal foods and because the kidneys are able to limit urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of magnesium when intake is low. The following conditions increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of magnesium deficiency [(7)](#reference7): Poor dietary intake, [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) problems, and increased urinary loss of magnesium may all contribute to magnesium depletion in people suffering from alcoholism. Older adults have relatively low dietary intakes of magnesium [(8, 9)](#reference8). Intestinal magnesium absorption tends to decrease with age, and urinary magnesium excretion tends to increase with age; thus, suboptimal dietary magnesium intake may increase the risk of magnesium depletion in the elderly [(2)](#reference2). Although severe magnesium deficiency is uncommon, it has been induced experimentally. When magnesium deficiency was induced in humans, the earliest sign was a decrease in [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentration. Hypomagnesemia usually describes serum [calcium](calcium) concentration also began to decrease (hypocalcemia) despite adequate dietary calcium. Hypocalcemia persisted despite increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis). Usually, increased PTH secretion quickly results in the mobilization of calcium from bone and normalization of blood calcium concentration. As the magnesium depletion progressed, PTH secretion diminished to low concentrations. In addition to hypomagnesemia, signs of severe magnesium deficiency included hypocalcemia, low serum [potassium](potassium) concentrations (hypokalemia), retention of [sodium](sodium), low circulating PTH concentrations, [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) and muscular symptoms ( [tremor](../glossary#tremor), muscle spasms, [tetany](../glossary#tetany)), loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and personality changes [(3)](#reference3). While mild magnesium deficiency may not elicit clinical symptoms, it may be associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(1)](#references). There currently no reliable indicator of magnesium [status](../glossary#status). The magnesium tolerance test, which basically determines magnesium retention (using 24-h urine collection) following the [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of magnesium, is considered to be the gold standard [(1)](#references). If this method is a good indicator of hypomagnesemia in adults, it appears to be poorly sensitive to changes in magnesium status in healthy people. Moreover, the method is invasive and cumbersome, and thus difficult to use routinely [(10)](#reference10). Another method to assess magnesium status is through measurements of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) ionized magnesium, which represents the physiologically active form of magnesium. However, it is unknown whether plasma ionized magnesium reflect body stores [(10)](#reference10). In practice, magnesium status is usually determined through assessments of dietary magnesium intake, [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentration, and/or urinary magnesium concentration [(10)](#reference10). However, each of these indicators has limitations. Although predominantly used in [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) and the sole indicator available to clinicians, serum magnesium concentration has been found to poorly respond to magnesium supplementation. Regarding dietary intakes of magnesium, about 30 to 40% of ingested magnesium is absorbed, yet absorption varies with the amount of magnesium ingested and with the food matrix composition. Finally, a state of magnesium deficiency has not been associated to a clear cutoff concentration of magnesium in the urine. Urinary magnesium concentration fluctuates rapidly with dietary intakes, but measurements of 24-hour urinary magnesium can be used in addition to other indicators to assess population status. Presently, a combination of all three markers \u2014 dietary, serum, and urinary magnesium \u2014 may be used to get a valid assessment of magnesium status (reviewed in [10](#reference10)). In 1997, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine increased the Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for magnesium, based on the results of tightly controlled [balance studies](../glossary#balance-study) that utilized more accurate methods of measuring magnesium (Table 1) [(2)](#reference2). Balance studies are useful for determining the amount of a nutrient that will prevent deficiency; however, such studies provide little information regarding the amount of a nutrient required for [chronic the concomitant presentation of several metabolic disorders in an individual, including dyslipidemia, [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), and [obesity](../glossary#obesity) [(11)](#reference11). People with metabolic [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), and some types of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(12-14)](#reference12). A 2015 analysis of data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2001-2010) in 9,148 adults (mean age, 50 years) found a 32% lower risk of metabolic syndrome in those in the highest versus lowest [quantile](../glossary#quantile) of magnesium intake (355 mg/day reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between dietary magnesium intake and risk of metabolic syndrome [(16-18)](#reference16). Moreover, lower [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentrations have been reported in individuals with metabolic syndrome compared to controls [(18, 19)](#reference18). However, circulating magnesium represents only 1% of total body stores and is tightly regulated; thus, serum magnesium concentrations do not best reflect magnesium status [(1)](#references). At present, additional evidence is needed from prospectively designed studies to inform the potential relationship between dietary and circulating magnesium and the risk of metabolic syndrome. Systemic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), which contributes to the development of metabolic disorders, has been inversely correlated with magnesium intakes in a cross-sectional study of 11,686 women (45 years). In this study, the lowest [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of metabolic syndrome was found in the group of women in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of magnesium intakes (median intake, 422 mg/day) [(20)](#reference20). Several reported a reduction in circulating [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) \u2014 a marker of inflammation \u2014 following oral magnesium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) [(21)](#reference21). This might constitute a potential mechanism through which magnesium could play a role in the prevention of metabolic disorders. Large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined the relationship between magnesium and blood pressure. However, the fact that foods high in magnesium (fruit, vegetables, whole grains) are frequently high in [potassium](potassium) and [dietary fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) has made it difficult to evaluate the independent effect of magnesium on blood pressure. Findings from large cohorts, including the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) [(22)](#reference22), the Nurses' Health Study Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study [(24)](#reference24), and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study [(25)](#reference25), have been summarized in a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(26)](#reference26). The pooled analysis of seven prospective studies showed an 8% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) with higher versus lower dietary magnesium intakes [(26)](#reference26). In one of these studies, data from 5,511 men and women followed for a median period of 7.6 years found that the highest concentrations of urinary magnesium corresponded to a 25% reduction in the risk of hypertension, whereas there was no association between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) magnesium concentrations and the risk of hypertension [(27)](#reference27). There was also no evidence of an association between circulating magnesium concentrations and the risk of hypertension in a meta-analysis of three prospective cohort studies [(26)](#reference26). The relationship between magnesium intake and risk of hypertension suggests that improving diet quality or using magnesium [supplements](../glossary#supplement) might play a role in the prevention of hypertension in those with inadequate dietary intakes. The buildup of plaque inside arterial walls \u2014 a process called [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) \u2014 is an early event in the development of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). The [calcification](../glossary#calcification) of atherosclerotic plaques that occurs with the progression of atherosclerosis has been associated with a three- to four-fold increase in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of cardiovascular events and mortality [(28)](#reference28). Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD): Abnormalities in mineral and bone [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) are not uncommon in individuals with impaired kidney function and have been associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) and mortality [(29, 30)](#reference29). In particular, elevated blood [phosphorus](phosphorus) concentration and increased deposition of [calcium](calcium) phosphate within the vasculature are thought to promote vascular [calcification](../glossary#calcification). Since magnesium can function as a calcium [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist), it has been suggested that it could be utilized to slow down or reverse the calcification of vessels observed in patients with CKD. In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in patients with pre-dialysis CKD, higher [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentrations were associated with lower coronary artery calcification density scores in those in the higher end of normal serum phosphorus concentrations (i.e., 3.4 mg/dL) [(31)](#reference31). One small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in participants with CKD examined the effect of oral, slow-release magnesium hydroxide on the calcification propensity of serum by measuring the time needed for primary calciprotein particles (containing amorphous calcium phosphate) to transform into secondary calciprotein particles (containing crystalline [hydroxyapatite](../glossary#hydroxyapatite)) [(32)](#reference32). Increased serum calcification propensity has been associated with greater risk of mortality in patients with impaired kidney function [(33, 34)](#reference33). The trial found an increase in serum magnesium concentration and a reduction in serum calcification propensity \u2014 i.e., an increase in the time needed for 50% of the transformation to occur (T50) \u2014 with 720 mg/day of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium for eight weeks compared to placebo [(32)](#reference32). Serum calcification propensity was also reduced when magnesium concentration was increased (from 1 to 2 mEq/L for 28 days) in the dialysate of patients with established kidney failure [(35)](#reference35). A larger [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in patients with pre-dialysis CKD is underway to examine further the effect of oral magnesium on markers of vascular calcification, markers of mineral and bone metabolism, incidence of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, and deterioration of kidney function [(36)](#reference36). Individuals with normal kidney function: The [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) analysis of data from 2,695 middle-aged participants in the Framingham Heart Study showed that the odds of having [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-arteries) [calcification](../glossary#calcification) was 58% lower in those in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of total magnesium intakes (median values, 427 mg/day versus 259 mg/day) [(37)](#reference37). magnesium concentration with vascular calcification in recent population-based cross-sectional studies [(38-40)](#reference38). No research has yet examined whether improving magnesium [status](../glossary#status) of generally healthy people could play a role in [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) prevention. Dietary magnesium intakes: Several large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), have examined magnesium intakes in relation to [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) outcomes. In the most recent analysis of the NHS, which followed nearly 90,000 female nurses for 28 years, those in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of magnesium intake had a 39% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) (but not nonfatal [coronary heart versus <246 mg/day) [(41)](#reference41). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine prospective cohort studies, mostly conducted in participants without [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) at baseline, reported a 22% lower risk of CHD per 200 mg/day incremental intake in dietary magnesium [(42)](#reference42). A more recent meta-analysis by Fang et al. [(43)](#reference43) included six studies and reported a 10% lower risk of CHD with higher versus lower dietary magnesium intakes. Higher magnesium intakes were associated with an 8 to 11% reduction in [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) risk in two meta-analyses of prospective studies, each including over 240,000 participants [(44, 45)](#reference44). The most recent pooled analysis of 14 studies found a 12% lower risk of stroke with higher versus lower magnesium intakes and estimated a 7% risk reduction of stroke associated with each 100-mg increment in daily magnesium intake [(43)](#reference43). Only two prospective studies have examined the risk of [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) in relation to magnesium intakes. The pooled analysis suggested a 31% lower risk of heart failure with higher dietary magnesium intakes [(43)](#reference43). Finally, a meta-analysis of 13 prospective studies in over 475,000 participants reported that the risk of total [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, including stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and CHD, was 15% lower in individuals with higher intakes of magnesium [(46)](#reference46). However, in the recent meta-analysis of eight studies by Fang et al. [(43)](#reference43), there was no association between dietary magnesium intake and risk of total cardiovascular disease. It is important to note that while these prospective cohort studies assessed the association between dietary magnesium and cardiovascular disease, they did not account for the use of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium by a significant fraction of participants. Serum magnesium concentrations: One large [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (almost 14,000 men and women) associated higher [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentrations with a lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of [CHD](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) in women but not in men [(47)](#reference47). This study was included in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four studies that showed no evidence of a reduced risk of CHD with increasing serum magnesium concentrations [(42)](#reference42). In contrast, a 0.2 mmol/L increment in serum magnesium concentration was associated with a 30% lower risk of total [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) in a pooled analysis of eight [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [(42)](#reference42). In the recently published British Regional Heart Study that followed 3,523 men for a mean 15 years, there was no association between serum magnesium concentration and incidental CHD events, yet serum magnesium concentration was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) [(48)](#reference48). A number of early studies found lower [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular)-related mortality in populations who routinely consume \"hard\" water. Hard ( [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline)) water is generally high in magnesium but may also contain more [calcium](calcium) and [fluoride](fluoride) than \"soft\" water, making the cardioprotective effects of hard water difficult to attribute to magnesium alone [(49)](#reference49). Additionally, [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have found no associations between magnesium intake and cardiovascular [(50)](#reference50) or all-cause mortality [(43)](#reference43). In a prospective analysis of NHANES data from 14,353 participants, followed for a median period of 28.6 years, the [risk](../glossary#risk) of all-cause and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) mortality was significantly increased in those with low rather than normal [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of magnesium than hypomagnesemia \u2014 in people with [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [(52)](#reference52). Occurrence of hypomagnesemia has been reported in patients who suffered from a subarachnoid [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (a type of [stroke](../health-disease/stroke)) caused by the rupture of a [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) aneurysm [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) outcomes following an (aSAH) have been linked to inappropriate [calcium](calcium)-dependent contraction of arteries (known as cerebral arterial vasospasm), leading to delayed cerebral [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) [(54)](#reference54). Because magnesium is a calcium [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) and potent several [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined whether [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium sulfate infusions could reduce the incidence of vasospasm after aSAH. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine randomized controlled trials found that magnesium therapy after aSAH significantly reduced vasospasm but failed to prevent neurologic deterioration or decrease the [risk](../glossary#risk) of death [(55)](#reference55). Another meta-analysis of 13 trials in 2,413 aSAH sufferers concluded that the infusion of magnesium sulfate had no benefit regarding neurologic outcome and mortality, despite a reduction in the incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia [(56)](#reference56). The post-hoc analysis of a small randomized controlled trial suggested that maintaining magnesium sulfate infusion for 10 days post-aSAH or until signs of vasospasm disappear might protect against secondary cerebral infarction when markers of [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction) and reduced brain perfusion are present [(57, 58)](#reference57). Current evidence does not support the use of magnesium supplementation in clinical practice for aSAH patients normalization. Atrial [arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia) (also called [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation)) is a condition defined as the occurrence of persistent heart rate abnormalities; such arrhythmias often complicate the recovery of patients after cardiac surgery. The use of magnesium in the [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) of postoperative atrial arrhythmia after [coronary artery bypass grafting](../glossary#coronary-artery-bypass-graft) has been evaluated as a sole or adjunctive agent to classical antiarrhythmic molecules (namely, -blockers and amiodarone) in several prospective, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 21 intervention studies showed [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium infusions could significantly reduce postoperative atrial arrhythmia in treated compared to untreated patients [(59)](#reference59). The results of a more recent meta-analysis of 22 [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials suggested that magnesium may effectively reduce atrial arrhythmia when administered post-operatively, as a bolus, and for more than 24 hours [(60)](#reference60). However, another meta-analysis of four trials found that magnesium was no more effective than other antiarrhythmic agents [(60)](#reference60). Moreover, the meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials also suggested that intravenous magnesium added to -blocker treatment did not decrease the risk of atrial arrhythmia compared to -blocker alone and was associated with more adverse effects (bradycardia and hypotension) [(61)](#reference61). Presently, high-quality evidence is still lacking to support the use of magnesium in the prophylaxis of post-operative atrial fibrillation and other in patients with contraindications to first-line antiarrhythmic agents [(60)](#reference60). Public health concerns regarding the epidemics of [obesity](../glossary#obesity) and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and the prominent role of magnesium in [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) have led scientists to investigate the relationship between magnesium intake and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed more than 25,000 individuals, 35 to 65 years of age, for seven years found no difference in incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus when comparing the highest (377 mg/day) [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of magnesium intake to the lowest quintile (268 mg/day) [(62)](#reference62). However, inclusion of this study in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight cohort studies showed that the [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 diabetes was [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with magnesium intake [(62)](#reference62). The most recent meta-analysis of 25 prospective cohort studies, including 637,922 individuals and 26,828 new cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, found that higher magnesium intakes were associated with a 17% lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus [(63)](#reference63). Several meta-analyses conducted to date reported an 8 to 15% decrease in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus with each 100 mg-increment in dietary magnesium intake [(63-66)](#reference63). [Insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), characterized by alterations in both [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion by the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) and insulin action on target tissues, has been linked to inadequate magnesium [status](../glossary#status). A [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) analysis of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, which included 15 cohorts with a total of 52,684 diabetes-free participants, showed that magnesium intakes were inversely associated with fasting insulin concentrations after multiple adjustments, including various lifestyle factors, [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI), caffeine intake, and [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) intake [(65)](#reference65). It is thought that pancreatic -cells, which secrete insulin, could become less responsive to changes in [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) in magnesium-deficient subjects [(67)](#reference67). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled healthy with significant hypomagnesemia ( [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentration 0.70 mmol/L) showed that daily consumption of 638 mg of magnesium (from a solution of magnesium chloride) for three months improved the function of pancreatic -cells, resulting in lower fasting glucose and insulin concentrations [(68)](#reference68). In a follow-up [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-contolled-trial), the administration of 382 mg/day of magnesium for four months to participants (mean age, 42 years) with both hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium concentration <0.74 mmoles/L) and impaired fasting glucose improved serum magnesium concentrations, as well as fasting and post-load glucose concentrations [(69)](#reference69). Other metabolic markers, including serum [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides), [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol, and a measure of insulin resistance, also improved in magnesium- versus placebo-treated individuals [(69)](#reference69). Additionally, similar metabolic improvements have been reported following the supplementation of magnesium (382 mg/day for four months) to participants who were both hypomagnesemic and lean yet metabolically obese (i.e., with metabolic disorders usually associated with obesity) [(70)](#reference70). In another study, supplementation with 365 mg/day of magnesium (from magnesium aspartate hydrochloride) for six months reduced insulin resistance in 27 overweight individuals with normal values of serum and intracellular magnesium [(71)](#reference71). This latter study suggests that magnesium might have additional effects on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity that go beyond the normalization of serum magnesium concentrations in hypomagnesemic individuals. Although decreased [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) is the primary feature of [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis), other osteoporotic changes in the [collagenous matrix](../glossary#collagenous-matrix) and [mineral](../glossary#mineral) composition of bone may result in bones that are brittle and more susceptible to [fracture](../glossary#fracture) [(72)](#reference72). Around 60% of total body magnesium is stored in the skeleton and is known to influence both bone matrix and bone mineral [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). Magnesium at the surface of bones is also available for dynamic exchange with blood [(73)](#reference73). As the magnesium content of bone mineral decreases, [hydroxyapatite](../glossary#hydroxyapatite) crystals of bone may become larger and more brittle. Some studies have found lower magnesium content and larger hydroxyapatite crystals in bones of women with osteoporosis compared to disease-free women [(74)](#reference74). Inadequate [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentrations are known to result in low serum calcium concentrations, resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) action, and resistance to some of the effects of vitamin D (calcitriol), all of which can lead to increased bone loss (see the articles on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) and [Calcium](calcium)). Lower serum magnesium concentrations may not be unusual in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [(75)](#reference75), and hypomagnesemia has been reported as an adverse effect of using the prescription drug teriparatide (Forteo) in the treatment of osteoporosis [(76)](#reference76). Higher dietary magnesium intakes have been associated BMD [(78)](#reference78) in [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), including studies of older adults. More recently, a large cohort study conducted in almost two-thirds of the Norwegian population found the level of magnesium in drinking water to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip fracture [(79)](#reference79). In the Women's Health Initiative study, data analysis from 4,778 participants (mean age, 63 years) followed for about seven years showed that higher magnesium intakes were associated with higher hip and whole-body BMD but not with reduced hip or total fractures [(80)](#reference80). Moreover, the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of total magnesium intakes was associated with a 23% increased risk of lower arm and wrist fractures [(80)](#reference80). In a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk study, which included 5,319 individuals, total magnesium and potassium intakes were found to be inversely associated with heel bone (calcaneus) broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) measurements \u2014 which are predictive of the risk of incidental fracture \u2014 and with the risk of hip fractures [(81)](#reference81). Few studies have addressed the effect of magnesium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on BMD or osteoporosis in humans. In a small group of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, magnesium supplementation of 750 mg/day for six months followed by 250 mg/day for 18 more months resulted in increased BMD at the wrist after one year, with no further increase after two years of supplementation [(82)](#reference82). A study in postmenopausal women who were taking [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) replacement therapy and a multivitamin supplement found that supplementation with an additional 400 mg/day of magnesium and 600 mg/day of calcium resulted in increased BMD at the heel compared to postmenopausal women receiving estrogen replacement therapy only [(83)](#reference83). A more recent randomized controlled study conducted in 20 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis suggested that high-dose supplementation with magnesium citrate (1,830 mg/day) for one month could reduce the rapid rate of bone loss that characterizes osteoporosis [(84)](#reference84). Evidence is not yet sufficient to suggest that supplemental magnesium in excess of the RDA could be effective in the prevention of osteoporosis unless normalization of serum magnesium concentration is required [(85)](#reference85). Sarcopenia is a condition characterized by a loss of skeletal muscle mass that increases frailty and [risk](../glossary#risk) of falls in older adults [(86)](#reference86). Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have reported a positive association between dietary magnesium intakes and proxy measures of skeletal muscle mass in middle-age and older adults [(87-90)](#reference87). A 2014 [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 139 physically active and healthy older women (mean age, 71.5 years) found little-to-no impact of magnesium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (900 mg/day of magnesium oxide) for 12 weeks on body composition and muscle strength, yet the Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] test score \u2014 a composite indicator of physical function \u2014 improved [(91)](#reference91). More research is needed to examine further the effect of magnesium supplementation on body composition, muscle strength, and physical performance in older adults, whether physically active or sedentary, and with normal or inadequate magnesium [status](../glossary#status). The use of [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of magnesium to treat specific disorders is discussed below. Although many of the cited studies utilized [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium at doses considerably higher than the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)), which is 350 mg/day set by the Food and Nutrition Board (see [Safety](#safety)), it is important to note that these studies were all conducted under medical supervision. Because of the potential side effects of high doses of magnesium, especially in the presence of impaired kidney function, any disease treatment trial using oral magnesium doses higher than the UL should be conducted under medical supervision. Moreover, [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium has been used in the management of several conditions. [Preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) and [eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia) are hypertensive disorders of pregnancy that may occur at any time after 20 weeks' [gestation](../glossary#gestation) and persist up to six weeks following birth. Preeclampsia (sometimes called toxemia of pregnancy) affects approximately 4% of pregnant women in the US [(92)](#reference92). Preeclampsia is defined as the presence of elevated blood pressure ( [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure)), [protein](../glossary#protein) in the urine, and severe swelling ( [edema](../glossary#edema)) during pregnancy [(93)](#reference93). Eclampsia occurs with the addition of [seizures](../glossary#seizure) to the triad of preeclamptic symptoms and is a significant cause of [perinatal](../glossary#perinatal) and maternal mortality [(93, 94)](#reference93). Although cases of preeclampsia are at high [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing eclampsia, one-quarter of eclamptic women do not initially exhibit preeclamptic symptoms [(95)](#reference95). Although lower magnesium concentrations have been reported in the blood and brain of women with preeclampsia than in healthy pregnant women, there is no evidence that magnesium imbalance may cause adverse pregnancy events. A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no effect of oral magnesium salt administration during normal and at-risk pregnancies on the risk of preeclampsia, perinatal mortality, and small-for-gestational age infants [(96)](#reference96). For many years, high-dose [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium sulfate has been the treatment of choice for preventing eclamptic seizures that may occur in association with severe preeclampsia in pregnancy or during labor [(97, 98)](#reference97). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of seven [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) trials in 1,396 women with eclampsia compared the effect of magnesium sulfate administration with diazepam (a known [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant)) treatment on perinatal outcomes. Risks of recurrent seizures and maternal death were significantly reduced by the magnesium regimen compared to diazepam. Moreover, the use of magnesium for the care of eclamptic women resulted in newborns with higher [Apgar scores](../glossary#Apgar-score); there was no significant difference in the risk of preterm birth and perinatal mortality [(95)](#reference95). Additional research has confirmed that infusion of magnesium sulfate should always be considered in the management of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia to prevent initial and recurrent seizures [(99)](#reference99). Moreover, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of magnesium sulfate \u2014 administered either intramuscularly or intravenously \u2014 as first-line treatment for the prevention of eclampsia in women with severe preeclampsia, in preference to other anticonvulsants [(100)](#reference100). Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium salt infusion in eclampsia [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) in women with mild preeclampsia [(101)](#reference101). In addition, it is unclear whether prolonging magnesium use post-partum in women who presented with severe preeclampsia during pregnancy is necessary to lower the risk of eclampsia after delivery [(102)](#reference102). While [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium sulfate is included in the medical care of [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) and [eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support its use in two additional situations: specific conditions of short-term prolongation of pregnancy and neuroprotection of the fetus in anticipated premature delivery [(103)](#reference103). Preterm birth, which is defined by the premature delivery of an infant between the 20th and 37th weeks of estimated [gestation](../glossary#gestation), is associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [perinatal](../glossary#perinatal) mortality and both short- and long-term morbidity. The ACOG approves the use of different classes of drugs \u2014 known as tocolytics \u2014 that are meant to delay delivery for long enough so that antenatal corticoids can be used to accelerate lung maturation in the fetus of women at imminent risk of preterm labor [(104)](#reference104). A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 37 trials found that intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate was no more efficacious than commonly used tocolytics (e.g., -adrenergic [receptor](../glossary#receptor) agonists, calcium channel blockers, prostaglandin inhibitors) in delaying delivery or preventing serious infant outcomes [(105)](#reference105). Very limited evidence also suggested that high- versus low-dose magnesium infusion may reduce the length of hospital stays in neonates admitted to intensive care units [(106)](#reference106). The relationship between magnesium sulfate and risk of [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) damage in premature infants has been assessed in [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study). A meta-analysis of six [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) and five [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) showed that the use of magnesium significantly reduced the risk of cerebral palsy, as well as mortality [(107)](#reference107). However, the high degree of [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among the cohort studies and the fact that [corticosteroid](../glossary#corticosteroid) exposure (which is known to decrease antenatal mortality) was higher in the cases of children exposed to magnesium compared to controls imply a cautious interpretation of the results. Nonetheless, a meta-analysis of five [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), which included 5,493 women at risk of preterm birth and 6,135 babies, found that magnesium therapy given to mothers delivering before term decreased the risk of cerebral palsy by 32% without causing severe adverse maternal events, but this treatment did not reduce the risk of other [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) impairments or mortality in early childhood [(108)](#reference108). Another meta-analysis conducted on five randomized controlled trials found that intravenous magnesium administration to newborns who suffered from perinatal [asphyxia](../glossary#asphyxia) could be beneficial in terms of short-term neurologic outcomes, although there was no effect on mortality [(109)](#reference109). Additional trials are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits of magnesium in pediatric care. While results from [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) have not been entirely consistent [(2)](#reference2), the latest review of the data highlighted a therapeutic benefit of magnesium [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in treating [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure). A 2012 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) examined [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials of magnesium supplementation conducted in 1,173 individuals with either normal blood pressure (normotensive) or hypertension (treated with medication or untreated). Oral supplementation with magnesium (mean dose of 410 mg/day; range of 120 to 973 mg/day) for a median period of 11.3 months significantly reduced [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) by 2 to 3 mm Hg and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) by 3 to 4 mm Hg [(110)](#reference110); a greater effect was seen at higher doses (370 mg/day). The results of 19 of the 22 trials included in the meta-analysis were previously reviewed together with another 25 intervention studies [(111)](#reference111). The systematic examination of these 44 trials suggested a blood pressure-lowering effect associated with supplemental magnesium in hypertensive but not in normotensive individuals. Magnesium doses required to achieve a decrease in blood pressure appeared to depend on whether participants with high blood pressure were treated with antihypertensive medications, including [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic). Intervention trials on treated participants showed a reduction in hypertension with magnesium doses from 243 mg/day to 486 mg/day, whereas untreated patients required doses above 486 mg/day to achieve a significant decrease in blood pressure. A more recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies with 2,028 participants found that supplemental magnesium at a median dose of 368 mg/day (range: 238-960 mg/day) for a median duration of three months (range: 3 weeks-6 months) increased [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentration by 0.05 mmol/L (27 trials) and reduced systolic blood pressure by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.78 mm Hg (37 trials) [(112)](#reference112). A 2017 meta-analysis restricted to trials in participants with underlying preclinical ( [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) or prediabetes) or clinical conditions (type mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) or [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease)) found a 4.18 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 2.27 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure with supplemental doses of magnesium ranging between 365 mg/day and 450 mg/day for one to six months [(113)](#reference113). While oral magnesium supplementation may be helpful in hypertensive individuals who are depleted of magnesium due to chronic diuretic use and/or inadequate dietary intake [(7)](#reference7), several dietary factors play a role in hypertension. For example, adherence to the DASH diet \u2014 a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy and low in [saturated](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and total fats \u2014 has been linked to significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures [(114)](#reference114). See the Blood Pressure](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/high-blood-pressure). [Vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells line arterial walls where they are in contact with the blood that flows through the circulatory system. Normally functioning vascular endothelium promotes [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation) when needed, for example, during exercise, and inhibits the formation of blood clots. Conversely, endothelial dysfunction results in widespread [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction) and [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities. In [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) is associated with the formation of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaques in arteries. [Atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) impairs normal endothelial function, increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of vasoconstriction and clot formation, which may lead to [heart attack](../health-disease/heart-attack) or [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) (reviewed in [115](#reference115)). A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified six [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the of [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of oral magnesium on vascular endothelial function [(116)](#reference116). Three out of six trials, which individuals with [coronary artery disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) [(117)](#reference117), [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) dilation (FMD) with [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium compared to control. In other words, the normal dilation response of the brachial (arm) artery to increased blood flow was improved. In contrast, there was no evidence of an effect of magnesium supplementation on FMD in three trials conducted in [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) patients [(120)](#reference120) or healthy participants with normal [(121)](#reference121) or high [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) [(122)](#reference122). A pooled analysis of the six trials in 262 participants found that supplementation with 107 to 730 mg/day of magnesium for one to six months resulted in an overall improvement of FMD, regardless of the health status or baseline magnesium concentrations of participants [(116)](#reference116). The measurement of the thickness of the inner layers of the [carotid arteries](../glossary#carotid-arteries) is sometimes used as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis [(123)](#reference123). Higher [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentrations have been associated with reduced carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in all women and in Caucasian men participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study [(124)](#reference124). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four small (145 participants in total) and [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneous) [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) found no effect of magnesium supplementation (98.6 to 368 mg/day for 2 to 6 months) on CIMT [(116)](#reference116). Results from several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have suggested that an [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium administered early after a suspected [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) could decrease the risk of death. The most influential study was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 2,316 patients that found a significant reduction in mortality in the group of patients given intravenous magnesium sulfate within 24 hours of suspected myocardial infarction (7.8% all-cause mortality in the experimental group vs. 10.3% all-cause mortality in the placebo group) [(125)](#reference125). Follow-up from one to five years after treatment revealed that the mortality from [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) was 21% lower in the magnesium-treated group [(126)](#reference126). However, a larger placebo-controlled trial in more than 58,000 patients found no significant reduction in five-week mortality in patients treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate within 24 hours of suspected myocardial infarction, resulting in controversy regarding the efficacy of this treatment [(127)](#reference127). A US survey of the treatment of more than 173,000 individuals with acute myocardial infarction found that only 5% were given intravenous magnesium in the first 24 hours post-infarction and that mortality was higher in this group compared to the group of patients not treated with magnesium [(128)](#reference128). A 2007 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 73,363 participants, concluded that intravenous magnesium administration does not appear to reduce post-myocardial infarction mortality and thus should not be utilized as a treatment [(129)](#reference129). Thus, the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction remains controversial. Magnesium depletion has been associated with type 1 ( [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-dependent) and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), as well as with [gestational](../glossary#gestation) diabetes. Low [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of magnesium (hypomagnesemia) have been reported in 13.5 to 47.7% of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus [(130)](#reference130). One cause of the depletion may be an increased urinary loss of magnesium caused by an increased urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. Magnesium depletion has been shown to increase [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) in a few studies and may adversely affect blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus (see also [Diabetes mellitus](#diabetes-prevention) under Disease Prevention) [(131)](#reference131). A small study in nine individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus reported that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium (300 mg/day for 30 days), in the form of a liquid, magnesium-containing salt solution, improved fasting insulin but not fasting glucose concentrations [(132)](#reference132). One [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 63 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypomagnesemia found that those taking an oral magnesium chloride solution (638 mg/day of elemental magnesium) for 16 weeks had improved measures of [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) and glycemic control compared to those taking a placebo [(133)](#reference133). The most recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine randomized, double-blind, controlled trials concluded that oral supplemental magnesium lowered fasting [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose concentrations in individuals with diabetes [(134)](#reference134). However, magnesium supplementation did not improve other markers of glucose [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis), such as [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) (HbA1c) concentration, fasting and post-glucose load insulin concentrations, and measures of insulin resistance [(134)](#reference134). Another meta-analysis of trials that included participants either at-risk of diabetes mellitus or with diabetes mellitus suggested that evidence to support a benefit of magnesium supplementation on measures of insulin resistance was stronger in subjects who were magnesium deficient than in those with normal serum concentrations of magnesium [(135)](#reference135). Correcting existing magnesium deficiencies may improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in subjects with diabetes, but it remains uncertain whether magnesium supplementation can have any therapeutic benefit in patients with adequate magnesium [status](../glossary#status). The occurrence of hypomagnesemia may be greater in patients with [asthma](../glossary#asthma) than in individuals without asthma [(136)](#reference136). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium infusions on acute asthmatic attacks in children or adults who did not respond to initial treatment in the emergency room. Indeed, magnesium can promote bronchodilation in subjects with asthma by interfering with mechanisms like the activation of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) [receptors](../glossary#receptor) that trigger bronchoconstriction through facilitating calcium influx in airway smooth muscle cells [(137)](#reference137). In a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six (quasi) [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 325 children with acute asthma treated with a short-acting 2-adrenergic receptor agonist (e.g., salbutamol) and systemic [steroids](../glossary#steroid), intravenous magnesium sulfate treatment improved measurements of the respiratory function and reduced the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hospital admission by 30% compared to control [(138)](#reference138). Another meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials primarily conducted in adults with asthma exacerbations indicated that single infusions of 1.2 to 2 g of magnesium sulfate over 15 to 30 minutes could reduce the risk of hospital admission and improve lung function after initial treatments failed (i.e., oxygen, short-acting 2 agonist, and steroids) [(139)](#reference139). The use of nebulized, inhaled magnesium for treating asthma has also been investigated. A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 25 randomized controlled trials, including adults, children, or both, found little evidence that inhaled magnesium sulfate alone or along with a 2-adrenergic receptor agonist and/or a muscarinic anticholinergic (e.g., ipratropium) could improve pulmonary function in patients with acute asthma [(140)](#reference140). In addition, oral magnesium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) is of no known value in the management of chronic asthma [(141-143)](#reference141). The potential analgesic effect of magnesium is attributed in particular to its capacity to block NMDA [receptors](../glossary#receptor), which are located in the brain and spinal cord and are involved in pain transduction [(144)](#reference144). Several intervention studies have examined the role of magnesium on pain control and analgesic requirement in patients during the immediate post-surgery period. After cesarean section: Pain management strategies after cesarean section usually involve the injection of an analgesic into either the epidural space (for epidural analgesia) or the subarachnoid space (for spinal [intrathecal] analgesia). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) summarized the evidence regarding the potential use of magnesium sulfate to control or relieve postoperative pain in 827 women who underwent cesarean section [(145)](#reference145). All the trials evaluated the effect of a first-line analgesic regimen (i.e., bupivacaine or lidocaine, with or without opioids) with and without the addition of magnesium sulfate. The results suggested that the anesthesia (8 studies) and sensory blockade (6 studies) lasted longer in women who received the additional magnesium sulfate. The use of magnesium sulfate also resulted in lower pain score (3 studies) and in lower postoperative consumption of analgesics (4 studies). Additionally, there was no difference in occurrence of side effects between regimens [(145)](#reference145). A recent randomized controlled trial in 60 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section confirmed that the addition of magnesium sulfate to a bupivacaine/opioid regimen increased the duration of spinal anesthesia and lowered the pain level, yet did not improve the potency of bupivacaine [(146)](#reference146). In another study in women with mild preeclampsia who received an epidural injection of ropivacaine after cesarean section, spinal infusion of magnesium sulfate increased the duration of sensory and motor blockade, as well as the time before patients requested an analgesic, compared to midazolam [(147)](#reference147). After a variety of other surgeries: The efficacy of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium has also been examined for local, regional, or systemic pain control following a range of different surgeries. A review of four small [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) suggested that, when added to local analgesics, magnesium infusion to patients undergoing tonsillectomy might decrease pain and incidence of [laryngospasm](../glossary#laryngospasm), extend the time to first post-operative analgesic requirement, and reduce the number of post-operative analgesic requests [(148)](#reference148). Similar observations were reported in two additional [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis), yet there was discrepancy regarding the ability of magnesium to alleviate pain [(149, 150)](#reference149). Indeed, the review of eight trials by Xie et al. [(150)](#reference150), of which only two scored pain using the same scale, showed no pain reduction with magnesium compared to control. Finally, both meta-analyses reported no reduction in risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting with intravenous magnesium administration [(148, 150)](#reference148). A 2018 meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials in 263 patients also suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion may help reduce pain scores at 2 and 8 hours (but not 24 hours) after laparoscopic [cholecystectomy](../glossary#cholecystectomy) [(151)](#reference151). Recent studies have examined the use of magnesium sulfate for pain control after other surgeries, including hysterectomy [(152, 153)](#reference152), spinal [(156)](#reference156) or cochlear implantation [(157)](#reference157) surgery. Despite conflicting results or reports of limited benefits of magnesium, further research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn. The effect of magnesium on [neuropathic](../glossary#neuropathy) pain has been examined in some clinical studies. The [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of magnesium sulfate was found to partially or completely alleviate pain in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, a type of neuropathic pain caused by herpes zoster infection (shingles) [(158, 159)](#reference158). In a more recent [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 45 patients with either postherpetic neuralgia or neuropathic pain of traumatic or surgical origin, oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) of magnesium failed to improve measures of pain and quality of life compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(160)](#reference160). Another trial is underway to examine the impact of intravenous magnesium with ketamine on neuropathic pain [(161)](#reference161). Lower intracellular magnesium concentrations (in both red blood cells and white blood cells) have been reported in individuals who suffer from recurrent [migraine headaches](../glossary#migraine-headache) compared to migraine-free individuals [(162)](#reference162). Additionally, the incidence of hypomagnesemia also appeared to be greater in women who experience migraines with [menstruation](../glossary#menstruation) compared to women without menstrual migraines [(163)](#reference163). A few [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) have examined whether an increase in intracellular magnesium concentration with [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) (oral) magnesium could help decrease the frequency and severity of migraine headaches in affected individuals. Two early [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials demonstrated modest decreases in the frequency of migraine headaches after supplementation with 600 mg/day of magnesium [(162, 164)](#reference162). Another placebo-controlled trial in 86 children with frequent migraine headaches found that oral magnesium oxide (9 mg/kg body weight/day) reduced headache frequency over the 16-week intervention [(165)](#reference165). However, there was no reduction in the frequency of migraine headaches with 485 mg/day of magnesium in another placebo-controlled study conducted in 69 adults suffering migraine attacks [(166)](#reference166). The efficiency of magnesium absorption varies with the type of oral magnesium complex, and this might explain the conflicting results. Although no serious adverse effects were noted during these migraine headache trials, 19 to 40% of individuals taking the magnesium supplements have reported diarrhea and [gastric](../glossary#gastric) irritation. The efficacy of magnesium infusions was also investigated in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), single-blind, trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) of 30 patients with migraine [(167)](#reference167). The administration of 1 gram of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium sulfate ended the attacks, abolished associated symptoms, and prevented recurrence within 24 hours in nearly 90% of the subjects. While this promising result was confirmed in another trial [(168)](#reference168), two additional randomized, placebo-controlled studies found that magnesium sulfate was less effective than other molecules (e.g., metoclopramide) in treating migraines [(169, 170)](#reference169). The most recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of five randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trials reported no beneficial effect of magnesium infusion for migraine in adults [(171)](#reference171). Another two more recent intervention studies suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion could be more effective and faster than dexamethasone/metoclopramide [(172)](#reference172) or caffeine citrate [(173)](#reference173) to relieve pain in patients with acute migraine. The efficacy of magnesium should be examined in larger studies that consider the magnesium [status](../glossary#status) of migraine sufferers [(174)](#reference174). Hypomagnesemia is not uncommon in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Two recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) cohort studies reported [serum](../glossary#serum) magnesium concentrations 0.75 mmol/L in ICU patients at admission or within 24 hours following admission to be associated with a greater need for mechanical ventilation, longer ICU stay, and higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of hospital mortality [(175, 176)](#reference175). A pooled analysis of three studies also suggested a higher risk of sepsis in ICU patients with hypomagnesemia [(175)](#reference175). A recent prospective study conducted in patients admitted with severe head injury found better [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) outcomes after six months in those who presented with normal serum magnesium concentrations at admission compared to those with hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium concentrations <0.65 mmol/L) [(177)](#reference177). However, evidence is currently unavailable to suggest that magnesium administration could improve outcomes in critically ill or severely injured patients [(178)](#reference178). The analysis of US national nutrition survey data (NHANES 2003-2006) showed an average magnesium intake in adults (ages 19 years) of 278 mg/day when only unfortified food sources were considered [(179)](#reference179). Considering all sources of magnesium intakes (i.e., unfortified and fortified food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)), the average intake in adults was estimated to be around 330 mg/day \u2014 a value close to the estimated average requirements ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) for magnesium \u2014 suggesting that about one-half of the adult population may be at [risk](../glossary#risk) of magnesium inadequacy [(179)](#reference179). Yet, the long-term consequences of inadequate dietary intakes remain unclear [(1)](#references). Since magnesium is part of [chlorophyll](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/chlorophyll-chlorophyllin), the green pigment in plants, green leafy vegetables are good sources of magnesium. Unrefined grains ( [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains)) and [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) also have high magnesium content. Meats and milk have an intermediate content of magnesium, while refined foods generally have the lowest. Water is a variable source of intake; harder water usually has a higher concentration of magnesium salts [(2)](#reference2). Some foods that are relatively rich in magnesium are listed in Table 2, along with their magnesium content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content search [gastric](../glossary#gastric) hyperacidity and symptoms of [gastroesophageal reflux disease](../glossary#gastroesophageal-reflux-disease) [(180)](#reference180). Adverse effects have not been identified from magnesium occurring naturally in food. However, adverse effects from excessive magnesium have been observed with intakes of various magnesium salts (i.e., [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium) [(6)](#reference6). The initial symptom of excess magnesium supplementation is diarrhea \u2014 a well-known side effect of magnesium that is used therapeutically as a laxative. Individuals with impaired kidney function are at higher [risk](../glossary#risk) for adverse effects of magnesium supplementation, and symptoms of magnesium toxicity have occurred in people with impaired kidney function taking moderate doses of magnesium-containing laxatives or antacids. Elevated [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of magnesium (hypermagnesemia) may result in a fall in blood pressure (hypotension). Some of the later effects of magnesium toxicity, such as lethargy, confusion, disturbances in normal cardiac rhythm, and deterioration of kidney function, are related to severe hypotension. As hypermagnesemia progresses, muscle weakness and difficulty breathing may occur. Severe hypermagnesemia may result in cardiac arrest [(2, 3)](#reference2). The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for magnesium at 350 mg/day; this UL represents the highest level of daily supplemental magnesium intake likely to pose no risk of diarrhea or [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disturbance in almost all individuals. The FNB cautions that individuals with [renal](../glossary#renal) impairment are at higher risk for adverse effects from excess supplemental magnesium intake. However, the FNB also notes that there are some conditions that may warrant higher doses of magnesium under medical supervision intake should be from food and formula only.| Magnesium interferes with the absorption of digoxin (a heart medication), nitrofurantoin (an antibiotic), and certain anti- [malarial](../glossary#malaria) drugs, which could potentially reduce drug efficacy. Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, etidronate), which are drugs used to treat [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis), and magnesium should be taken two hours apart so that the absorption of the bisphosphonates is not inhibited [(181, 182)](#reference181). Magnesium has also been found to reduce the efficacy of chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), penicillamine, oral [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant), and antibiotics [(181, 182)](#reference181). [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) magnesium might inhibit calcium entry into smooth muscle cells and lead to hypotension and muscular weakness if administered with calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipin, nicardipin) [(182)](#reference182). Because intravenous magnesium has increased the effects of certain muscle-relaxing medications used during anesthesia, it is advisable to let medical staff know if you are taking oral magnesium [supplements](../glossary#supplement), laxatives, or antacids prior to surgical procedures. Moreover, long-term use (three months or longer) of proton-pump inhibitors (drugs used to reduce the amount of stomach acid) may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypomagnesemia [(183, 184)](#reference183). High some thiazide [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide), if taken for extended periods, may interfere with magnesium reabsorption in the kidneys and result in magnesium depletion [(182)](#reference182). Many other medications may also result in [renal](../glossary#renal) magnesium loss [(3)](#reference3). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the latest [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for magnesium intake (400 to 420 mg/day for men and 310 to 320 mg/day for women). Despite magnesium being plentiful in foods, it is considered a shortfall nutrient (see the article on [Micronutrient Inadequacies in the US Population](../micronutrient-inadequacies/overview#magnesium)). Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement might ensure an intake of at least 100 mg/day of magnesium. Few multivitamin/mineral supplements contain more than 100 mg of magnesium due to its bulk. Eating a varied diet that provides green vegetables, [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains), and [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) daily should provide the rest of an individual's magnesium requirement. Older adults are less likely than younger adults to consume enough magnesium to meet their needs and should therefore take care to eat magnesium-rich foods in addition to taking a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) daily (see the article on [Micronutrient Inadequacies: Subpopulations at Risk](../micronutrient-inadequacies/subpopulations-at-risk)). Since older adults are also more likely to have impaired kidney function, they should avoid taking more than 350 mg/day of supplemental magnesium without medical consultation (see [Safety](#safety)).

Arginase, another manganese-containing enzyme, is required by the liver for the urea cycle, a process that detoxifies ammonia generated during amino acid metabolism [(3)](#reference3). In the brain, the manganese-activated enzyme, glutamine synthetase, converts Glutamate is an [excitotoxic](../glossary#excitoxicity) [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) (GABA) [(5, 6)](#reference5). Manganese deficiency results in abnormal skeletal development in a number of animal species. Manganese is the preferred [ cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) called glycosyltransferases; these enzymes are required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [ proteoglycans](../glossary#proteoglycan) that are needed for the formation of healthy [ cartilage](../glossary#cartilage) and bone [(7)](#reference7). Wound healing is a complex process that requires increased production of [collagen](../glossary#collagen). Manganese is required for the activation of prolidase, an [ enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that functions to provide the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid), proline, for collagen formation in human skin cells [(8)](#reference8). A genetic disorder known as prolidase deficiency results in abnormal wound healing among other problems and is characterized by abnormal manganese [ metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [ (7)](#reference7). Glycosaminoglycan [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), which requires manganese-activated glycosyltransferases, may also play an important role in wound healing [(9)](#reference9). [Iron](iron) and manganese share common absorption and transport proteins, including the divalent metal transporter 1, the lactoferrin receptor, transferrin, and ferroportin (reviewed in [10](#reference10)). Absorption of manganese from a meal decreases as the meal's iron content increases [(7)](#reference7). Iron [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (60 milligrams [mg]/day for four months) has been associated with decreased blood manganese concentrations and decreased MnSOD activity in [leukocytes](../glossary#leukocyte), indicating a reduction in manganese nutritional [status](../glossary#status) [(11)](#reference11). Additionally, an individual's iron status can affect manganese [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). Intestinal absorption of manganese is increased during iron deficiency and decreased when iron stores are elevated (i.e., high ferritin concentrations) [(12)](#reference12). Small studies have found increased blood concentrations of manganese in iron-deficient infants [(13)](#reference13) and children [(14)](#reference14), and a national survey of adults residing in South Korea found men and women with low ferritin levels had higher blood concentrations of manganese compared to those with normal ferritin levels [(15)](#reference15). In this analysis, anemia was associated with higher blood concentrations of manganese in women but not in men [(15)](#reference15). Men generally absorb less manganese than women, which may be related to the fact that men usually have higher iron stores than women [(16)](#reference16). Iron deficiency has also been shown to increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of manganese accumulation in the brain [(17)](#reference17). [Supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium (200 mg/day) has been shown to slightly decrease manganese [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) in healthy adults, either by decreasing manganese absorption or by increasing its [excretion](../glossary#excretion) [(18)](#reference18). In one set of studies, [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) calcium (500 mg/day) slightly decreased manganese [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) in healthy adults. As a source of calcium, milk had the least effect, while calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate had the greatest effect [(18)](#reference18). Several other studies have found minimal effects of supplemental calcium on manganese [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(19)](#reference19). Although manganese is a nutritionally essential [mineral](../glossary#mineral), it is potentially toxic; thus, it is important for the body to tightly regulate manganese [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis). While the exact mechanisms that govern manganese homeostasis are not completely understood, systemic regulation is achieved through intestinal control of manganese absorption and [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of manganese into [bile](../glossary#bile) [(20)](#reference20). At the cellular level, influx of manganese into cells is regulated by several different transport [proteins](../glossary#protein), including the transferrin [receptor](../glossary#receptor), the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT 1), zinc-interacting proteins 8 and 14 (ZIP8 and ZIP14), as well as others (reviewed in [21](#reference21)). Efflux of manganese from cells is accomplished by various transporters, including SLC30A10; the sodium-calcium exchanger; and the iron transporter, ferroportin endosome) utilize various transporters for manganese trafficking within the cell, but the exact mechanisms of regulation are not fully understood [(21)](#reference21). Manganese deficiency has been observed in a number of animal species, but manganese deficiency is not a concern in humans. Signs of manganese deficiency vary among animal species and may include impaired growth, impaired reproductive function, skeletal abnormalities, [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), and altered [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). In humans, demonstration of a manganese deficiency syndrome has been less clear [(2](#reference2), [7)](#reference7). A child on long-term [total parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) (TPN) lacking manganese developed bone demineralization growth that were corrected by manganese [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) [(23)](#reference23). Young men who were fed a low-manganese diet developed decreased [serum](../glossary#serum) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations and a transient skin rash [(24)](#reference24). Blood concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase were also elevated, which may indicate increased [bone remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling) as a consequence of insufficient dietary manganese. Young women fed a manganese-poor diet developed mildly abnormal [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance) in response to an [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) (IV) infusion of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [(19)](#reference19). Overall, manganese deficiency is quite rare, and there is more concern for toxicity related to manganese overexposure (see [Safety](#safety)). Because there was insufficient information on manganese requirements to set a Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)), the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) set an adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)). Since overt manganese deficiency has not been documented in humans eating natural diets, the FNB based the AI on average dietary intakes of manganese determined by the Total Diet Study \u2014 an annual survey of the [mineral](../glossary#mineral) content of representative American diets [(4)](#reference4). AI values for manganese are listed in Table 1 in milligrams (mg)/day by age and gender. Manganese requirements are increased in pregnancy and lactation [(4)](#reference4). |Life manganese intake or low levels of manganese in blood or tissue have been associated with various [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease). Although manganese insufficiency is not currently thought to cause the diseases discussed below, more research may be warranted to determine whether suboptimal manganese nutritional [status](../glossary#status) contributes to certain disease processes. Early studies found women with [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) had decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of manganese and an enhanced plasma response to an oral dose of manganese [(25, 26)](#reference25), suggesting they may have lower manganese [status](../glossary#status) than women without osteoporosis. However, more recent studies in postmenopausal women have reported conflicting results, with one study finding lower blood manganese concentrations among women with osteoporosis compared to those without osteoporosis [(27)](#reference27) and another finding no differences [(28)](#reference28). A study in healthy postmenopausal women found that a [supplement](../glossary#supplement) containing manganese (5 mg/day), [copper](copper) (2.5 mg/day), and [zinc](zinc) (15 mg/day) in combination with a calcium supplement (1,000 mg/day) was more effective than the calcium supplement alone in preventing spinal bone loss over a two-year period [(29)](#reference29). However, the presence of other trace elements in the supplement makes it impossible to determine whether manganese supplementation was the beneficial agent for maintaining [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density). In animal models, manganese deficiency results in impaired insulin secretion and [glucose intolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) similar to [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(30)](#reference30); however, results of human studies on manganese and type 2 diabetes have been somewhat conflicting. Manganese intake was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in 71,270 French women participating in the E3N-EPIC cohort study [(31)](#reference31). In an analysis of two prospective cohorts of Chinese adults (ages 20-74 years at baseline), followed for a mean of 4.2 and 5.3 years, higher dietary intakes of manganese were associated with a lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 diabetes; these associations were independent of dietary total [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity, a measure of dietary antioxidant intake [(32)](#reference32). Most recently, a prospective cohort study of 19,862 adults (ages 40-79 at baseline) participating in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study, followed for five years, found higher dietary intake of manganese to be associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in women but not in men [(33)](#reference33). While these studies of dietary manganese intake are suggestive of a protective association with type 2 diabetes, studies employing [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of manganese intake - either blood concentrations of manganese or urinary manganese [excretion](../glossary#excretion) \u2014 have reported mixed results. Most studies conducted have been small [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study); studies to date have reported blood manganese concentrations in patients with diabetes were higher [(34-36)](#reference34), lower [(37)](#reference37), or similar [(38-40)](#reference38) compared to blood manganese concentrations in controls without diabetes. Additionally, a case-control study that included 3,228 adults in China reported a U-shaped relationship between plasma concentration of manganese and type 2 diabetes, meaning those with low or high blood concentrations had a higher odds of diabetes when compared to those with an intermediate blood concentration of manganese [(41)](#reference41). In a cross-sectional analysis of adults participating in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, blood concentrations of manganese were significantly lower among those with diabetes compared to those without diabetes [(42)](#reference42). Further, one case-control study found higher urinary manganese excretion in patients with diabetes compared to controls without diabetes [(37)](#reference37). Results of case-control studies are more likely to be distorted by bias (i.e., the selection bias with the selection of cases and controls, as well as dietary [recall bias](../glossary#recall-bias)) than results of prospective cohort studies. Moreover, one study of functional manganese status found the activity of the antioxidant [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), MnSOD, to be lower in the white blood cells of patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes [(43)](#reference43). When given at the same time as an oral glucose challenge, an acute oral dose of 15 mg or 30 mg manganese did not improve [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance) in subjects with diabetes or in controls without diabetes [(44)](#reference44). Although manganese appears to play a role in glucose [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), it is not clear whether higher manganese status might improve glucose tolerance and protect against the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Manganese deficient rats are more susceptible to [seizures](../glossary#seizure) than manganese sufficient rats, and rats that are genetically prone to [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) have lower than normal brain and blood manganese concentrations. Certain subgroups of humans with epilepsy reportedly have lower whole blood manganese concentrations than control subjects without epilepsy [(45)](#reference45). One study found blood manganese concentrations of individuals with epilepsy of unknown origin were lower than those of individuals whose epilepsy was induced by trauma (e.g., head injury) or disease [(46)](#reference46), suggesting a possible genetic relationship between epilepsy and abnormal manganese [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). While manganese deficiency does not appear to be a cause of epilepsy in humans, the relationship between manganese metabolism and epilepsy deserves further research [(7](#reference7), [45, 47)](#reference45). In the US, estimated average intakes of dietary manganese range from 2.1 to 2.3 mg/day for men and 1.6 to 1.8 mg/day for women [(4)](#reference4). Surveys have found those adhering to a vegetarian diet have manganese intakes of up to 7.0 mg/day (reviewed in sources of manganese [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), vegetables, and [teas](../food-beverages/tea) [(49)](#reference49). Foods high in phytic acid, such as beans, seeds, nuts, whole grains, and soy products, or foods high in oxalic acid, such as cabbage, spinach, and sweet potatoes, may slightly inhibit manganese absorption. Although teas are rich sources of manganese, the [tannins](../glossary#tannins) present in tea may moderately reduce the absorption of manganese [(18)](#reference18). Intakes of other [minerals](../glossary#minerals), including [iron](iron), [calcium](calcium), and have been found to limit retention of manganese [(4)](#reference4). The manganese content of some manganese-rich foods is listed in milligrams (mg) in Table 2. For more information on the nutrient content of foods, (black)||1 cup (8 ounces)||0.18-0.77| Infants are exposed to varying amounts of manganese depending on their source of nutrition. Manganese concentrations in breast milk, cow-based formula, and soy-based formula range from 3 to 10 micrograms/liter (g/L), 30 to 50 g/L, and 200 to 300 g/L, respectively. However, the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of manganese from breast milk is higher than from infant formulas, and manganese deficiencies in breast-fed infants or toxicities in formula-fed infants have not been reported [(20)](#reference20). Manganese concentrations in drinking water range from 1 to 100 micrograms (g)/L, but most sources contain less than 10 g/L [(51)](#reference51). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends 0.05 mg (50 g)/L as the maximum allowable manganese concentration in drinking water [(52)](#reference52). Several forms of manganese are found in [supplements](../glossary#supplement), including gluconate, manganese. Manganese is available as a stand-alone supplement or in combination products [(53)](#reference53). Relatively high levels of manganese ascorbate may be found in a bone/joint health product containing chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride (see [Safety](#safety)). Manganese may be present in solutions of parenteral nutrition either included as a trace element or as an incidental contaminant (see [Intravenous manganese](#intravenous-manganese-safety) in the a manganese transporter expressed in the liver and brain, causes a manganese overload syndrome. Such loss-of-function mutations lead to manganese accumulation in certain brain regions and in the liver, causing hypermanganesemia, dystonia parkinsonism, and hepatic dysfunction at an 57)](#reference56). Autosomal recessive mutations in the SLC39A14 gene have also been reported, leading to hypermanganesemia and similar a neurological phenotype, but liver disease is absent with this specific mutation [(58)](#reference58). [Chelation](../glossary#chelate) therapy is important to treat these inherited manganese-overload disorders [(59)](#reference59). Manganese toxicity may result in multiple [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) problems and is a well-recognized health hazard for people who inhale manganese dust, such as welders, miners, and smelters [(1](#references), [4)](#reference4). Unlike ingested manganese, inhaled manganese is transported directly to the brain before it can be metabolized in the liver [(60, 61)](#reference60). The symptoms of manganese toxicity generally appear slowly over a period of months to years. In its worst form, manganese toxicity can result in a permanent neurological disorder with symptoms similar to those of [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease), including tremors, difficulty walking, and facial muscle spasms. This syndrome, often called manganism, is sometimes preceded by psychiatric symptoms, such as irritability, aggressiveness, and even hallucinations [(62, 63)](#reference62). Additionally, environmental or occupational inhalation of manganese can cause an [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) response in the lungs [(64)](#reference64), with clinical symptoms including cough, acute bronchitis, and decreased lung function [(65)](#reference65). Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is a manganese-containing compound used in gasoline as an anti-knock additive. Although it has been used for this purpose in Canada for more than 20 years, uncertainty about adverse health effects from inhaled exhaust emissions kept the US EPA from approving its use in unleaded gasoline. In 1995, a US court decision made MMT available for widespread use in unleaded gasoline [(60)](#reference60). A study in Montreal, where MMT had been used for more than 10 years, found airborne manganese levels to be similar to those in areas where MMT was not used [(66)](#reference66). Another Canadian study found higher concentrations of respirable manganese in an urban versus a rural area, but average concentrations in both areas were below the safe level set by the US EPA [(67)](#reference67). The impact of long-term exposure to low levels of MMT combustion products, however, has not been thoroughly evaluated and will require additional study [(68)](#reference68). A single case of reversible neurotoxicity and seizures following unintentional MMT ingestion has been documented: a 54-year old man accidentally drank an MMT-containing anti-knock agent that he assumed was an energy drink due so similar product labeling [(69)](#reference69). Limited evidence suggests that high manganese intakes from drinking water may be associated with [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms similar to those of [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease). Severe neurological symptoms were reported in 25 people who drank water contaminated with manganese \u2014 and probably other contaminants \u2014 from dry cell batteries for two to three months [(70)](#reference70). Water manganese concentrations were found to be 14 mg/L almost two months after symptoms began and may have already been declining [(1)](#references). A study of older adults in Greece found a high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of neurological symptoms in those exposed to water manganese levels of 1.8 to 2.3 mg/L [(71)](#reference71), while a study in Germany found no evidence of increased neurological symptoms in people drinking water with manganese levels ranging from 0.3 to 2.2 mg/L compared to those drinking water containing less than 0.05 mg/L of manganese [(72)](#reference72). Manganese in drinking water may be more [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) than manganese in food. However, none of the studies measured dietary manganese, so total manganese intake in these cases is unknown. In the US, the EPA recommends 0.05 mg/L as the maximum allowable manganese concentration in drinking water [(52)](#reference52), but the World Health Organization does not currently have a health-based limit for manganese in drinking water [(73, 74)](#reference73). Additionally, several cross-sectional studies have associated high levels of manganese in drinking water with cognitive and behavioral deficits in children (reviewed in [75](#reference75)). For example, a cross-sectional study of 362 children (ages 6-13 years) in Canada found children with the highest manganese concentrations in home tap water (median of 216 g/L) had a 6.2-point lower Full Scale IQ (lower Performance IQ but not Verbal IQ) than those with lowest manganese levels in home tap water (median of 1 g/L) [(76)](#reference76). A cohort study that followed 287 of these children for a mean of 4.4 years found that exposure to higher concentrations of manganese in drinking water was linked to a lower Performance IQ among girls but a higher Performance IQ among boys [(77)](#reference77). Additionally, a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) among 1,265 children in Bangladesh did not find manganese concentration in drinking water (medians of 0.20 mg/L during pregnancy and 0.34 mg/L at 10 years) to be associated with any measure of cognitive ability (i.e., IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed) when assessed at age 10 [(78)](#reference78). Yet, this study associated manganese in drinking water with higher [risks](../glossary#risk) of conduct problems among boys and low prosocial scores among girls [(78)](#reference78). In a population-based cohort study in Denmark that followed 643,401 children, exposure to higher manganese concentrations in drinking water was linked to a heightened risk of one subtype of attention-deficit hyperactive disorder [(79)](#reference79). Specifically, exposure to a manganese concentration in drinking water of at least 100 g/L was associated with a 51% higher risk of the ADHD-Inattentive subtype in girls and a 20% higher risk in boys, in comparison to exposure of <5 g/L \u2014 using these exposure comparisons, a 9% increased risk of ADHD-Overall was observed in girls and no difference found in boys [(79)](#reference79). Only a few adverse effects of manganese intake from [supplements](../glossary#supplement) have been documented. A single case of manganese toxicity was reported in a person who took large amounts of mineral supplements for years [(51)](#reference51), while another case was reported as a result of a person taking a Chinese herbal supplement [(62)](#reference62). More recently, Parkinson's disease was reported in a woman taking 100 mg/day of manganese chloride for at least two years, followed by 30 mg/day for two months [(80)](#reference80). Manganese toxicity resulting from food alone has not been reported in humans, even though certain vegetarian diets could provide up to 20 mg/day of manganese [(4](#reference4), [51)](#reference51). Manganese [total parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) (TPN), both as a result of excessive manganese in the solution and as an incidental contaminant [(54)](#reference54). Neonates are especially vulnerable to manganese-related neurotoxicity receiving manganese-containing TPN can be exposed manganese concentrations about 100-fold higher than breast-fed infants [(20)](#reference20). Because of potential toxicities, some argue against including manganese in parenteral nutrition [(82)](#reference82). Due to the severe implications of manganese [ neurotoxicity](../glossary#neurotoxic), the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) set very conservative tolerable upper intake levels ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for manganese; the ULs are listed in Table to age [(4)](#reference4). should be from food and formula only.| Magnesium-containing antacids and laxatives and the antibiotic medication, tetracycline, may decrease the absorption of manganese if taken together with manganese-containing foods or [supplements](../glossary#supplement) [(53)](#reference53). Two studies have found that [supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing a combination of glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, and manganese ascorbate are beneficial in relieving pain due to mild or moderate [osteoarthritis](../glossary#osteoarthritis) of the knee when compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(93, 94)](#reference93). The dose of elemental manganese supplied by the supplements was 30 mg/day for eight weeks in one study [(94)](#reference94) and 40 mg/day for six months in the other study [(93)](#reference93). No adverse effects were reported during either study, and blood manganese concentrations were not measured. Neither study compared the treatment containing manganese ascorbate to a treatment containing glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate without manganese ascorbate, so it is impossible to determine whether the supplement would have resulted in the same benefit without high doses of manganese. The adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) for manganese (2.3 mg/day for adult men and 1.8 mg/day for adult women) appears sufficient to prevent deficiency in most individuals. The daily intake of manganese most likely to promote optimum health is not known. Following the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) containing 100% of the daily values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of most nutrients will generally provide 2.3 mg/day of manganese. Because of the potential for toxicity and the lack of information regarding benefit, manganese supplementation beyond 100% of the DV (2.3 mg/day) is not recommended. There is presently no evidence that the consumption of a manganese-rich plant-based diet results in manganese toxicity. The requirement for manganese is not known to be higher for older adults. However, liver disease is more common in older adults and may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of manganese toxicity by decreasing the elimination of manganese from the body (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)). Manganese [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) beyond 100% of the DV (2.3 mg/day) is not recommended.

It functions as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for a number of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) that [catalyze](../glossary#catalyze) important chemical transformations in the global carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles [(1)](#references). Thus, molybdenum-dependent enzymes are not only required for human health, but also for the health of our ecosystem. The biological form of the molybdenum atom is an organic molecule known as the molybdenum [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) (Moco) present in the active site of Moco-containing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) (molybdoenzymes) [(2)](#reference2). In humans, molybdenum is known to function as a cofactor for four enzymes [(3)](#reference3): Of these enzymes, sulfite oxidase is known to be crucial for human health [(12)](#reference12). Hereditary xanthinuria, characterized by a deficiency in xanthine oxidase (Type I) or by a deficiency in both xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase (Type II), can be asymptomatic. However, in less than half of the cases, affected individuals exhibit a range of health issues of variable severity [(13, 14)](#reference13). An early study reported that molybdenum intakes of 500 g/day and 1,500 g/day from sorghum increased urinary copper [excretion](../glossary#excretion) [(2)](#reference2). However, the results of a more recent, well-controlled study indicated that very high dietary molybdenum intakes (up to 1,500 g/day) did not adversely affect copper nutritional [status](../glossary#status) in eight, healthy young men [(15)](#reference15). Excess dietary molybdenum has been found to result in copper deficiency in grazing animals ( [ruminants](../glossary#ruminant)). In the digestive tract of ruminants, the formation of compounds containing sulfur and molybdenum, known as thiomolybdates, prevents the absorption of copper and can cause fatal copper-dependent disorders [(16, 17)](#reference16). Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a molecule that can form high-affinity complexes with copper, controlling free copper (copper that is not bound to [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin)), and inhibiting copper [chaperones](../glossary#molecular-chaperone) and copper-containing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) [(18, 19)](#reference18). TM's ability to lower free copper levels is exploited in the treatment of Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder characterized by copper accumulation in tissues responsible for [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) and [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorders. Neurologic worsening has been linked with toxic levels of free copper in the [serum](../glossary#serum) of neurologically presenting patients. TM therapy seems able to stabilize neurologic status and prevent neurologic deterioration in these patients, as opposed to the standard initial treatment of choice [(20)](#reference20). Copper is also a required [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for enzymes involved in [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and [angiogenesis](../glossary#angiogenesis) that are known to accelerate [cancer](../glossary#cancer) progression and [metastasis](../glossary#metastasize). Copper depletion studies employing TM have been initiated in patients with advanced [malignancies](../glossary#malignant) with the aim of preventing disease progression or relapse. These pilot trials showed promising results in individuals with metastatic kidney cancer [(21)](#reference21), metastatic colorectal cancer [(22)](#reference22), and breast cancer with high [risk](../glossary#risk) of relapse [(23)](#reference23). TM was relatively well-tolerated and stabilized disease or prevented relapse in correlation with copper depletion. TM's efficacy has also been investigated in animal models of inflammatory and immune-related diseases [(24, 25)](#reference24), but clinical studies are needed to evaluate whether copper depletion might stabilize diseases and improve survival in humans, as suggested by a trial of TM therapy with patients with [biliary](../glossary#bile) [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) [(26)](#reference26). Dietary molybdenum deficiency has never been observed in healthy people [(2)](#reference2). The only documented case of acquired molybdenum deficiency occurred in a patient with [Crohn's disease](../glossary#crohn-disease) on long-term [ total parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) (TPN) without molybdenum added to the TPN solution [(27)](#reference27). The patient developed rapid heart and respiratory rates, headaches, and night blindness, and ultimately became comatose. The patient was diagnosed with defects in [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid) production and sulfur [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). The patient's clinical condition improved and the amino acid intolerance disappeared when the TPN solution was discontinued and instead supplemented with molybdenum in the form of ammonium molybdate (300 g/day) [(27)](#reference27). Because molybdenum functions only in the form of the Moco in humans, any disturbance of Moco [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) can disrupt the function of all molybdoenzymes. Current understanding of the essentiality of molybdenum in humans is based largely on the study of individuals with very rare inborn metabolic disorders caused by a deficiency in Moco. Moco is synthesized [de novo](../glossary#de-novo-synthesis) [Figure 1](#figure-1) more than 60 [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting mostly MOCS1 and MOCS2 have been identified [(28)](#reference28). The absence of a functional Moco has a direct impact on the activity of the molybdoenzymes. Metabolic disorders specifically associated with deficiency in sulfite oxidase activity include an accumulation of sulfite, thiosulfate (see [Figure 2](#figure-2) below). This metabolic profile is identical to that observed in isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD), an inherited condition caused by mutations in the SUOX gene that codes for sulfite oxidase [(29)](#reference29). Compared with ISOD, Moco deficiency (MocoD) also affects the xanthine pathway and leads to an accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, and low to undetectable uric acid concentrations in blood (see [Figure 3](#figure-3) below). MocoD and ISOD have been diagnosed in more than 100 individuals worldwide. However the global prevalence of MocoD is likely to be underestimated as a result of a failure to diagnose or to report [(28, 30, 31)](#reference30). The incidence of MocoD has been recently estimated at one in 100,000 to 200,000 live births [(32)](#reference32). Both MocoD and ISOD result from [recessive traits](../glossary#recessive-trait), meaning that only individuals who inherit two copies of the abnormal gene (one from each parent) develop the disease. Individuals who inherit only one copy of the abnormal gene are known as carriers of the trait but do not exhibit any symptoms. ISOD and MocoD can be diagnosed relatively early in pregnancy (10-14 weeks' gestation) by [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) activity assays using amniotic cell chorionic villus sampling and by genetic testing [(30, 33)](#reference30). These disorders typically occur in the first days of life, although a few cases of MocoD with late presentation have been described [(34-37)](#reference34). The loss of sulfite oxidase activity in ISOD and MocoD leads to severe [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) dysfunction characterized by cerebral [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy), mental retardation, intractable [seizures](../glossary#seizure), and dislocation of [ocular](../glossary#ocular) lenses. At present, it is not clear whether the neurologic effects are a result of the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, such as sulfite, or inadequate sulfate production. Patients with ISOD and MocoD were also found (-AASA) [(38)](#reference38). -AASA of a deficiency in -AASA dehydrogenase observed in patients with [pyridoxine](../vitamins/vitamin-B6)-dependent [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy). The enzymatic deficiency in these individuals causes an increase in -AASA and its cyclic form piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C). P6C can (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), leading to a deficiency in PLP, which is corrected with supplemental pyridoxine. A decrease in PLP has also been observed in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) from ISOD and MocoD patients [(39)](#reference39). It is not clear whether sulfite is responsible for the accumulation of -AASA and the deficiency in PLP in ISOD and MocoD patients. Nevertheless, pyridoxine and folic acid supplementation in patients with MocoD successfully normalized the PLP level and abolished seizures in two patients with mutations in MOCS2 (MocoD Type B) [(40)](#reference40). Although anti-seizure medications and dietary restriction of sulfur-containing amino acids may be beneficial in some cases [(41)](#reference41), there are no treatment options for patients with mutations in the MOCS2, GPHN (MocoD Type C), or SUOX genes. Pyridoxine supplementation is an option being considered to alleviate specific clinical features in patients. A successful treatment using cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) has been described for patients with mutations in the MOCS1 gene (i.e., those with MocoD Type A) [(42)](#reference42). The MOCS1 gene controls the initial step in the Moco biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into cPMP. Therefore, patients with mutations in the MOCS1 gene lack cPMP. Daily administration of cPMP to patients resolved all metabolic abnormalities associated with defective sulfite oxidase and xanthine pathways and prevented further signs of neurologic deterioration [(43, 44)](#reference43). Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are essential to ensure success [(44)](#reference44). A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 16 young infants, followed for five years, found that intravenous cPMP treatment was associated with clinical improvement in most infants with MocoD Type A but not in those with MocoD Type B [(42)](#reference42). The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved the cPMP replacement drug, fosdenopterin (brand name: Nulibry), for [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) treatment of MocoD Type A [(45)](#reference45). Since cPMP replacement therapy can only benefit MocoD Type A, additional treatment methods are required. A mouse model for MocoD Type B has been recently developed, which may aid in the development of a therapy for those suffering from the MOSC2 mutation [(46)](#reference46). The recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for molybdenum was most recently revised in January 2001 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) [(2)](#reference2). It was based on the results of nutritional [balance studies](../glossary#balance-study) conducted in eight, healthy young men under controlled laboratory conditions [(47, 48)](#reference47). The RDA values for molybdenum are listed in Table 1 in micrograms (g)/day by age and gender. Adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) levels were set for infants based on mean molybdenum intake from human milk, exclusively. The Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)), derived from the RDA, is 45 g/day for individuals 4 years of age or is a small region in northern China where the incidence of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) of the [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus) and stomach is very high (10 times higher than the average in China and 100 times higher than the average in the US). The soil in this region is low in molybdenum and other [mineral](../glossary#mineral) elements; therefore, dietary molybdenum intake is also low. Studies conducted in other areas of low and high incidence of esophageal cancer showed that content of molybdenum and zinc in hair and nails is significantly lower in inhabitants of high- [risk](../glossary#risk) regions compared to cold spots. Moreover, esophageal cancer patients display reduced content of the trace elements compared to healthy relatives [(50, 51)](#reference50). Increased intake of nitrosamines, which are known [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen), may be one of a number of dietary and environmental factors that contributes to the development of esophageal cancer in residents of high-risk regions. Adding ammonium molybdate to the soil may help decrease the risk of esophageal cancer by limiting nitrosamine exposure. It is not clear whether dietary molybdenum supplementation is beneficial in decreasing the risk of esophageal cancer. A [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) conducted in the Linxian area molybdenum (30 g/day) and [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) (120 mg/day) for 5.25 years did not decrease the incidence or mortality from esophageal cancer [(52-54)](#reference52). The 25-year follow-up of this trial found that co-supplementation with these two micronutrients actually led to small increases in risk of death from gastric cardia cancer and cancer in general, but not death from esophageal cancer [(54)](#reference54). However, a subanalysis of this 25-year follow-up revealed that co-supplementation with molybdenum and vitamin C slightly increased risk of mortality from esophageal cancer in those who were 55 years or older when the trial initially began (HR, 1.16; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval): 1.04-1.30) [(54)](#reference54). Rugao is a county in Jiangsu province (China) renowned for the longevity of its residents. Extended longevity can hardly be attributed to significant differences in traditions, lifestyles, or dietary habits among the residents, and most longevous people are not related to one another, limiting the possible influence of genetics. However, the county has a large number of different soils whose compositions could affect the distribution of trace elements in water and crops and ultimately be linked with human health and longevity. Significant correlations were found between the ratio of people over 90 years old per 100,000 inhabitants and trace elements, including molybdenum, in soils, drinking water, and rice, which constitute key elements of their natural environment [(55)](#reference55). The percentage of long-lived people (>80 years old) in Zhongxiang (Hubei province) was also positively linked to the content of molybdenum in their staple food, rice [(56)](#reference56). In these regions, it is likely that combinations of trace elements contribute to optimum health and longevity as opposed to the sole effect of molybdenum. The Total Diet Study, an annual survey of the mineral content in the typical American diet, indicates that the dietary intake of molybdenum averages 76 g/day for women and 109 g/day for men. Thus, usual molybdenum intakes are well above the [ RDA](#RDA) for molybdenum. Legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas, are the richest sources of molybdenum. Grain products and nuts are considered good sources, while animal products, fruit, and many vegetables are generally low in molybdenum [(2)](#reference2). Because the molybdenum content of plants depends on the soil molybdenum content and other environmental conditions, the molybdenum content of foods can vary considerably [(51](#reference51), [57)](#reference57). Molybdenum in single-nutrient and multiple nutrient [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may be present in solutions of parenteral nutrition either included as a trace element or as an incidental contaminant [(59, 60)](#reference59). The toxicity of molybdenum compounds appears to be relatively low in humans. Increased [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid) and [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin) (an iron-oxidizing enzyme) have been reported in occupationally exposed workers in a molybdenite roasting plant [(61)](#reference61). [Gout](../glossary#gout)-like symptoms have also been reported in an Armenian population consuming 10 to 15 milligrams (mg) of molybdenum from food daily [(62)](#reference62). In other studies, blood and urinary uric acid concentrations were not elevated by molybdenum intakes up to 1.5 mg/day [(2)](#reference2). There has been only one report of acute toxicity related to molybdenum from a dietary supplement: an adult male reportedly consumed a total of 13.5 mg of molybdenum over a period of 18 days (300 to 800 g/day) and developed acute psychosis with hallucinations, [seizures](../glossary#seizure), and other [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms [(63)](#reference63). However, a controlled study in four, healthy young men found that molybdenum intakes, ranging from 22 g/day to 1,490 g/day (almost 1.5 mg/day), elicited no serious adverse effects when molybdenum was given for 24 days [(47)](#reference47). The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) found little evidence that molybdenum excess was associated with adverse health outcomes in generally healthy people. To determine the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)), the FNB selected adverse reproductive effects in rats as the most sensitive index of toxicity and applied a large uncertainty factor because animal data were used [(2)](#reference2). The UL for molybdenum is listed by age Table (2.0 mg/day)| |*Source of intake should be from food and formula only.| High doses of molybdenum have been found to inhibit the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of acetaminophen in rats [(64)](#reference64); however, it is not known whether this occurs at clinically relevant doses in humans. The [ RDA](#RDA) for molybdenum (45 g/day for adults) is sufficient to prevent deficiency. Although the intake of molybdenum most likely to promote optimum health is not known, there is presently no evidence that intakes higher than the RDA are beneficial. Most people in the US consume more than sufficient molybdenum in their diets, making supplementation unnecessary. Following the Linus Pauling Institute's general recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement that contains 100% of the daily values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for most nutrients is likely to provide 45 g/day of molybdenum. Because aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for molybdenum [(2)](#reference2), our recommendation for older adults is the same as that for adults 50 years and younger.

Bound to oxygen in all biological systems, phosphorus is found as phosphate (PO43-) in the body. Approximately 85% of the body's phosphorus is found in bones and teeth [(2)](#reference2). Phosphorus is a major structural component of bone in the form of a calcium phosphate salt called [hydroxyapatite](../glossary#hydroxyapatite). [Phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) (e.g., phosphatidylcholine) are major structural components of [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). All energy production and storage are dependent on [phosphorylated](../glossary#phosphorylation) compounds, such which are responsible for the storage and transmission of genetic information, are long chains of phosphate-containing molecules. A number of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), [hormones](../glossary#hormone), and [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules depend on phosphorylation for their activation. Phosphorus also helps maintain normal acid-base balance ( [pH](../glossary#pH)) by acting as one of the body's most important [buffers](../glossary#buffer). Additionally, the phosphorus-containing molecule 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) binds to [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) in red blood cells and regulates oxygen delivery to the tissues of the body [(1)](#references). Dietary phosphorus is readily absorbed in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine), and in healthy individuals, excess phosphorus is [excreted](../glossary#excretion) by the kidneys under the regulatory action of the [endocrine](../glossary#endocrine-system) [hormones](../glossary#hormone): parathyroid hormone (PTH), [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D), and The acute regulation of blood [calcium](../minerals/calcium) and phosphorus concentrations is controlled through the actions of PTH and the active form of vitamin D. A slight drop in blood calcium levels (e.g., in the case of inadequate calcium intake) is sensed by the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands), resulting in their increased secretion of PTH, which rapidly decreases urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of calcium but increases urinary excretion of phosphorus and stimulates bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption). This results in the release of bone mineral (calcium and phosphate) \u2014 actions that restore serum calcium concentrations. Although the action is not immediate, PTH also stimulates conversion of vitamin D to its active form (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; calcitriol) in the kidneys. Increased circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in turn stimulates increased intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphorus. A third hormone, FGF-23, plays a central role in [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis). FGF-23 is secreted by bone-forming cells ( [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast)/osteocytes) in response to increases in phosphorus intake. In a negative feedback loop, FGF-23 inhibits the production and stimulates the degradation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, as well as promotes an increase in urinary phosphorus excretion independently of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [(3)](#reference3). phosphorus intake rarely results levels (hypophosphatemia) because [renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption of phosphorus increases to compensate for decreased intake. The effects of moderate to severe hypophosphatemia may include loss of appetite, [anemia](../glossary#anemia), muscle weakness, bone pain, [rickets](../glossary#rickets) (in children), [osteomalacia](../glossary#osteomalacia) (in adults), increased susceptibility to infection, numbness and tingling of the extremities, difficulty walking, and respiratory failure. Severe hypophosphatemia may occasionally be life threatening. Since phosphorus is so widespread in food, dietary phosphorus deficiency is usually seen only in cases of near-total starvation. Other individuals at [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypophosphatemia include alcoholics, diabetics recovering from an episode of [diabetic ketoacidosis](../glossary#diabetic-ketoacidosis), patients with respiratory alkalosis, and starving or anorexic patients on refeeding regimens that are high in calories but too low in phosphorus (reviewed in [4](#reference4)). Hypophosphatemia caused by inherited disorders of phosphorus [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) (phosphorus wasting disorders) has been linked to elevated urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) or impaired renal reabsorption of phosphorus in affected subjects (reviewed in [5](#reference5)). The Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for phosphorus is based on the maintenance of normal [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus levels in adults (2.5-4.5 milligrams/deciliter [mg/dL]) and is believed to represent adequate phosphorus intakes to meet cellular and bone formation needs ( [6](#reference6); Table 1). The RDA, which is the average daily intake that meets the requirements of 97.5% of healthy individuals in a specific life stage and gender group, is based on the Estimated Average Requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR); 580 mg/day of phosphorus for adults) \u2014 the nutrient intake that meets the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group. |Life Stage||Age|| Males | (mg/day) | Females | (mg/day) |Infants||0-6 months|| 100 ( | Phosphorus is found in most food because it is a critical constituent of all living organisms. Dairy foods, cereal products, meat, and fish are particularly rich sources of phosphorus [(7)](#reference7). Phosphorus is also a component of many food additives that are used in food processing and is present in cola soft drinks as phosphoric acid [(8)](#reference8). In the nationally representative NHANES survey, phosphorus intakes were well above the EAR and RDA, with average daily intakes of 1,602 mg in men and 1,128 mg in women [(8)](#reference8). Dietary phosphorus derived from food additives is not always included in food nutrient composition databases, so the total amount of phosphorus consumed by the average person in the US can be underestimated by more than 20% [(9)](#reference9). Segments of the US population who consume more highly processed foods and whose phosphorus intakes approach the tolerable upper intake level of 4,000 mg/day are thought by some to be at high [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing adverse health outcomes (see [Safety](#safety)) [(7, 9)](#reference7). The phosphorus in plant seeds (beans, peas, cereals, and nuts) is present in a storage form of phosphate called phytic acid or phytate. Only about 50% of the phosphorus from phytate is available to humans because we lack [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) (phytases) that liberate phosphorus from phytate [(10)](#reference10). Yeasts possess phytases, so whole grains incorporated into leavened breads have more [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) phosphorus than whole grains incorporated into breakfast cereals or flat breads [(6)](#reference6). Because reducing dietary phosphorus absorption may benefit individuals with impaired kidney function who are at [risk](../glossary#risk) of hyperphosphatemia ( [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus at or sources of phosphorus in grain-based vegetarian diets may be preferred over meat-based diets [(11)](#reference11). Table 2 lists a number of phosphorus-rich foods, along with their phosphorus content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content three-ounce serving of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards. | #Phosphorus from nuts, seeds, and grains is about 50% less bioavailable than phosphorus from other sources Phosphorus content of multivitamin/mineral (MVM) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) varies; a US national survey found that MVM supplements contributed an average of 108 mg to daily phosphorus intake [(10)](#reference10). Sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate salts are used for the treatment of hypophosphatemia that occurs in hereditary disorders of phosphate wasting, and their use requires medical supervision. Calcium phosphate salts are sometimes used as [calcium](../minerals/calcium) supplements [(13)](#reference13). Commonly used over-the-counter and prescription drugs also contribute to phosphorus intakes at levels yet to be defined [(10)](#reference10). Several disorders characterized by [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus levels above normal (hyperphosphatemia) have been described, including those resulting from increased intestinal absorption of phosphate salts taken by mouth or by [colonic](../glossary#colon) absorption of the phosphate salts in enemas [(1)](#references). Yet, the disruption of phosphorus [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) is most often associated with [excretion](../glossary#excretion) failure in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage [renal](../glossary#renal) disease (advanced CKD). When kidney function is only 20% of normal, even phosphorus intakes within the recommended range may lead to hyperphosphatemia. Hyperphosphatemia may also affect individuals with inappropriately low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels ( [hypoparathyroidism](../glossary#hypoparathyroidism)) as they lack PTH stimulation of renal phosphate excretion and fail to stimulate [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the active form of [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D)). These individuals cannot excrete excess phosphorus in the absence of both hormones [(14)](#reference14). Elevated serum phosphorus concentrations have been associated with accelerated disease progression in individuals with impaired kidney function and have been linked to increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of adverse health outcomes in the general population [(9](#reference9), [15)](#reference15). High [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus within the normal range (2.5-4.5 mg/dL) has recently been associated with increased incidence of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) in individuals with normal kidney function. Two studies conducted in the general population and in individuals with prior CVD have linked high-normal serum phosphorus found concentrations equal to or above 4 mg/dL were associated with a doubling of the risk of developing incident CKD and end-stage [renal](../glossary#renal) disease in individuals free of renal disease at study inception [(18)](#reference18). In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), which followed 4,005 healthy young adults for more than 15 years, higher serum phosphorus within the normal range was also associated with [left ventricular hypertrophy](../glossary#left-ventricular-hypertrophy), a condition often linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes [(19)](#reference19). In another study of 3,088 middle-aged healthy participants followed for over 17 years, serum phosphorus concentrations in the top [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of the normal range were associated with a two-fold higher risk of heart failure compared to the lowest quartile (3.5 mg/dL vs. <2.9 mg/dL) [(16)](#reference16). It is thought that vascular [calcification](../glossary#calcification), which may explain the relationship between high phosphorus and cardiovascular disease risk in CKD patients (see [Hyperphosphatemia in subjects with kidney disease](#hyperphosphatemia-kidney-disease)), contributes to this association in individuals with normal kidney function, even when their serum phosphorus is within the normal range and their intakes are below the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) [(20, 21)](#reference20). PTH/ [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D)/FGF-23 axis in individuals with normal kidney function (see [Regulation](#regulation)). Increased secretion of PTH and FGF-23 helps maintain phosphorus serum concentrations in the normal range (2.5-4.5 mg/dL) even in the setting of high phosphorus intake [(9)](#reference9). This contributes to serum phosphorus being only weakly correlated to phosphorus consumption [(22)](#reference22). Of note, sustained increases in FGF-23 and PTH are commonly observed during CKD in order to maintain normal serum phosphorus concentrations despite a reduction in Elevated FGF-23, rather than serum be an early marker of disordered phosphorus homeostasis and a predictor of adverse health outcomes in patients with early-stage CKD [(23, 24)](#reference23). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that measuring serum phosphorus in people with normal renal function cannot adequately reflect early disturbances in phosphorus [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) due to high phosphorus consumption. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have reported high rates of mortality and [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events in association with high blood phosphorus levels in subjects with CKD. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), conducted in over 90,000 CKD patients, found an 18% increase in all-cause mortality per 1 mg/dL increase in [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus concentration increased [risk](../glossary#risk) in [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD)-related death was also calculated for each 1 mg/dL higher concentration in the meta-analysis of three studies [(25)](#reference25). Although no causality has been established between [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) deficiency and CVD risk, it has been suggested that failure to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in hyperphosphatemic individuals may modify the risk of developing cardiovascular and [renal](../glossary#renal) disease, as well as worsen kidney insufficiency in CKD patients [(26)](#reference26). Another plausible mechanism for hyperphosphatemia-induced cardiovascular dysfunction is the deposition of calcium phosphate in non-skeletal tissues, especially the vasculature [(27)](#reference27). Indeed, high phosphorus concentrations may stimulate the expression of bone specific markers in blood vessel-forming cells, resulting in a shift in their functions; this process, called osteochondrogenic [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), transforms vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into bone-like cells. The culture of human aortic VSMCs in hyperphosphatemic conditions was found to result in with at least a three-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular events and mortality; the risk for cardiovascular events is twice as high (i.e., six-fold increased risk) in individuals with kidney insufficiency [(29)](#reference29). In CKD patients, disorders in [bone remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling) may result in excess release of phosphorus and calcium into the blood, which exacerbates hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification and accelerates the decline of kidney function. Currently, dietary phosphorus restriction is recommended to normalize serum concentrations in CKD patients, although the impact on CVD and mortality risks is not known. To avoid the adverse effects of hyperphosphatemia, the US Food and Nutrition Board set a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for oral phosphorus in generally healthy individuals ( [6](#reference6); Table 3). The lower UL for individuals over 70 years of age, compared to younger age groups, reflects the increased likelihood of impaired kidney function in elderly individuals. The UL does not apply to individuals with significantly impaired kidney function or other health conditions known to increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of (4.0 g)| intake should be from food and formula only.| Adverse health outcomes have been associated with normal serum phosphorus concentrations, suggesting that in individuals with adequate kidney function, the measurement of tightly controlled serum phosphorus levels may misrepresent the detrimental effect of high dietary phosphorus intake (see [High serum phosphorus concentrations in the general While phosphorus intakes below the UL of 4,000 mg/day should not result in hyperphosphatemia or [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) risk in healthy adults ages 19-70 years, a recent study found that daily phosphorus intakes more than twice the RDA (i.e., >1,400 mg/day) were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [(30)](#reference30). Some investigators are concerned about the increasing amounts of phosphates in the diet, which they largely attribute to phosphoric acid in some soft drinks and the increasing use of phosphate additives in processed foods [(31, 32)](#reference31). High [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus has been shown to impair [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) in the kidneys, reduce blood [calcium](../minerals/calcium), and lead to increased PTH release by the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) [(8)](#reference8). PTH stimulation then results in decreased urinary calcium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) and increased bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption); both contribute to serum calcium concentrations returning to normal [(8)](#reference8). If sustained, elevated PTH levels could have an adverse effect on bone mineral content, but this effect appears to be observed with diets that are high in phosphorus and low in calcium, underscoring the importance of a balanced dietary calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. In a small [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study), which enrolled 147 premenopausal women with adequate calcium intakes, participants with lower calcium-to-phosphorus (Ca:P) intakes (ratios 0.5) had significantly higher serum PTH levels and urinary calcium excretion than those with higher Ca:P ratios (ratios >0.5) [(33)](#reference33). A controlled trial in 10 young women found no adverse effects of a phosphorus-rich diet (3,000 mg/day) on bone-related [hormones](../glossary#hormone) and biochemical markers of bone resorption when dietary calcium intakes were maintained at almost 2,000 mg/day (Ca:P = 0.66), again demonstrating the importance of the balance between dietary calcium and phosphorus [(34)](#reference34). A cross-sectional study conducted in 2,344 Brazilian men and women (median age, 58 years) showed an association between higher phosphorus intakes and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture). Yet, intakes of other [minerals](../glossary#mineral) and [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) relevant to bone health, such as [calcium](../minerals/calcium), [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium), and [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D), were below the RDA in this population, whereas phosphorus intakes were close to the RDA [(35)](#reference35). While it appears that hormonal and calcium disorders might be prevented by an adequate calcium-to-phosphorus intake ratio, there is no convincing evidence that the dietary phosphorus levels experienced in the US adversely affect [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density). Nevertheless, the substitution of phosphate-containing soft drinks and snack foods for milk and other calcium-rich food may represent a serious risk to bone health (see the article on [Calcium](../minerals/calcium)) [(36)](#reference36). Aluminum-containing antacids reduce the absorption of dietary phosphorus by forming aluminum phosphate, which is unabsorbable. When consumed in high doses, aluminum-containing antacids can produce abnormally low blood phosphorus levels (hypophosphatemia), as well as aggravate phosphorus deficiency due to other causes [(37)](#reference37). The reduction of stomach acidity by proton-pump inhibitors may also limit the efficacy of phosphate-binder therapy in patients with kidney failure [(38)](#reference38). Excessively high doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, or its [analogs](../glossary#analog), may result in hyperphosphatemia [(6)](#reference6). [Potassium](../minerals/potassium) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) or potassium-sparing [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) taken together with phosphorus supplements may result in high blood levels of potassium (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia can be a serious problem, resulting in life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities ( [arrhythmias](../glossary#arrhythmia)). People taking such a combination must inform their health care provider and have their [serum](../glossary#serum) potassium levels checked regularly [(37)](#reference37). Additionally, prevention of bone demineralization by [hormone](../glossary#hormone) replacement therapy in postmenopausal women is associated with higher urinary phosphorus [excretion](../glossary#excretion) and lower serum phosphorus levels in treated compared to untreated women [(39, 40)](#reference39). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the [RDA](#RDA) for phosphorus (700 mg/day for adults). Although some multivitamin/mineral supplements contain more than 15% of the current RDA for phosphorus, a varied diet should easily provide adequate phosphorus for most people. At present, there is no evidence that phosphorus requirements of older adults differ from that of younger adults, and a varied diet should easily provide the RDA (700 mg/day) of phosphorus for those over 50 years of age.

The term electrolyte refers to a substance that dissociates into [ions](../glossary#ion) (charged particles) in solution, making it capable of conducting electricity. Normal body function depends on tight regulation of potassium concentrations both inside and outside of cells [(1)](#references). Potassium (K+) is the principal positively charged [ion](../glossary#ion) ( [cation](../glossary#cation)) in the fluid inside of cells, while sodium (Na+) is the principal cation in the extracellular fluid. Potassium concentrations are about 30 times higher inside than outside cells, while [sodium](sodium) concentrations are more than 10 times lower inside than outside cells. The concentration differences between potassium and sodium across [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) create an electrochemical gradient known as the [membrane potential](../glossary#membrane-potential). A cell's membrane potential is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane, especially the Na+/K+-ATPase pumps. These pumps use [ATP](../glossary#ATP) (energy) to pump sodium out of the cell in exchange for potassium (Figure 1). Their activity has been estimated to account for 20%-40% of the resting energy expenditure in a typical adult. The large proportion of energy dedicated to maintaining sodium/potassium concentration gradients emphasizes the importance of this function in sustaining life. Tight control of cell membrane potential is critical for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and heart function [(2-4)](#reference2). A limited number of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) require the presence of potassium for their activity. The activation of Na+/K+-ATPase requires the presence of sodium and potassium. The presence of potassium is also required for the activity of pyruvate kinase, an important enzyme in [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(5)](#reference5). An [plasma](../glossary#plasma) potassium concentration is referred to as hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is most commonly a result of excessive loss of potassium, e.g., from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, use of some [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) and other medications (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)), some forms of kidney disease, or metabolic disturbances. The symptoms of hypokalemia are related to alterations in [membrane potential](../glossary#membrane-potential) and cellular [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(1)](#references). They include fatigue, muscle weakness and cramps, and intestinal paralysis, which may lead to bloating, constipation, and abdominal pain. Chronic hypokalemia is associated with hypertension and kidney stone formation (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention) and [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Severe hypokalemia may result in muscular paralysis or abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac [arrhythmias](../health-disease/arrhythmia)) that can be fatal [(1](#references), [6)](#reference6). Low dietary potassium intake alone does not generally result in hypokalemia. However, insufficient dietary potassium in patients at risk of hypokalemia can precipitate hypokalemia [(1)](#references). In rare cases, habitual consumption of large amounts of black licorice has resulted in hypokalemia [(7, 8)](#reference7). Licorice contains a compound (i.e., glycyrrhizic acid) with similar physiologic effects to those of aldosterone, a [hormone](../glossary#hormone) that increases urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of potassium. The Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for potassium have been recently revised by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Medicine. The FNB did not find sufficient evidence to determine an Estimated Average Requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) and derive a Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)); instead, they established an adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) based on median intakes in generally healthy people (Table 1) [(9)](#reference9). The FNB found insufficient evidence from human studies that examined potassium intakes in relation to [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) and mortality (reviewed recently by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; [10](#reference10)) to inform the DRIs for potassium [(11)](#reference11). people residing in Western industrialized countries are quite different from those that were consumed before the agricultural revolution and the shift towards the consumption of highly refined, processed food [(12)](#reference12). Among other differences, the daily intake of sodium chloride (salt) in modern diets is about three times higher than the daily intake of potassium on a [molar](../glossary#mole) basis, whereas salt intake in primitive cultures is about seven times lower than potassium intake [(13)](#reference13). The relative deficiency of dietary potassium in the modern diet and a higher sodium-to-potassium ratio may contribute to the development of some [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have consistently reported an increased with elevated dietary sodium intakes [(14, cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have also found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between potassium intake and risk of [stroke](../health-disease/stroke). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine prospective cohort studies showed that daily potassium intakes ranging between 3,510 mg and 4,680 mg were associated with a 30% reduced risk of stroke [(16)](#reference16). No associations were found with [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) or total cardiovascular disease. In a more recent meta-analysis of 16 studies, the highest versus lowest dietary potassium intake was found to be associated with a 13% lower risk of stroke after multiple adjustments (including for blood pressure) [(17)](#reference17). The lowest risk of stroke corresponded to daily potassium intakes around 3,500 mg. Subgroup analyses showed a reduced risk of [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke), but not [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke). Finally, in a recent meta-analysis of 16 observational studies, each 1-unit increase in the dietary sodium-to-potassium ratio was found to be associated with a 22% higher risk of stroke [(12)](#reference12). Abnormally high increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones). In individuals with a history of developing calcium-containing kidney stones, increased dietary acid load has been significantly associated with increased urinary calcium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) [(18)](#reference18). Increasing dietary potassium (and alkali) intake by increasing fruit and vegetable intake or by taking potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) has been found to decrease urinary calcium excretion. Conversely, potassium deprivation has been found to increase urinary calcium excretion [(19, 20)](#reference19). Three large US [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) \u2014 the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses' Health Studies I and II \u2014 which included 193,676 participants, have examined dietary potassium intake and animal protein-to-potassium ratio (a marker of dietary acid load) in the diet in relation to the risk of developing kidney stones [(21)](#reference21). In all three cohorts, dietary potassium intake was derived almost entirely from potassium-rich foods, such as fruit and vegetables. Across the three cohorts, individuals in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of potassium intake were found to be 33%-56% less likely to develop symptomatic kidney stones than those in the lowest quintile of intake. Additionally, a pooled analysis of the data from all three cohorts showed that those with the highest versus lowest animal protein-to-potassium ratio were 41% more likely to develop kidney stones [(21)](#reference21). Urinary alkalinization with supplemental potassium citrate is used in stone formers to reduce the risk of recurrent stone formation (reviewed in [22](#reference22)). However, potassium citrate therapy should only be initiated under the supervision of a medical provider. In a 2015 case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk study, which included 5,319 individuals, dietary intakes of potassium (alone or combined with intakes of magnesium) were found to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with heel bone (calcaneus) broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) measurements (a predictor of the [risk](../glossary#risk) of incidental fracture) and risk of hip fracture in women but not in men [(23)](#reference23). More recently, a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in older Korean adults reported higher total hip and femur neck [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) in those in the top versus bottom [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of potassium intakes [(24)](#reference24). Although these [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggest a link between potassium intakes and bone health, they cannot establish whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship. The mechanisms by which potassium might influence bone health are poorly understood. Modern (Western) diets tend to be relatively low in sources of alkali ( [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables)) and high in sources of acid (fish, meat, and cheese) [(25)](#reference25). When the quantity of bicarbonate ions is insufficient to maintain normal [pH](../glossary#pH), the body is capable of mobilizing [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline) calcium salts from bone in order to neutralize acids consumed in the diet or generated by [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(26)](#reference26). Because fruit and vegetables are rich in both potassium and [precursors](../glossary#precursor) to bicarbonate ions, increasing their consumption might help reduce the net acid content of the diet and preserve calcium in bones, which might otherwise be mobilized to maintain normal pH (see the article on [Fruit and Vegetables](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/fruit-vegetables#osteoporosis-prevention)). Alternatively, potassium bicarbonate supplementation might decrease urinary acid and calcium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) and influence bone turnover \u2014 a small trial in postmenopausal women found that potassium bicarbonate supplementation increases [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of bone formation and a of bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption) [(27)](#reference27). A two-year [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial in 201 older adults without [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) (mean age, 69 years) found evidence of increased lumbar spine, hip, femoral neck, and total-body BMD, as well as trabecular BMD of the radius and tibia, with supplemental (2,340 mg/day) compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(28)](#reference28). Potassium citrate was found to increase the [serum](../glossary#serum) concentration of N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) \u2014 a marker of bone formation \u2014 and reduce the urine concentration of N-telopeptide of collagen type I (NTX) \u2014 a marker of bone resorption [(28)](#reference28). Another three-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 244 adults (50 years) examined the effect of oral potassium bicarbonate, at either 39 mg/kg/day or 58.5 mg/kg/day, on markers of bone turnover [(29)](#reference29). Both dosage regimens led to reductions in serum PINP concentration and urine NTX concentration, yet evidence of an effect was stronger with the lowest dose (median dose administered, 3,160 mg/day) rather than with the highest dose (median dose administered, 4,760 mg/day). In contrast, a two-year [randomized controlled (721 mg/day or 2,165 mg/day) nor an increase in fruit and vegetable intake (300 mg/day) had an impact on markers of bone turnover or increased BMD in postmenopausal women [(30)](#reference30). A 2015 meta-analysis of [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) found that supplemental potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate could reduce urinary net acid and calcium excretion, but evidence to support an effect on markers of bone turnover and bone density was weak [(31)](#reference31). The most recent randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in 40 postmenopausal women with [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia) found no difference in markers of bone turnover over a six-month period between those supplemented with potassium citrate and those taking a placebo [(32)](#reference32). The authors highlighted the possibility that an effect of supplemental potassium might have an impact on bone health in a subset of subjects with low potassium intakes and/or signs of low-grade acidosis. In this study, all participants received daily supplements of calcium carbonate (500 mg/day) and [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) (10 \u00b5g/day). Overall, whether consuming potassium-rich fruit and vegetables can influence bone health and help lower the risk of osteoporosis remains uncertain (see also the article on [Fruit and Vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables#osteoporosis-prevention)). Forty-five percent of US adults have [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) (blood pressure levels 130/80 mm Hg) [(33)](#reference33). Chronic hypertension damages the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys, thereby increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of heart disease and [stroke](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/stroke), as well as hypertensive kidney disease [(34, 35)](#reference34). Modern diets, which are high in [sodium](sodium) and low in potassium, are recognized as largely contributing to the high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of hypertension (see the article on [Sodium](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/sodium#health-risks-excess-sodium)). Unlike 24-hour dietary recalls, 24-hour urine collections provide accurate estimates of dietary intakes of sodium and potassium [(36)](#reference36). An analysis of the 2014 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed an increase in [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) with increasing sodium excretion and increasing sodium-to-potassium ratio in the urine [(37)](#reference37). In this study, the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) potassium excretion (mid-values, with a 62% lower risk of hypertension [(37)](#reference37). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial provided evidence of the blood pressure-lowering effect of a diet higher in [potassium](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/potassium) and [calcium](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/calcium), modestly higher in protein, and lower in total fat, [saturated fat](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#saturated-fatty-acid), [cholesterol](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/cholesterol), red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages compared to the typical US diet [(38)](#reference38). Indeed, compared to the control diet providing only 3.5 servings/day of [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) and 1,700 mg/day of potassium, adherence to the DASH diet that included 8.5 servings/day of fruit and vegetables and 4,100 mg/day of potassium lowered systolic/ [diastolic](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) blood pressures by an average 11.4/5.5 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) in people with hypertension and 3.5/2.1 mm Hg in those without hypertension [(38)](#reference38). A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of the DASH diet compared to a control diet in a total of 2,561 adults found overall reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6.7 mm Hg and 3.5 mm Hg, respectively [(39)](#reference39). However effective the DASH diet is, the blood pressure-lowering effects can hardly be solely attributed to potassium intakes [(40)](#reference40). A 2015 meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials, including 917 individuals, assessed the effects of increased potassium intake, mostly in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) [supplements](../glossary#supplement), on blood pressure [(41)](#reference41). Thirteen studies included hypertensive participants who were not taking anti-hypertensive medication and two studies included [normotensive](../glossary#normotensive) or at-risk subjects. Most studies used supplemental potassium doses between 2,340 and 2,535 mg/day (60-65 mmol/L). Increased potassium intake resulted in overall reductions of systolic blood pressure by 4.7 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.5 mm Hg. The blood pressure-lowering effect of supplemental potassium was more pronounced when the analysis was restricted to individuals with hypertension: systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found to be reduced by 6.8 mm Hg and 4.6 mm Hg, respectively [(41)](#reference41). Two additional meta-analyses published in 2017 also confirmed a blood pressure-lowering effect of supplemental potassium. Findings suggested some evidence of a greater effect when baseline potassium intake was less than 3,510 mg/day (vs. 3,510 reported a dose-response relationship between the intake of potassium and the lowering of blood pressure [(42, 43)](#reference42). Supplemental potassium can help lower blood pressure, but potassium supplements should only be used in consultation with a medical provider (see [Supplements](#supplements)). Increasing potassium intake to recommended levels (see [Adequate Intake](#AI)) by consuming a diet rich in fruit and vegetables can help lower blood pressure and may have additional benefits to health (see the article on [Fruit and Vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables)). Blood pressure is a reliable [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) risk marker [(44)](#reference44). Yet, although reducing sodium consumption while increasing potassium intake helps with lowering blood pressure [(45)](#reference45), current evidence suggests that dietary advice and support interventions may not be sufficient to deliver long-term cardiovascular benefits in individuals with hypertension [(46)](#reference46). The richest sources of potassium are [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables). [Nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), seeds, and dairy products are also good sources of potassium. A dietary survey in the US indicated that the average dietary potassium intake was 2,408 mg/day for adult women and 3,172 mg/day for adult men [(47)](#reference47). Because many individuals in the population consume potassium in amounts that are well below the [AI](../glossary#AI) and because underconsumption of potassium is linked with adverse health effects, potassium has been recognized as a \"nutrient of public health concern\" in the [2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/). In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers to display potassium content of foods on the Nutrition Facts food label [(48)](#reference48). Some relatively good dietary sources of potassium are listed in the Table 2, along with their potassium content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content search the US do not contain more than 99 mg of potassium per serving [(50)](#reference50). One milliequivalent (mEq) or one millimole (mmol) corresponds to about 39 mg of potassium. Higher doses of supplemental potassium are generally prescribed to prevent and treat potassium depletion and hypokalemia. The use of more potent potassium supplements in potassium deficiency requires close monitoring of [serum](../glossary#serum) potassium concentrations. Potassium is available in different supplemental forms, including potassium chloride, potassium citrate, potassium gluconate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium aspartate, and potassium orotate [(50)](#reference50). Because of the potential for serious side effects, one should seek medical advice before deciding to use a potassium supplement (see [Safety](#safety)). The best way to increase one's potassium intake is by increasing the consumption of potassium-rich food and beverages [(50)](#reference50). Finally, many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride, and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) is an FDA-approved general purpose sweetener. Abnormally elevated [serum](../glossary#serum) potassium concentrations are referred to as hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia occurs when potassium intake exceeds the capacity of the kidneys to eliminate it. Acute or chronic kidney failure, the use of potassium-sparing [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic), and insufficient aldosterone secretion (hypoaldosteronism) may result in the accumulation of potassium due to a decreased urinary potassium [excretion](../glossary#excretion). Oral doses of potassium >18 g taken at one time in individuals not accustomed to high intakes may lead to severe hyperkalemia, even in those with normal kidney function [(6](#reference6), [50)](#reference50). Hyperkalemia may also result from a shift of intracellular potassium into the circulation, which may occur with the rupture of red blood cells ( [hemolysis](../glossary#hemolysis)) or tissue damage (e.g., trauma or severe burns). Symptoms of hyperkalemia may include tingling of the hands and feet, muscular weakness, and temporary paralysis. The most serious complication of hyperkalemia is the development of an abnormal heart rhythm ( [cardiac arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia)), which can lead to cardiac arrest [(51)](#reference51). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) showed that heart rate in healthy adults was unlikely to be affected by the chronic use of supplemental potassium doses of 2 to 3 g/day [(52)](#reference52). See the section on [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions) for a discussion of the medications that increase the risk of hyperkalemia. [Gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms are the most common side effects of potassium [supplements](../glossary#supplement), including nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Intestinal ulceration has been reported after the use of enteric-coated potassium chloride tablets. Taking potassium with meals or taking a microencapsulated form of potassium may reduce gastrointestinal side effects [(50)](#reference50). Rashes may occasionally occur. The most serious adverse reaction to potassium supplementation is hyperkalemia, yet is rare in subjects with normal kidney function (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)). Individuals with abnormal kidney function and those on potassium-sparing medications (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)) should be monitored closely to prevent hyperkalemia [(50, 53)](#reference50). Table 3 lists the classes of medications known to increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hyperkalemia (elevated [serum](../glossary#serum) potassium) in patients hypokalemia (low serum potassium; Table 4; [55](#reference55)) . In the absence of treatment, hypokalemia can have serious complications and even be fatal (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). Various mechanisms explain how certain medications can lead to potassium depletion. For example, both loop and thiazide diuretics increase the urinary excretion of potassium. Corticoids cause sodium retention that leads to a compensatory increase in urinary potassium excretion. Penicillins formulated as sodium salts also stimulate excretion. medications, including aminoglycosides, anti-fungal agents (amphotericin-B, fluconazole), and cisplatin, can damage the renal tubular epithelium and lead to severe potassium loss. Outdated tetracycline antibiotics have been linked phosphates, caffeine| There is substantial evidence suggesting that a diet high in potassium-rich food and beverages may be associated with lower [risks](../glossary#risk) of [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones), and possibly [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis). However, currently there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between potassium intakes and the risk of these chronic conditions [(10)](#reference10). As a consequence, median potassium intakes observed in apparently healthy people were used to set adequate intakes ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) by age/life stage in the recent revision of the Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for potassium. The revised AI values are 2.6 g/day for women and 3.4 g/day for men (see [The Adequate Intake](#AI)). [Fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) are among the richest sources of dietary potassium, and a large body of evidence supports the association of increased fruit and vegetable intakes with reduced risk of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (see the article on [Fruit and Vegetables](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/fruit-vegetables)). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends the consumption of a diet high in potassium-rich foods (see [Sources](#sources)), especially fruit, vegetables, [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), and dairy products to ensure adequate potassium intakes. A diet rich in [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) that supplies 2.6-3.4 g/day of potassium (see [AI](../glossary#AI)) should contribute to maintaining a low [risk](../glossary#risk) of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) in generally healthy older adults. This recommendation does not apply to individuals who have been advised to limit potassium consumption by a health care professional (see [Safety](#safety)).

Contents [Selenium is a trace ] [element](../glossary#element) that is essential in small amounts, but like all essential elements, selenium can be toxic at high levels. Unlike plants, most animals \u2014 including humans \u2014 require selenium for the appropriate functioning of a number of incorporated into elongating proteins at very specific locations in the amino acid sequence in order to form functional selenoproteins. Although higher plants do not appear to require selenium for survival, they can incorporate it non-specifically into sulfur-containing molecules when the mineral is present in the soil [(1)](#references). Of note, in animals, the amino acid selenomethionine can be nonspecifically incorporated into proteins in place of [methionine](../glossary#methionine) [(2)](#reference2). However, only selenocysteine-containing proteins are regarded as selenoproteins (Figure 1). Twenty-five genes coding for selenoproteins have been identified in humans [(3)](#reference3). The insertion of selenocysteine into selenoproteins during [translation](../glossary#translation) is directed by the presence of a selenocysteine-insertion sequence (SECIS) within selenoprotein [mRNAs](../glossary#mRNA). Briefly, the recognition of SECIS by the translational machinery results in the recruitment of specific translational factors that decode Research is gradually uncovering the metabolic functions of all human selenoproteins, including splicing variants [(3)](#reference3). Some of the selenoproteins expressed in lining and lungs), GPx3 (highly expressed in thyroid gland and kidneys), GPx4 are [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) enzymes that reduce potentially damaging [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides, to harmless products like water and alcohols by coupling their [reduction](../glossary#reduction) with the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione) (Figure 2). [Spermatogenesis](../glossary#spermatogenesis) and male fertility are highly dependent on GPx4 and selenoprotein P (SEPP1; see [below](#selenoprotein-P)). In [spermatozoa](../glossary#spermatozoon) cells [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress). GPx4 is also a major structural [protein](../glossary#protein) of the capsule embedding mature sperm mitochondrial helix involved in sperm motility. SEPP1 is essential for selenium supply to the testes, and animal models lacking the SEPP1 [gene](../glossary#gene) are infertile due to poor selenium tissue bioavailability, defective GPx4 [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), and impaired three selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductase selenocysteine-containing [catalytic](../glossary#catalyze) site. TrxRs catalyze the [reduction](../glossary#reduction) of a disulfide isomerase also [electron](../glossary#electron) donors for the regeneration of small [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), [(6)](#reference6). The maintenance of thioredoxin in a reduced form by TrxRs is important for regulating cell growth and survival. The [protein](../glossary#protein) thioredoxin, together with TrxR1 (or TrxR3), NADPH, and FAD, constitute the thioredoxin antioxidant system involved in the reduction of peroxiredoxins, methionine signaling proteins [(7)](#reference7). TrxR1 is one of the most investigated selenoproteins and regarded as one of the major antioxidant enzymes and redox regulators in mammalian cells. The [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) gland releases very small amounts of biologically active thyroid [hormone](../glossary#hormone) (triiodothyronine or T3) and larger amounts of an inactive form of thyroid hormone (T3 [precursor](../glossary#precursor): thyroxine or T4) into the circulation. Most of the biologically active T3 in the circulation and inside cells is generated by the removal of one [iodine](iodine) atom from T4 in a reaction different and 2) can deiodinate T4, thus increasing circulating T3, while a third iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO type 3) can convert both T3 and T4 to inactive [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) (Figure 3) [(8)](#reference8). Of note, inactivation of the [genes](../glossary#gene) encoding DIOs in rodent models has revealed a role for DIO type 1 in iodine [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) and the importance of DIOs type 2 and 3 in the maturation of auditory and visual systems during fetal development [(8)](#reference8). Thus the importance of selenium in normal development, growth, and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) is not limited to its role in the regulation of thyroid gland function. Selenoprotein P (SEPP1) is predominantly produced by the liver, a major storage site for selenium, and secreted in the [plasma](../glossary#plasma). The full-length glycoprotein contains a selenium-rich domain with nine selenocysteine residues, as well as a thioredoxin-like [catalytic](../glossary#catalyze) site with one selenocysteine residue. SEPP1 constitutes the major form of selenium transport to peripheral tissues [(9)](#reference9). SEPP1 also functions as an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) that protects cells from [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) by enabling full activity of thioredoxin reductases and [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione) peroxidases through adequate extrahepatic tissues (see [Glutathione peroxidases](#glutathione-peroxidases)). SEPP1 appears to be especially critical for selenium [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) in the brain and testes where apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) facilitates the uptake of SEPP1. Megalin is another SEPP1-specific re-uptake by the kidneys [(10)](#reference10). Moreover, SEPP1 has been recently implicated in the regulation [glucose](../glossary#glucose) and [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) isoforms (homologues) and is highly conserved across species. In humans, SEPW is expressed in numerous tissues, with highest levels found in skeletal muscle and heart [(12)](#reference12). SEPW contains a selenocysteine residue and a cysteine residue that binds to a [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione) molecule, suggesting a role in [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) regulation [(13)](#reference13). The expression of SEPW is correlated with selenium status and appears to be sensitive to low-selenium supply [(14, 15)](#reference14). SEPW expression in the brain has been found to confer protection against [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress)-induced [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cell death [(16)](#reference16). SEPW also appears to a negative regulator for 14-3-3 [proteins](../glossary#protein). Indeed, 14-3-3 inhibition by SEPW in breast cancer cells was found to increase cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and cell survival through increasing resistance to genotoxic stress [(17)](#reference17). In skeletal muscle cells, SEPW was shown to reduce the binding of 14-3-3 to TAZ, allowing TAZ translocation to the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) and activation of muscle cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) [genes](../glossary#gene) [(18)](#reference18). Finally, SEPW was found to prevent the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in breast and prostate epithelial cells in culture. EGFR is constitutively activated in many tumors, and evidence of a role for SEPW in EGFR activation and signaling may help shed light on the relationship between selenium status and cancer risk [(19)](#reference19). There is no free pool of the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) selenocysteine in cells such that selenocysteine [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) takes place on a specialized tRNA during the [translation](../glossary#translation) of selenoprotein (Figure 4) [(20)](#reference20). synthetase 2 is a selenoenzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of selenophosphate from hydrogen selenide (Figure 4) [(3)](#reference3). The methionine sulfoxide reduction system is involved in the protection against [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and is especially critical for the regeneration of [proteins](../glossary#protein) damaged by [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS). Indeed, ROS can [oxidize](../glossary#oxidation) [methionine](../glossary#methionine) residues (methionine sulfoxides) within proteins and potentially impair their activities. In humans, two stereospecific families of methionine sulfoxide reductases (MsrA and MsrB) three genes of methionine sulfoxide is reduced by MsrB1, 2, or 3. Only MsrB1 has been characterized as a selenoprotein with one selenocysteine residue in its catalytic site. MsrB1 appears to be involved in the [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) regulation of certain proteins. In macrophages, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton necessary for chemotaxis and requires MsrB1-dependent methionine-R-sulfoxide residues within actin [(21)](#reference21). Studies using MSR gene inactivation in mice have also shown that methionine sulfoxide reduction is implicated in the regulation of the methionine cycle (reviewed in [22](#reference22)). Both the thioredoxin (Trx) and GSH-dependent glutaredoxin expressed in several tissues, including [prostate](../glossary#prostate), kidney, testes, liver, and brain [(23)](#reference23). Although its function is not known, SEP15 was found to interact with the endoplasmic reticulum UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) folding [(24, 25)](#reference24). Because SEP15 has a thioredoxin-like [catalytic](../glossary#catalyze) site, SEP15 is thought to either regulate UGGT activity or the [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) state of UGGT substrates [(26)](#reference26). Mice lacking a functional SEP15 were found to develop nuclear [cataract](../glossary#cataract) (lens opacification) at a very early age suggesting that SEP15 may be critical to the quality control system of protein folding in the [lens](../glossary#lens) [(27)](#reference27). SEP15 may also be implicated in anticancer mechanisms (reviewed in [28](#reference28)). The mammalian selenoprotein S (known as SEPS1, (ER) membrane [protein](../glossary#protein). SEPS1 is involved in the cellular response to ER stress (ER-associated degradation; ERAD) activated by the detection of misfolded proteins. SEPS1 contributes to the removal and transfer (retrotranslocation) of misfolded proteins from the ER [lumen](../glossary#lumen) to the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol) where proteins are tagged with ubiquitin before being degraded. A [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) or variation in the sequence within an ER-response element located in the SEPS1 promoter was found to result in reduced SEPS1 promoter activity and [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) [(29)](#reference29). The polymorphism corresponding to the substitution of a guanine (G) by an adenine (A) at [nucleotide](../glossary#nucleotide) -105 (-105G>A) has been associated with increased plasma levels of pro- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine). In addition, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) recently reported that the A [allele](../glossary#allele) was more [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) in individuals affected by Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) \u2014 a T-cell-mediated [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) resulting in the destruction of thyroid cells \u2014 than in healthy controls [(30)](#reference30). Other associations between SEPS1 polymorphism (including -105G>A) and susceptibility to various conditions, such as [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease), or [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) [cancers](../glossary#cancer), strongly suggest a role for this selenoprotein in the regulation of [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) and immune responses [(31-34)](#reference31). Other less well-characterized selenoproteins, which are also localized in the ER lumen and/or membrane, include selenoproteins K, M, N, and T [(35)](#reference35). The importance of selenium to biological systems, and specifically to the cellular [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) ( [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant)/ [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant)) balance, is derived from its presence as selenocysteine in the [catalytic](../glossary#catalyze) site of selenoproteins (see [Function](#function)). Other [minerals](../glossary#mineral) that are in synergy with the antioxidant vitamins, [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) (ascorbic acid) and [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) (-tocopherol), by regenerating them from their oxidized forms and promoting maximal antioxidant protection [(36-38)](#reference36). While [iodine](iodine) is [hormones](../glossary#hormone), the selenium-containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) are [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the biologically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3) (see [Function](#function)). DIO1 activity may also be regulating iodine [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) [(39)](#reference39). The selenoenzymes, glutathione peroxidases, also play a critical role in thyroid function because they [catalyze](../glossary#catalyze) the degradation of peroxides generated during thyroid hormone [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) [(8)](#reference8). The epidemiology of coexisting iodine and selenium deficiencies in central Africa, but not in China, has been linked to the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of myxedematous [cretinism](../glossary#cretinism), a severe form of [congenital hypothyroidism](../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) accompanied by mental and physical retardation. Selenium deficiency may be only one of several undetermined factors that might exacerbate the detrimental effects of iodine deficiency [(40)](#reference40). Interestingly, selenium deficiency in rodents was found to have little impact on DIO activities as it appears that selenium is being supplied in priority for adequate synthesis of DIOs at the expense of other selenoenzymes [(8)](#reference8). Insufficient selenium intake may negatively affect the activity (MsrB1). Even when severe, isolated selenium deficiency does not usually result in obvious clinical illness. Yet, compared to subjects with adequate selenium status, selenium-deficient individuals might be more susceptible to additional physiological stresses [(41)](#reference41). Prolonged selenium deficiency may likely contribute to Keshan and Kashin-Beck diseases (see [below](#Keshan-disease)). Selenium deficiency has been reported in chronically ill patients who were receiving [total parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) (TPN) without added selenium for prolonged periods of time. Muscular weakness, muscle wasting, and [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) ( [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and damage to the heart muscle) have been observed in these patients. Nowadays, TPN solutions are routinely [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with selenium. The risk of selenium deficiency may be increased following bariatric surgery or in severe [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) conditions, such as [Crohn's disease](../glossary#crohn-disease). Some specialized medical diets like those used to treat certain metabolic disorders, including [phenylketonuria](../glossary#phenylketonuria), homocystinuria, and maple syrup urine disease, need to be supplemented with selenium to ensure optimum selenium status in patients [(42)](#reference42). Keshan disease is a fatal form of dilated [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) that was first described in young women and children in a selenium-deficient region in China. The [acute](../glossary#acute) form of the disease is characterized by the sudden onset of cardiac insufficiency, while the chronic form results in moderate-to-severe heart enlargement with varying degrees of cardiac insufficiency [(43)](#reference43). The incidence of Keshan disease is closely associated with very low dietary intakes of selenium and poor selenium nutritional status. Selenium supplementation (in the form of sodium selenite; Na2SeO3) was found to protect people from developing Keshan disease but could not reverse heart muscle damage once it had occurred [(43)](#reference43). A recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) reported that selenium-responsive glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) activity was significantly lower in Keshan patients compared to healthy individuals. Interestingly, a specific GPX1 [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) resulting in a proline-to-leucine transition at position 198 (Pro198Leu) is associated with a reduction in GPx1 activity and found to be more [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) in Keshan patients. This GPX1 polymorphism might confer a greater susceptibility to Keshan disease in carriers with low selenium nutritional status [(44)](#reference44). While selenium deficiency is a major etiological factor of Keshan disease, the seasonal and annual variation in disease occurrence suggested that other factors, especially an infectious agent, might be involved in addition to selenium deficiency [(45)](#reference45). Coxsackie [virus](../glossary#virus) B3 is one virus type that has been isolated from Keshan patients, and animal studies have shown that this virus was capable of causing an [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the heart ( [myocarditis](../glossary#myocarditis)) in selenium-deficient mice. Studies in mice also indicated that [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) induced by selenium deficiency could result in changes in the viral [genome](../glossary#genome), such as to convert a relatively harmless strain of coxsackie virus B3 into a myocarditis-causing strain [(43)](#reference43). Although not proven in Keshan disease, it is possible that selenium deficiency may increase the [virulence](../glossary#virulent) of viruses with the potential to invade and damage the heart muscle [(46)](#reference46). Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is another endemic condition that affects an estimated 2.5 million people in Tibet, northern and central China, North Korea, and southeastern Siberia [(47)](#reference47). KBD is characterized by the degeneration of articular [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage) between joints ( [osteoarthritis](../glossary#osteoarthritis)) that can result in joint deformities and dwarfism in the most severe forms of the disease. The disease affects children as young as two years old. As with Keshan disease, KBD is [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) in selenium-deficient provinces and thus generally affects people with very low selenium intakes [(47)](#reference47). Recent studies have suggested that increased susceptibility to KBD in selenium-deficient populations might result from a reduced [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) protection associated with [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in GPX [genes](../glossary#gene) [(48, 49)](#reference48). the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) be [multifactorial](../glossary#multifactorial), as a number of other causative factors have been suggested for KBD, including fungal toxins in grain, [iodine](iodine) deficiency, and contaminated drinking water [(43)](#reference43). Recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of a few small trials and [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have indicated that improving selenium nutritional status in children living in endemic areas may help reduce KBD incidence [(50)](#reference50). Also, there is limited evidence to suggest that selenium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) could be useful in the treatment of patients with KBD. A meta-analysis of 10 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) reported a significant increase in the repairing rate of bone lesions in KBD children supplemented with sodium selenite for at least one year [(51)](#reference51). Larger trials of higher quality are needed to assess whether selenium supplementation could result in disease remission. The dietary reference intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for selenium were last revised in 2000 by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine. The most recent [RDA](../glossary#RDA) is based on the estimated average requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) needed to Of note, the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reported that over 99% of the US participants had serum selenium concentrations consistent with selenium requirements being met [(52)](#reference52), suggesting selenium supplementation is not needed for Americans. There has been considerable research on the effect of selenium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on the incidence of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) in animals. More than two-thirds of over 100 published studies in 20 different animal models of spontaneous, [viral](../glossary#virus), and chemically induced cancers found that selenium supplementation (to at least adequate intake levels) significantly reduces tumor incidence, especially in comparison to selenium-deficient diets [(53)](#reference53). Evidence of cancer-inhibiting effects of selenium has provided a strong rationale for investigating potential associations between selenium intake and cancer [risk](../glossary#risk) in humans. Most of the early [epidemiological evidence](../glossary#epidemiological-study) from [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) and [nested case-control studies](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) suggested either null or inverse between selenium exposure and [risk](../glossary#risk) of site-specific [cancers](../glossary#cancer) [(54)](#reference54). Markers of selenium exposure include toenail and selenium content, as well as [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. However, it is not clear whether they adequately reflect selenium exposure from dietary and supplemental sources (see [Sources](#sources)) or selenium distribution in tissues and organs that may be affected by cancer. In the Danish Prospective Diet, Cancer, and Health prospective study that followed over 57,000 men and women for 14 years, the risk of [rectal](../glossary#rectum) cancer was found to be 42% higher in current smokers compared to nonsmokers. No difference between smokers and nonsmokers regarding supplemental and dietary intakes of [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient), including selenium, was found to contribute to the association of smoking and rectal cancer [(55)](#reference55). Yet, because studies have consistently reported lower blood selenium concentrations and GPx activities in smokers compared to nonsmokers (reviewed in [56](#reference56)), estimation of selenium intakes might not be a reliable marker of selenium exposure in this population. Also, the chemical forms of selenium found in food are varied (see [Sources](#sources)) and may have very different biological and toxicological effects [(57, 58)](#reference57). A recent Cochrane review included 55 completed [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) \u2014 mostly with a nested case-control design \u2014 published over three decades [(54)](#reference54). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 16 of these observational studies, including over 144,000 individuals, reported that higher versus lower selenium status was associated with a 31% lower risk of cancer at any site and a 40% lower risk of cancer-related mortality. A significantly lower risk was reported for bladder cancer (5 studies) and [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer (17 studies); however, higher selenium status was not inversely associated with risks of breast cancer (8 studies), lung cancer (12 studies), [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) (5 studies), and [gastric](../glossary#gastric) cancer (5 studies) [(54)](#reference54). Another meta-analysis of 16 observational studies reported an inverse relationship between breast cancer and serum selenium concentrations [(59)](#reference59). Gender differences in cancer susceptibility have been reported in some studies, although consistent evidence of different effects in men and women appears to be lacking. Single [nucleotide](../glossary#nucleotide) variations ( [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism)) in the sequence of [genes](../glossary#gene) can modify [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) level and the stability and activity of the [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) [proteins](../glossary#protein). For example, a proline-to-leucine transition caused by a specific polymorphism in the GPX1 gene (rs1050450 C>T) is associated with reduced GPx1 [enzymatic](../glossary#enzyme) activity. The description of several polymorphisms in genes encoding selenoproteins has led to evaluation of possible associations with selenium status and cancer incidence. Notably, certain polymorphisms in genes coding for selenoproteins have been associated with increased risks of gastric and [colorectal cancers](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) (reviewed in [60](#reference60)). Additionally, a number of studies have investigated the effect of selenoprotein polymorphisms on the relationship between selenium status and prostate cancer risk. A nested case-control study within the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort has combined genotyping for several selenoprotein variants with markers of selenium status [(61)](#reference61). Briefly, the study showed that a GPX1 gene polymorphism (rs1050450 C>T) affected the association between selenium concentrations and prostate cancer risk. Specifically, selenium concentrations were found to be inversely associated with prostate cancer risk only among carriers of the GPX1 T allele. Additional variants in selenoprotein genes may mitigate the effect of selenium status on the risk of prostate cancer [(62, 63)](#reference62). In another nested case-control study within the Physicians' Health Study (PHS), individuals in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of selenium concentrations were found to have a reduced risk of prostate cancer-related mortality except if carrying a specific variant in 15kDa selenoprotein gene (SEP15 rs561104 G>A) [(64)](#reference64). More research is needed to further unravel the mechanisms underlying the influence of gene-diet interactions on the risk of developing cancer. Community-based studies: A very early [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) of selenium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) was undertaken in China among a general population of 130,471 individuals living in a high- [risk](../glossary#risk) area for [viral](../glossary#virus) [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis) B infection and liver cancer. The trial provided table salt enriched with sodium selenite to the population of one township (20,847 people) using four other townships as controls. During an eight-year follow-up period, the average incidence of liver cancer was reduced by 35% in the selenium-supplemented population, while no reduction was found in the control populations. In a [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) in the same region, 226 individuals with evidence of chronic hepatitis B infection were supplemented daily with either 200 g of selenium in the form of a selenium-enriched yeast tablet or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) yeast tablet. During the 4-year follow-up period, 7 out of 113 individuals on the placebo developed primary liver cancer, while none of the 113 subjects supplemented with selenium developed liver cancer [(65)](#reference65). Randomized controlled trials: The [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) study in 1,312 older adults with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found that supplementation with 200 g/day of selenium-enriched yeast (selenized yeast) for an average of 7.4 years resulted in a 52% decrease in prostate cancer incidence in men (reviewed in [66](#reference66)). The protective effect of selenium supplementation was greatest in men with lower baseline [plasma](../glossary#plasma) selenium and [prostate-specific antigen](../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) levels. A reduced incidence in lung, colorectal, and total cancer was also associated with supplementation with 200 g/day [(67)](#reference67) but not with 400 g/day of selenium-enriched yeast [(68)](#reference68). Besides, selenium supplementation increased the risk of one type of skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) by 25%. A larger [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled intervention trial (the SELECT study) in more than 35,000 middle-aged and selenium-replete men, randomized to receive selenium (in of selenomethionine, 200 g/day) and/or [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) supplementation, was halted because of concerns regarding an increased risk of type 2 diabetes with selenium and increased risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E [(69, 70)](#reference69). In addition, the supplementation of selenium, alone or together with vitamin E, did not show any benefits regarding the risk of prostate, lung, or colorectal cancers after 5.5 years of follow-up [(71, 72)](#reference71). Outcomes from other smaller trials (reviewed in [66](#reference66)) also suggested either a lack of an effect or the possibility of an increased risk of cancer. The lack of a beneficial effect of selenium supplementation was supported in a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(54)](#reference54). Low activity levels of peroxidases (CVD) [(73)](#reference73). Theoretically, the maintenance of an optimal selenium status has the potential to protect against oxidative stress (including [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation)) and could eventually prevent chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) disorders. Yet, analyses of [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data from 13,887 US adults included in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) failed to show any significant associations between serum selenium concentrations and individuals with [renal](../glossary#renal) insufficiency are at higher risk of developing CAD compared to those with normal kidney function, that risk was not found to be greater with low rather than normal selenium concentrations in serum (98 ng/mL vs. >98 ng/mL) [(75)](#reference75). cross-sectional study based on NHANES 2003-2004 data from 2,638 participants ages 40 years and over found that the risk of high blood pressure ( [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension)), a major contributing factor for CVD, was 73% higher in individuals in the upper versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of [serum](../glossary#serum) selenium concentrations (150 Yet, a recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of the literature failed to find enough evidence to support any relationship between serum selenium concentrations and hypertension [(77)](#reference77). Besides, a few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have also reported associations between normal-to-high selenium status and elevated serum [lipid](../glossary#lipid) levels in selenium- [replete](../glossary#replete) populations, speculating that selenium might interfere with lipid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and adversely affect cardiovascular health [(78, 79)](#reference78). At present, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have not provided consistent results regarding the effect of selenium supplementation on lipid levels nor have they demonstrated any additional cardiovascular benefits of selenium in individuals with suboptimal or optimal selenium intakes [(80)](#reference80). Selenium deficiency has been associated with impaired immunity and chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) [(81)](#reference81). A considerable amount of research conducted in cell culture and animal models indicates that selenium plays essential roles in regulating the migration, [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), activation, and optimal function of immune cells, thus influencing innate immunity, B-cell dependent [antibody](../glossary#antibody) production, and T-cell immunity (reviewed in [82](#reference82)). Recent evidence on the role of selenium and selenoproteins in the production of [lipid](../glossary#lipid) mediators (called [eicosanoids](../glossary#eicosanoid)) involved in inflammatory responses suggests that selenium supplementation might mitigate dysfunctional inflammatory responses that contribute to the pathogenesis of many chronic health conditions [(83)](#reference83). At present, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to evaluate the potential benefits of selenium supplementation in inflammatory disorders, such as [asthma](../glossary#asthma) [(84)](#reference84) and [inflammatory bowel disease](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease) [(85)](#reference85). In areas of widespread malnutrition, deficiencies in [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) (including selenium) are common in individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus ( [HIV](../glossary#HIV)) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS)). Before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became the standard for HIV treatment, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) had consistently reported associations between low [serum](../glossary#serum) selenium concentrations and HIV infection in well-nourished subjects [(86)](#reference86). Poor selenium status has been linked to increased [risks](../glossary#risk) of dilated [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) and mortality in HIV-infected children and adults, as well as mother-to-child HIV transmission and perinatal mortality (reviewed in [87](#reference87). Early laboratory studies have suggested that HIV might disrupt normal [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) defenses in infected T-cells by reducing the levels of selenoproteins, i.e., thioredoxine glutathione [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) found that HIV-seropositive individuals receiving ART for more than two years had undetectable [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [viral](../glossary#virus) loads, higher CD4 [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) concentrations compared ART-na\u00efve subjects [(88)](#reference88). Because the antioxidant activity of selenoproteins may interfere with viral replication in HIV-infected immune cells [(89,90)](#reference89), it has been suggested that selenium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) might serve as a potential [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to ART for HIV patients. A few trials of selenium supplementation in HIV-infected individuals have been conducted. A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 186 HIV-positive adults initially found that selenium supplementation at 200 g/day for two years significantly decreased the rate of hospital admissions [(91)](#reference91). Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 174 HIV-positive individuals reported that 200 g/day of selenium supplementation (in the form of selenium-enriched yeast) for nine months increased serum selenium concentrations, improved CD4 lymphocyte T-cell count, and prevented any progression of the HIV viral load [(92)](#reference92). In a third double-blind trial in Tanzania, 913 pregnant women between 12 and 27 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive 200 g/day of selenium (as selenomethionine) or a placebo until six months after birth. Selenium supplementation had no effect on maternal CD4, CD8, and CD3 T-cell counts and on HIV viral load, but it significantly decreased the risk of acute or persistent diarrhea [(93, 94)](#reference93). In addition, the risk of death between six weeks and six months postpartum was significantly reduced in infants of mothers supplemented with selenium compared to placebo [(94)](#reference94). A recent four-armed trial in Botswana randomized 878 HIV-positive adults at an early stage of the infection to receive either a placebo treatment, multivitamins (vitamins B, C, and E), 200 g/day of selenium, or both multivitamins and selenium for 24 months [(95)](#reference95). Unlike selenium alone, supplementation with multivitamins (with or without selenium) reduced the risk of immune decline by significantly increasing the time before ART initiation became necessary (i.e., when CD4 T-cell count fell below 251 cells/mcL) compared to placebo. In the study, a combined outcome of (1) CD4 T-cell count falling below 251 cells/mcL; (2) occurrence of AIDS-defining conditions; and (3) AIDS-related death \u2014 whichever happened first \u2014 was used to evaluate disease progression in the different arms of treatment. Compared to placebo, there was a longer period of time from randomization to the date of the composite outcome in individuals supplemented with multivitamins plus selenium, but not in those who received multivitamins or selenium alone [(95)](#reference95). More research is needed to replicate these preliminary results, especially in settings and communities where malnutrition hastens the progression of HIV infection and access to antiretroviral therapy may be limited. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) results from a systemic [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) response that can be due to an infection (sepsis) [(96)](#reference96). Severe sepsis and septic shock \u2014 defined as persistent sepsis-induced low blood pressure \u2014 are associated with elevated mortality rates in critically ill patients [(96, 97)](#reference96). Because systemic inflammatory responses involve excessive [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), it has been suggested that providing [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients like selenium may improve the outcome of critically ill patients in intensive care units. Two recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) selenium supplementation (as sodium selenite) in critically ill patients with SIRS, sepsis, or septic shock resulted in significantly reducing the risk of mortality by 17% to 27% [(98, 99)](#reference98). More trials are needed to identify the appropriate schedule of selenium administration (in terms of dose, route, and treatment duration) and to assess additional outcomes (e.g., infectious complications and length of hospital stay). Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT; chronic autoimmune thyroiditis) is an [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) characterized T-cell infiltration in the [thyroid gland](../glossary#thyroid) and circulating autoantibodies (predominantly raised against thyroid peroxidase), causing prolonged [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), tissue damage, and hypothyroidism [(8)](#reference8). While the function of the thyroid gland of healthy individuals is usually protected from variations in selenium supply, selenium deficiency and genetic [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) affecting the activity of selenoproteins might be potential contributing factors to autoimmune thyroid diseases. A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) [(100)](#reference100) identified four [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that evaluated the effect of selenium supplementation as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) treatment to T4 replacement therapy (levothyroxine) in HT patients [(101-104)](#reference101). While three out of four studies suggested a reduction in levels of circulating autoantibodies, none of them provided information on whether selenium may improve mood- and health-related symptoms to allow for a decreased dosage of levothyroxine. Another randomized controlled trial found that selenium supplementation improved the well being of patients affected by another autoimmune thyroid disease leading to hyperthyroidism (Graves disease) [(105)](#reference105). The results of two ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled trials \u2014 the CATALYST in HT patients and the GRASS trial in patients with Graves disease \u2014 may provide insight into an effect of selenium on thyroid-specific quality-of-life criteria and inform clinical decision making [(106, 107)](#reference106). The richest food sources of selenium are organ meats and seafood, followed by muscle meats. Drinking water is not considered to be a significant source of selenium in North America. However, in areas, where high levels of selenium in soil contribute to the selenium content of the water, higher levels of selenium may be found in wells used for drinking water [(108)](#reference108). In general, there is wide variation in the selenium content of plants and grains, especially because some plants, including garlic, Brazil nuts, and multiple Brassica species, tend to accumulate selenium ('selenium accumulators'), while other assimilate selenium to a lesser extent ('non-accumulators'). The assimilation of selenium by plants also depends on soil selenium content. Brazil nuts grown in areas of Brazil with selenium-rich soil may provide more than 100 g of selenium in one nut, while those grown in selenium-poor soil provide 10 times less [(109)](#reference109). In the US, grains are a good source of selenium, but fruit and vegetables tend to be relatively poor in selenium. Various chemical forms (species) of selenium are Although the two latter compounds are predominant in plants of the Allium and Brassicaceae families (which include garlic, onion, and broccoli), wheat, other grains (including Brazil nuts), and soy are rich in selenomethionine and contain smaller amounts of selenocysteine and selenate. Less is known about selenium species and distribution in dietary sources of animal origin. Animal nutrition and growth conditions certainly contribute to the selenium species formed and their relative quantities, and it is assumed that the metabolic pathway of dietary selenium in animals is similar to that in humans. Selenocysteine is predominantly formed in animals fed inorganic selenium, while selenomethionine is derived from dietary sources of plant origin (reviewed in [110](#reference110)). In the US, the national survey NHANES III reported mean dietary intakes ranging between 100.5 g/day and 158.5 g/day in adults ages 19-50 years [(52)](#reference52). Table 2 lists some good food sources of selenium and their selenium content in micrograms (g). For more information on the selenium content of specific foods, search ounces (1 cup)||7.6| | *Above the tolerable upper intake level ( | Selenium [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are available in several forms. Sodium selenite and sodium selenate are inorganic forms of selenium. Sodium selenate is almost completely absorbed, but a significant amount is [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine before it can be incorporated into [proteins](../glossary#protein). Sodium selenite is only about 50% absorbed but is better retained than selenate once it is absorbed. Selenomethionine is about 90% absorbed [(52)](#reference52); however, only about 34% may then actually be converted to free selenomethionine [(111)](#reference111). Selenomethionine and selenium-enriched yeast, which mainly supply selenomethionine, are also available as supplements. The consumer should be aware that some forms of selenium-enriched yeast on the market contain yeast plus mainly inorganic forms of selenium. Although both inorganic and organic forms of selenium can be metabolized to selenocysteine by the body and incorporated into selenoenzymes, they may not equally contribute to the maintenance of an adequate selenium status. In [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial), supplementation with an organic form of selenium (selenomethionine) more effectively increased blood selenium concentrations compared to supplementation with inorganic forms (i.e., sodium selenite and sodium forms may increase [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity more effectively than organic forms (reviewed in [112](#reference112)). It has also been suggested that the incorporation of selenomethionine in place of [methionine](../glossary#methionine) into tissue [proteins](../glossary#protein) may ensure that selenium is available upon protein turnover [(110)](#reference110). Selenium-enriched foods have been of interest to scientists, especially because of the suggestion that some of the chemical forms of selenium produced by plants might be more potent modifiers of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) than those currently available in [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Although there is currently no evidence of long-term health benefits associated with the consumption of selenium-enriched foods, results from animal studies and [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) suggest that protein-based sources of selenium are more effective at increasing GPx activity than selenium-enriched yeast and selenomethionine [(112)](#reference112). Food [fortification](../glossary#fortification) may also represent a cost-effective strategy to improve selenium nutritional status in populations at risk of inadequacy [(113)](#reference113). Although selenium is required for health, high doses of selenium can be toxic. Acute and fatal toxicities have occurred with accidental or suicidal ingestion of gram quantities of selenium. Clinically significant selenium toxicity was reported in 13 individuals after taking supplements that contained 27.3 mg (27,300 g) per tablet due to a manufacturing error. Chronic selenium toxicity (selenosis) may occur with smaller doses of selenium over long periods of time. The most frequently reported symptoms of selenosis are hair and nail brittleness and loss. Other symptoms may include [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disturbances, skin rashes, a garlic breath odor, fatigue, irritability, and [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorders. In an area of China with a high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of selenosis, toxic effects occurred with increasing frequency when blood selenium concentrations reached a level corresponding to an intake of 850 g/day. The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for selenium at 400 g/day in adults based on the prevention of hair and nail brittleness and loss and early signs of chronic selenium toxicity [(52)](#reference52). The UL of 400 g/day for adults includes both selenium obtained from food and selenium from A few studies have examined the relationship between selenium status and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). In the [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) analysis of NHANES III (1988-1994) data from 8,876 adult participants, the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of [serum](../glossary#serum) selenium concentrations (137 ng/mL vs. <111 ng/mL) was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes [(114)](#reference114). Data analyses from 917 participants (40 years of age) of NHANES 2003-2004 also indicated an increased [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of type 2 diabetes in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of serum selenium concentrations (147 ngm/L vs. <124 ng/mL). in the highest versus lowest quartile of serum selenium concentrations also had higher levels of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose and glycated hemoglobin, suggestive of poor The [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 1,312 participants in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial found that selenium supplementation (200 g/day; mean follow-up of 7.7 years) significantly increased the risk for type 2 diabetes in participants in the highest tertile of baseline plasma selenium concentrations [(116)](#reference116). In addition, in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), more cases of type 2 diabetes were found in the selenium group (200 g/day; median follow-up of 5.5 years) than in the placebo group, but this was only a trend and not statistically significant [(72)](#reference72). At present, the mechanisms behind these observations are not well understood. An increase in [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) has been reported in individuals with congenital (inborn) deficiency of most selenoproteins [(117)](#reference117). Results from several animal studies also indicated that selenium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) and selenoproteins may interfere with [insulin](../glossary#insulin) action and [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) (reviewed in [118](#reference118)). On the other hand, recent studies have found that impaired glucose [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in patients with type 2 diabetes may affect SEPP1 expression and selenium homeostasis [(11](#reference11), [119, 120)](#reference119). While more research is needed to fully understand the interplay between [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) metabolism and selenium homeostasis, the use of selenium supplements is considered unlikely to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in healthy individuals but should be discouraged in those with high selenium status and/or at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes [(118)](#reference118). At present, few interactions between selenium and medications have been reported [(121)](#reference121). For example, the [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) drug valproic acid and the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin may lower circulating selenium concentrations in treated subjects [(122, 123)](#reference122). Also, supplemental sodium selenite was found to reduce the toxicity of the antibiotic nitrofurantoin and the herbicide paraquat in animal studies [(124)](#reference124). A three-year [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 patients disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CAD) and low high-density-lipoprotein ( [HDL](../glossary#HDL)) of simvastatin (Zocor) and [niacin](../vitamins/niacin) increased HDL2 subfraction levels, inhibited the progression of coronary artery [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(125)](#reference125). Surprisingly, when an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) combination (1,000 mg of vitamin C, 800 IU of vitamin E (d--tocopherol), 100 g of selenium, and 25 mg of -carotene daily) was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects were diminished. However, the individual contribution of selenium cannot be established, and other studies have reported that antioxidant vitamins alone could interfere with the action of HDL-raising drugs, including statins [(126)](#reference126). The average American diet is estimated to provide about 100 g/day of selenium, an amount that is well above the current [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (55 g/day) and appears sufficient to optimize [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. A recent 10-week [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in healthy British adults (ages, 50-64 years) estimated that about 105 g/day of total selenium intake was required to maximize the plasma concentrations of selenoprotein P (SEPP1), another useful [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of selenium status [(127)](#reference127). However, a similar trial in an American cohort with higher baseline plasma selenium concentrations found no effect of selenium supplementation on SEPP1 concentrations [(128)](#reference128). While the in multivitamin/mineral (MVM) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) varies considerably, MVM supplements rarely provide more than the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of 70 g. Eating a varied diet and taking a daily MVM supplement should provide sufficient selenium for most people in the US and help improve selenium status in populations with lower selenium intakes outside the US. At present, the effect of selenium supplementation on [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) is not clear enough to support a general recommendation for an extra selenium [supplement](../glossary#supplement), especially in men with serum selenium concentrations consistent with adequate selenium intakes. The SELECT trial found that 200 g/day of selenium did not reduce the risk of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer [(72)](#reference72), refuting the results of the NPC trial (see [Cancer](#cancer-prevention)). Another recent multicenter, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial (the Negative Biopsy Trial) in 699 men at high risk of prostate cancer found no effect of either 200 g/day or 400 g/day of selenium on prostate cancer risk during a mean follow-up of 36 months [(129)](#reference129). In addition, because current evidence suggests a U-shaped relationship between selenium status and prostate cancer risk [(130)](#reference130), men should avoid taking supplemental selenium that would exceed 200 g/day. At present, there is no clinical evidence showing that selenium supplementation above recommended levels decreases the risk of breast cancer although some, but not all, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found an inverse relationship between selenium status and breast cancer in women [(59)](#reference59). Aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for selenium. A five-year, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in healthy Danish older people (ages at inclusion, 60-74 years) found that selenium supplementation (100-300 g/day) had [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), including GPx [(131)](#reference131).

Total body sodium in an average 70-kg person is of about 4,200 mmol (~100 g), of which 40% is found in bone and 60% in the fluid inside and outside of cells [(1)](#references). Total body chloride averages 2,310 mmol (~82 g), of which 70% is distributed in the [extracellular fluid](../glossary#extracellular-fluid) and the remaining is found in the [collagen](../glossary#collagen) of connective tissue [(1)](#references). Multiple mechanisms work in concert to tightly regulate the body's sodium and chloride concentrations. Although this review emphasizes the function and requirements of sodium, sodium and chloride [ions](../glossary#ion) work together to control extracellular volume and blood pressure [(1)](#references). Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are the principal [ions](../glossary#ion) in the extracellular compartment, which includes blood [plasma](../glossary#plasma), interstitial fluid (fluid between cells), and transcellular fluid (e.g., [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid), joint fluid). As such, they play critical roles in a number of life-sustaining processes. Sodium and chloride are [electrolytes](../glossary#electrolytes) that contribute to the maintenance of concentration and charge differences across [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). [Potassium](potassium) (K+) is the principal positively charged [ion](../glossary#ion) ( [cation](../glossary#cation)) inside of cells, while sodium is the principal cation in [extracellular fluid](../glossary#extracellular-fluid). Potassium concentrations are about 30 times higher inside than outside cells, while sodium concentrations are more than 10 times lower inside than outside cells. The concentration differences between potassium and sodium across cell membranes create an electrochemical gradient known as the [membrane potential](../glossary#membrane-potential). A cell's membrane potential is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane, especially the Na+/K+ ATPase pumps. These pumps use [ATP](../glossary#ATP) (energy) to pump sodium out of the cell in exchange for potassium (Figure 1). Their activity has been estimated to account for 20%-40% of the resting energy expenditure in a typical adult. The large proportion of energy dedicated to maintaining sodium/potassium concentration gradients emphasizes the importance of this function in sustaining life. Tight control of cell membrane potential is critical for [nerve impulse](../glossary#nerve-impulse) transmission, muscle contraction, and cardiac function [(2-4)](#reference2). Absorption of sodium in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) plays an important role in the absorption of chloride, [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid), [glucose](../glossary#glucose), and water. Similar mechanisms are involved in the reabsorption of these nutrients after they have been filtered from the blood by the kidneys. Chloride, in the form of hydrochloric acid (HCl), is also an important component of [gastric](../glossary#gastric) juice, which aids the digestion and absorption of many nutrients [(5)](#reference5). Because sodium is the primary determinant of [extracellular fluid](../glossary#extracellular-fluid) volume, including blood volume, a number of physiological mechanisms that regulate blood volume and blood pressure work by adjusting the body's sodium content. In the circulatory system, pressure receptors (baroreceptors) sense changes in blood pressure and send excitatory or inhibitory signals to the nervous system and/or [endocrine](../glossary#endocrine-system) glands to affect sodium regulation by the kidneys. In general, sodium retention results in water retention, and sodium loss results in water loss [(6)](#reference6). Below are descriptions of three mechanisms contributing to a larger multifactorial [homeostatic](../glossary#homeostasis) control system that governs blood volume and blood pressure through regulation of sodium balance. These regulatory mechanisms are especially important for the control of sodium transport in various segments of the nephron (basic structural unit of the kidney), including the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and the collecting duct. In response to a significant decrease in blood volume or pressure (e.g., serious blood loss or dehydration), the kidneys release renin into the circulation. Renin is an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that splits a small [peptide](../glossary#peptide) (angiotensin I) from a larger [protein](../glossary#protein) (angiotensinogen) produced by the liver. Angiotensin I is split into a smaller peptide (angiotensin II) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme present on the inner surface of blood vessels and in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Angiotensin II stimulates the constriction of small arteries, resulting in increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II is also a potent stimulator of aldosterone [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by the [adrenal glands](../glossary#adrenal-glands). Aldosterone is a [steroid](../glossary#steroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) that acts on the kidneys to increase the reabsorption of sodium and the [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of [potassium](potassium). Retention of sodium by the kidneys increases the retention of water, resulting in increased blood volume and blood pressure [(7)](#reference7). Secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH; by the posterior [pituitary gland](../glossary#pituitary-gland) is stimulated by a significant decrease in blood volume or pressure. In conjunction with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ADH stimulates epithelial sodium channels nephron distal increase the reabsorption of sodium and water [(8)](#reference8). Dopamine is produced from L-DOPA in the kidney proximal tubules and acts on dopamine [receptors](../glossary#receptor) distributed along the proximal tubules and the thick ascending limbs of the loop of Henle to regulate sodium transport. Dopamine promotes sodium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) (natriuresis) by inhibiting the effect of (ANP), which is muscle cells into the circulation [(9)](#reference9). Hyponatremia, defined as a [serum](../glossary#serum) sodium concentration ([Na+]) <136 mmol/liter (mM), may result from increased fluid retention (dilutional hyponatremia) or increased sodium loss. Inadequate sodium intakes rarely result in hyponatremia, even in those on very low-salt diets, because the kidneys increase the [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of water in order to maintain serum osmolality (i.e., [electrolyte](../glossary#electrolytes)-water balance). The results of the 1999-2004 US National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicated an overall [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of hyponatremia of 1.9% in a US population representative sample of 14,697 participants aged 18 and older [(10)](#reference10). Hyponatremia was found to be more prevalent among older individuals (3.1% in those aged 65 to 84 years) and in those suffering from (2.9%) [(10)](#reference10). Hyponatremia is also common in hospitalized patients, with an estimated 15%-30% having mild hyponatremia (serum [Na+]: inappropriate anti-diuretic [hormone](../glossary#hormone) (ADH) secretion, which is associated with disorders affecting the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), and with use of certain drugs (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions-deficiency)). In some cases, excessive water intake may also lead to dilutional hyponatremia (see also [Exercise-associated hyponatremia](#exercise-associated-hyponatremia)). Conditions that increase the loss of sodium and chloride include severe or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, excessive and persistent sweating, the use of some [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic), and some forms of kidney disease. Too severe restriction of dietary sodium intake in [renal](../glossary#renal) patients with [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) and [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) might also result in harmful body depletion of sodium [(1)](#references). Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is dilutional hyponatremia occurring in individuals competing in endurance (up to 6 h in duration) and ultra-endurance (>6 h in duration) exercise events, such as marathons, Ironman triathlons, mountain bike races, hiker treks, and open-water ultra-distance swimming events. Of note, symptomatic EAH has been increasingly reported in shorter events, such as half-marathons and sprint triathlons. The development of hyponatremia during or up to 24 h after intense and/or sustained physical activity has been linked to fluid overload due to excessive water intakes, impaired urinary water [excretion](../glossary#excretion) due to persistent ADH secretion, and very low or very high ambient temperature [(12)](#reference12). Risk factors include pre-exercise hyperhydration, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and prolonged exercise (>4 h) (reviewed in [12](#reference12)). Symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, disorientation, and fainting. Complications of severe and rapidly developing hyponatremia may include cerebral [edema](../glossary#edema) (swelling of the brain), seizures, coma, and brain damage. Acute or severe hyponatremia may be fatal without prompt and appropriate medical treatment [(13)](#reference13). Chronic mild hyponatremia has been associated with deficits in gait and attention, falls, and bone loss and [fractures](../glossary#fracture), especially in women and the elderly [(14, 15)](#reference14). A recent 11-year [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in over 3,000 men free of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) also reported significantly higher disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), total CVD events, hyponatremia mM) compared to those serum [Na+] between 139 mM and 144 mM [(16)](#reference16). In addition, in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 81 [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in patients with diverse medical conditions (including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary infections, and [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis)), the risk of mortality was found to be nearly three times greater in hyponatremic compared to normonatremic subjects [(17)](#reference17). Improvement or normalization of serum [Na+] in hyponatremic subjects was associated with a reduced mortality rate in patients with diverse clinical conditions [(18)](#reference18). Table 1 lists some medications that may increase the the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Medicine revised the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for sodium [(20)](#reference20). The FNB did not find sufficient evidence to determine an Estimated Average Requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) and derive a Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)). Instead, they established an adequate intake (AI) for sodium (Table 2; [20](#reference20)). Considerations accounted for by the FNB for establishing an AI for sodium included that the available evidence was insufficient to identify adverse health effects associated with low dietary sodium intakes and that there was substantial evidence suggesting potential long-term health benefits associated with reducing habitual sodium intakes below 2,300 mg/day (see [The Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake for sodium](#CDRR)). The AI could not be derived from the average dietary intakes of apparently healthy people in the US since average intake levels are well above 2,300 mg/day (see [Sources](#sources)). |Life Stage||Age|| Males and Females | Sodium (mg/day) | AI for salt corresponds to the AI for sodium multiplied by 2.5.| Most of the sodium and chloride in the diet comes from salt [(21)](#reference21). Very little sodium occurs naturally in food. Instead, sodium is added to make certain foods shelf stable, and it is ubiquitously used in the US food supply such that all food groups contribute to sodium intake levels [(21)](#reference21). It has been estimated that 75% of the salt intake in the US is derived from salt added during food processing or manufacturing, rather than from salt added at the table or during cooking [(22)](#reference22). The lowest salt intakes are associated with diets that emphasize unprocessed foods, especially [fruit](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), [vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), and [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes). Combined data of the US National Health And Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 indicated average dietary sodium intakes of 3,100 mg/day in children (ages, 3-18 years), 3,800 mg/day in adults (ages, 19-50 years), and 3,300 mg/day in older adults (>50 years) [(23)](#reference23). Usual intakes were estimated to be 4,400 mg/day and 3,100 mg/day in adult men and women (ages, 19-50 years), respectively. Overall, sodium intakes among males of all age groups were found to be 20%-45% higher than among females [(23)](#reference23). These intakes are well above the sodium Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake (CDRR) of 2,300 mg/day (see [The Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake for sodium](#CDRR)). Table 3 lists the sodium content (in milligrams [mg]) of some foods that are high in salt, and Table 4 lists some foods that are relatively low in salt. Most sodium is consumed in the form of sodium chloride (salt). The salt content of foods can be calculated by multiplying the sodium content by 2.5. Example: 2,000 mg (2 g) of sodium x 2.5 = 5,000 mg (5 g) of salt. For more information on the sodium content of foods, search with added||1 |Carrot||1 medium||42||105| The daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for sodium is less than 2,400 mg. The % DV included on the Nutrition Facts label of packaged foods and beverages is meant to help consumers make informed choices and consider the foods with low (5% DV per serving) rather than high (20% DV per serving) sodium content [(24)](#reference24). Excessive intakes of sodium chloride lead to an increase in [extracellular fluid](../glossary#extracellular-fluid) volume as water is pulled from cells to maintain normal sodium concentrations outside of cells. However, as long as water needs can be met, normally functioning kidneys can [excrete](../glossary#excretion) the excess sodium and restore the system to normal [(1)](#references). Ingestion of large amounts of salt may lead to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps [(25)](#reference25). Hypernatremia, defined as [serum](../glossary#serum) sodium concentrations ([Na+]) >145 mM, is much less common than hyponatremia and rarely caused by excessive sodium intake (e.g., from the ingestion of large amounts of seawater or [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) infusion of concentrated saline solution) [(26)](#reference26). Hypernatremia generally develops from excess water loss (e.g., burns, respiratory infections, [renal](../glossary#renal) loss, osmotic diarrhea, [hypothalamic](../glossary#hypothalamus) disorders) or reduced water intake, frequently accompanied by an impaired thirst mechanism [(6)](#reference6). Symptoms of hypernatremia with evidence of dehydration from excessive water loss may include dizziness or fainting, low blood pressure, and diminished urine production. Severe hypernatremia ([Na+] >158 mM) may result in altered mental status, lethargy, irritability, stupor, convulsions, and coma. Acute brain shrinkage can lead to intracranial and subarachnoid [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) [(26)](#reference26). The Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for sodium were recently revised by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Medicine [(20)](#reference20). Using a new expanded DRI model, the National Academy of Medicine did not find sufficient evidence of adverse toxicological effects of excessive sodium intake; therefore, they did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for sodium [(20)](#reference20). Normal blood pressure is defined by a [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) below 120 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) and a [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) below 80 mm Hg, often noted <120/80 mm Hg [(27)](#reference27). Currently, about one-third of US adults have [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) (blood pressure levels 140/90 mm Hg), and another one-third have elevated blood pressure (prehypertension, corresponding to levels 120/80 mm Hg and <140/90 mm Hg) that places them at [risk](../glossary#risk) for hypertension [(28)](#reference28). Chronic hypertension damages the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), as well as hypertensive kidney disease. In a number of [clinical studies](../glossary#clinical-trial), salt intake has been significantly correlated with [left ventricular hypertrophy](../glossary#left-ventricular-hypertrophy), an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, which is associated with increased mortality from [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(29)](#reference29). Several lines of research, conducted over the last decades, have provided evidence of a relationship between sodium consumption and health outcomes. For instance, [observational](../glossary#observational-study) [cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), like the well-designed International Study of Salt and Blood Pressure (INTERSALT), have associated excess sodium intake with a progressive increase of blood pressure with age [(30, 31)](#reference30). Further, a number of [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial), including the Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly (TONE), Trials Of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-sodium, have demonstrated that dietary sodium reduction could effectively prevent or improve hypertension among population subgroups at elevated risk (see [Blood pressure clinical trials](#blood-pressure-clninical-trials)). Salt sensitivity: Blood pressure responses to short-term changes in sodium intake are [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity). Indeed, some individuals have little-to-no change in blood pressure in response to sodium manipulation and are identified as \"salt-resistant.\" In contrast, individuals who experience a greater change in blood pressure following dietary sodium manipulation are labeled \"salt sensitive\" [(32, 33)](#reference32). Most of the protocols used in salt sensitivity studies involve extreme manipulations of sodium intake (sodium loading and sodium depletion) over a short timespan of a few days or up to one week. A typical controlled [isocaloric](../glossary#isocaloric) intervention may include a two-phase, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [cross-over](../glossary#cross-over-trial) seven-day dietary sodium manipulation with a high-sodium diet (6.9 to 8.1 g/day) and a very-low-sodium diet (0.5 g/day). Salt resistance is often defined as a change of 5 mm Hg in 24-h mean arterial pressure (MAP) between a high-sodium diet and a low-sodium diet. Conversely, salt sensitivity is defined by changes of >5 mm Hg in MAP between high- and low-sodium diets [(34)](#reference34). About 26% of [normotensive](../glossary#normotensive) and 51% of [hypertensive](../glossary#hypertension) individuals are estimated to be salt sensitive [(35)](#reference35). Salt sensitivity among normotensive subjects has been found to predict future [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) [(36, 37)](#reference36). Long-term [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) also provided substantial evidence suggesting that sensitivity to salt may be an independent risk factor for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (reviewed in [38](#reference38)). Salt sensitivity involves greater sodium reabsorption in the kidney proximal tubules and higher [glomerular](../glossary#glomerulus) filtration rate (GFR) on a high-sodium diet than salt resistance. The rise in blood pressure is thought to compensate high sodium and fluid retention by triggering increased [renal](../glossary#renal) [excretion](../glossary#excretion). Conversely, salt resistance is associated with adequate excretion of excess sodium such that consumption of large amounts of sodium does not markedly increase blood pressure [(1)](#references). Earlier observations suggested that certain subgroups of the population, including African Americans, older individuals (>45 years), and hypertensive patients, tended to have greater average blood pressure responses to changes in sodium intake [(38)](#reference38). Nevertheless, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found marginal ethnic differences in blood pressure response to sodium reduction (for at least one week) compared to previously reported data [(39)](#reference39). Research examining a genetic basis for salt sensitivity may eventually lead to better and reliable classification of individuals for salt sensitivity. Yet, at present, the analyses of common variations (known as [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism)) in the sequence of specific [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in sodium retention by the kidney failed to show consistent results (reviewed in [40](#reference40)). A recent meta-analysis of nine [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) failed to show significant associations between specific gene polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and blood pressure response to salt [(41)](#reference41). Other polymorphisms in genes like those coding for G-protein coupled receptor kinase type 4 (GRK4), epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and regulators, or -adducin may favor sodium retention by the kidney, hence predisposing to blood pressure sensitivity to salt (reviewed in [40](#reference40)). Finally, in addition to genetic predispositions, factors like diet quality (e.g., [the DASH diet](#blood-pressure-clninical-trials)) and body weight probably influence blood pressure sensitivity to salt [(38)](#reference38). [Blood pressure clinical trials: Of particular importance are the results of long-term multicenter trials that are the most relevant to clinical and public health practice, i.e., TONE ] [(42)](#reference42), TOHP [(43)](#reference43), and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)-sodium. TONE showed that modest reduction in sodium intake by about 1.0 g/day (~2.5 g/day of salt) resulted in a better control of [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) in older adults who initially were on blood pressure medication [(42)](#reference42). TOHP-Phase II (the second of two hypertension prevention trials) showed that a similar level of sodium reduction significantly reduced [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) (but not [diastolic](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure)) blood pressure by 1.2 mm Hg in overweight participants with prehypertension after three years and limited the onset of hypertension by 18% after four years compared to usual care (no dietary intervention) [(43, 44)](#reference43). Adherence to the DASH diet, which emphasizes fruit, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts, and low-fat dairy products, was found to substantially lower systolic/diastolic blood pressures by 11.4/5.5 mm Hg in hypertensive and 3.5/2.1 mm Hg in normotensive people compared to a typical US diet [(45)](#reference45). The DASH diet is also markedly higher in [potassium](potassium) and [calcium](calcium), modestly higher in protein, and lower in total fat, [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid), [cholesterol](../health-disease/cholesterol), red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages than the typical US diet. The DASH-sodium trial compared the DASH diet to a typical US (control) diet at three levels of sodium intake: low (1.5 g/day, current AI), intermediate (2.3 g/day, recommended as an upper level by US dietary guidelines), and high (3.2 g/day, typical US intake) levels [(46)](#reference46). At each level of sodium intake, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were systematically lower in (pre)hypertensive people (blood pressure >120/80 mm Hg) consuming the DASH diet compared to the control diet. Reduction of sodium intake also significantly reduced blood pressure in hypertensive consumers of either the DASH diet or the typical US diet. Yet, in prehypertensive participants, the blood pressure-lowering effect of sodium reduction was only significant in those consuming the typical US diet; sodium reduction failed to reduce blood pressure in all prehypertensive participants assigned to the DASH diet, with the exception of African Americans. Compared to the high-salt control diet, average blood pressure in (pre)hypertensive participants on the low-sodium DASH diet was decreased by 8.9/4.5 mm Hg. Results of the DASH trials support the idea that sodium reduction in the context of a healthful dietary pattern offers an effective approach to the prevention and treatment of hypertension [(47)](#reference47). A majority of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of dietary sodium reduction on blood pressure in (pre)hypertensive rather than in normotensive (normal blood pressure) people. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) assessed the results of modest sodium reduction from 22 trials in 990 participants with hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg) and 12 trials in 2,240 participants without hypertension (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg). A modest sodium reduction by 1.8 g/day (equivalent to 4.4 g/day of salt; based on 24-hour urinary sodium [excretions](../glossary#excretion)) for at least four weeks decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 5.4/2.8 mm Hg in subjects with hypertension and 2.4/1.0 mm Hg in those without hypertension [(48)](#reference48). Another pooled analysis of eight [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) demonstrated a dose-response relationship between sodium reduction (by 1.8 to 3.2 g/day) and blood pressure in subjects with blood pressure over 130/80, but there was no such relationship in subjects whose blood pressure was below 130/80 [(49)](#reference49). The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans concurred with the 2013 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Guideline to recommend that individuals who would benefit from blood pressure lowering, particularly prehypertensive and hypertensive adults, should follow the DASH eating pattern to lower sodium intakes [(50)](#reference50). Recommendations include sodium intakes of no more than 2.4 g/day, further sodium intake reduction to 1.5 g/day for an even greater blood pressure-lowering effect, or a reduction is sodium intake of at least 1 g/day if sodium intakes of 1.5 g/day or 2.4 g/day cannot be achieved [(50, 51)](#reference50). More information about the DASH diet is available from the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan). Early studies in animals and humans reported that high-salt intake was associated with [pathological](../glossary#pathology) alterations in the structure and function of large elastic arteries, independent of changes in blood pressure (reviewed in [52](#reference52)). [Endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis). Alterations in the structure and function of the [vascular endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) that lines the inner surface of all blood vessels are associated with the loss of normal [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation). Endothelial dysfunction results The measurement of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is often used as a marker of endothelial function; FMD values are [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the [risk](../glossary#risk) of future [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(53)](#reference53). The link between sodium intake and [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) has traditionally involved [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure). Yet, recent investigations in salt-resistant normotensive individuals have reported that dietary sodium loading could impair endothelial function independent of changes in blood pressure [(54, 55)](#reference54). A study using controlled dietary sodium conditions also demonstrated that a high-sodium diet (6.9 g/day for one week) reduced brachial artery FMD to the same extent in salt-sensitive and salt-resistant normotensive participants [(56)](#reference56). On the other hand, a three-week dietary sodium intake of 3 g following a baseline intake of 2.4 g/day of sodium did not lower FMD in 36 untreated (pre)hypertensive adults with baseline FMD values significantly lower than those usually observed in healthy normotensive subjects [(57)](#reference57). Circulating markers of endothelial function and low-grade inflammation were unchanged; only urinary sodium and [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) increased [(57)](#reference57). In healthy normotensive adults in whom FMD significantly decreased following a meal containing 1.5 g of sodium, [potassium](potassium) supplementation (1.5 g) could limit high sodium-induced FMD reduction normotensive subjects, a diet containing 2.3 g/day reduced FMD after two days and for six weeks, compared to a diet containing 3.5 g/day [(60)](#reference60). In another randomized, cross-over, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial, dietary sodium restriction (1.2 g/day vs. 3.5 g/day) for five weeks significantly lowered systolic (but not [diastolic](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure)) blood pressure by 12 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) and increased FMD by 68% in 17 (pre)hypertensive subjects (mean age, 62 years) [(61)](#reference61). The improvements in both blood pressure and endothelial function suggest that sodium restriction has a strong potential for reducing CVD risk by preserving the vasculature. A high dietary sodium intake is a [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). A pooled analysis of 13 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 177,025 participants followed for 3 to 17 years found greater risks of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (+17%) and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) (+23%) with an average difference of 2 g of sodium (5 g of salt) between higher and lower daily consumption across the studies [(62)](#reference62). Higher sodium intakes were also found to be associated with an increased risk of stroke (+24%) \u2014 but not with the risk of cardiovascular disease or [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) \u2014 in a more recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials [(63)](#reference63). A meta-analysis of [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examined the effect of dietary sodium reduction on cardiovascular events and mortality [(64)](#reference64). Dietary interventions aiming at reducing sodium intake failed to demonstrate an effect on all-cause mortality in [hypertensive](../glossary#hypertension) and non-hypertensive individuals. Current evidence also fails to support a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension [(64)](#reference64). Likewise, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored 2013 report on Sodium Intake in Populations by the US Institute of Medicine (IOM; renamed the National Academy of Medicine) indicated that evidence was scarce and of poor quality to assess whether sodium intakes below 2.3 g/day may lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality in the general US population [(65)](#reference65). In addition, the IOM committee found no evidence of benefits but some evidence of potential harm in reducing sodium intakes to 1.5 g/day-2.3 g/day in individuals with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease [(65)](#reference65). However, in a recent review of the literature, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) identified low strength evidence to suggest that sodium reduction could decrease the risk of a composite measure of cardiovascular outcomes (seven trials) and the risk of combined cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (eight trials) [(66)](#reference66). In the evidence-based report, Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer (2007), the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research concluded that salt was a probable cause of stomach [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(67)](#reference67). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in nearly 270,000 participants showed a 68% greater [risk](../glossary#risk) of [gastric](../glossary#gastric) cancer with the highest versus lowest salt intake level [(68)](#reference68). Findings from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), conducted mainly in Asian countries, also suggested an increased risk of gastric cancer with high intakes of salted foods, pickled foods, and processed meat products [(68-70)](#reference68). Low intakes of [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), which are protective against gastric cancer, in populations with high intakes of salted foods might also contribute to increasing the risk of gastric cancer [(69, 71)](#reference69). Animal studies suggested that high concentrations of salt may damage the cells lining the stomach, potentially increasing the risk of [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) infection by Helicobacter pylori [(72, 73)](#reference72) and cancer-promoting genetic damage [(74)](#reference74). The colonization by H. pylori is a recognized risk factor for gastric cancer. [Case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) examining the potential interaction between salt intake and H. pylori infection in the risk of gastric cancer have provided mixed results [(75-78)](#reference75). Although there is little evidence that salt itself is a [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen), high intakes of salted foods may increase the risk of gastric cancer in individuals infected with H. pylori or exposed to gastric carcinogens [(67)](#reference67). Salty foods, like processed meat, cured meat, and salted fish, contain high levels of nitrosated compounds that may contribute to increasing the risk of gastric cancer [(67)](#reference67). [Osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) is a multifactorial skeletal disorder in which bone strength is compromised, resulting in an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture). Nutrition is one of many factors contributing to the development and progression of osteoporosis. Dietary sodium is a major determinant of urinary [calcium](calcium) loss [(79)](#reference79). High-sodium intake results in increased loss of calcium in the urine, possibly due to competition between sodium and calcium for reabsorption in the kidneys or by an effect of sodium on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion (see the article on [Calcium](calcium)). Every 1-g increment in sodium (2.5 g of salt) [excreted](../glossary#excretion) by the kidneys has been found to draw about 26.3 mg of calcium into the urine [(79)](#reference79). A study conducted in adolescent girls reported that a high-salt diet had a greater effect on urinary sodium and calcium excretion in White compared to Black girls, suggesting differences among ethnic groups [(80)](#reference80). In adult women, each extra gram of sodium consumed per day is projected to produce an additional rate of bone loss of 1% per year if all of the calcium loss comes from the skeleton. A number of [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have suggested that high-sodium intakes are deleterious to bone health, especially in older women [(81)](#reference81). In particular, high-sodium intake in conjunction with low-calcium intake may be especially detrimental to bone health [(82-84)](#reference82). A two-year longitudinal study in postmenopausal women found increased urinary sodium excretion (an indicator of increased sodium intake) to be associated with decreased [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) at the hip [(85)](#reference85). Linear regression analysis estimated that BMD could be maintained by reducing sodium intake to a level of 2.3 g/day and by increasing calcium intake to 1.2 g/day. A second longitudinal study in postmenopausal women found that habitual sodium intake of approximately 3 g/day was not detrimental to BMD over three years of follow-up [(86)](#reference86). Notably, the average calcium intake in this study population was 1.3 to 1.5 g/day \u2014 slightly above the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for calcium in women over 50 years. Another study in 40 postmenopausal women found that adherence to a low-sodium diet (2 g/day) for six months was associated with significant reductions in sodium excretion, calcium excretion, and aminoterminal propeptide of type I [collagen](../glossary#collagen) (a [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption)). Yet, these associations were only observed in women with elevated baseline urinary sodium excretions [(87)](#reference87). Finally, in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 60 postmenopausal women, potassium citrate supplementation prevented an increase in calcium excretion induced by the consumption of a high-sodium diet (5 g/day of sodium) for four weeks [(88)](#reference88). Most [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones) are composed of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. Subjects with an abnormally high level of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) are at higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing kidney stones (a process called nephrolithiasis) [(89)](#reference89). A large [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed more than 90,000 women over a 12-year period found that women with a sodium intake averaging 4.9 g/day (12.6 g/day of salt) had a 30% higher risk of developing symptomatic kidney stones than women whose sodium intake averaged 1.5 g/day (3.8 g/day of salt) [(90)](#reference90). Because urinary calcium [excretion](../glossary#excretion) is increased by high sodium intakes [(79)](#reference79), dietary sodium restriction may reduce the risk of stone formation, especially in patients with a history of kidney stones, by limiting calcium excretion [(91)](#reference91). A five-year, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) that enrolled 120 men with idiopathic hypercalciuria (mean age, 45 years) reported that those assigned to a normal-to-high calcium (1.2 g/day) and low-sodium diet (1.2 g/day) had a 49% reduced risk of kidney stone recurrence compared to those on a low-calcium diet (~0.4 g/day) [(92)](#reference92). In 2004, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly, the Institute of Medicine [IOM]) established a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) of 2.3 g/day sodium (5.8 g/day of salt) for adults based on the adverse effects of high sodium intakes on blood pressure, a major [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) and kidney diseases [(93)](#reference93). The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans report also recognizes that excess sodium consumption poses potential health risks and emphasizes the reduction of sodium intake in the context of a healthful dietary pattern, following the UL set by the IOM panel [(50)](#reference50). In a 2019 update of the Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for sodium, the National Academy of Medicine made use of a new expanded DRI model [(20)](#reference20). As a consequence, only evidence of a toxicological risk associated with excessive sodium intakes was considered to establish a UL for sodium [(20)](#reference20), whereas previously the UL for sodium was based on evidence of any type of adverse effects [(93)](#reference93). In addition, the evidence of the relationship between sodium intake levels, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease \u2014 considered toward establishing a UL in the previous report \u2014 has now been reviewed to establish a new DRI category, namely the Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake (CDRR) for sodium [(20)](#reference20). Using the expanded DRI model, the National Academy of Medicine did not find sufficient evidence of adverse toxicological effects to establish a UL for sodium [(20)](#reference20). In contrast, substantial evidence from trials showing a lowering of the risks of hypertension and cardiovascular disease with reduction of sodium intakes was used to set a CDRR for sodium in apparently healthy adults at 2,300 mg/day [(20)](#reference20). The CDRR for healthy adults means that a lowering of usual sodium intakes to at least 2,300 mg/day from higher levels is expected to reduce the risk of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). The CDRR values for other ages/life stages have been extrapolated from the CDRR value set for adults using estimated energy requirements; these CDRR-based recommendations for each age/life stage are older||Reduce intakes if above 2,300 mg/day| |*Extrapolated from the adult CDRR using estimated energy requirements.| Of note, in its 2013 report on Sodium Intake in Populations, the FNB committee considered that recommendations to population subgroups, including those who are most sensitive to the blood pressure effects of sodium, like older people (51 years), African Americans, and individuals with [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), or chronic kidney disease, should be similar to those for the general US population [(65)](#reference65). The IOM committee found no supportive evidence to recommend that these subgroups lower their sodium intake to 1.5 g/day or below [(65)](#reference65). In contrast, the 2013 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk advises adults with (pre)hypertension to consume no more than 2.4 g/day of sodium, further reduce sodium intake to 1.5 g/day for an even greater blood pressure-lowering effect, or reduce their daily intake by at least 1 g if sodium intakes of 1.5 g/day or 2.4 g/day cannot be achieved [(51)](#reference51). Finally, the 2010 IOM report on Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States suggested that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revisit the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status of salt added to processed food, restaurant food, and food additives, in order to reduce the salt content in the food supply and assist in achieving sodium intakes consistent with US Dietary Guidelines and IOM recommendations [(21)](#reference21). These recommendations are currently being reviewed by the FDA [(22)](#reference22). Taking sodium bicarbonate orally may reduce the efficacy of the antibiotic cefpodoxime and the antidiabetic drug chlorpropamide by limiting drug absorption or increasing drug urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion). [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of sodium bicarbonate may also reduce the effects of aspirin and the nasal decongestant pseudoephedrine. Excessive intake of sodium bicarbonate may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypokalemia (abnormally low blood [potassium](potassium) concentration) in patients potassium-depleting is strong and consistent evidence that diets relatively low in sodium (2.3 g/day or less) and high in [potassium](potassium) are associated with decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of high blood pressure and the related risks of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) and kidney diseases. Moreover, the DASH trial demonstrated that a diet emphasizing [fruit](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), [vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains), [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), and low-fat dairy products substantially lowered blood pressure, an effect that was enhanced by reducing salt intake to 2.3 g/day of sodium (5.8 g/day of salt). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends a diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables (at least 9 servings/day) and limits processed foods that are high in salt. Since sensitivity to the blood pressure-raising effect of salt increases with age, sodium reduction in the context of a healthful dietary pattern may especially benefit older adults, who are at increased risk of high blood pressure, [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), and kidney disease.

National interactions with drugs; 2016. Available at: ] [https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/](https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/). Contents Zinc is an essential trace element for all forms of life. Clinical zinc deficiency in humans was first described in 1961, when the consumption of diets with low zinc [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) due to high phytate content (see [Food sources](#food-sources)) was associated with \"adolescent nutritional dwarfism\" in the Middle East [(1)](#references). Since then, zinc insufficiency has been recognized by a number of experts as an important public health issue, especially in low-resource countries [(2, 3)](#reference2). Numerous aspects of cellular [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) are zinc-dependent. Zinc plays important roles in growth and development, immune function, neurotransmission, vision, reproduction, and intestinal [ion](../glossary#ion) transport [(4)](#reference4). Using data mining approaches, it has been estimated that over 3,000 proteins in humans have functional zinc-binding sites [(5)](#reference5). At the cellular level, the function of zinc can be divided into three categories: (1) catalytic, (2) structural, and (3) regulatory [(6)](#reference6). Over 50 different [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) depend on zinc for their ability to [catalyze](../glossary#catalyze) vital chemical reactions [(7)](#reference7). Zinc-dependent enzymes can be found in all six classes of enzymes [(8)](#reference8), as defined by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology [(9)](#reference9). During enzymatic reactions, zinc may have either a direct catalytic role or a structural role (i.e., stabilizing the structure of catalytic enzymes; see below). Zinc plays an essential role in the folding of some [proteins](../glossary#protein). A finger-like structure, known as a zinc finger motif, stabilizes the structure several proteins. Examples of zinc finger proteins include the superfamily of [nuclear](../glossary#nuclear) [receptors](../glossary#receptor) that bind and respond to [steroids](../glossary#steroid) other and [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) [(10)](#reference10). Zinc finger motifs in the structure of nuclear receptors allow them to bind to [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and act as [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor) to regulate [gene](../glossary#gene) expression (see [Regulatory role](#regulatory-function)). Zinc finger motifs are also involved in interactions of proteins with other proteins, [ribonucleotides](../glossary#ribonucleotide), and [lipids](../glossary#lipid) [(6)](#reference6). Removal of zinc from zinc-containing proteins results in protein misfolding and loss of function. Metallothioneins are examples of proteins with a zinc-binding motif. Metallothioneins are small metal-binding cysteine-rich proteins with a high affinity for zinc. They work in concert with zinc transporters, regulating free zinc concentrations in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol) [(11)](#reference11). Metallothioneins are also involved in the regulation of metal ion [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis), cellular defense against [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and detoxification copper-zinc superoxide is made of two identical [dimers](../glossary#dimer), each including an active site with a catalytic [copper](copper) [ion](../glossary#ion) and a structural zinc ion. Demetalation of SOD1 has been implicated in the formation of amyloid aggregates in some forms of inherited [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis](../glossary#amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis) (ALS) \u2014 a motor [neuron](../glossary#neuron) disease leading to muscle [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) and paralysis [(13)](#reference13). Zinc finger [proteins](../glossary#protein) have been found to regulate [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) by acting as [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor) (see above). Zinc also plays a role in [cell signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) via the metal-response element (MRE)-binding transcription factor 1 (MTF1); MTF1 has a zinc finger domain that allows its binding to MRE sequences in the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of target [genes](../glossary#gene) and the subsequent expression of zinc-responsive genes [(6)](#reference6). Zinc may also have a direct regulatory function, modulating the activity of cell-signaling [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and transcription factors [(6)](#reference6). Extracellular zinc can also stimulate a zinc-sensing [receptor](../glossary#receptor) that triggers the release of intracellular calcium, a second messenger in signaling pathways [(14)](#reference14). Zinc has been found to influence [hormone](../glossary#hormone) release (see [Type 2 diabetes mellitus](#type-2-diabetes-mellitus-prevention)) [(15)](#reference15) and [nerve impulse](../glossary#nerve-impulse) transmission [(16)](#reference16). Taking large quantities of zinc (50 mg/day or more) over a period of weeks can interfere with [copper](copper) [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). High intake of zinc induces the intestinal [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of a copper-binding [protein](../glossary#protein) called metallothionein (see the article on [Copper](copper#nutrient-interactions-zinc)). Metallothionein traps copper within intestinal cells and prevents its systemic absorption (see [Wilson's disease](#Wilson-disease-treatment)). More typical intakes of zinc do not affect copper absorption, and high copper intakes do not affect zinc absorption [(17)](#reference17). [Iron](iron) for absorptive pathways [(18)](#reference18). [Supplemental](../glossary#supplement) (38-65 mg/day of elemental iron) but not dietary levels of iron may decrease zinc absorption [(18, 19)](#reference18). This interaction is of concern in the management of iron supplementation during pregnancy and lactation and has led some experts to recommend zinc supplementation for pregnant and lactating women taking iron supplements [(20, 21)](#reference20). Food [fortification](../glossary#fortification) with iron has not been shown to negatively affect zinc absorption [(22)](#reference22). In a [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, supplementation with zinc (10 mg/day) for three months in children aged eight to nine years significantly decreased [serum](../glossary#serum) iron concentrations, yet not to the extent of causing [anemia](../glossary#anemia) [(23)](#reference23). Additional [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have reported a worsening of nutritional iron [status](../glossary#status) with chronic zinc supplementation [(24, 25)](#reference24). High levels of dietary [calcium](calcium) impair zinc absorption in animals, but it is uncertain whether this occur in humans [(17)](#reference17). One study showed that increasing the calcium intake of postmenopausal women by 890 mg/day in the form of milk or calcium phosphate (total calcium intake, 1,360 mg/day) reduced zinc absorption and zinc balance in postmenopausal women [(26)](#reference26). However, another study found that increasing the calcium intake of adolescent girls by 1,000 mg/day in the form of calcium citrate malate (total calcium intake, 1,667 mg/day) did not affect zinc absorption or balance [(27)](#reference27). Calcium in combination with phytate might affect zinc absorption, which would be particularly relevant to individuals who very frequently consume tortillas made with lime (i.e., calcium oxide). A study in 10 healthy women (age range, 21-47 years) found that high intake of dietary calcium (~1,800 mg/day) did not impair zinc absorption regardless of the phytate content of the diet [(28)](#reference28). For more information on phytate, see [Food sources](#food-sources). The [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of dietary [folate](../vitamins/folate) (vitamin B9) is increased by the action of a zinc-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme). Accordingly, some studies found low zinc intake decreased folate absorption. It was also suggested that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with folic acid \u2014 the synthetic form of folate \u2014 might impair zinc utilization in individuals with marginal zinc [status](../glossary#status) [(17](#reference17), [29)](#reference29). However, one study reported that supplementation with a relatively high dose of folic acid (800 \u00b5g/day) for 25 days did not alter zinc absorption or status in a group of students being fed a low-zinc diet (3.5 mg/day) [(30)](#reference30). Zinc and [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) interact in several ways. Zinc is a component of retinol-binding protein, a protein necessary for transporting vitamin A in the blood. Zinc is also required for the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that converts retinol (vitamin A) to retinal. This latter form of vitamin A is necessary for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of rhodopsin, a [protein](../glossary#protein) in the eye that absorbs light and thus is involved in dark adaptation. Zinc deficiency has been associated with a decreased release of vitamin A from the liver, which may contribute to symptoms of night blindness that are seen with zinc deficiency [(31, 32)](#reference31). Much of what is known about severe zinc deficiency was derived from the study of individuals born with [acrodermatitis enteropathica](../glossary#acrodermatitis-enteropathica), a genetic disorder resulting from the impaired uptake and transport of zinc [(33)](#reference33). The symptoms of severe zinc deficiency include the slowing or cessation of growth and development, delayed sexual maturation, characteristic skin rashes, chronic and severe diarrhea, immune system deficiencies, impaired wound healing, diminished appetite, impaired taste sensation, night blindness, swelling and clouding of the [cornea](../glossary#cornea), and behavioral disturbances. Before the cause of acrodermatitis enteropathica was known, patients typically died in infancy. Oral zinc therapy results in the complete remission of symptoms, though it must be maintained indefinitely in individuals with the genetic disorder [(33, 34)](#reference33). It is now recognized that milder zinc deficiency contributes to a number of health problems, especially common in children who live in low-resource countries. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide are affected by dietary zinc deficiency [(3)](#reference3). The lack of a sensitive and specific indicator of marginal zinc deficiency hinders the scientific study of its health implications [(8)](#reference8). However, controlled trials of moderate zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) have demonstrated that marginal zinc deficiency contributes to impaired physical and neuropsychological development and increased susceptibility to life-threatening infections in young children [(34)](#reference34). In fact, zinc deficiency has been estimated to cause more than 450,000 deaths annually in children under five years of age, comprising 4.4% of global childhood deaths [(35)](#reference35). For a more detailed discussion of the relationship of zinc deficiency to health problems, see the section on [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention). In industrialized countries, dietary zinc deficiency is unlikely to cause severe zinc deficiency in individuals without a genetic disorder, zinc malabsorption or conditions of increased zinc loss, such as severe burns or prolonged diarrhea. Severe zinc deficiency has also been reported in individuals undergoing [total parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) without zinc, in those who abuse alcohol, and in those who are taking certain medications like penicillamine (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)) [(36)](#reference36). Currently, there is not a sensitive and specific [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) to detect zinc deficiency in humans. Low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or [serum](../glossary#serum) zinc concentrations are typically used as indicators of zinc [status](../glossary#status) in populations and in [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study), but they have a number of limitations, including lack of sensitivity to detect marginal zinc deficiency, diurnal variations, and [confounding](../glossary#confounder) by [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), stress, and [hormones](../glossary#hormone) [(38, 39)](#reference38). The recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for zinc is listed by gender and age group in Table 1. Infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women are at increased risk of zinc deficiency. Since a sensitive indicator of zinc nutritional [status](../glossary#status) is not readily available, the RDA for zinc is based on a number of different indicators of zinc nutritional status and represents the daily intake likely to prevent deficiency in nearly all individuals in a specific age and gender group [(29)](#reference29). |Life Stage||Age||Males (mg/day)||Females (mg/day)| |Infants||0-6 months|| 2 | Estimates based on national food supply indicate that dietary zinc intake is likely inadequate in most low- and middle-income countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [(40)](#reference40). Inadequate zinc [status](../glossary#status) during pregnancy interferes with fetal development, and preterm neonates from zinc-deficient mothers suffer from growth retardation and [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis) and are at [risk](../glossary#risk) of infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic lung disease, and retinopathy of prematurity [(4)](#reference4). Maternal zinc deficiency has also been associated with a number of pregnancy complications and poor outcomes. A recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) conducted in an Iranian hospital reported higher odds of [congenital malformations](../glossary#congenital-malformation) in newborns of mothers with low serum zinc concentrations during the last month of pregnancy [(41)](#reference41). A 2016 review of 64 [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between maternal zinc status and the severity of [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), as well as between maternal zinc intake and the risk of low-birth-weight newborns [(42)](#reference42). There were no apparent associations between maternal zinc status and the risk of [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and preterm birth. However, the conclusions of this analysis were limited by the fact that most observational studies were conducted in women from populations not at risk for zinc deficiency [(42)](#reference42). To date, available evidence from maternal zinc [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) conducted worldwide does not support the recommendation of routine zinc supplementation during pregnancy. A 2015 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 21 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in over 17,000 women and their babies found a 14% reduction in premature deliveries with zinc supplementation during pregnancy, mainly in low-income women [(43)](#reference43). This analysis, however, did not find zinc supplementation to benefit other indicators of maternal or infant health, including stillbirth or neonatal death, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age, and pregnancy-induced [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure). There was also no effect of supplemental zinc on postpartum [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage), maternal infections, congenital malformations, and child development outcomes [(43)](#reference43). A recent review of 17 trials (of which 15 were conducted in low- and middle-income countries) found that maternal supplementation with multiple micronutrients (including, among others, zinc, iron, and folic acid) reduced the risk of low-birth-weight newborns and small-for-gestational age infants when compared to supplemental iron with or without folic acid [(44)](#reference44). While multiple micronutrient supplementation would likely benefit pregnant women with coexisting micronutrient deficiencies in low- and middle-income countries, there is no evidence to recommend zinc supplementation in isolation in pregnant women from any settings [(43, 45)](#reference43). Significant delays in linear growth and weight gain, known as growth retardation or failure to thrive, are common features of mild zinc deficiency in children. In the 1970s and 1980s, several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies of zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in young children with significant growth delays were conducted in Denver, Colorado. Modest zinc supplementation (5.7 mg/day) resulted in increased growth rates compared to placebo [(46)](#reference46). Several [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of growth data from zinc [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) have confirmed the widespread occurrence of growth-limiting zinc deficiency in young children, especially in low- and middle-income countries [(47-49)](#reference47). A 2018 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analysis identified 54 trials that examined the impact of zinc supplementation during infancy (on average, 7.6 mg/day for 30.9 weeks) or childhood (on average, 8.5 mg/day for 38.9 weeks) on child [anthropometric](../glossary#anthropometric) measurements [(50)](#reference50). There was evidence of a positive effect of supplemental zinc on children's height, weight, and weight-for-age Z score (WAZ), but neither on height-for-age Z score (HAZ) or weight-for-height Z score (WHZ). In addition, zinc supplementation did not reduce the risks of underweight (WAZ<-2 standard deviation [SD]), wasting (WHZ<-2 SD), or stunting (HAZ<-2 SD) in children [(50)](#reference50). Although the exact mechanisms for the growth-limiting effect of zinc deficiency are not known, research indicates that zinc availability affects [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) systems that coordinate the response to the growth-regulating [hormone](../glossary#hormone), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [(51)](#reference51). Adequate nutrition in essential for brain growth and development, especially during the first 1,000 days of life \u2014 a critical period of development for all organs and systems spanning from conception to 24 months of age [(52)](#reference52). Animal studies have established that zinc deficiency in early life interferes with normal brain development and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) functions (reviewed in [53](#reference53)). Data on the effect of zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy on infants' [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) and psychomotor outcomes is very limited. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in African-American women, daily maternal supplementation with 25 mg of zinc from about 19 weeks' [gestation](../glossary#gestation) had no effect on neurologic development test scores in their children at five years of age [(54)](#reference54). Several studies have reported on the effect of postnatal zinc supplementation on mental and motor development. Two early [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), one conducted in India and the other in Guatemala, suggested that postnatal supplementation with 10 mg/day of zinc resulted in toddlers being more vigorous [(55)](#reference55) and functionally active [(56)](#reference56). In one trial conducted in Brazilian newborns from low-income families and weighing between 1,500 g and 2,499 g at birth, neither zinc supplementation for eight weeks with 1 mg/day or 5 mg/day improved mental and psychomotor development at 6 or 12 months of age compared to a placebo and assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) for Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) [(57)](#reference57). Additionally, a randomized, placebo-controlled, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) trial in Chilean newborns (birth weights >2,300 g) from low-income families reported no effect of zinc supplementation (5 mg/day) on mental and psychomotor development indices at 6 and 12 months [(58)](#reference58). Two other trials found that supplemental zinc failed to improve MDI or PDI at 12 months of age when zinc (10 mg/day) was given to six-month-old infants for six months [(59)](#reference59) or at the end of the intervention in toddlers aged 12-18 months when zinc (30 mg/day) was given for four months [(60)](#reference60). A 2012 Cochrane review of eight [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) found no evidence that postnatal zinc supplementation improves mental or motor development of infants and children from populations with presumably inadequate zinc [status](../glossary#status) [(61)](#reference61). Adequate zinc intake is essential in maintaining the integrity of the immune system [(62)](#reference62), specifically for normal development and function of cells that mediate both [innate](../health-disease/immunity#innate-immunity) ( [neutrophils](../glossary#neutrophil), [macrophages](../glossary#macrophage), T-lymphocytes) immune responses [(63)](#reference63). Because [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) also require zinc to thrive and invade, a well-established [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) defense mechanism in the body sequesters free zinc away from microbes [(64)](#reference64). Another opposite mechanism consists in intoxicating intracellular microbes within macrophages with excess zinc [(65)](#reference65). Through weakening innate and adaptive immune responses, zinc deficiency diminishes the capacity of the body to combat pathogens [(63, 64)](#reference63). As a consequence, zinc-deficient individuals experience an increased susceptibility to a variety of infectious agents [(66)](#reference66). Diarrhea: Zinc promotes mucosal resistance to infections by supporting the activity of immune cells and the production of [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) against invading [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) [(63, 64](#reference63), [67)](#reference67). Therefore, a deficiency in zinc increases the susceptibility to intestinal infections and constitutes a major contributor to diarrheal diseases in children [(66)](#reference66). In turn, persistent diarrhea contributes to zinc deficiency and malnutrition [(66)](#reference66). Research indicates that zinc deficiency may also potentiate the effects of toxins produced by diarrhea-causing bacteria like E. coli [(68)](#reference68). It is estimated that diarrheal diseases are responsible for the deaths of about 500,000 children under five years of age annually in low- and middle-income countries [(69)](#reference69). Zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in combination with oral rehydration therapy has been shown to significantly reduce the duration and severity of acute and persistent childhood diarrhea and to increase survival in a number of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(70)](#reference70). A 2016 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that zinc supplementation reduced the duration of acute diarrhea by one day in children aged >6 months who presented signs of malnutrition (5 trials; 419 children) [(71)](#reference71). However, there was little evidence to suggest that zinc could be as efficacious to reduce the duration of acute diarrheal episodes in children aged <6 months and in well-nourished children aged >6 months. Zinc supplementation also reduced the duration of persistent diarrhea in children by more than half a day (5 trials; 529 children) [(71)](#reference71). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) currently recommend supplementing young children with 10 to 20 mg/day of zinc as part of the treatment for acute diarrheal episodes and to prevent further episodes in the two to three months following zinc supplementation [(72)](#reference72). Pneumonia: [Pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia) \u2014 caused by lower respiratory tract viral or bacterial infections (LRTIs) \u2014 accounts for nearly 1 million deaths among children annually, primarily in low-and middle-income countries [(69)](#reference69). Vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococcus, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles can help prevent pneumonia [(73)](#reference73). According to a 2009 WHO report on disease [risk](../glossary#risk) factors, zinc deficiency may be responsible for 13% of all LRTI cases, primarily pneumonia and flu cases, in children younger than 5 years [(74)](#reference74). Accordingly, a 2016 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six trials found that zinc supplementation in children under 5 years old reduced the risk of pneumonia by 13% [(75)](#reference75). However, it remains unclear whether supplemental zinc, in conjunction with antibiotic therapy, is beneficial in the treatment of pneumonia. A recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial conducted in Gambian children who were not zinc deficient failed to show any benefit of zinc supplementation (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day [depending on child's age] for 7 days) given alongside antibiotics in the treatment of severe pneumonia [(76)](#reference76). A 2018 meta-analysis of five trials (1,822 participants) found no improvement when zinc was used as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to antibiotic treatment in children with pneumonia [(77)](#reference77). There was, however, evidence that supplemental zinc reduced the risk of pneumonia-related mortality (3 trials; 1,318 participants) [(77)](#reference77). Malaria: Early studies have indicated that zinc supplementation may reduce the incidence of clinical attacks of [malaria](../glossary#malaria) in children [(78)](#reference78). A [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in preschool-aged children in Papua New Guinea found that zinc supplementation reduced the frequency of health center attendance due to Plasmodium falciparum malaria by 38% [(79)](#reference79). Additionally, the number of malaria episodes accompanied by high circulating parasite concentrations was reduced by 68%, suggesting that zinc supplementation may be of benefit in preventing more severe episodes of malaria. However, a six-month trial in more than 700 West African children did not find any difference in the frequency or severity of malaria episodes between children supplemented with zinc and those given a placebo [(80)](#reference80). Another [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) reported that zinc supplementation did not benefit preschool-aged children with acute, uncomplicated malaria [(81)](#reference81). There is also little evidence to suggest that zinc supplementation could reduce the risk of malaria-related mortality in children [(82)](#reference82). At present, there is not enough evidence to suggest a [prophylactic](../glossary#prophylaxis) and/or therapeutic role for supplemental zinc in the management of childhood malaria [(48)](#reference48). A recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial did not provide clear-cut evidence of a protective effect of zinc (25 mg/day) administered to Tanzanian women during their first gestational trimester until delivery on the risk of [placental](../glossary#placenta) malaria infection [(83)](#reference83). Inadequate zinc [status](../glossary#status) in elderly subjects is not uncommon and is thought to exacerbate the age-related decline in immune function [(84)](#reference84). In one study, low [serum](../glossary#serum) zinc concentrations in nursing home residents were associated with higher risks of [pneumonia](../glossary#pnemonia) and pneumonia-related and all-cause mortality [(85)](#reference85). Trials examining the effects of zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on immune function in middle-aged and elderly adults have given mixed results (reviewed in [86](#reference86)). Some studies showed mixed or no effects of zinc supplementation on parameters of immune function [(87-89)](#reference87). However, zinc supplementation was found to have a positive impact on certain aspects of immune function that are affected by zinc deficiency, such as the decline in T-cell (a type of [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte)) function [(90)](#reference90). For example, a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-trial), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in adults over 65 years of age found that zinc supplementation (25 mg/day) for three months increased blood concentrations of helper T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells [(91)](#reference91). Additionally, a randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial in 101 older adults (aged 50-70 years) with normal blood zinc concentrations showed that zinc supplementation at 15 mg/day for six months improved the helper T-cells/cytotoxic T-cells ratio, which tends to decline with age and is a predictor of survival [(92)](#reference92). However, the study also suggested that a dose of 30 mg/day of zinc might reduce the number of B-lymphocytes, which play a central role in humoral immunity. Further, zinc supplementation had no effect on various immune parameters, including markers of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), measures of granulocyte and [monocyte](../glossary#monocyte) [phagocytic](../glossary#phagocytosis) capacity, or [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine) production by activated monocytes [(92)](#reference92). A more recent trial examined the effect of daily supplementation with a multiple [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient), including 5 mg or 30 mg of zinc for three months, on zinc status and markers of immune function in institutionalized elderly participants (mean age, >80 years) with low serum zinc concentrations [(93)](#reference93). Zinc status was improved with the 30 mg/day dose \u2014 but not with 5 mg/day \u2014 yet the most zinc-deficient individuals failed to achieve normal serum zinc concentrations within the intervention period. The number of circulating T-cells was also significantly increased in those who took the micronutrient supplement with the higher versus low dose of zinc [(93)](#reference93). More research is warranted before zinc supplementation could be recommended to older adults, especially those with no symptoms of declining immunity. Nonetheless, the high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of zinc deficiency among institutionalized elderly adults should be addressed and would likely improve the performance of their immune systems [(86)](#reference86). There is a close relationship between zinc and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) action. Specifically, in [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) -cells, zinc is involved in insulin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and storage in secretory vesicles. Zinc is released with the [hormone ](../glossary#hormone)when blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations increase [(15)](#reference15). Zinc is also understood to stimulate glucose uptake and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) by insulin-sensitive tissues through triggering the intracellular insulin [nucleotide](../glossary#nucleotide) [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) (SNPs) SLC30A8 (solute carrier family 30 member 8) [gene](../glossary#gene), coding for a zinc transporter that co-localizes with insulin in -cells, have been associated with higher [risks](../glossary#risk) of type 1 and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(95)](#reference95), though the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus was found to be reduced with rare protein-truncating variants of the gene [(96)](#reference96). The first [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) to examine the risk of type 2 diabetes in relation to zinc intakes \u2014 the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) \u2014 followed 82,297 US registered female nurses for 24 years. The data analysis showed an 8% lower risk of type 2 diabetes with the highest versus lowest intake of dietary zinc (median values, 11.8 mg/day versus 4.9 mg/day) [(97)](#reference97). This finding was consistent with the result of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) that enrolled 8,921 women for six years and showed a 50% lower risk of diabetes with the highest versus lowest intake of energy-adjusted dietary zinc [(98)](#reference98). Both NHS and ALSWH studies also reported a reduced risk of diabetes with higher versus lower zinc-to- [heme](../glossary#heme) iron ratios in the diet [(97, 98)](#reference97), although the significance is unclear as nonheme iron, rather than heme iron, is known to interfere with dietary zinc absorption (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). Heme iron may be an indicator of red meat consumption, which has been positively associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes [(99)](#reference99). However, two other prospective cohort studies \u2014 the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; 4,982 participants) and the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study (232,007 participants) \u2014 failed to find evidence for an association between zinc intake and risk of type 2 diabetes [(100, 101)](#reference100). Another recent prospective cohort study, the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study in 26,132 middle-aged Swedish participants followed for 19 years, found an increased risk of diabetes with higher dietary zinc intakes yet a lower risk of diabetes in zinc supplement users (versus non-users) and in those with a higher zinc-to-iron intake ratio [(102)](#reference102). The authors reported a stronger [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between zinc-to-iron intake ratio and risk of diabetes among obese participants carrying a specific SLC30A8 [genotype](../glossary#genotype) [(102)](#reference102). The results of a few short-term [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) suggest that zinc supplementation may improve glucose handling in subjects with prediabetes. A 2015 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified three short trials (4 to 12 weeks) conducted in adults with prediabetes and found little evidence of an improvement in [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) with zinc supplementation [(103)](#reference103). However, a 2016 randomized, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 55 Bangladeshi with prediabetes showed that daily supplementation with zinc sulfate (30 mg/day for 6 months) improved fasting blood glucose, as well as measures of -cell function and [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) [(104)](#reference104). Similar observations were made in another recent trial in 100 Sri Lankan randomized to receive daily supplementation with zinc (20 mg of elemental zinc) or a placebo for one year [(105)](#reference105). Supplemental zinc improved zinc [status](../glossary#status) and measures of glycemic control [(105)](#reference105). Large-scale, long-term studies are necessary to provide definite conclusions regarding the potential benefit of zinc supplementation in subjects at risk of type 2 diabetes. Doses of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) zinc in many of the below-mentioned [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) exceeded the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)). Such high intake of supplemental zinc may lead to adverse health effects with prolonged use (see [Safety](#safety)). The protein, ATP7B, is responsible for the [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) [copper](copper) into the [biliary](../glossary#bile) tract, and its impairment in Wilson's disease results in an increased concentration of 'free' copper (i.e., not bound to the copper-carrying protein, [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin)) in blood, an increased excretion of copper in the urine (hypercupriuria), the deposition of copper in part of the [cornea](../glossary#cornea) (forming Kayser-Fleischer rings), and the accumulation of copper in the liver and brain [(106)](#reference106). This inherited condition is progressive and fatal if untreated. The standard-of-care for symptomatic patients usually includes an initial phase (around 2-6 months) of copper [chelation](../glossary#chelate) with agents, such as penicillamine or trientine (triethylenetetramine), followed by lifelong maintenance therapy with penicillamine and/or trientine and/or zinc salts [(107)](#reference107). Patients presenting without symptoms can be treated with maintenance therapeutic doses of a chelating agent or with zinc [(108)](#reference108). Zinc-induced metallothionein in the intestinal mucosa binds copper and prevents its absorption (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). There is growing evidence to suggest that zinc salts are a safer, much cheaper, and efficacious alternative to metal-chelating agents \u2014 which have been associated with a worsening of symptoms during the initial phase of treatment in some patients [(109)](#reference109). The use of zinc is advocated as safe and efficacious in both pediatric [(110, 111)](#reference110) and adult patients [(112-114)](#reference112). There is no proven treatment for [common cold](../health-disease/common-cold) [(115)](#reference115). The use of zinc lozenges within 24 hours of the onset of cold symptoms, and continued intake every two to three hours while awake until symptoms resolve, have been advocated for reducing the duration of the common cold [(116)](#reference116). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) examining the effect of zinc have been published to date. A 2012 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) reported that zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in the form of lozenges or syrup shortened the duration of cold symptoms, but there was significant [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) (inconsistent effects across the included studies) for the primary outcomes [(117)](#reference117). A 2013 Cochrane review confirmed that oral zinc administrated within 24 hours of symptom onset could reduce the duration of cold symptoms (14 trials, 1,656 participants) [(118)](#reference118). Subgroup analyses also suggested that oral zinc was effective regardless of the age of participants (children or adults) and the type of zinc formulation (gluconate/acetate lozenges or sulfate syrup). In addition, beneficial effects on cold duration were seen in trials that provided more than 75 mg/day of zinc but not in trials that used lower doses. The pooled analysis of five trials found no evidence of an effect of oral zinc on the severity of cold symptoms. The analysis of secondary trial outcomes suggested a faster resolution of specific cold symptoms (cough, nasal congestion, nasal drainage, sore throat) and a lower proportion of participants exhibiting cold symptoms after seven days of treatment in zinc- versus [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-supplemented participants [(118)](#reference118). Inconsistent findings among trials have been partly attributed to different amounts of zinc released from various forms used in the lozenges (particularly zinc acetate and zinc gluconate) [(119, 120)](#reference119). It has been argued that the unpleasant taste of zinc gluconate forming complexes with [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) may have led to poor compliance, thereby explaining negative trial results [(119, 121)](#reference119). However, when a meta-analysis was recently conducted on results from seven trials (575 participants) that employed zinc lozenges at doses >75 mg/day, there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy observed between trials that used either zinc acetate (3 trials) or zinc gluconate (4 trials) [(122)](#reference122). With numerous well-controlled trials and meta-analyses, the efficacy of zinc lozenges or syrup in treating common cold symptoms is no longer questionable. A meta-analysis of seven trials recently reported a 33% reduction in the duration of cold symptoms with the intake of zinc lozenges (>75 mg/day of elemental zinc) [(122)](#reference122). However, many supplemental zinc formulations available over-the-counter have been found to release zero zinc ions (i.e., the biologically active form of zinc) or to contain additives (e.g., magnesium, certain [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid), citric acid) that either cancel out the benefit of zinc or worsen cold symptoms [(119)](#reference119). Finally, although taking zinc lozenges for a cold every two to three hours while awake will result in daily zinc intakes well above the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) of 40 mg/day for adults (see [Safety](#safety)), the use of zinc at daily doses of 50 to 180 mg for one to two weeks has not resulted in serious side effects [(117)](#reference117). Bad taste and nausea were the most frequent adverse effects reported in therapeutic trials [(117)](#reference117). Use of zinc lozenges for prolonged periods (e.g., 6-8 weeks) is likely to result in [copper](copper) deficiency (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions) and [Safety](#safety)). Intranasal zinc preparations, designed to be applied directly to the nasal [epithelium](../glossary#epithelium) (cells lining the nasal passages), are marketed as over-the-counter cold remedies. While two [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found that intranasal zinc gluconate modestly shortened the duration of cold symptoms [(123, 124)](#reference123), another one found intranasal zinc to be of no benefit [(125)](#reference125). The pooled analysis of these three trials showed no overall benefit of intranasal zinc on the [risk](../glossary#risk) of still experiencing cold symptoms by day 3 [(126)](#reference126). The existence of a mouth-nose biologically close electric circuit (BCEC) has been proposed to explain the efficacy of oral rather than intranasal zinc delivery [(119)](#reference119). Specifically, it is suggested that the positively charged interior of the nose repels [ionic](../glossary#ion) zinc (Zn2+) such that ionic zinc delivered by throat lozenges and migrating from the mouth to the nose are more effective against rhinovirus infection than those directly delivered into the nose [(119)](#reference119). Of serious concern are several [case reports](../glossary#case-report) of individuals experiencing loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) after using intranasal zinc as a cold remedy [(127)](#reference127). Since zinc-associated anosmia may be irreversible, intranasal zinc preparations should be avoided. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the [macula](../glossary#macula) and a leading cause of blindness in people aged >65 years in the US [(128)](#reference128). The macula is the portion of the [retina](../glossary#retina) in the back of the eye involved with central vision. Zinc is [hypothesized](../glossary#hypothesis) to play a role in the development of AMD for several reasons: (1) zinc is found at high concentrations in the part of the retina affected by AMD, (2) retinal zinc content has been shown to decline with age, and (3) the activities of some zinc-dependent retinal enzymes have been shown to decline with age. To date, [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have shown limited evidence suggesting an association between dietary zinc intake and the incidence of AMD [(129-131)](#reference129). However, an early [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) provoked interest when it found that 200 mg/day of zinc sulfate (81 mg/day of elemental zinc) over two years limited the loss of vision in patients with AMD [(132)](#reference132). Yet a later trial using the same dose and duration found no benefit to patients with a more advanced form of AMD in one eye [(133)](#reference133). Small trials have generally not reported a protective effect of [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) and [mineral](../glossary#mineral) supplementation on AMD [(134, 135)](#reference134). However, a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 74 patients with AMD reported that supplementation with 50 mg/day of zinc monocysteine for six months improved measures of macular function, including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and photorecovery [(136)](#reference136). A large randomized, placebo-controlled trial of daily [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C), 400 IU [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E), and 15 mg of -carotene) and high-dose zinc (80 mg of zinc as zinc oxide and 2 mg of copper as cupric oxide) \u2014 the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) \u2014 found that administration of high-dose zinc alone or with the antioxidant combination to individuals with signs of moderate-to-severe macular degeneration significantly reduced the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing advanced macular degeneration over a mean follow-up of 6.3 years [(137)](#reference137). A follow-up analysis conducted four years after the cessation of the trial in 2001, including nearly 85% of the surviving participants, found that the benefit of the AREDS (combined antioxidants plus zinc) formulation had persisted [(138)](#reference138). Indeed, the odds of developing late AMD, especially neovascular AMD, was lower in both participants with a low risk of developing AMD and those who were at risk and recommended to continue taking the AREDS formulation after the trial ended. There was, however, no effect of AREDS formulation on the risk of developing central geographic atrophy [(138)](#reference138). Another trial, AREDS2, examined the effect of an AREDS formulation without -carotene and/or containing 25 mg instead of 80 mg of zinc [(139)](#reference139). The trial showed no apparent difference in the risk of developing advanced AMD with the use of AREDS formulations containing either 25 mg or 80 mg of zinc and/or -carotene [(140)](#reference140). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of five trials (including the original AREDS study) confirmed the protective effect of supplemental zinc against neovascular and advanced AMD [(141)](#reference141). In conclusion, the AREDS formulation combining antioxidants and zinc (25 mg or 80 mg) may delay the progression of the disease in patients with AMD. Patients, especially smokers and those with vascular disease, are advised to discuss with their physician the benefits versus potential harms that could be associated with the long-term use of high-dose antioxidant vitamins and [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids) [(141)](#reference141). Poor glycemic control and frequent urination in patients with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) may be driving urinary loss of zinc and contribute to marginal zinc deficiency [(142, 143)](#reference142). Yet, because of the role of zinc in -cell function and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) action (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)), a number of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined whether [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with zinc (alone or with other [minerals](../glossary#mineral) and [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin)) could play a role in diabetes management, especially by improving glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes [(15)](#reference15). Out of the 12 trials that measured participants' zinc [status](../glossary#status) at baseline, supplementation with zinc (20-240 mg/day) for 4 to 16 weeks improved fasting blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) in patients who presented with zinc deficiency (6 studies). Supplemental zinc also reduced the proportion of [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) ( [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c)) in two trials conducted in zinc-deficient participants, yet not in four studies including participants without zinc deficiency [(15)](#reference15). Patients with type 2 diabetes should ensure that their diet provides enough zinc to cover their needs, especially if their blood glucose is poorly controlled. [Gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) is defined as [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. The condition is associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for adverse pregnancy outcomes [(144)](#reference144). A group of investigators in Iran conducted two small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials to examine the effect of zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in pregnant women with gestational diabetes. Supplemental zinc (30 mg/day) for six weeks during pregnancy improved zinc [status](../glossary#status), reduced fasting blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose), and improved [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) in women with gestational diabetes but had no impact on pregnancy outcomes, including the need for cesarean section, need for insulin therapy, newborn's birth size and [Apgar scores](../glossary#Apgar-score), or incidence of hyperbilirubinemia [(145, 146)](#reference145). Similar improvements of markers of glycemic control were reported in another placebo-controlled trial that randomized pregnant women with gestational diabetes to receive zinc (4 mg) together with [magnesium](magnesium) (100 mg), [calcium](calcium) (400 mg), and [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) (200 IU) twice a day for six weeks [(147)](#reference147). There was also some evidence suggesting that supplemental zinc might help correct other metabolic disorders (e.g., abnormal blood lipid profile) associated with gestational diabetes [(147, 148)](#reference147). Sufficient zinc is essential to maintain immune system function, and [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-infected individuals are particularly susceptible to zinc deficiency. In HIV-infected patients, low [serum](../glossary#serum) zinc concentrations have been associated with disease progression and increased mortality [(149, 150)](#reference149). In one study conducted in [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS) patients, 45 mg/day of zinc for one month resulted in a decreased incidence of opportunistic infections compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(151)](#reference151). A placebo-controlled trial in 231 HIV-positive adults with low zinc [status](../glossary#status) found that zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (12 mg/day for women and 15 mg/day for men) for 18 months reduced the incidence of immunological failure (defined by a CD4+ count <200 cells/mm3) by 76% and the rate of diarrhea by 60% [(152)](#reference152). A 2011 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) that identified three [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in primarily resource-poor settings concluded that zinc supplementation was safe and efficacious in reducing opportunistic infections in HIV-positive adults [(153)](#reference153). Evidence of benefits of zinc supplementation in HIV-positive pregnant women and children is very limited. In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trial in Tanzania, the administration of zinc (25 mg/day) to women between 12 and 27 weeks' gestation until six months after delivery failed to reduce maternal viral load or limit mother-to-child HIV transmission [(154)](#reference154). A randomized placebo-controlled trial of zinc supplementation (10 mg/day for 6 months) in 96 HIV-positive children (6 months to 5 years old) in South Africa showed no effect on CD4+ count and viral load [(155)](#reference155). There was evidence showing a reduction in the incidence of watery diarrhea in zinc-supplemented children compared to those taking a placebo, yet no differences in the incidence of [pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia), ear infection, or upper respiratory tract infection [(155)](#reference155). Another trial in Uganda showed that supplemental zinc in children with severe pneumonia effectively reduced case fatality regardless of children's HIV status [(156)](#reference156). While zinc supplementation during pregnancy and infancy is recommended in populations likely to be zinc deficient [(43](#reference43), [71](#reference71), [75)](#reference75), its use in HIV infection management requires further investigation [(157)](#reference157). Abnormal [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) of trace metals, in particular [copper](copper) and zinc, has been reported in individuals affected by [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) \u2014 the most common form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia). Specifically, results from [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) have shown higher [serum](../glossary#serum) copper concentrations and lower serum zinc concentrations in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to [cognitively](../glossary#cognitive) healthy controls [(158-160)](#reference158). Based on the utilization of zinc salts in Wilson's disease, it has been proposed that zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) could improve zinc and copper [status](../glossary#status) and limit further cognitive deterioration in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The use of slow-release zinc acetate (150 mg/day for six months) in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study of 60 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease corrected low zinc status and decreased serum 'free' copper (i.e., unbound to [ceruloplasmin](../glossary#ceruloplasmin)) [(161)](#reference161). Moreover, when a post-hoc analysis was restricted to participants over 70 years of age (N=29), it was found that zinc supplementation prevented the deterioration of [cognition](../glossary#cognition) scores over the trial period [(161)](#reference161). Additional evidence is needed to confirm whether zinc supplementation could play a role in stabilizing cognitive deficits in older adults with dementia. A data analysis of the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) survey, including 3,708 participants (ages, 30-79 years), reported higher odds of depression symptoms in women (but not in men) in the lowest versus highest [quartiles](../glossary#quartile) of total (median values, 8.7 mg/day versus 26.8 mg/day) and dietary (median values, 7.6 mg/day versus 13.1 mg/day) zinc intakes [(162)](#reference162). The possibility that zinc could play a role in preventing or alleviating depression has been explored in two trials conducted by one research group. The data from these trials were analyzed following a per-protocol approach (i.e., restricted to the participants who completed the studies). A preliminary [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 20 subjects (mean age, 43 years) treated for major depression showed that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 25 mg/day of zinc reduced depression symptoms at 6 and 12 weeks as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores [(163)](#reference163). A second placebo-controlled trial in 60 participants treated with the antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil; 100-200 mg/day) assessed the therapeutic response to supplemental zinc (25 mg/day) using HDRS, BDI, Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores [(164)](#reference164). Zinc supplementation improved score-based measures of therapeutic response and remission after six weeks but only when the analysis was restricted to participants resistant to imipramine. There was, however, no evidence of an effect of zinc after 12 weeks [(164)](#reference164). Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that causes organ dysfunction as a consequence of a dysregulated host's response to infection [(165)](#reference165). Sepsis is accompanied by changes in zinc [homeostasis ](../glossary#homeostasis)characterized in particular by a decrease in [serum](../glossary#serum) zinc concentration and an increase in liver zinc concentration [(166)](#reference166). These changes in zinc distribution are thought to be part of a host's defense mechanism whereby the host can limit zinc availability to [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen), as well as stimulate the immune system. Such a mechanism has been described for other transition metals, including iron and manganese [(167)](#reference167). However, lower serum zinc concentrations in critically ill patients at high [risk](../glossary#risk) of organ failure have been associated with recurrent sepsis episodes and poorer outcomes [(168, 169)](#reference168). A 2018 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified four trials that examined the effect of zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in newborns with sepsis [(166)](#reference166). Zinc supplementation was found to result in decreased [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) [(170)](#reference170) and better [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) development [(171, 172)](#reference171). Three out of four trials that examined the rate of mortality showed no effect of zinc supplementation [(170](#reference170), [172, 173)](#reference172). Shellfish, beef, and other red meats are rich sources of zinc; [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) and [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes) are relatively good plant sources of zinc. Zinc [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) (the fraction of zinc retained and used by the body) is relatively high in meat, eggs, and seafood because of the relative absence of compounds that inhibit zinc absorption and the presence of sulfur-containing [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) (cysteine and [methionine](../glossary#methionine)) that improve zinc absorption. Zinc in whole-grain products and plant proteins is less [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) due to their relatively high content of phytate, which inhibits zinc absorption [(174)](#reference174). The enzymatic action of yeast reduces the level of phytate in foods; therefore, leavened whole-grain breads have more bioavailable zinc than unleavened whole-grain breads. National dietary surveys in the US estimate that average dietary zinc intake from naturally and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food is about 12.3 mg/day in adults, with about 12% of the adult population being at risk for inadequate intake [(175)](#reference175). The zinc content of some foods relatively rich in zinc is listed in Table 2 in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content of is about the size of a deck of cards.| A number of zinc [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are commercially available, including zinc acetate, zinc gluconate, zinc picolinate, and zinc sulfate. Zinc picolinate has been promoted as a more absorbable form of zinc, but few data support this idea in humans. Limited work in animals suggests that increased intestinal absorption of zinc picolinate may be offset by increased elimination [(29)](#reference29). Isolated outbreaks of acute zinc toxicity have occurred as a result of the consumption of food or beverages contaminated with zinc released from galvanized containers. Signs of acute zinc toxicity are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Single doses of 225 to 450 mg of zinc usually induce vomiting. Milder [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) distress has been reported at doses of 50 to 150 mg/day of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) zinc. Metal fume fever has been reported after the inhalation of zinc oxide fumes. Specifically, profuse sweating, weakness, and rapid breathing may develop within eight hours of zinc oxide inhalation and persist for 12 to 24 hours after exposure is terminated [(6](#reference6), [29)](#reference29). The major consequence of long-term consumption of excessive zinc is copper deficiency. Total zinc intakes of 60 mg/day (50 mg [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) and 10 mg dietary zinc) for up to 10 weeks have been found to result in signs of copper deficiency [(29)](#reference29). Copper deficiency has also been reported following chronic use of excessive amounts of zinc-containing denture creams (2 tubes per week containing 17-34 mg/g of zinc) [(177)](#reference177). In order to prevent copper deficiency, the US Food and Nutrition Board set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for adults at 40 mg/day, including dietary and Intranasal zinc is known to cause a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) in laboratory animals [(178)](#reference178), and there have been several [case reports](../glossary#case-report) of individuals who developed anosmia after using gluconate [(127)](#reference127). Since zinc-associated be irreversible, the use of zinc nasal gels and sprays should be avoided. The use of zinc [supplements](../glossary#supplement) decreases the absorption of certain medications, including cephalexin (Keplex) and penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen), as well drugs atazanavir (Reyataz) and ritonavir (Norvir) [(179)](#reference179). Concomitant administration of zinc supplements with certain medications like tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics may decrease the absorption of both zinc and the medications, potentially reducing drug efficacy. Taking zinc supplements and these medications at least two hours apart should prevent this interaction. The therapeutic use of metal-chelating agents, such as penicillamine (used to treat copper overload in Wilson's disease) and diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA; used to treat iron overload), has resulted in severe zinc deficiency. [Anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) drugs, especially sodium valproate, may also precipitate zinc deficiency. Prolonged use of [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) may increase urinary zinc [excretion](../glossary#excretion), resulting in increased loss of zinc. Because supplemental zinc can lower blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose), those taking anti-diabetic agents are advised to use zinc supplements with caution. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for zinc (8 mg/day for adult women and 11 mg/day for adult men) appears sufficient to prevent deficiency in most individuals, but the lack of sensitive indicators of zinc nutritional status in humans makes it difficult to determine the level of zinc intake most likely to promote optimum health. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement will generally provide at least the RDA for zinc. Daily total (supplemental + dietary) intakes of zinc should not exceed the [UL](../glossary#UL) (40 mg/day for adults) in order to limit the risk of copper deficiency in particular (see [Safety](#safety)). Although the requirement for zinc is not known to be higher for older adults, many have inadequate dietary zinc intakes [(180, 181)](#reference180). A reduced capacity to absorb zinc, increased likelihood of disease states that alter zinc utilization, and increased use of drugs that decrease zinc [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) may all contribute to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of mild zinc deficiency in older adults. Adequate dietary intake of zinc is essential for older adults because the consequences of mild zinc deficiency, such as impaired immune system function, are especially relevant to maintenance of their health.

Select a nutrient from the list for more information. Contents Although choline is not by strict definition a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), it is an essential nutrient. Despite the fact that humans can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) it in small amounts, choline must be consumed in the diet to maintain health. The majority of the body's choline is found in specialized fat molecules known as [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid), the most common of which is called phosphatidylcholine [(1)](#references). Choline and compounds derived from choline (i.e., [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite)) serve a number of vital biological functions (Figure 1) [(1)](#references). Choline is used in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of certain [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) that are essential structural components of [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Phosphatidylcholine accounts for about 95% of total choline in tissues [(2)](#reference2). This phospholipid can be synthesized from dietary choline via the cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) pathway or through of another phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (Figure 2) [(3)](#reference3). Sphingomyelin is a type of sphingosine-containing phospholipid (sphingolipid) that is synthesized by the transfer of a phosphocholine residue from a phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide (Figure 3). Sphingomyelin is found in cell membranes and in the fatty sheath that envelops [myelinated](../glossary#myelin) The generating phosphocholine is released the degradation of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipases. Other choline [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) known to and sphingophosphocholine. [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) by cholinergic [neurons](../glossary#neuron) and involved in muscle control, circadian rhythm, memory, and many other neuronal functions. Choline CDP-choline (citicoline) administration was also found to stimulate the synthesis and release of a family of neurotransmitters derived from tyrosine (i.e., the [catecholamines](../glossary#catecholamine), including noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine) [(5)](#reference5). Of note, non-neuronal cells of various tissues and organ systems also synthesize and release acetylcholine, which then binds and stimulates cholinergic [receptors](../glossary#receptor) on target cells (reviewed in [6](#reference6)). Fat and [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) consumed in the diet are transported to the liver by [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) called [chylomicrons](../glossary#chylomicrons). In the liver, fat and cholesterol are packaged into lipoproteins called very-low-density lipoproteins ( [VLDL](../glossary#VLDL)) for transport in the bloodstream tissues. Phosphatidylcholine [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway is required assembly and the liver [(7, 8)](#reference7). [Polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) of the PEMT [gene](../glossary#gene) increase the dietary requirements of choline [(9)](#reference9). Without adequate phosphatidylcholine, fat and cholesterol accumulate in the liver (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). Choline may be [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) in the liver and kidney to form a [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) called betaine via a two-step [enzymatic](../glossary#enzyme) then converted to betaine by betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase in either the mitochondrial matrix or the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol) [(2)](#reference2). Betaine is a source of up to 60% of the methyl (CH3) groups required methyltransferase convert homocysteine to [methionine](../glossary#methionine) in [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (Figure 4). also using the folate derivative, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, as a methyl donor (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). Elevated concentrations of homocysteine in the blood have been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(11)](#reference11). The conversion is irreversible. Betaine is an osmolyte that regulates cell volume and protect cell integrity against osmotic stress (especially in the kidney). Osmotic stress has been associated with a reduced BHMT expression such that the role of betaine in osmoregulation may be temporarily prioritized over its function as a methyl donor [(2)](#reference2). Men and women fed [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) (IV) with solutions that contained adequate [methionine](../glossary#methionine) and [folate](../vitamins/folate) but lacked choline have been found to develop a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and signs of liver damage that resolved when choline was provided [(12)](#reference12). The occurrence of NAFLD is usually associated with the co-presentation of metabolic disorders, including [obesity](../glossary#obesity), with [metabolic syndrome](../disease-index/metabolic-syndrome). NAFLD is estimated to progress to a more severe condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in about one-third of NAFLD patients, as well as to increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) and liver [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(13)](#reference13). Because ( results in impaired VLDL secretion and accumulation of fat in the liver ( [steatosis](../glossary#steatosis)), ultimately leading to liver damage. Because low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../glossary#LDL)) particles are formed from VLDL particles, choline-deficient individuals also show reduced blood concentrations of LDL-cholesterol [(14)](#reference14). Abnormally elevated [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of organ dysfunction creatine phosphokinase, Choline deficiency-induced organ dysfunction has also been associated with increased [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage and [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) in circulating [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) [(15)](#reference15). In the liver, the accumulation of [lipids](../glossary#lipid) is thought to impair [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) function, thus reducing [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) and increasing the production of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) that trigger [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation), DNA damage, and apoptosis. Further, oxidative stress is thought to be responsible for prompting inflammatory processes that can lead to the progression of NAFLD to NASH and cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease) [(16)](#reference16). An intervention study in 57 healthy adults who were fed choline-deficient diets under controlled conditions found that 77% of men, 80% of postmenopausal women, and 44% of premenopausal women developed fatty liver, liver damage, and/or muscle damage [(17)](#reference17). These signs of organ dysfunction resolved upon choline reintroduction in the diet. Because estrogen stimulates the endogenous of phosphatidylcholine via the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway, premenopausal women may be less likely to develop signs of choline deficiency in response to a low-choline diet compared to postmenopausal women [(18, 19)](#reference18). Further, rs12325817) of the PEMT [gene](../glossary#gene), which may affect the expression and/or activity of the PEMT [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), is thought to increase the susceptibility to choline deficiency-induced organ dysfunction [(18)](#reference18). Additional genetic polymorphisms occurring in choline and one-carbon metabolic pathways may alter the dietary requirement for choline and thus increase the likelihood of developing signs of deficiency when choline intake is inadequate [(9](#reference9), [20, 21)](#reference20). Of note, the composition of one's intestinal microbiota has been identified as a potential predictor of susceptibility to choline deficiency-induced NAFLD [(22)](#reference22). Intestinal microbiota-dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine might also be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (see [Safety](#safety)) [(23, 24)](#reference23). For more information on fatty liver diseases, see the section on [Disease Prevention](#liver-diseases-prevention). Daily intake recommendations are higher during pregnancy and lactation (see [The AI](#AI)), placing pregnant and lactating individuals at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of choline inadequacy [(25, 26)](#reference25). Vegetarians may also be at increased risk of choline inadequacy [(26)](#reference26). Patients with cystic fibrosis who have pancreatic insufficiency are at risk of choline depletion due to increased fecal losses [(27)](#reference27). Circulating choline has been directly correlated with lung function in cystic fibrosis patients [(28)](#reference28), and results of a pilot study in 10 patients suggested that choline supplementation may have utility in improving clinical outcomes in cystic fibrosis patients [(29)](#reference29). [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) and [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid), and for the generation of the universal methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) ( [Figure 4](#figure-4)). SAM is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) from the essential amino acid, [methionine](../glossary#methionine). Three molecules of SAM are required for the methylation reaction that converts phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine ( [Figure 2](#figure-2b)). Once SAM donates a methyl group it becomes S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is then metabolized to [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine). Homocysteine can be converted back to methionine in a reaction [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyze) by vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase, which requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-meTHF) a methyl donor. Alternately, betaine (a [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) of choline) is used as the methyl donor for the methylation of homocysteine vitamin B6-dependent transsulfuration pathway ( [Figure 4](#figure-4)). Thus, the human requirement for choline is especially influenced by the relationship between choline and other methyl group donors, such as folate and S-adenosylmethionine. A low intake of folate leads to an increased demand for choline-derived metabolite, betaine. Moreover, the [de novo synthesis](../glossary#de-novo-synthesis) of phosphatidylcholine is not sufficient to maintain adequate choline nutritional [status](../glossary#status) when dietary intakes of folate and choline are low [(30)](#reference30). Conversely, the demand for folate is increased when dietary supply for choline is limited [(31)](#reference31). In 1998, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) established a dietary reference intake ( [DRI](../glossary#DRI)) for choline [(32)](#reference32). The FNB felt the existing scientific evidence was insufficient to calculate an [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for choline, so they set an Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI); Table 1). The main criterion for establishing the AI for choline was the prevention of liver damage. Yet, common [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in choline or [folate](../vitamins/folate) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) alter one's susceptibility to choline deficiency and thus may affect dietary requirements A large body of research indicates that even moderately elevated levels of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in the blood increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(11)](#reference11). The most common cause of a [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or a [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) is the rupture of [atherosclerotic](../glossary#atherosclerosis) plaques in arterial walls causing blood clot formation (thrombogenesis). High homocysteine concentrations may promote the development of atherosclerosis (atherogenesis) and thrombogenesis via mechanisms involving [oxidative in Once dietary homocysteine can be [catabolized](../glossary#catabolism) to cysteine via the transsulfuration or re-methylated to methionine (Figure 4). [Folate](../vitamins/folate) and choline are involved in alternate that re-methylation homocysteine choline is the [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of betaine, which provides a methyl group for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine via the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). While the amount of homocysteine in the blood is regulated by several nutrients, including folate and choline, conditions that cause damage to the liver like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may also affect homocysteine [methylation](../glossary#methylation) of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine), dietary intakes of both nutrients need to be considered when the association between homocysteine concentrations and [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) is assessed. Yet, despite its relevance, the relationship of betaine and choline to homocysteine metabolism has been only lightly investigated in humans, essentially because the choline content of foods could not be accurately measured until fairly recently. In preliminary [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial), [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of betaine (1,500 to 6,000 mg/day) were found to reduce blood homocysteine concentrations in a small number of volunteers with normal-to-mildly elevated homocysteine concentrations [(37-40)](#reference37). Yet, in a [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) analysis of a large cohort of 16,165 women (ages, 49-79 years), lower betaine doses in the range of dietary intakes were not found to be correlated with homocysteine concentrations [(41)](#reference41). This study also showed that levels of choline intake were [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with homocysteine concentrations in the blood. However, an eight-year follow-up study of the cohort failed to show any difference in cardiovascular [risk](../glossary#risk) between women in the upper versus bottom [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of dietary choline intakes (>329 More studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) on the association of dietary choline or betaine and cardiovascular disease have been mixed. In the Jackson Heart Study, which followed 3,924 African Americans for nine years, higher dietary choline intakes were associated with a reduced risk of [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) [(42)](#reference42). In the Nurses' Health Study (80,978 women) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (39,434 men), higher dietary intakes of phosphatidylcholine were linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related mortality [(43)](#reference43). Higher total daily choline intakes were linked to a higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (i.e., death attributed to cardiovascular disease or type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus)) in large prospective cohorts of three ethnic groups: blacks (n=49,858), whites (n=23,766), and Chinese (n=134,001) [(44)](#reference44). In this study, higher betaine intakes were associated with a higher risk of cardiometabolic death in the Chinese cohort only [(44)](#reference44). However, no associations between choline or betaine intakes and cardiovascular-related mortality were found in a cohort study of Japanese adults (n=29,079) [(45)](#reference45). Several other prospective cohort studies have failed to find an association between choline intake and cardiovascular disease endpoints [(41](#reference41), [46-48)](#reference46). Convincing evidence that increased dietary intake of choline or betaine could benefit cardiovascular health through lowering homocysteine concentrations in the blood is presently lacking. A 1995 study had found that elevated blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations in patients who experienced a vascular occlusion were associated with higher urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of betaine, rather than with reduced intake of choline or betaine or diminished activity of [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), high urinary associated with of [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) in 325 subjects without [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) who had been hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome [(50)](#reference50). In the same study, both top and bottom [quintiles](../glossary#quintile) of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) betaine concentrations were associated with an increased risk of secondary acute [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack). The findings of another prospective study (the Hordaland Health Study) that followed 7,045 healthy adults (ages, 47-49 years and 71-74 years) suggested that high choline and low betaine plasma concentrations were associated with an unfavorable [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) risk profile [(51)](#reference51). Indeed, plasma choline was positively associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors, such as [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index), percentage body fat, waist circumference, and [serum](../glossary#serum) [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride), and inversely associated with HDL-cholesterol. On the contrary, plasma betaine was positively correlated to HDL-cholesterol and inversely associated with the above-mentioned risk factors, as well as with [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](/glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure). More recent studies suggest that the blood concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), generated from trimethylamine-containing nutrients like dietary choline, rather than that of choline, might influence the risk of cardiovascular events (see [Safety](#safety)). However, the association between high blood levels of TMAO and [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) was not observed in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) [(52)](#reference52) It is not yet clear whether concentrations of choline, betaine, and/or TMAO in the blood can predict the risk for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). While a choline-deficient diet results in organ dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (see [Deficiency](#deficiency); [17](#reference17)), it is not known whether suboptimal dietary choline intakes in healthy subjects may contribute to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for NAFLD. A [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) analysis of two large [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted in China \u2014 the Shanghai Women's Health Study and the Shanghai Men's Health Study \u2014 including 56,195 people (ages, 40-75 years), was conducted to assess the association between dietary choline intakes and self-reported diagnosis of fatty liver disease [(53)](#reference53). The highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of choline intake (412 mg/day vs. 179 mg/day) was associated with a 28% lower risk of fatty liver disease in normal-weight women, but no association was found in overweight or [obese](../glossary#obesity) women or in men. Another cross-sectional study of 664 individuals with NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) also reported that disease severity was [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with dietary choline intakes in postmenopausal women, but not in premenopausal women, men, or children [(54)](#reference54). Moreover, in a US national cross-sectional survey of 20,643 adults, higher dietary intakes of choline were associated with a more favorable profile of liver [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and with a lower risk of developing NAFLD (NHANES 2005-2012) [(55)](#reference55). In animal models, dietary choline deficiency has been associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous liver [cancer](../glossary#cancer) ( [hepatocellular carcinoma](../glossary#hepatocellular-carcinoma)) and increased sensitivity to [carcinogenic](../glossary#carcinogen) chemicals [(10)](#reference10). A number of mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the cancer-promoting effects of choline deficiency: (1) enhanced liver cell regeneration and tissue sensitivity to chemical insults; (2) altered expression of numerous [genes](../glossary#gene) regulating cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), [DNA](../glossary#DNA) repair, and [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) due to improper DNA [methylation](../glossary#methylation); (3) increased likelihood of DNA damage caused by [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction-induced [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress); and (4) activated protein kinase C-mediated [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) cascade, eventually leading to an increase in liver cell apoptosis [(2)](#reference2). Yet, it is not known whether choline deficiency can increase the susceptibility to cancer in humans [(2)](#reference2). It is known that [folate](../vitamins/folate) is critical for normal embryonic development, and maternal [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with folic acid decreases the incidence of [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTDs) [(56)](#reference56). NTDs include various malformations, such as lesions of the brain (e.g., [anencephaly](../glossary#anencephaly), encephalocele) or lesions of the spine ( [spina bifida](../glossary#spina-bifida)), which are devastating and usually incompatible with life [(57)](#reference57). These defects occur between the 21st and 28th days after conception, a time when many women do not realize that they are pregnant [(58)](#reference58). While the protective effect of folate against NTD is well established, only a few studies have investigated the role of other methyl group donors, including choline and betaine, in the occurrence of NTDs. A [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) (424 NTD cases and 440 controls) found that women in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of periconceptual choline intake [risk](../glossary#risk) of an NTD-affected pregnancy [(59)](#reference59). However, more recent studies have failed to find an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between maternal choline intake and risk of NTDs [(60-63)](#reference60). A case-control study (80 NTD-affected pregnancy and 409 controls) in US women found that the lowest concentrations of [serum](../glossary#serum) choline (<2.49 mmol/L) during mid-pregnancy were associated with a 2.4-fold higher risk of NTDs [(64)](#reference64). Finally, a more recent study, including 71 NTD-affected pregnancies, 214 pregnancies with non NTD malformations, 98 normal pregnancies in women with prior NTD-affected pregnancies, and 386 normal pregnancies, found no associations between maternal blood concentrations of choline during pregnancy, choline- and folate-related genetic variants, and risk of NTDs [(65)](#reference65). However, it is important to note that circulating choline concentrations do not accurately reflect dietary intake of choline. In a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that pooled the results of five case-control studies [(59, 60](#reference59), [62-64)](#reference62), including 1,131 dietary choline intakes or lower serum concentrations of choline were associated with a 36% higher risk of NTDs compared to higher levels throughout the periconceptional period would been needed to determine whether choline has a protective effect against NTDs. Increased dietary intake of cytidine [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of phosphatidylcholine; [Figure 2](#figure-2a)) very early in life can diminish the severity of memory deficits in aged rats [(67)](#reference67). Choline [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) of the mothers of unborn rats, as well as rat pups during the first month of life, led to improved performance in spatial memory tests months after choline supplementation had been discontinued [(68)](#reference68). A review by McCann et al. discusses the experimental evidence from rodent studies regarding the availability of choline during prenatal development and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function in the offspring [(69)](#reference69). Because of the importance of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [methylation](../glossary#methylation) in normal brain development, [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) functions, and cognitive processes [(70)](#reference70), methyl donor nutrients like choline are essential for optimal brain functioning. However, clinical evidence to determine whether findings in rodent studies are applicable to humans is currently limited. The analysis of the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Cohort study reported a lack of an association between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of choline and its related [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) and cognitive abilities in 256 five-year-old children. Only plasma betaine concentrations were found to be positively correlated with preschool language test scores [(71)](#reference71). Yet, because circulating concentrations of choline are not directly related to dietary choline intakes, the study could not evaluate whether maternal choline intakes influence children's brain development. Project Viva is an ongoing [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that has examined the relationship between daily intakes of methyl donor nutrients in 1,210 women during pregnancy and child cognition at three and seven years postpartum. Maternal intake of choline during the first and/or second trimester of pregnancy was not correlated with measures of cognitive performance in children at age 3 years [(72)](#reference72). Another report of the study indicated that upper versus lower [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of maternal choline intakes during the second trimester of pregnancy (median intakes, 392 mg/day vs. 260 mg/day) was significantly associated with higher visual memory scores in children ages 7 years old [(73)](#reference73). In addition, a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 99 pregnant women (ages, 21-41 years old) evaluated the effect of choline supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on infants' cognitive function at ages 10 and 12 months [(74)](#reference74). The results indicated that maternal choline supplementation (750 mg/day of choline in the form of phosphatidylcholine) from 18 weeks of gestation to 3 months' postpartum provided no cognitive benefits in children regarding short-term visuospatial memory, long-term episodic memory, and language and global development [(74)](#reference74). In a randomized, double-blind, controlled-feeding study in 24 pregnant women, maternal choline intake of 930 mg/day (~2x the [AI](../glossary#AI)) throughout the third trimester of pregnancy improved measures of information-processing speed (i.e., reaction times) and visuospatial memory in infants compared to choline intakes of 480 mg/day [(75)](#reference75). Choline intake in this study was from both dietary and supplemental sources: 380 mg/day of choline from dietary sources and either 100 mg/day or 550 mg/day from supplemental choline chloride [(75)](#reference75). Follow-up of the offspring (N=20) at 7 years of age indicated that children of mothers who consumed 930 mg/day of choline had higher measures of sustained attention compared to those of mothers who consumed 480 mg/day of choline [(76)](#reference76), suggesting that prenatal choline supplementation during late pregnancy can confer cognitive benefits to the child. [Cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function, including the domains of memory, speed, and [executive function](../glossary#executive-function), decline gradually with increasing age. The rate of cognitive decline is also influenced by modifiable risk factors like dietary habits. Deficiency in B-vitamins and elevated blood concentrations of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) have been associated with cognitive impairments in the elderly. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found that B-vitamin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) slowed cognitive decline in cognitive healthy older adults, as measured by score on the Mini-Mental State Examination, compared to placebo [(77)](#reference77). However, less is known about dietary or supplemental choline specifically. A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined choline intake and cognitive function in older adults, but these are [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in nature. The cross-sectional data analysis of a subgroup of 1,391 volunteers (ages, 36-83 years) from the large Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort has indicated that dietary choline intake was positively associated with specific cognitive functions, namely verbal memory and visual memory [(78)](#reference78). In a US national cross-sectional study of 2,393 older adults (60 years), total daily choline intakes (combined from diet and supplements) between 187.06 and 399.5 mg/day were associated with improved cognitive performance in three separate measures (assessing learning, processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory) compared to intakes less than 187.06 mg/day; however, the highest intakes of choline (>399.5 no different than the lowest intakes (<187.06 mg/day) in these measures [(79)](#reference79). Another cross-sectional study of 2,195 older individuals (ages, 70-74 years) from the Hordaland Health Study examined cognitive abilities and blood concentrations of various determinants of circulating homocysteine, including choline and betaine [(80)](#reference80). Unlike of free choline (>8.36 \u00b5M vs. 8.36 \u00b5M) were found to be significantly associated with a greater performance at cognitive tests assessing sensory motor speed, perceptual speed, executive function, and global cognition. However, in an earlier [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) that enrolled 235 elderly individuals (mean age, 81 years old) with or without mild [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) deficiency, baseline concentrations of betaine \u2014 but not choline \u2014 were found to be positively correlated to test scores evaluating the cognitive domains of construction, sensory motor speed, and executive function [(81)](#reference81). More research is needed to determine the effect of choline on the developing brain and whether choline intakes above the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) may be useful in the prevention of memory loss or [dementia](../glossary#dementia) in older adults. [Neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease), such as [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) and [Parkinson's decline in [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) signaling, affecting cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways in particular, have been involved in the occurrence of cognitive impairments. Deficits in acetylcholine and abnormal [phospholipid](../glossary#phospholipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) have been reported in postmortem studies of the brains of AD patients [(12)](#reference12). For these reasons, inhibitors of (acetyl) cholinesterase (which [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the breakdown of acetylcholine) and large doses of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) have been used to treat patients with dementia due to AD in hopes of raising the amount of acetylcholine available in the brain. While cholinesterase inhibitors have shown positive effects on cognitive functions and measures of clinical global state [(82)](#reference82), a [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) did not find lecithin to be more beneficial than [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment, [vascular dementia](../glossary#vascular-dementia), AD, or mixed dementia [(83)](#reference83). Limited data \u2014 mostly from [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) \u2014 are available to assess whether citicoline (CDP-choline) might improve cognitive performance in subjects with AD or PD, and studies to date have generally been labeled as poor in quality [(84)](#reference84). Optic [neuropathies](../glossary#neuropathy), including [glaucoma](../glossary#glaucoma), are associated with damage of the optic nerve and loss of visual function. In glaucoma, the progressive deterioration of the optic nerve is caused by loss of a specific [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) population known as [retinal](../glossary#retina) ganglion cells (RGC), such that the condition has been classified as a [neurodegenerative disease](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) [(85)](#reference85). Choline and its [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) have a number of roles in supporting normal visual function, including retinal function [(86)](#reference86). In a small, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, the effect of citicoline was assessed in 24 subjects affected by open-angle glaucoma and treated with -blockers. Patients were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to follow a therapeutic cycle for a total period of eight years: citicoline (1,000 mg/day, by intramuscular injection) or placebo (-blockers alone) for a two-month period followed by a four-month washout period [(87)](#reference87). Electrophysiological examinations were used to assess the extent of visual dysfunctions, including the simultaneous recordings of Pattern ElectroRetinoGrams (PERG) and Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP). Citicoline was found to enhance retinal function and neural conduction along post-retinal visual pathways, such that responses of the visual cortex to stimuli were significantly improved compared to placebo [(87)](#reference87). In a similar [pilot](../glossary#pilot-study) trial, citicoline efficacy was assessed in 26 volunteers (mean age, 65.4 years) affected by another type of optic neuropathy known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Oral citicoline (1,600 mg/day) was given for 60 days followed by 60 days of washout, and the therapeutic cycle was repeated once. Compared to placebo, citicoline was found to improve retinal function and post-retinal neural conduction, evidenced by PERG and VEP measures [(88)](#reference88). Oral citicoline (four cycles of 500 mg/day for four months followed by a two-month washout period) was also found to significantly reduce the rate of visual field loss and the level of intraocular pressure in 41 patients with progressive glaucoma [(89)](#reference89). Larger [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to establish whether citicoline supplementation could be included in the medical treatment of glaucoma. A few studies have also explored [topical](../glossary#topical) citicoline (i.e., eyedrops) as a potential treatment for glaucoma. One study in 56 patients with open-angle glaucoma found that such topically applied citicoline for four months improved retinal function and visual-related neural conduction when on top of -blocker [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) intraocular pressure [(90)](#reference90). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 78 patients with progressive open-angle glaucoma (despite intraocular pressures of 18 mm Hg), use of citicoline eyedrops for three years blunted the decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness compared to use of placebo eyedrops [(91)](#reference91). This trial also found a trend (p=0.07) for a lower rate of disease progression with topical citicoline [(91)](#reference91). While the results of these pilot studies are promising, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed. [Cerebrovascular diseases](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease) (including [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) and sub-acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease) are the main cause of [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairments in older people. Results from experimental studies have suggested that [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of citicoline (CDP-choline) could enhance the and the [biosynthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) and [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter), while limiting the degradation of phospholipids in [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) membranes in models of Many short-term [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) in older individuals with vascular diseases have found that therapeutic doses of citicoline \u2014 given orally, by intramuscular injection, or by [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) infusion \u2014 resulted in improvements in neuropsychological functions, including cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions (reviewed in [5](#reference5)). A six-month, multicenter [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) enrolled 197 stroke subjects (mean age, 81.5 years) with a progressive decline of their mental health and general confusion and/or stupor who were initially administered citicoline for 5 or 10 days (2,000 mg/day, by intravenous infusion) within a four-month period, and then for 21 days (1,000 mg/day, by intramuscular injection), repeated once after a seven-day washout period [(93)](#reference93). Citicoline treatment was found to be associated with higher scores on cognitive and functional evaluation scales when compared to baseline measurements. However, only [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) would be able to assess whether citicoline is protective against vascular damage and cognitive impairment in elderly adults with complex geriatric symptoms. The International Citicoline Trial on acUte Stroke (ICTUS) is a multicenter and [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) study that assessed the effect of supplementing 2,298 patients with acute [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) with citicoline (2,000 mg/day) or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for six weeks on several functional and [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) outcomes and on mortality rate [(94)](#reference94). The results showed no difference between treatment groups after a 90-day follow-up period. Only subgroup analyses found significant benefits of citicoline in patients older than 70 years, in those with moderate rather than severe strokes, and in those not treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA; standard-of-care treatment). An earlier [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trials had reported a positive impact of citicoline (1,000 mg/day, administered for 28 days to 12 months) on memory and behavior in subjects with cognitive deficits associated with cerebrovascular disorders [(95)](#reference95). The effect of citicoline was also evaluated in a multicenter, [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), controlled trial (IDEALE trial) in Italian elderly adults (ages, 65-94 years) with evidence of vascular lesions on neuroradiology and mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; scores 21) [(96)](#reference96). Three hundred and forty-nine participants received oral citicoline (1,000 mg/day) or no treatment for nine months. MMSE scores in citicoline-treated individuals remained unchanged while they significantly deteriorated in untreated patients such that MMSE scores between groups were found to be significantly different after three and nine months of treatment. No significant effect was reported in measures of functional autonomy, mood, and behavioral disorders. Another open-label, randomized, controlled trial evaluated the effect of citicoline (1,000 mg/day for 12 months) in 347 subjects (mean age, 67.2 years) who suffered an acute stroke. The results demonstrated that citicoline significantly limited cognitive impairments in the domains of attention and [executive functions](../glossary#executive-function) and temporal orientation at 6 and 12 months post-stroke in treated compared to untreated patients [(97)](#reference97). However, other randomized controlled trials have not found any benefit of citicoline treatment in the management of acute ischemic stroke [(98, 99)](#reference98), including a recent trial evaluating its effects when provided immediately following endovascular thrombectomy (i.e., recanalization therapy) and continued for 42 days [(100)](#reference100). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials found that citicoline therapy in acute ischemic stroke (provided intravenously and/or orally between 8 hours and 14 days post stroke) was linked to a slightly higher rate of independence [(101)](#reference101). However, a recent Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials found that citicoline had no benefit to acute ischemic stroke patients compared to placebo with respect to all-cause mortality (8 trials); serious, adverse cardiovascular events (3 trials); or degree of disability or dependence with daily tasks (4 trials) [(102)](#reference102). Thus, there is little evidence that citicoline treatment is efficacious for patients with cerebrovascular disease. Many of the conducted trials have not been a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) design, which reduces the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [bias](../glossary#bias). For decades, preclinical and small [clinical studies](../glossary#clinical-trial) have investigated the effect of citicoline \u2014 when provided intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally \u2014 in the management of traumatic brain injury (TBI). A 2011 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of clinical data suggested that citicoline could hasten the resorption of [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) [edema](../glossary#edema) and improve the recovery of consciousness and [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorders in severe TBI cases (classified by Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] scores of 8) [(5)](#reference5). Citicoline also appeared to limit memory deficits and the duration and severity of other post-traumatic symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, attention disorder) in TBI patients with mild-to-moderate injuries (GCS scores, 9-15) (reviewed in [5](#reference5)). Although citicoline is included in TBI therapeutic regimen in 59 countries, only one multicenter, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial has been conducted in the US. The CiticOline Brain Injury Trial (COBRIT) has enrolled 1,213 patients with mild-to-severe TBI and assessed the effect of enteral or oral citicoline (2,000 mg/day, for 90 days) on functional and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) outcomes (measured by components of the TBI Clinical Trials Network Care Battery) [(103)](#reference103). No significant benefits of citicoline supplementation over placebo were found at 90 days (end of treatment period) and 180 days. It is important to note that this trial had low adherence: only 44% of patients in the trial took at least 75% of their assigned dose [(103)](#reference103). When pooling the results of COBRIT with those of 10 other clinical trials in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis), citicoline treatment for acute-phase TBI was linked to a higher degree of independence, i.e., the capability of performing daily activities without needing assistance [(104)](#reference104). Humans can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) choline moieties in are required, each using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl group donor. Choline is generated [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) when the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine is coupled with the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of newly formed phosphatidylcholine by phospholipases. This is referred to as [de novo synthesis](../glossary#de-novo-synthesis) of choline. The substitution of choline by serine in the synthesis of phosphatidylserine from also releases source of endogenous choline, the nutrient was not initially classified as essential [(1)](#references). Yet, de novo choline synthesis in humans is not sufficient to meet their metabolic needs such that healthy humans fed choline-deficient diets develop fatty liver, liver damage, and/or muscle damage (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). In the US, mean dietary intakes of choline are well below the recommended Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) level. According to a US national survey, NHANES 2015-2018, mean dietary intakes of choline were 284 mg/day for women and 390 mg/day for men; only 6% of women and 11% of men had dietary intakes greater than the AI [(105)](#reference105). Moreover, NHANES data indicate that less than 9% of pregnant women meet the AI for choline [(106)](#reference106). Americans of all ages have low intakes of choline: an analysis of NHANES 2009-2012 found that less than 11% of US residents ages 2 years and older had total choline intakes (from diet and [supplements](../glossary#supplement) combined) above the AI [(107)](#reference107). Stratifying the data by life stage indicated that young children ages 2-8 years were more likely to meet the AI than older children, adolescents, or adults [(107)](#reference107). Vegetarians, especially vegans, who consume no meat, milk, or eggs, may be at [risk](../glossary#risk) for inadequate choline intake [(26)](#reference26). Eggs, liver, [cruciferous vegetables](../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables), and peanuts are especially rich in choline [(32](#reference32), [108)](#reference108); one analysis of NHANES data concluded that it is extremely difficult to meet the AI from food sources alone if eggs are not consumed [(106)](#reference106). Major contributors to choline in the American diet are meat, poultry, fish, dairy foods, pasta, rice, and egg-based dishes [(109)](#reference109). Spinach, beets, wheat, and shellfish are also good sources of the choline [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite), betaine [(110)](#reference110). Betaine cannot be converted back to spare some choline requirements for [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) remethylation [(1)](#references). Phosphatidylcholine, which contains about 13% choline by weight, is the main form of choline in dietary products [(111)](#reference111). Lecithin extracts, which comprise a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and other [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid), are often added during food processing. Lecithins in processed food have been estimated to increase the daily consumption of phosphatidylcholine by about 1.5 mg/kg of body weight for adults [(32)](#reference32). The total choline contents of some choline-containing foods are listed in milligrams (mg) in Table 2. For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) or the [USDA's documentation of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| CDP-choline (citicoline) [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Phosphatidylcholine also provide choline; however, choline comprises only about 13% of the weight of phosphatidylcholine [(111)](#reference111). Therefore, a supplement containing 4,230 mg (4.23 grams) of phosphatidylcholine would provide 550 mg of choline. Although the term \"lecithin\" is synonymous with phosphatidylcholine when used in chemistry, commercial lecithins are usually prepared from soybean, sunflower, and rapeseed, and may contain anywhere from 20%-90% of phosphatidylcholine. Egg yolk lecithin is a more unlikely source of lecithin in dietary supplements. Moreover, the nature of phosphatidylcholine-containing [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) depends on whether lecithin is produced from vegetable, animal, or microbial sources. In particular, soybean lecithin is richer in acids](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) than [(112)](#reference112). including prenatal multivitamins, do not contain choline; the few that do often contain choline at levels much lower than the [AI](../glossary#AI) [(113)](#reference113). High doses (10,000 to 16,000 mg/day) of choline have been associated with a fishy body odor, vomiting, salivation, and increased sweating. The fishy body odor results from excessive production and [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of trimethylamine, a [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) of choline. In the inherited condition, primary [trimethylaminuria](../glossary#trimethylaminuria) (also known as \"fish odor syndrome\"; see the article on [Riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin#trimethylaminuria)), a defective flavin containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) results in impaired [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of trimethylamine in the liver. Disease management includes the use of choline-restricted diets in affected individuals [(114)](#reference114). Taking large doses of choline in the form of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) does not generally result in fishy body odor, because its [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) results in little trimethylamine. A dose of 7,500 mg/day of choline was found to have a slight blood pressure-lowering (hypotensive) effect, which could result in dizziness or fainting. Choline magnesium trisalicylate at doses of 3,000 mg/day has resulted in impaired liver function, generalized itching, and ringing of the ears (tinnitus). However, it is likely that these effects were caused by the salicylate, rather than the choline in the preparation [(32)](#reference32). In 1998, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) established the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for choline at 3,500 mg/day for adults (Table 3). This recommendation was based primarily on preventing hypotension (low blood pressure), and secondarily, on preventing the fishy body odor due to increased excretion of trimethylamine. The UL was established for generally healthy people, and the FNB noted that individuals with liver or kidney disease, [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease), depression, or inherited trimethylaminuria might be at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of adverse effects when consuming choline at intake should be food and formula only.| Oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with phosphatidylcholine (250 mg of total choline from food plus 250 mg of supplemental phosphatidylcholine) has been found to result in detectable concentrations of trimethylamine and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the blood [(23)](#reference23). The [intestinal microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) is directly implicated in the generation of trimethylamine from dietary choline and its [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) phosphatidylcholine, as well as from dietary betaine and [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine). Trimethylamine is subsequently converted into TMAO by flavin-containing monooxygenases in the liver. The [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 4,007 individuals \u2014 with or without [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) \u2014 for a three-year period found baseline concentrations of circulating TMAO to be positively correlated with incidence of death, nonfatal [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) \u2014 described as major adverse cardiac events (MACE) [(23)](#reference23). In the same cohort, MACE [risk](../glossary#risk) was found to be about 30% higher in individuals in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of choline or betaine [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations [(115)](#reference115). However, depending on gut microbiota composition, the risk of having an adverse [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) event may be lower in individuals with low versus high circulating TMAO even though choline and/or betaine concentrations in the blood are elevated [(115)](#reference115). Similar findings have since been made in other prospective cohorts. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 19 prospective studies found that higher blood TMAO concentrations were associated with a 62% increased risk for MACE or death compared to lower concentrations [(116)](#reference116). Elevated circulating TMAO concentrations have been not only linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease but also to an increased risk for type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and kidney disease [(117-119)](#reference117). However, high TMAO concentrations in blood may be a [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of the disease rather than a causative factor [(120, 121)](#reference120). Further research is needed to understand how the composition of intestinal microbiota influences the metabolic fate of ingested choline. At present, there is little evidence that dietary choline increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Prospective cohort studies on the association have been inconsistent: a few studies have linked higher choline intakes to increased risks of [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) [(122)](#reference122) and cardiovascular disease-related mortality [(43, 44)](#reference43), while several other prospective studies have found no association between choline intake and cardiovascular disease endpoints [(41](#reference41), [45-48)](#reference45). Interestingly, in the PREvencion con DIeta trial in overweight or obese individuals with metabolic syndrome, an increase in dietary choline intake over a one-year period was associated with improved measures of cardiovascular health (i.e., lower [serum](../glossary#serum) total cholesterol, serum [LDL](../glossary#LDL) cholesterol, and [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) levels) [(123)](#reference123). Methotrexate, a medication in the treatment and [rheumatoid arthritis](../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis), inhibits the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) dihydrofolate reductase and therefore limits the availability of methyl groups donated from [folate](../vitamins/folate) derivatives. Rats given methotrexate have shown evidence of diminished nutritional [status](../glossary#status) of choline and greater drug adverse reactions due to liver dysfunction [(12](#reference12), [124)](#reference124). Thus, individuals taking methotrexate may have an increased choline requirement. Treatments with a family of [lipid](../glossary#lipid)-lowering drugs known as fibrates (e.g., fenofibrate, bezofibrate) have been associated with an increased [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of betaine in the urine and a rise in [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentration in the blood of patients with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) or [metabolic syndrome](../disease-index/metabolic-syndrome) [(125, 126)](#reference125). If the fibrate therapy are indeed mitigated by fibrate-induced betaine deficiency, the use and safety of supplementing patients with betaine would need to be considered [(127)](#reference127). Little is known regarding the amount of dietary choline required to promote optimum health or prevent [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) in humans. The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation by the Food and Nutrition Board of 425 mg/day for adult women and 550 mg/day for adult men. A varied, healthy diet should provide enough choline for most people, but strict vegetarians who consume no milk or eggs may be at [risk](../glossary#risk) of inadequate choline intake. Little is known regarding the amount of dietary choline most likely to promote optimum health or prevent [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) in older adults. At present, there is no evidence to support a different recommended intake of choline from that of younger adults (425 mg/day for women and 550 mg/day for men).

N Z Med (PUFA), they contain more than one cis double bond [(1)](#references). In all omega-6 (6 or n-6) fatty acids, the first double bond is located between the sixth and seventh carbon atom from the methyl end of the fatty acid. Likewise, all omega-3 fatty acids (3 or n-3) have at least one double bond between the third and fourth carbon atom counting from the methyl end of the fatty acid. Scientific abbreviations for fatty acids tell the reader something about their chemical structure. For example, the scientific abbreviation for -linolenic acid (ALA) is 18:3n-3. The first part (18:3) tells the reader that ALA is an 18-carbon fatty acid with three double bonds, while the second part (n-3) tells the reader that the first double bond is in the n-3 position, which defines this fatty acid as an omega-3 (Figures 1a & b). Double bonds introduce kinks in the hydrocarbon chain that influence the structure and physical properties of the fatty acid molecule (Figure 1c). Although humans and other mammals [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) [saturated fatty acids](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and some in [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [proteins](../glossary#protein), they lack the delta () 12 and 15 desaturase [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) necessary to insert a cis double bond at the n-6 or the n-3 position of a fatty acid [(1)](#references). Consequently, omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients. The parent fatty acid of the omega-6 series is linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n-6), and the parent fatty acid of the omega-3 series is ALA (Figure 2 and [Table 1](#table-1)). Humans can synthesize long-chain (20 carbons or acids, acids must be [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) [(2)](#reference2). [Bile](../glossary#bile) salts must also be present in the small intestine to allow for the incorporation of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) and other fat digestion products into mixed [micelles](../glossary#micelle). Fat absorption from mixed micelles occurs throughout the small intestine and is 85%-95% efficient under normal conditions. Concentrations of fatty acids in blood (i.e., whole blood, [plasma](../glossary#plasma), [serum](../glossary#serum), and red blood cells) reflect both dietary intake and biological processes [(3)](#reference3). Humans can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) longer omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids from the essential fatty acids linoleic acid (LA) and -linolenic acid (ALA), respectively, through a series of desaturation (addition of a double bond between two carbon atoms) and elongation (addition of two carbon atoms) reactions (Figure 3) [(4, 5)](#reference4). LA and ALA compete for the same elongase and desaturase enzymes in the synthesis of longer [polyunsaturated fatty acids](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) (PUFA), such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Studies of ALA [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in healthy young men indicated that approximately 8% of dietary ALA was converted to EPA and 0%-4% was converted to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [(6)](#reference6). In healthy young women, approximately 21% of dietary ALA was converted to EPA and 9% was converted to DHA [(7)](#reference7). The better capacity to generate long-chain PUFA from ALA in young women compared to men is related to the effects of [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) [(8, 9)](#reference8). Although only the essentiality of ALA is recognized because it cannot be synthesized [de novo](../glossary#de-novo-synthesis) by humans, the relatively low rate of ALA conversion into EPA and DHA suggests that these long-chain omega-3 PUFA may be considered [conditionally essential nutrients](../glossary#conditionally-essential-nutrient). In addition to gender differences, genetic variability in enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism influences one's ability to generate long-chain PUFA. Two key enzymes in fatty acid metabolism are delta 6 desaturase (FADS2) and delta 5 desaturase (FADS1) (Figure 3) [(10)](#reference10). Two common [haplotypes](../glossary#haplotype) (a cluster of [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism)) in the FADS [genes](../glossary#gene) differ dramatically in their ability to generate long-chain PUFA: haplotype D is associated with increased FADS activity (both FADS1 and FADS2) and higher conversion rate of fatty acid [precursors](../glossary#precursor) (LA and ALA) to long-chain PUFA (EPA, GLA, DHA, and AA) [(11)](#reference11). These FADS polymorphisms are relatively common in the population and may explain up to 30% of the variability in blood concentrations of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids among individuals [(3)](#reference3). Finally, DHA can be retro-converted to EPA and DPA at a low basal rate and following [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (Figure 3) [(12)](#reference12). After supplementing omnivores (n=8) and vegetarians (n=12) for six weeks with an EPA-free preparation of DHA (1.62 g/day), EPA, DPA, and DHA concentrations increased in serum and [platelet](../glossary#platelet) phospholipids [(13)](#reference13). Based on the measured changes, the estimated percent retroconversion of DHA to EPA was 7.4%-11.4% (based on serum phospholipid data) and 12.3%-13.8% (based on platelet phospholipid data), with no significant difference between omnivores and vegetarians. Due to this nontrivial retroconversion efficiency, DHA supplementation may represent an alternative to fish oil to increase blood and tissue concentrations of EPA, DPA, and DHA (see [Supplements](#supplements)) [(5)](#reference5). Omega-6 and omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) are important structural components of [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). When incorporated into [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid), they affect cell membrane properties, such as fluidity, flexibility, permeability, and the activity of membrane-bound [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) dietary consumption of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) can modify the composition and molecular structure of cellular membranes. Thus, increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake increases the omega-3 content of red blood cells, immune cells [(16)](#reference16), [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaques [(17)](#reference17), cardiac tissue [(18)](#reference18), and other cell types throughout the body. DHA is selectively incorporated into [retinal](../glossary#retina) cell membranes and postsynaptic [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cell membranes, suggesting it plays important roles in vision and nervous system function. In fact, DHA represents the predominant PUFA in the retina and neuronal cells [(19)](#reference19). DHA is found at very high concentrations in the [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) of the [retina](../glossary#retina); the retina conserves and recycles even when omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) intake is low [(20)](#reference20). Animal studies indicate that DHA is required for the normal development and function of the retina. Moreover, these studies suggest that there is a critical period during retinal development when inadequate DHA will result in permanent abnormalities in retinal function. Research indicates that DHA plays an important role in the regeneration of the visual pigment rhodopsin, which plays a critical role in the visual transduction system that converts light hitting the retina to visual images in the brain [(21)](#reference21). The [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) of the brain's [gray matter](../glossary#gray-matter) contain high proportions of long-chain [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid), suggesting they are important to [central nervous [(22)](#reference22). AA stimulates [glucose](../glossary#glucose) uptake by cortical [astrocytes](../glossary#astrocyte), meaning that it is important for energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(23)](#reference23). AA and DHA also increase the release of acetylcholine, which enhances [synaptic plasticity](../glossary#synaptic-plasticity) and memory, thereby improving learning abilities [(24)](#reference24). Although trials of PUFA supplementation during pregnancy and/or early infancy failed to show [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) improvements in offspring (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)), the availability of omega-3 and omega-6 [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) to the fetus and infants is essential for the growth of their brain and development of brain functions. There is compelling evidence to suggest that PUFA are essential to [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) growth and [synapse](../glossary#synapse) formation, and for appropriate neurotransmission (reviewed in [25](#reference25)). Oxylipins are potent chemical messengers derived from PUFA. They play critical roles in immune and [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) responses. The most common oxylipins are eicosanoids that encompass numerous bioactive [lipid](../glossary#lipid) mediators 20-carbon (\"eicosa-\") AA. Following stimulation by [hormones](../glossary#hormone), [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), and other stimuli, PUFA bound to membrane phospholipids from 4). Physiological to AA-derived eicosanoids differ from responses to EPA-derived eicosanoids. In general, EPA is a poor substrate for eicosanoid production and EPA-derives eicosanoids are less potent inducers of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), blood vessel and [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) than eicosanoids derived from AA [(19](#reference19), [27)](#reference27). Nonetheless, it is an to label all AA-derived eicosanoids as pro-inflammatory. AA-derived inflammation leukotrienes and cytokines and induce anti-inflammatory lipoxins, thereby modulating the intensity and duration of the inflammatory response via negative feedback (Figure 4) [(17)](#reference17). A separate class of [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid)-derived bioactive [lipids](../glossary#lipid), specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), has been more recently identified (reviewed in [28](#reference28)). These molecules function as local mediators of the resolution phase of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), actively turning off the inflammatory response. SPMs are derived from both omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA (Figure 4) [(29)](#reference29). The S-series of SPMs results from the LOX-mediated oxygenation of EPA and DHA, giving rise to S-resolvins, S-protectins, and S-maresins. A second class of SPMs, the R-series, is generated from the aspirin-dependent [acetylation](../glossary#acetylation) of COX-2 and subsequent generation of aspirin-triggered SPMs from AA, EPA, and DHA. It appears that these mediators may explain many of the anti-inflammatory actions of omega-3 [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) that have been described [(16](#reference16), [30)](#reference30). [free radical](../glossary#free-radical)-induced [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of any [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) with three or more double bonds (Figure 4) [(26)](#reference26). Because they are produced upon exposure to free radicals, isoprostanes are often used as markers for [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress). In to prostanoids, isoprostanes are [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) from PUFA [precursors](../glossary#precursor) and to the membrane [phospholipid](../glossary#phospholipid) until cleaved by PLA2 and released into circulation. In addition to being used as markers of oxidative stress, isoprostanes may also function as [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) mediators, exerting both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects [(26)](#reference26). PUFA are pleiotropic regulators of cell function. They can regulate gene expression directly by interacting with transcription factors or indirectly by influencing membrane lipid composition and cell signaling pathways. The results of cell culture and animal studies indicate that omega-6 and omega-3 [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) can modulate the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of a number of [genes](../glossary#gene), including those 32)](#reference31). Omega-6 and omega-3 gene interacting with specific [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor), such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) act like [hydrophobic](../glossary#hydrophobic) [hormones](../glossary#hormone) (e.g., [steroid](../glossary#steroid) hormones) to control gene expression and bind directly to [receptors](../glossary#receptor) like PPARs. These [ligand](../glossary#ligand)-activated receptors then bind to the [promoters](../glossary#promoter) of genes and function to increase/decrease [transcription](../glossary#transcription). In other cases, PUFA regulate the abundance of transcription factors inside the cell's [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) [(14)](#reference14). Two examples include NFB and SREBP-1. NFB is a transcription factor involved in regulating the expression of multiple genes involved in inflammation. Omega-3 PUFA suppress NFB nuclear content, thus inhibiting the production of inflammatory [eicosanoids](../glossary#eicosanoid) and [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine). SREBP-1 is a major transcription factor acid both [de novo](../glossary#de-novo-synthesis) [lipogenesis](../glossary#lipogenesis) and PUFA synthesis. Dietary PUFA can suppress SREBP-1, which decreases the expression of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in fatty acid synthesis and PUFA synthesis. In this way, dietary PUFA function as feedback inhibitors of all fatty acid synthesis. By altering cell membrane fluidity, fatty acids can interfere with the activity of membrane receptor systems and thus indirectly influence signaling pathways and gene expression [(34)](#reference34). Clinical signs of essential [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) deficiency include a dry scaly rash, decreased growth in infants and children, increased susceptibility to infection, and poor wound healing [(35)](#reference35). Omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids compete for the same desaturase [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). The desaturase enzymes show preference for the different series of fatty acids in the following order: omega-3 > omega-6 acid eicosatrienoic acid (20:3n-9, mead acid, or 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid) increases only when dietary intakes of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are very low; therefore, mead acid is one marker of essential fatty acid deficiency [(36)](#reference36). A [plasma](../glossary#plasma) eicosatrienoic acid:arachidonic acid (triene:tetraene) ratio greater than 0.2 is generally considered indicative of essential fatty acid deficiency [(35, 37)](#reference35). In patients of essential fatty acid deficiency developed in as little as 7 to 10 days [(38)](#reference38). In these cases, the continuous glucose infusion resulted in high circulating [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentrations, which inhibited the release of essential fatty acids stored in [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose). When glucose-free amino acid solutions were used, parenteral nutrition up to 14 days did not result in biochemical signs of essential fatty acid deficiency. Essential fatty acid deficiency has also been found to occur in patients with chronic fat [malabsorption](../glossary#malasorption-syndrome) [(39)](#reference39) and in patients with [cystic fibrosis](../glossary#cystic-fibrosis) [(40)](#reference40). It has been proposed that essential fatty acid deficiency may play a role in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of protein-energy malnutrition [(36)](#reference36). At least one case of isolated omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) deficiency has been reported. A young girl who received [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) [lipid](../glossary#lipid) emulsions with very little ALA developed visual problems and sensory [neuropathy](../glossary#neuropathy); these conditions were resolved when she was administered an emulsion containing more ALA [(41)](#reference41). Isolated omega-3 fatty acid deficiency does not result in increased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) triene:tetraene ratios, and skin [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) and [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis) are absent [(1)](#references). Plasma DHA concentrations decrease when omega-3 fatty acid intake is insufficient, but no accepted plasma omega-3 fatty acid or [eicosanoid](../glossary#eicosanoid) concentrations indicative of impaired health status have been defined [(1)](#references). Studies in rodents have revealed significant impairment of n-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) deficiency on learning and memory [(42, 43)](#reference42), prompting research in humans to assess the impact of omega-3 PUFA on [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) development and cognitive decline (see visual development](#cognitive-visual-development) and [Alzheimer's disease](#cognitive-decline-alzheimer-disease-prevention)). The [omega-3 index](../glossary#omega-3-index) is defined as the amount of EPA plus DHA in red blood [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) expressed as the percent of total red blood cell membrane [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) [(44)](#reference44). The EPA + DHA content of red blood cell membranes correlates with that of cardiac muscle cells [(45, 46)](#reference45), and several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) indicate that a lower omega-3 index is associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) mortality [(47)](#reference47). It is therefore proposed that the omega-3 index be used as a [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) risk, with suggested cutoffs as follows: high risk, intermediate risk, 4%-8%; and low risk, >8% [(48)](#reference48). Supplementation with EPA + DHA from fish oil capsules for approximately five months dose-dependently increased the omega-3 index in 115 healthy, young adults (ages, 20-45 years), validating the use of the omega-3 index as a biomarker of EPA + DHA intake [(49)](#reference49). Before the omega-3 index can be used in routine clinical evaluation, however, clinical reference values in the population must be established [(50)](#reference50). Additionally, fatty acid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) may be altered in certain disease states, potentially making the omega-3 index less relevant for some [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) conditions [(5)](#reference5). Effect on pregnancy-associated conditions and neonatal outcomes: The results of [randomized omega-3 [polyunsaturated fatty [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) [(51-54)](#reference51) but may result in modest increases in length of gestation, especially in women with low omega-3 fatty acid consumption. A 2006 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six randomized controlled trials in women with low- [risk](../glossary#risk) pregnancies found that omega-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy resulted in an increased length of pregnancy by 1.6 days [(55)](#reference55). A 2007 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in women with high-risk pregnancies found that supplementation with long-chain PUFA did not affect pregnancy duration or the overall incidence of premature births (birth before 37 weeks' gestation) but decreased the incidence of early premature births (birth before 34 weeks' gestation; 2 trials, 291 participants) [(56)](#reference56). Analyses of the secondary outcomes of the 2010 DHA to Optimize Mother-Infant Outcome (DOMInO) trial in 2,399 participants showed that supplementation with DHA-enriched fish oil capsules (800 mg/day of DHA and 100 mg/day of EPA) during pregnancy (from <21 gestational weeks until birth) reduced the risk of early premature birth but increased the risk of obstetrical interventions like the need for induction or cesarean section, when compared to supplementation with DHA-free vegetable oil capsules [(57)](#reference57). A 2016 meta-analysis of trials found evidence to suggest that omega-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy reduced the overall risk of prematurity and the risk of early premature births, increased gestational age at delivery and birth weight, and had no effect on the risks of perinatal death and low [Apgar scores](../glossary#Apgar-score) at 1 minute post birth [(58)](#reference58). A dose-response analysis found a continuous reduction of the risks of early premature birth (birth before 34 weeks' gestation) and very low birth weight (birth weight <1,500 g) with daily doses of DHA supplement up to at least 600 mg during pregnancy [(59)](#reference59). There is currently limited evidence to support a role for omega-3 supplementation in the prevention of recurrent intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) [(60)](#reference60) or recurrent preterm birth [(61)](#reference61). [Effect on children's and visual effect of maternal omega-3 long-chain ] [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on early childhood [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) and visual development was summarized in a 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(62)](#reference62). Included in this assessment were 11 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (a total of 5,272 participants) that supplemented maternal diet with omega-3 long-chain PUFA during pregnancy or both pregnancy and lactation. Results regarding visual outcomes (eight trials) could not be pooled together due to variability in assessments; overall, four of six trials had null findings and the remaining two trials had very high rates of [attrition](../glossary#attrition). Cognitive outcomes (nine trials) included the Developmental Standard Score (DSS; in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers) or Intelligence Quotient (IQ; in children) and other aspects of neurodevelopment, such as language, behavior, and motor function. No differences were found between DHA and control groups for [cognition](../glossary#cognition) measured with standardized psychometric scales in infants (<12 months), toddlers (12-24 months), and school-aged children (5-12 years); preschool children (2-5 years) in the DHA treatment group had a substantially higher DSS score compared to controls. The authors noted that many of the trials of long-chain PUFA supplementation in pregnancy had methodological weaknesses (e.g., high rates of attrition, small sample sizes, high [risk](../glossary#risk) of [bias](../glossary#bias), multiple comparisons), limiting the confidence and interpretation of the pooled results. Of note, a seven-year follow-up of the DOMInO trial is currently underway to assess the effect of DHA supplementation during pregnancy on child IQ and various measures of cognitive development (e.g., executive functioning, memory, language) [(63)](#reference63). Effect on children's body composition: The follow-up of 1,531 children whose mothers were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) DHA (800 mg/day) or a control during the second half of pregnancy in the DOMInO trial showed no effect of maternal DHA supplementation on the [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI)-for-age z score and percentage of body fat of their children at three and five years of age [(64)](#reference64). Measures of [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) in 5-year-old children were unexpectedly higher in children whose mothers were in the DHA group than in those whose mothers were in the control group [(64)](#reference64). Further analyses conducted in a subset of children (252) at age seven years again showed no effect of DHA supplementation on BMI z score, percentage of body fat, height, weight, and waist/hip circumference [(65)](#reference65). Current evidence from 10 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) primarily conducted in high-income countries (all but one) suggests no influence of maternal supplementation with long-chain PUFA on the body composition and [anthropometry](../glossary#anthropometric) of the offspring [(66)](#reference66). Effect on children's risk of allergies and asthma: A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 2,047 children followed for six months to 16 years found a 19% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of wheezing and/or [asthma](../glossary#asthma) with maternal [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) of omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) (primarily EPA and DHA) from as early as the 20th week of [gestation](../glossary#gestation) until delivery [(67)](#reference67). However, there was no effect of prenatal supplementation when the analysis was restricted to the three trials that reported on the incidence of childhood asthma only [(67)](#reference67). Another meta-analysis of nine trials in 3,637 children, including three trials in which maternal supplementation with omega-3 PUFA continued after birth, found no effect of prenatal supplements on the risk of any allergy (three trials), the risk of wheeze and/or asthma (seven trials), the risk of eczema (six trials), the development of allergic rhinitis (two trials), and the risk of food allergy (three trials) in children [(68)](#reference68). There was, however, some evidence to suggest that prenatal supplementation could lower the incidence of sensitization to specific allergens, namely egg (three trials; -46%) [(68)](#reference68). A 2015 review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) summarized the results of eight [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of maternal [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with long-chain [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) during either pregnancy and lactation or lactation only on the development and growth of their infants over the first two years of life and beyond [(69)](#reference69). All studies were conducted in high-income countries. No differences between long-chain PUFA supplementation and control were observed in terms of language development, intelligence or problem-solving ability, psychomotor development, and [anthropometric](../glossary#anthropometric) measurements (weight, length/height, head circumference, [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index), fat mass distribution) [(69)](#reference69). The last trimester of pregnancy and first six months of postnatal life are critical periods for the accumulation of DHA in the brain and [retina](../glossary#retina) [(70)](#reference70). Human milk contains human milk contains DHA in addition to ALA and EPA, ALA was the only omega-3 fatty acid present in conventional infant formulas until the year 2001. Although infants can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) DHA from ALA, they generally cannot synthesize enough to prevent declines in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and cellular DHA concentrations without additional dietary intake. Therefore, it was proposed that infant formulas be supplemented with enough DHA to bring plasma and cellular DHA concentrations of formula-fed infants up to those of breast-fed infants [(72)](#reference72). All infants: Although formulas enriched with DHA raise [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and red blood cell DHA concentrations in preterm and term infants, the results of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examining measures of visual acuity and [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) development in infants fed formula with or without added DHA have been mixed. For instance, a 2012 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of randomized controlled trials (12 trials, 1,902 infants) comparing long-chain [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid)-supplemented and unsupplemented formula, started within one month of birth, found no effect of long-chain PUFA supplementation on infant [cognition](../glossary#cognition) assessed at approximately one year of age [(73)](#reference73). A lack of effect was observed regardless of the dose of long-chain PUFA or the prematurity status of the infant. With respect to visual acuity, a 2013 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (19 trials, 1,949 infants) found a beneficial effect of long-chain PUFA-supplemented formula, started within one month of birth, on infant visual acuity up to 12 months of age [(74)](#reference74). Notably, two different types of visual acuity assessment were evaluated in the meta-analysis. Visual acuity assessed by using the Visually Evoked Potential (10 trials, 852 infants) showed a significant positive effect of long-chain PUFA-supplemented formula at 2, 4, and 12 months of age. When assessed by the Behavioral Method (12 trials, 1,095 infants), a significant benefit of long-chain PUFA-supplemented formula on visual acuity was found only at the age of two months. No moderating effects of dose or prematurity status were observed. Preterm infants: A few trials have been specifically conducted in preterm infants. This is the case of the DHA for the Improvement of Neurodevelopmental Outcome (DINO) trial that initially enrolled 657 very preterm infants (born <33 gestational weeks) in five Australian hospitals [(75)](#reference75). The aim of the trial was to examine the effect of enteral feeds with either high DHA (1% of total [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid)) or standard DHA level (0.3% of total fatty acids) to preterm infants from age 2 to 4 days of life until term's corrected age (mean duration, 9.4 weeks) on their mental and psychomotor development, assessed at 18 months' and 7 years' corrected ages. At the 18-month follow-up, there was no difference in mean Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) test scores between high-DHA and standard-DHA groups; yet, better MDI scores in girls fed high-DHA versus those fed standard-DHA feeds were reported in subgroup analyses [(75)](#reference75). Post-hoc analyses also suggested fewer cases with delayed mental development among girls and infants weighing <1,250 kg at birth in the high- versus standard-DHA group [(75)](#reference75). Follow-up at 7 years' corrected age showed no difference between groups in measures of IQ and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) development, including attention, short-term verbal memory and learning ability, executive functioning, visual perception, and academic achievement [(76)](#reference76). A 2016 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 17 trials found little evidence to suggest that supplementing preterm infants with long-chain PUFA (primarily AA and DHA) improved measures of visual acuity, neurodevelopment, and physical growth during infancy [(77)](#reference77). Linoleic acid (LA) is the most abundant dietary [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) and accounts for approximately 90% of dietary omega-6 PUFA intake [(78)](#reference78). Observational studies: A pooled analysis of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), encompassing 310,602 individuals and 12,479 [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) events (of which resulted in 5,882 CHD deaths) over follow-up periods of 5.3 to 30 years, found higher LA intakes to be associated with a 15% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of CHD events and a 21% lower risk of CHD mortality [(79)](#reference79). A dose-response analysis found that replacing 5% of energy from [saturated fatty acids](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) with LA was associated with a 9% lower risk of coronary events and a 13% lower risk of coronary deaths [(79)](#reference79). A 2019 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 30 prospective cohort studies in 68,659 participants found that individuals in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#qunitile) of LA concentrations in tissues (primarily blood compartments) had a 23% lower risk of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) mortality [(80)](#reference80). No associations were found between LA concentrations in tissues and the risks of CHD, [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke), or total [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(80)](#reference80). Randomized controlled trials: consideration the results from four [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(81-85)](#reference81) that compared the effects of diets either high in [saturated fatty acids](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) or [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) over at least two years, a 2016 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and presidential advisory from the American Heart Association concluded that lowering saturated fat intake and replacing it with vegetable oil rich in PUFA (primarily soybean oil) could reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [CHD](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) by 29% [(86)](#reference86). Of note, these trials were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, when the use of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering drug statin was not widespread and the saturated fat content in diets was higher; all but one trial [(84, 85)](#reference84) were in men with diagnosed [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). Among these four trials, the Oslo Diet-Heart Study [(83)](#reference83) increased both omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA intake, and the Finnish Mental Hospital Study [(84, 85)](#reference84) used a [cross-over design](../glossary#cross-over-trial) \u2014 both trials were excluded from a Cochrane systematic review of 19 randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of increasing omega-6 PUFA intake on CVD outcomes [(87)](#reference87). Of these 19 trials, seven assessed the effect of supplemental -linolenic acid (GLA) and 12 assessed the effect of substituting dietary LA for saturated or [monounsaturated fatty acids](../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid). The pooled analysis of studies showed no effect of increasing omega-6 intake on the risks of CHD or CVD events, major adverse cardiac and [cerebrovascular](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease) events, [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), CVD mortality, or all-cause mortality (low-quality evidence) [(87)](#reference87). Moreover, many trials that examined the effect of replacing saturated fatty acids with mostly omega-6 PUFA may not have been adequately controlled. For example, in some trials, only the experimental group (the high omega-6 PUFA group) received dietary advice regarding more than just replacing saturated fatty acids by omega-3 PUFA, e.g., to avoid dietary sources of [trans fatty acids](../glossary#trans-fat) and processed foods, to consume more whole-plant foods, to lower sugar consumption, to increase consumption of fish and shellfish, which could have [biased](../glossary#bias) the results [(88)](#reference88). Additionally, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of trials with low risk of bias (i.e., free of differences between intervention and control groups other than those under examination) showed no evidence of an effect of substituting omega-6 PUFA for saturated fatty acids on the risks of major CHD events (MI and sudden death), total CHD events, CHD mortality, and all-cause mortality [(88)](#reference88). Yet, replacing dietary saturated fatty acids with omega-6 PUFA was consistently found to lower total blood [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations [(87, 89)](#reference87). In fact, LA has been shown to be the most potent fatty acid for lowering total cholesterol when substituted for dietary saturated fatty acids [(90)](#reference90). The potential mechanisms by which LA reduces blood cholesterol include (1) the upregulation of [LDL](../glossary#LDL) [receptor](../glossary#receptor) and redistribution of LDL-cholesterol from [plasma](../glossary#plasma) to tissue, (2) the increase in [bile acid](../glossary#bile-acids) production and cholesterol [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism), and (3) the decreased [VLDL](../glossary#VLDL)-to-LDL conversion [(91)](#reference91). However, if substituting omega-6 PUFA for saturated fatty acids can reduce blood cholesterol, the most recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have failed to find evidence of clinical cardiovascular benefits (see above) [(87, 88](#reference87), [92)](#reference92). Observational studies: A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and two [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) cohort studies in 45,637 generally healthy participants found that circulating concentrations of -linolenic acid (ALA) and longer chain omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) [(93)](#reference93). Several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) also examined the relationship between dietary ALA intake and the risk of CHD. A 2018 meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies in a total of 345,202 participants free of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) evaluated the risk of composite CHD outcomes (combining different CHD events) and fatal CHD in relation to dietary consumption of ALA [(94)](#reference94). Overall, the pooled analysis found a 9% lower risk of composite CHD outcomes and a 15% lower risk of fatal CHD with higher ALA exposure [(94)](#reference94). Further, a number of prospective cohort studies have examined the consumption of fish, rich in long-chain omega-3 PUFA (mainly EPA and DHA), in relation to various [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events and mortality. A 2018 review of the evidence and advisory from the American Heart Association concluded that seafood intake was associated with modestly lower risks of CHD, [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke), and sudden cardiac death, and noted a greater benefit when intake went from zero to one or two seafood meals per week and when seafood was substituted for less healthy options like processed meat [(95)](#reference95). In contrast, recently published meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies found little evidence of inverse associations between fish consumption and either CHD or stroke [(96, 97)](#reference96). Higher fish consumption was found to be associated with lower risks of [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (MI) [(98)](#reference98) and [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) [(96)](#reference96). In addition, one meta-analysis of 12 prospective cohort studies found a 6% lower risk of all-cause mortality with the highest versus lowest level of fish consumption [(99)](#reference99). Yet, another meta-analysis found no association between fish intake and all-cause mortality but a 4% lower risk of CVD mortality for each 20-g/day increment in fish intake [(100)](#reference100). The potential cardiovascular benefit of seafood consumption appears to be tightly linked to the type of seafood (e.g., fatty or lean fish), the way it is prepared (e.g., baked, broiled, or fried), the presence of toxic metals and environmental contaminants, and the habitual level of consumption (high versus low) \u2014 these factors may be [confounding](../glossary#confounder) the results reported in observational studies and pooled analyses [(95)](#reference95). Although seafood is a good source of long-chain omega-3 PUFA, health benefits associated with fish consumption could be attributed to the presence of other nutritional factors (e.g., [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) and high-quality protein) and that seafood consumption is usually a marker of higher socioeconomic status, as well as healthy lifestyles [(101, 102)](#reference101). Randomized controlled trials: A 2018 Cochrane [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) assessed the evidence for a cardioprotective effect of ALA and long-chain omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) in individuals either at low or high [risk](../glossary#risk) of [CVD](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(103)](#reference103). Moderate-to-high quality evidence from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (of at least 12 months) suggested no effect of omega-3 PUFA (either supplemented, enriched in meals, or advised to be consumed) on the risk of [CHD](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) events, CVD events, [arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), CHD mortality, CVD mortality, or all-cause mortality. There was also no evidence of an effect on secondary outcomes, including major adverse [cerebrovascular](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease) or cardiovascular events, MI, sudden [(103)](#reference103). A 2017 review and advisory from the American Heart Association found no evidence to suggest a benefit of long-chain omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular mortality in patients with or at risk of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), the prevention of CHD in patients with [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) disease (e.g., with prior stroke, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia), the prevention of stroke in patients with or without a history of stroke, and the prevention of [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) in patients with prior atrial fibrillation or in those undergoing cardiac surgery [(104)](#reference104). There was some evidence to suggest that supplementation with long-chain omega-3 PUFA in patients with prior clinical CHD might reduce the risk of CHD death, possibly because of a reduction in the risk of [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia)-induced sudden cardiac factor for cardiovascular disease [(105)](#reference105). Numerous controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have demonstrated that increasing intakes of EPA and DHA significantly lower serum triglyceride concentrations [(103)](#reference103). The triglyceride-lowering effects of EPA and DHA increase with dose [(106)](#reference106), but clinically meaningful reductions in serum triglyceride concentrations have been demonstrated at doses of 2 g/day of EPA + DHA [(107)](#reference107). Although long-chain omega-3 PUFA can reduce triglyceride concentrations, they have no effect on total cholesterol, [LDL](../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol, or [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol in blood [(103)](#reference103). Of note, the mechanisms by which long-chain omega-3 PUFA [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may reduce CHD death are unlikely to involve a lowering of triglycerides as doses used in the studies (~1 g/day) were generally too low [(104)](#reference104). Some studies in cell culture indicated that long-chain omega-3 PUFA may decrease the excitability of ( [myocytes](../glossary#myocyte)) by modulating [ion channel](../glossary#ion-channel) conductance, which would be consistent with anti-arrhythmic effects observed in animal models (see also [Hypertriglyceridemia](#hypertriglyceridemia-treatment)) Replacing dietary lowers total blood [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), yet there is no convincing evidence of an effect of omega-6 PUFA on the [risk](../glossary#risk) of major [CVD](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) events. Although evidence supports the adoption of a heart-healthy dietary pattern that includes two servings of seafood per week [(95)](#reference95), supplementation with long-chain omega-3 [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) is unlikely to result in [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits in generally healthy people with a low CVD risk or in individuals at risk of or with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(104)](#reference104). In its recommendations regarding omega-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease (see [Intake Recommendations](#intake-recommendations)), the American Heart Association indicates that long-chain omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be useful to reduce mortality in patients with prevalent [CHD](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (e.g., who suffered a recent MI) and in those with [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) without preserved [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) function [(104)](#reference104). Type 2 diabetes mellitus: [Cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) is the leading cause of death in individuals with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia) typically associated with diabetes is characterized a combination hypertriglyceridemia ( normalize diabetic dyslipidemia and reduce [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) [risk](../glossary#risk) includes lifestyle modification and medications \u2014 particularly the use of cholesterol-lowering statins [(111, 112)](#reference111). Additionally, achieving [glucose](../glossary#glucose) control in people with type 2 diabetes has been shown to decrease the occurrence of major microvascular and macrovascular events [(113)](#reference113). A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 19 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trials), including 24,788 individuals with either impaired glucose [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) or type 2 diabetes mellitus, found that long-chain omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (doses, 360-10,000 6 weeks 6 years) lowered serum triglyceride concentrations by 0.25 mmol/L but had no substantial effect on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, or HDL-cholesterol [(114)](#reference114). There was also no significant effect on [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c), fasting glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, or a measure of endothelial function. Four trials that lasted over a year reported on cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality. The pooled analysis of these trials found no effect of supplementation with omega-3 PUFA on the risk of major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, or a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for a cardiovascular cause. It is worth noting that two of these trials \u2014 the Alpha Omega Trial [(115)](#reference115) and the ORIGIN trial [(116)](#reference116) \u2014 included a high proportion of participants who took cardiovascular medications (i.e., cholesterol-lowering statins) [(114)](#reference114). Another meta-analysis of 45 randomized controlled trials in 2,674 participants with type 2 diabetes found that supplementation with omega-3 (400-1,800 mg/day for 2 weeks to 2 years) led to small decreases in blood concentrations of triglycerides, [VLDL](../glossary#VLDL)-triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, and vLDL-cholesterol [(117)](#reference117). There was no evidence of effect on total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, non-esterified [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid), apolipoprotein-A1, and apolipoprotein-B. There circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), TNF- and IL-6, in no effect on [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure). Finally, a small decrease in HbA1c was reported in response to supplemental omega-3 fatty acids, yet there was no effect on other indicators of glycemic control, especially fasting glucose, fasting [insulin](../glossary#insulin), connecting (C-) peptide, and a measure of [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) [(117)](#reference117). Lifestyle changes involving dietary modifications, such as the substitution of healthy fats (mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids) for [saturated](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and [trans fats](../glossary#trans-fat), are recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus [(118)](#reference118). In their most recent updated recommendations on the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, the American Diabetes Association and American Heart Association found insufficient evidence from large-scale randomized trials in individuals with type 2 diabetes to support the use of omega-3 fatty acid supplements (combined with a heart-healthy diet) in the prevention of cardiovascular events [(118)](#reference118). Gestational diabetes: Poor glycemic control during pregnancy, whether due to type 1 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), type 2 diabetes, or [gestational](../glossary#gestation) diabetes, increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of fetal anomalies, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [(119)](#reference119). Diabetes during pregnancy is also associated with a higher risk of metabolic disorders in offspring later in life [(119)](#reference119). A team of investigators in Iran examined the effect of omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy, beginning at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation for six weeks, in women with gestational diabetes. Overall, there was evidence of beneficial effects of 1,000 mg/day of omega-3 alone [(120)](#reference120) on markers of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) and, to a lesser extent, on markers of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile. In one [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 60 women with gestational diabetes, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E reduced the risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia yet had no effect on the rate of cesarean section, need for [insulin](../glossary#insulin) therapy, maternal hospitalization, newborns' hospitalization, gestational age, birth size, and [Apgar score](../glossary#Apgar-score) [(122)](#reference122). Current recommendations by the American Diabetes Association for the management of gestational diabetes encourage the development of an individualized nutrition plan between a woman and a registered dietitian, highlighting the importance of the amount and type of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) in the diet [(119)](#reference119). The use of omega-3 supplements in the management of gestational diabetes is not currently under consideration. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), controlled feeding trials that substituted [LA]) for [saturated fatty acids](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) or [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) for 3 to 16 weeks in generally healthy adults showed a decrease in fasting [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentration and [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) but no effect on fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentration [(123)](#reference123). Most studies used a mixture of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA in the form of plant-derived oils such that potential differences in effect between them could not be examined. A meta-analysis of 20 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted in 10 countries, in a total of 39,740 participants free from [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) at baseline, examined [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of omega-6 intake in relation to the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus [(124)](#reference124). LA ranged from 8.3% of total [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) to [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) [esters](../glossary#ester). The lowest percentage of arachidonic acid (AA) was found in [adipose tissue ](../glossary#adipose)(0.3%) and the highest in erythrocyte phospholipids (17.0%). The highest versus lowest concentration of LA markers in each compartment (phospholipids, plasma or [serum](../glossary#serum), cholesterol esters) except adipose tissue was associated with a 35% lower risk of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, only AA in plasma or serum was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of type 2 diabetes [(124)](#reference124). If LA concentration in blood and adipose tissue can provide an objective assessment of dietary LA intake [(125)](#reference125), these results suggest that dietary LA may be important for glycemic control and diabetes prevention. A 2019 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [observational](../glossary#observational-study) (9 [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study), and 1 cohort](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study); 36,542 participants) studies showed higher concentrations of omega-3 in blood and [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose) and higher level of omega-3 intake to be associated with a lower risk of [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) [(126)](#reference126). No association was found between tissue omega-6 concentration or dietary omega-6 intake level and the risk of metabolic syndrome [(126)](#reference126). [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) is the most common cause of [dementia](../glossary#dementia) in older adults [(127)](#reference127). Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the formation of [amyloid plaque](../glossary#amyloid-plaque) in the brain and nerve cell degeneration. Disease symptoms, including memory loss and confusion, worsen over time [(128)](#reference128). Observational studies: Several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined dietary fish and [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) consumption in relation to [risks](../glossary#risk) of [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline, [dementia](../glossary#dementia), and [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease). The pooled of five large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (Three-City Study, Nurses' Health Study, Women's Health Study, Chicago Health and Aging Project, and Rush Memory and Aging Project) that followed a total of 23,688 older (ages, 65 years) participants (88% women) for 3.9 to 9.1 years found slower rates of decline in episodic memory and global [cognition](../glossary#cognition) with increasing fish intakes [(129)](#reference129). Previous studies have suggested that the effect of fish or PUFA consumption on cognition may be dependent on apolipoprotein (epsilon [2], 3, and 4), the presence of the APOE 4 (E4) allele has been associated with increased risk and earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease [(132)](#reference132). It was found that long-chain omega-3 PUFA supplementation did not increase [plasma](../glossary#plasma) omega-3 concentrations to the same extent in E4 carriers than in non-carriers [(133)](#reference133) and that DHA [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) differs in E4 carriers compared to non-carriers, with greater [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) and lower plasma concentrations in E4 carriers [(134)](#reference134). However, neither APOE genotype nor [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in 11 other [genes](../glossary#gene) associated with Alzheimer's disease were found to modify the [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between fish intake and risk of cognitive decline in the pooled analysis of the five cohorts [(129)](#reference129). In a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies, each one-serving increase of fish intake per week was found to be associated with a 5% lower risk of dementia and a 7% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease [(135)](#reference135). Dietary intake level of marine-derived DHA \u2014 but not blood DHA concentration \u2014 was also inversely associated with the risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease; for instance, a 100 mg/day increment in dietary DHA intake was associated with lower risks of dementia (-14%) and Alzheimer's disease (-37%) [(135)](#reference135). Results from two large cohort studies published after this dose-response meta-analysis showed blood DHA concentration to be positively associated with cognitive performance in adults [(136, 137)](#reference136). Findings from preclinical studies suggest that long-chain omega-3 [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) may have neuroprotective effects, potentially through [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) blood flow, and/or reducing controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of omega-3 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline in cognitively healthy older or elderly adults [(139)](#reference139). There was no evidence showing an effect of omega-3 on measures of cognitive functions in these [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). In a more recent systematic review that identified seven trials conducted in cognitively healthy participants, the authors reported positive effects of long-chain omega-3 supplementation on measures of cognitive outcomes in all studies but the second longest and the two largest trials [(140)](#reference140). Another seven trials examined the effect of long-chain omega-3 supplementation in individuals with mild cognitive impairment; all but three trials showed a significant benefit on measures of cognitive function or specific memory tasks [(140)](#reference140). Yet, two trials that found no improvement in cognitive performance included omega-3 supplements in both intervention and control arms [(141, 142)](#reference141). Overall, the data favor a role for diets rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in slowing cognitive decline, but larger trials with longer intervention periods may be necessary to see a consistent beneficial effect of omega-3 supplementation in older individuals with normal or declining cognitive functions. About one-third of US adults have [serum](../glossary#serum) [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride) >150 mg/dL, and triglycerides >200 mg/dL [(143)](#reference143). The 2011 American Heart Association guidelines on triglyceride management recommended the use of marine-derived omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) (2-4 g/day of EPA plus DHA) under medical supervision to reduce triglyceride concentrations below 100 mg/dL [(143)](#reference143). Hypertriglyceridemia can have various causes, such as inherited and acquired disorders of triglyceride [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), poor diet, and/or use of certain medications [(143)](#reference143). Several omega-3 fatty acid preparations have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia [(104)](#reference104). Out of the five currently available preparations, four contain ethyl esters of EPA and/or DHA and one contains long-chain omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) as free fatty acids [(104)](#reference104). The Epanova for lowering very high triglycerides (EVOLVE) randomized controlled trial demonstrated that the omega-3 free fatty acid formulation (2-4 g/day for 12 weeks) effectively reduced triglycerides and other [atherogenic](../glossary#atherogenic) factors, including [vLDL](../glossary#VLDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and remnant-like cholesterol particles, when compared to olive oil (4 g/day) in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides in [144](#reference144)). Omega-3 supplementation by a reduction in [lipoprotein](../glossary#lipoprotein)-associated phospholipase A2) and [platelet](../glossary#platelet) activation (as shown by a reduction in circulating concentrations of arachidonic acid) [(144, 145)](#reference144). This omega-3 formulation also proved to be effective in reducing persistent hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides, 200-499 mg/dL) in patients treated with statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) [(146)](#reference146). Statin use has been found to effectively reduce triglyceride concentrations by about 5%-20% [(147)](#reference147). However, a residual elevation in triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol may remain in a substantial fraction of patients treated with statins. Compared to 4 g/day of olive oil, omega-3 supplementation with 2 or 4 g/day for six weeks reduced triglycerides by 14.6% and 20.6% and non-HDL-cholesterol by 3.9% and 6.9%, respectively [(146)](#reference146). The magnitude of these reductions in triglyceride and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations was similar to what has been observed in other trials that examined the use of ethyl ester omega-3 supplements as add-ons to statin therapy [(146](#reference146), [148-150)](#reference148). A study is underway to assess the benefit of combining omega-3 fatty acids and statins on the risk of major [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events over a three- to five-year period in patients with hypertriglyceridemia [(144](#reference144), [151)](#reference151). Often associated with metabolic disorders, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition characterized by an excessive [lipid ](../glossary#lipid)accumulation in the liver (i.e., hepatosteatosis). NAFLD can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in about one-third of the patients with NAFLD, thereby increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) and [hepatocellular carcinoma](../glossary#hepatocellular-carcinoma) [(152, 153)](#reference152). An decline in [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) omega-3 and omega-6 disease reduce [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), a possible therapeutic strategy would be to increase dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 PUFA. A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [randomized 1,424 participants with NAFLD found that omega-3 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) showed beneficial effects on liver fat, specific liver activities, [serum](../glossary#serum) [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride), fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose), and [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) [(155)](#reference155). However, there was no evidence of an effect on total [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), [LDL](../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol, [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol, fasting [insulin](../glossary#insulin), blood pressure, [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index), and waist circumference [(155)](#reference155). Other recent meta-analyses have also reported that supplementation months) improved hepatosteatosis and other metabolic disorders in both children and adults with NAFLD (reviewed in [153](#reference153)). Additional studies are needed to examine their efficacy in more severe cases of NASH. A 2017 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 20 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 1,252 efficacy of long-chain omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) Omega-3 supplementation (0.3-9.6 g/day) for 3 to 18 months reduced the number of tender joints (14 trials), as well as early morning stiffness (15 trials) and pain level (16 trials) compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo). Blood concentrations of [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride) (3 trials) and pro-inflammatory leukotriene B4 (5 trials) were decreased with PUFA [(156)](#reference156). Another 2017 meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials examined the effect of omega-3 supplementation (mainly as fish oil) on arthritic pain in patients diagnosed with different types of arthritis [(157)](#reference157). Daily administration of marine-derived EPA (0.01-4.1 g) and DHA (0.01-2.7 g) for up to 18 months resulted in a reduction in patients' reported pain (using a visual analog scale [VAS] for pain) in those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (22 trials) and those with other types of arthritis (i.e., juvenile arthritis, psoriatic arthritis) or mixed diagnoses (3 trials), yet not in those with [osteoarthritis](../glossary#osteoarthritis) (5 trials). The evidence of an effect of omega-3 supplements in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was deemed of moderate quality [(157)](#reference157). In a 2017 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 18 trials, including 1,143 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, only 4 of 18 placebo-controlled trials showed a benefit of omega-3 PUFA supplementation (2.2-3.6 g/day for 12-36 weeks) on pain level \u2014 reported by patients and/or assessed by physicians [(158)](#reference158). In most trials, the use of medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and/or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDs]) was continued throughout the intervention period. Results of a few trials suggested that omega-3 PUFA could spare the need for anti-inflammatory medications in some patients yet failed to show superiority of PUFA in pain management [(159, 160)](#reference159). The limited body of evidence that suggests potential benefits of omega-3 supplementation in rheumatoid arthritis treatment needs strengthening with data from larger studies conducted for longer intervention periods [(157, 158)](#reference157). Crohn's disease: A 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) omega-3 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in patients with [Crohn's disease](../glossary#crohn-disease), considering the evidence base from both short-term (9 to 24 weeks) and long-term (1 year) trials [(161)](#reference161). Among five trials that evaluated the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation on relapse rates, conflicting outcomes were reported. Most trials were limited by small sample sizes and short duration \u2014 up to three years may be necessary to see an effect on relapse rates given the natural relapsing-remitting course of the disease. The two largest and most recent trials (EPIC-1 and EPIC-2) showed no significant effect of omega-3 supplementation on indicators of Crohn's disease remission compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(162)](#reference162). Other systematic reviews of the literature reached similar conclusions [(163-165)](#reference163). Three short-term trials showed positive effects of omega-3 supplementation on [plasma](../glossary#plasma) biochemical parameters (e.g., reduced [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine) expression, increased plasma EPA and DHA concentrations) compared to controls [(161)](#reference161). In spite of its impact on biochemical changes in the short-term, however, the ability of omega-3 supplementation to maintain remission or effect clinically meaningful changes in Crohn's disease is not supported by the current evidence [(164)](#reference164). Ulcerative colitis: Seven [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of fish oil [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in patients with active [ulcerative colitis](../glossary#ulcerative-colitis) reported significant improvement in at least one outcome measure, such as decreased [corticosteroid](../glossary#corticosteroid) use, improved disease activity scores, or improved [histology](../glossary#histology) scores [(163)](#reference163). In patients with inactive ulcerative colitis, omega-3 supplementation had no effect on relapse rates compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in four separate trials [(163, 165)](#reference163). While no serious side effects were reported in any trials of fish oil supplementation for the maintenance or remission of [inflammatory bowel disease](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease), diarrhea and upper [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms occurred with treatment (AA; 20:4n-6) are thought to play an important role in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of [asthma](../glossary#asthma) [(32)](#reference32). Because increasing omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) intake has been found to decrease the formation of AA-derived leukotrienes, a number of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on asthma. Although there is some evidence that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can decrease the production of inflammatory mediators in asthmatic patients [(166, 167)](#reference166), evidence that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation decreases the clinical severity of asthma in controlled trials has been inconsistent [(168)](#reference168). Three [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) fatty acid supplementation in asthmatic adults and children found no consistent effects on clinical outcome measures, including pulmonary function tests, asthmatic symptoms, medication use, or bronchial hyperreactivity [(169-171)](#reference169). Immunoglobulin A (IgA) [nephropathy](../glossary#nephropathy) is a kidney disorder that results from the deposition of IgA in the [glomeruli](../glossary#glomerulus) of the kidneys. The cause of IgA nephropathy is not clear, but progressive [renal](../glossary#renal) failure may eventually develop in 15%-40% of patients [(172)](#reference172). Since glomerular IgA deposition results production of [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) mediators, omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) could potentially modulate the inflammatory response and preserve renal function. A 2012 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) assessed the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on adult IgA nephropathy [(173)](#reference173). Five [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) were included in an analysis involving 239 patients (mean age, 37-41 years) who received [placebo](../glossary#placebo) or supplemental EPA + DHA at doses of 1.4 to 5.1 g/day for 6 to 24 months. Compared with control groups, omega-3 supplementation had no significant effect on urine [protein](../glossary#protein) [excretion](../glossary#excretion) or glomerular filtration rate. Only two trials measured changes in [serum](../glossary#serum) creatinine (a marker of renal function) and end-stage renal disease \u2014 omega-3 treatment had a beneficial effect on these two parameters in both trials. No adverse events associated with omega-3 supplementation were reported in any of the trials. A more recent review of the literature identified six trials showing evidence of omega-3 supplementation slowing IgA nephropathy disease progression and three trials reporting no effect [(174)](#reference174). Additionally, preliminary data suggested that the potential synergistic actions of aspirin and long-chain omega-3 PUFAs might constitute a promising treatment option [(168)](#reference168). Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) refer to three neurodevelopmental disorders of variable severity, namely autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive development disorder. ASD are characterized by abnormal information processing in the brain due to alterations in the way [nerve cells](../glossary#neuron) and their [synapses](../glossary#synapse) connect and organize. ASD are thought to have a strong genetic basis, yet environmental factors including diet may play an important role. Given that omega-3 and omega-6 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) are necessary for [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) growth and synapse formation (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)), they may be of significant benefit in the prevention and/or management of ASD. This is supported by observations of PUFA abnormalities in blood of children with ASD, when compared to their peers with no neurodevelopmental disorders [(175)](#reference175). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) reported lower blood concentrations of DHA and EPA in children with ASD compared to typically developing children; yet, the ratio of total omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids was similar between children with and without ASD symptoms [(176)](#reference176). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) by the same authors identified six [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of primarily long-chain omega-3 PUFA on ASD symptoms [(176)](#reference176). All the studies included children; one study also included adults 28 years [(177)](#reference177). Four trials used EPA (0.70-0.84 g/day) plus DHA (0.46-0.70 g/day) [(178-181)](#reference178), one trial used DHA (0.24 g/day) plus AA (0.24 g/day) [(177)](#reference177), and one trial only used only DHA (0.20 g/day) [(182)](#reference182). A pooled analysis of four [(177-180)](#reference177) of these trials, including a total of 107 participants, showed a small improvement in measures of social interaction and repetitive and restrictive interests and behaviors with long-chain PUFA supplementation for 6 to 16 weeks; however, there was no effect on measures of communication and ASD co-existing conditions, such as hyperactivity, irritability, sensory issues, and [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms [(176)](#reference176). Two additional systematic reviews and meta-analyses, also published in 2017, identified the same set of trials. One meta-analysis suggested a benefit of long-chain PUFA on measures of lethargy and stereotypy but found no overall clinical improvement compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(183)](#reference183). The other meta-analysis suggested an improvement regarding lethargy yet a worsening of externalizing behavior and social skills in children supplemented with omega-3 PUFA [(184)](#reference184). The available evidence is based on few trials of small sample sizes and is thus too limited to draw firm conclusions regarding the potential benefit of long-chain PUFA supplementation in ASD management. Data from [ecologic studies](../glossary#ecologic-study) across different countries suggested an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between seafood consumption and national rates of major depression [(185)](#reference185) and [bipolar disorder](../glossary#bipolar-disorder) [(186)](#reference186). Several small studies have found [fatty be lower in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [(187-189)](#reference187) and [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose) [(190)](#reference190) of individuals suffering from depression compared to controls. Although it is not known how omega-3 fatty acid intake affects the incidence of depression, modulation of [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways and [eicosanoid](../glossary#eicosanoid) production have been proposed as possible mechanisms [(191)](#reference191). There may be some benefit of omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on depressive disorders, but it is difficult to compare studies and draw conclusions due to great [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among the trials [(192, 193)](#reference192). Small sample sizes, lack of standardization of therapeutic doses, type of omega-3 PUFA administered, co-treatment with pharmacological agents, and diagnostic criteria vary among the trials. A 2012 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of all published [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) investigated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the prevention and treatment of several types of depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders [(192)](#reference192). With respect to major depression, most studies reported a positive effect of omega-3 supplements on depressive symptoms, though efficacy is still considered inconclusive given the great variability among trials. A few themes emerged from this review: more trials reported positive effect for omega-3 PUFA supplements as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to pharmacological treatment; in [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) trials, EPA alone was more effective than DHA alone; and in combination trials, positive effects were more likely if an EPA:DHA ratio of >1.5-2.0 was administered. A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) grouped trials by type of diagnosis of depression [(194)](#reference194). A positive effect of omega-3 supplementation was found in 11 trials in participants with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM] criteria). Omega-3 supplementation also appeared to be effective in the pooled analysis of eight trials in participants not formally diagnosed with major depressive disorder, i.e., adults with depressive symptoms despite ongoing treatment, untreated patients with mild-to-severe depressed mood, patients with a history of at least one major depressive episode, women with borderline personality disorder, patients with recurrent self-harm, and postmenopausal women with psychological distress and depressive symptoms. There was no mood improvement with omega-3 supplements in generally healthy adults experiencing depressive symptoms, as suggested by the pooled analysis of six trials [(194)](#reference194). Finally, a 2017 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials reported a small benefit of omega-3 supplementation on depressive symptoms when compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo), yet the evidence was deemed of very low quality and the positive effect was judged likely to be [biased](../glossary#bias) and not clinically significant [(195)](#reference195). Unipolar depression and bipolar disorder are considered distinct psychiatric conditions, although major depression occurs in both. A 2016 meta-analysis of eight [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) that compared the PUFA composition of red blood [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) between patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects showed abnormally low red blood cell DHA concentrations with bipolar disorder [(196)](#reference196). As with major depression, reviews of trials indicated that omega-3 supplementation may have a positive effect as an adjunct to therapy in patients with bipolar disorder [(192, 194)](#reference192). Additionally, a 2016 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trial in 100 participants with bipolar disorder reported a reduction in the severity of manic episodes with daily supplementation of 1,000 mg omega-3 PUFA for three months [(197)](#reference197). While there is some promising evidence for the use of omega-3 fatty acids for major depression and bipolar disorder, additional trials that account for dietary omega-3 intake, changes in red blood cell PUFA concentrations, the ratio of EPA:DHA provided, and co-treatment with medications are necessary. A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 studies compared the [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) composition of red blood [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) in patients with [schizophrenia](../glossary#schizophrenia) to individuals without the disorder [(198)](#reference198). The majority of studies investigated medicated patients, though the authors separated the analysis into three groups of patients at time of measurement in order to account for possible [confounding](../glossary#confounder) from pharmacologic agents: antipsychotic-medicated, antipsychotic-na\u00efve, and antipsychotic-free. Overall, decreased concentrations of DPA, DHA, and AA in red blood cell membranes were associated with the schizophrenic state. Several mechanisms may account for PUFA abnormalities in schizophrenia, such as altered [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), or changes in diet consequent behavior. The use of long-chain omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) to alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia or to mitigate adverse effects of antipsychotic medications has been investigated in a number of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) [(194](#reference194), [199)](#reference199). In a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 50 subjects with recent onset of schizophrenia who were medicated, daily supplementation with EPA (740 mg) and DHA (400 mg) reduced psychotic symptoms (assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) only in those who were not taking the [anxiolytic](../glossary#anxiolytic), lorazepam (Ativan) [(200)](#reference200). Overall, however, there was no effect of long-chain PUFA supplements on schizophrenia symptoms. Yet, given the high safety profile of fish oil supplements and some evidence of a positive effect of EPA supplementation in a subset of trials, some clinicians may consider EPA a useful [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to antipsychotic therapy in patients with schizophrenia. Several mechanisms suggest that omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may improve the [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) performance of individuals with [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) and other types of [dementia](../glossary#dementia). In particular, the [antioxidative](../glossary#antioxidant) and anti- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) properties of these PUFA may help protect [neurons](../glossary#neuron), promote [synaptic plasticity](../glossary#synaptic-plasticity), and limit cellular death. The PUFA composition of the diet appears to influence blood [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), which may play a role in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of Alzheimer's disease. However, the current evidence from [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) is not supportive of omega-3 supplementation in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in humans. A 2016 Cochrane review identified three [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease of mild-to-moderate severity [(201)](#reference201). These trials compared daily supplementation with DHA (between 675 mg and 1,700 mg) and EPA (between 600 mg and 975 mg) to a placebo for 12 months [(202, 203)](#reference202) or 18 months [(204)](#reference204). Of note, the study by Quinn et al. [(204)](#reference204) also included 4 mg/day of [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) (used as preservative \u2014 see also [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)) in the intervention arm, and the study by Freund-Levi et al. [(202)](#reference202) included DHA (900-1,100 mg/day) but no EPA. The pooled analysis of these trials showed no beneficial effect of omega-3 supplementation on measures of global and specific cognitive functions, measures of functional outcomes, and measures of dementia severity [(201)](#reference201). There was no difference between intervention and placebo arms regarding the occurrence of adverse effects [(201)](#reference201). Humans can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) arachidonic acid (AA) from linoleic acid (LA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DHA) from -linolenic acid (ALA) through a series of desaturation and elongation reactions. EPA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) are also obtained from the retroconversion of DHA (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Due to low conversion efficiency, it is advised to obtain EPA and DHA from additional sources. Linoleic acid (LA): Food sources of LA include vegetable oils, such as soybean, safflower, and corn oil; [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts); seeds; and some vegetables. Dietary surveys in the US indicate that the average adult intake of LA ranges from 17 to 20 g/day for men and 12 to 13 g/day for women [(78)](#reference78). Some foods that are rich in LA are listed in Table 2. |Food||Serving||Linoleic Acid (g)| |Safflower oil||1 tablespoon|| | 5.6 Arachidonic acid: Animals, but not plants, can convert LA to AA. Therefore, AA is absent in vegetable oils and fats and present in small amounts in meat, poultry, and eggs. -Linolenic acid (ALA): Flaxseeds, walnuts, and their oils are among the richest dietary sources of ALA. Canola oil is also an excellent source of ALA. Dietary surveys in the US indicate that average adult intakes for ALA range from 1.8 to 2.0 g/day for men and from 1.4 to 1.5 g/day for women [(78)](#reference78). Some foods that are rich in ALA are listed in Table 3. |Food||Serving||-Linolenic acid (g)| |Flaxseed oil||1 acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA): Dietary surveys in the US indicate that average adult intakes of EPA range from 0.03 to 0.06 g/day, and average adult intakes of DHA range from 0.05 to 0.10 g/day [(78)](#reference78). Oily fish are the major dietary source of EPA and DHA; omega-3 fatty acid-enriched eggs are also available in the US. Some foods that are rich in EPA and DHA are listed in Table 4. |Food||Serving||EPA (g)||DHA (g)|| Amount Providing | 1 g of EPA + DHA |Herring, Pacific||3 ounces*|| | 1.06 | | 0.75 | | 1.5 ounces |Salmon, chinook||3 ounces|| | 0.86 | | 0.62 | | ounces |Sardines, Pacific||3 ounces|| | 0.45 | | 0.74 | | 2.5 ounces |Salmon, Atlantic||3 ounces|| | 0.28 | | 0.95 | | 2.5 ounces |Oysters, Pacific||3 ounces|| | 0.75 | | 0.43 | | 2.5 ounces |Salmon, sockeye||3 ounces|| | 0.45 | | 0.60 | | 3 ounces |Trout, rainbow||3 ounces|| | 0.40 | | 0.44 | | 3.5 ounces |Tuna, canned, white||3 ounces|| | 0.20 | | 0.54 | | 4 ounces |Crab, Dungeness||3 ounces|| | 0.24 | | 0.10 | | 9 ounces |Tuna, canned, light||3 ounces|| | 0.04 | | 0.19 | | 12 ounces |*A three-ounce serving of fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| Borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, and black currant seed oil are rich in -linolenic acid (GLA; 18:3n-6) and are often marketed as GLA or essential fatty acid (EFA) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) [(206)](#reference206). Flaxseed oil (also known as flax oil or linseed oil) is available as an ALA [supplement](../glossary#supplement). A number of fish oils are marketed as omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) supplements. The omega-3 fatty acids from natural fish oil are in the [triglyceride](../glossary#triglyceride) form, often with only one of three attached fatty acids an omega-3; thus, up to 70% of fatty acids provided may be other types [(3)](#reference3). Ethyl esters of EPA and DHA (ethyl-EPA and ethyl-DHA) are concentrated sources of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that provide more EPA and DHA per gram of oil. Krill oil contains both EPA and DHA and is considered comparable to fish oil as a source of these long-chain [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) [(207)](#reference207). Cod liver oil is also a rich source of EPA and DHA, but some cod liver oil preparations may contain excessive amounts of preformed [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) (retinol) and from algal and fungal sources are also available. Because dietary DHA can be retroconverted to EPA and DPA in humans, DHA supplementation represents yet another alternative to fish oil supplements (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). The content of EPA and DHA varies in each of these preparations, making it necessary to read product labels in order to determine the EPA and DHA levels provided by a particular supplement. All omega-3 fatty acid supplements are absorbed more efficiently with meals. Dividing one's daily dose into two or three smaller doses throughout the day will decrease the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects (see [Safety](#safety)). In 2001, the FDA began permitting the addition of DHA and AA to infant formula in the United States [(208)](#reference208). Presently, manufacturers are not required to list the amounts of DHA and AA added to infant formula on the label. However, most infant formula manufacturers provide this information. The amounts added to formulas in the US range from 8 to 17 mg DHA/100 calories (5 fl oz) and from 16 to 34 mg AA/100 calories. For example, an infant drinking 20 fl oz of DHA-enriched formula daily would receive 32 to 68 mg/day of DHA and 64 to 136 mg/day of AA. [Supplemental](../glossary#supplement) -linolenic acid is generally well tolerated, and serious adverse side effects have not been observed at doses up to 2.8 g/day for 12 months [(209)](#reference209). High doses of borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, or black currant seed oil may cause [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) upset, loose stools, or diarrhea [(206)](#reference206). Because of [case reports](../glossary#case-report) that supplementation with evening primrose oil induced in people with undiagnosed temporal lobe [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) [(210)](#reference210), people with a history of seizures or a seizure disorder are generally advised to avoid evening primrose oil and other -linolenic acid-rich oils [(206)](#reference206). Although flaxseed oil is generally well tolerated, high doses may cause loose stools or diarrhea [(211)](#reference211). Allergic and [anaphylactic](../glossary#anaphylaxis) reactions have been reported with flaxseed and flaxseed oil ingestion [(212)](#reference212). Serious adverse reactions have not been reported in those using fish oil or other EPA and DHA [supplements](../glossary#supplement). The most common adverse effect of fish oil or EPA and DHA supplements is a fishy aftertaste. Belching and heartburn have also been reported. Additionally, high doses may cause nausea and loose stools. Potential for excessive bleeding: The potential for high omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) intakes, especially EPA and DHA, to prolong bleeding times has been well studied and may play a role in the cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids. Although excessively long bleeding times and increased incidence of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) have been observed in Greenland Eskimos with very high intakes of EPA + DHA (6.5 g/day), it is not known whether high intakes of EPA and DHA are the only factor responsible for these observations [(1)](#references). The US FDA has ruled that intakes up to 3 g/day of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for inclusion in the diet, and available evidence suggests that intakes less than 3 g/day are unlikely to result in clinically significant bleeding [(107)](#reference107). Although the US Institute of Medicine did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for omega-3 fatty acids, caution was advised with the use of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) EPA and DHA, especially in those who are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of excessive bleeding (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions) and [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)) [(1](#references), [206)](#reference206). Potential for immune system suppression: Although the suppression of [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) responses resulting from increased omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) intakes may benefit individuals diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease), anti-inflammatory doses of omega-3 fatty acids could decrease the potential of the immune system to destroy [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) [(213)](#reference213). Studies comparing measures of immune cell function outside the body (ex vivo) at baseline and after [supplementing](../glossary#supplement) people with omega-3 fatty acids, mainly EPA and DHA, have demonstrated immunosuppressive effects at doses as low as 0.9 g/day for EPA and 0.6 g/day for DHA [(1)](#references). Although it is not clear if these findings translate to impaired immune responses [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo), caution should be observed when considering omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in individuals with compromised immune systems. Potential other effects: Although fish oil supplements are unlikely to affect [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis), people with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) who are considering fish oil supplements should inform their physician and be monitored if they choose to take them [(206)](#reference206). In early studies of DHA-enriched infant formula, EPA- and DHA-rich fish oil was used as a source of DHA. However, some preterm infants receiving fish oil-enriched formula had decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) AA concentrations, which were associated with decreased weight (but not length and head circumference) [(214, 215)](#reference214). This effect was attributed to the potential for high concentrations of EPA to interfere with the synthesis of AA, which is essential for normal growth. Consequently, EPA was removed and AA was added to DHA-enriched formula. Currently available infant formulas in the US contain only AA and DHA derived from algal or fungal sources, rather than fish oil. [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have not found any adverse effects on growth in infants fed formulas enriched with AA and DHA for up to one year [(216)](#reference216). The safety of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) omega-3 and omega-6 [fatty borage seed primrose oil, black currant seed oil, and flaxseed oil, has not been established in pregnant or lactating (breast-feeding) women [(217)](#reference217). Studies of fish oil supplementation during pregnancy and lactation have not reported any serious adverse effects, but use of omega-6/omega-3 [PUFA](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid)-containing supplements and fish oil supplements in pregnant or nursing women should be monitored by a physician (see [Contaminants in fish](#contaminants-fish) and [Contaminants in supplements](#contaminants-supplements)) [(206)](#reference206). Some species of fish may contain significant levels of methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or other environmental contaminants [(218)](#reference218). In general, larger predatory fish, such as swordfish, tend to contain the highest levels of these contaminants. Removing the skin, fat, and internal organs of the fish prior to cooking and allowing the fat to drain from the fish while it cooks will decrease exposure to a number of fat-soluble pollutants, such as PCBs [(219)](#reference219). However, methylmercury is found throughout the muscle of fish, so these cooking precautions will not reduce exposure to methylmercury. Organic mercury compounds are toxic and excessive exposure can cause brain and kidney damage. The developing fetus, infants, and young children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of mercury on the brain. In order to limit their exposure to methylmercury, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency have formulated joint recommendations for women who may become pregnant, pregnant women, breast-feeding women, and parents. These recommendations are presented in Table 5. For more information about the FDA/Environmental Protection Agency advisory for pregnant women and parents of young children on eating fish, see their [online brochure](https://www.fda.gov/food/metals/mercury-levels-commercial-fish-and-shellfish-1990-2012). More information about mercury levels in commercial fish and shellfish is available from the FDA. Of note, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend the consumption of salmon, anchovies, herring, shad, sardines, Pacific oysters, trout, and Atlantic and Pacific mackerel (not king mackerel), which are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in methylmercury [(220)](#reference220). Although concerns have been raised regarding the potential for omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) derived from fish oil to contain methylmercury, PCBs, and dioxins, several independent laboratory analyses in the US have found commercially available omega-3 fatty acid supplements to be free of methylmercury, PCBs, and dioxins [(221)](#reference221). The absence of methylmercury in omega-3 fatty acid supplements can be explained by the fact that mercury accumulates in the muscle, rather than the fat of fish [(107)](#reference107). In general, fish body oils contain lower concentrations of PCBs and other fat-soluble contaminants than fish liver oils. Additionally, fish oils that have been more highly refined and deodorized contain lower concentrations of PCBs [(222)](#reference222). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids, potentially hepatotoxic and [carcinogenic](../glossary#carcinogen) compounds, are found in various parts of the borage plant. People who take borage oil supplements should use products that are certified free of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids [(206)](#reference206). |1.

When adding more fish to your diet, be sure to stay within your calorie needs.| -Linolenic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement), such as evening primrose oil or borage seed oil, may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [seizures](../glossary#seizure) in people on phenothiazines (neuroleptic agents), such as chlorpromazine [(210)](#reference210). High doses of black currant seed oil, borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, flaxseed oil, and fish oil may inhibit [platelet](../glossary#platelet) aggregation; therefore, these supplements should be used with caution in people on [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) medications [(206)](#reference206). In particular, people taking fish oil or long-chain omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) (EPA and DHA) supplements in prothrombin time assay ( [international normalized ratio](../glossary#international-normalized-ratio) [INR]). One small study found that 3 g/day or 6 g/day of fish oil did not affect INR values in 10 patients on warfarin over a four-week period [(223)](#reference223). However, a [case report](../glossary#case-report) described an individual who required a reduction of her warfarin dose when she doubled her fish oil dose from 1 g/day to 2 g/day [(224)](#reference224). Outside the body, [vitamin important role in preventing the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of PUFA. Inside the body, results of animal studies and limited data in humans suggest that the amount of vitamin E required to prevent [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) increases with the amount of PUFA consumed [(225)](#reference225). One widely used recommendation for vitamin E intake is 0.6 mg of -tocopherol per gram of dietary PUFA. This recommendation was based on a small study in men and the ratio of -tocopherol to LA in the US diet and has not been verified in more comprehensive studies. Although EPA and DHA are easily oxidized outside the body, it is presently unclear whether they are more susceptible to [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) within the body [(226)](#reference226). High vitamin E intakes have not been found to decrease [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of oxidative damage when EPA and DHA intakes are increased [(227, 228)](#reference227), but some experts believe that an increase in PUFA intake, particularly omega-3 PUFA intake, should be accompanied by an increase in vitamin E intake [(1)](#references). The Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) has established adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) for omega-6 and present in human milk can contribute to the AI for infants. # LA, 0.5 |Infants||7-12 months||ALA, EPA, DHA|| | 0.5 | | 0.5 |Children||1-3 years||ALA|| | 0.7 | | 0.7 |Children||4-8 years||ALA|| | 0.9 | | 0.9 |Children||9-13 years||ALA|| | 1.2 | | 1.0 |Adolescents||14-18 years||ALA|| | 1.6 | | 1.1 |Adults||19 years and older||ALA|| | 1.6 | | 1.1 |Pregnancy||all ages||ALA|| | - | | 1.4 |Breast-feeding||all ages||ALA|| | - | | 1.3 |*All omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids present in human milk can contribute to the AI for infants. ALA, -linolenic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid.| Given the established health benefits of consuming at least two servings of oily fish per week, providing approximately 400 to 500 mg EPA + DHA, some researchers have proposed that the US Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) establish dietary reference intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for EPA + DHA [(27)](#reference27). For now, there are no DRIs for EPA and DHA specifically. Because maternal dietary intake of long-chain PUFA determines the DHA status of the newborn, several expert panels in the US recommend that pregnant and lactating women consume at least 200 mg DHA per day, close to the amount recommended for adults in general (250 mg/day) [(70](#reference70), [229)](#reference229). The potential benefits associated with obtaining long-chain omega-3 [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) through moderate consumption of fish (e.g., 1-2 servings weekly) during pregnancy and lactation outweigh any risks of contaminant exposure, though fish with high concentrations of methylmercury should be avoided [(218)](#reference218). For information about contaminants in fish and guidelines for fish consumption by women of childbearing age, see [Contaminants in fish](#contaminants-fish). The [2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/) provide recommendations for nutritional goals for linoleic acid and -linolenic acid based on the [DRIs](../glossary#DRI) (see [Tables 6 and 7](#table-6)). Seafood, [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), seeds, and oils, which are all part of healthy dietary patterns, provide essential fatty acids. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provide dietary recommendations regarding the amounts of these foods for those who choose to follow a healthy US-style eating pattern, a healthy Mediterranean-style eating pattern, or a healthy vegetarian eating pattern (Table 8). |Food||Healthy Eating Patterns| |US-style||Mediterranean-style||Vegetarian| |Seafood (oz-eq/week)||8||15||-| |5||5||7| |Oils (g/week)||27||27||27| | *Recommendations for total daily energy needs of 2,000 calories per day. Estimates of daily calorie needs according to age, gender, and physical activity can be found in the Appendix 2 of the '2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans' report | Oz-eq, ounce-equivalent The American Heart Association recommends that people without documented [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) eat a variety of fish (preferably oily) at least twice weekly [(230)](#reference230). Two servings of oily fish provide approximately 500 mg of EPA plus DHA. Pregnant women and children should avoid fish that typically have higher levels of methylmercury (see [Contaminants in fish](#contaminants-fish)). People with documented CHD and those with [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) without preserved left [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) function are advised to consume approximately 1 g/day of EPA + DHA preferably from oily fish, or to consider EPA + DHA supplements in consultation with a physician [(104](#reference104), [107)](#reference107). Patients who need to lower [serum](../glossary#serum) [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride) may take 2 to 4 g/day of EPA + DHA supplements under a physician's care (see [Hypertriglyceridemia](#hypertriglyceridemia-treatment)). Upon request of the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) proposed adequate intakes (AI) for the essential [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) LA and ALA, as well as the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA [(231)](#reference231). EFSA recommends an LA intake of 4% of total energy and an ALA intake of 0.5% of total energy; an AI of 250 mg/day is recommended for EPA plus DHA [(232)](#reference232). The European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends that pregnant and lactating women consume an additional 100 to 200 mg of preformed DHA on top of the 250 mg/day EPA plus DHA recommended for healthy adults [(231)](#reference231). For adults, the World Health Organization recommends an acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for omega-6 fatty acid intake of 2.5%-9% of energy and for omega-3 fatty acid intake of 0.5%-2% of energy [(233)](#reference233). Their AMDR for EPA plus DHA is 0.25 to 2 g/day (the upper level applying to secondary prevention of [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease)). The International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids (ISSFAL) recommends healthy adults have an LA intake of 2% energy, an ALA intake of 0.7% energy, and a minimum of 500 mg/day of EPA plus DHA for cardiovascular health [(234)](#reference234). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the AI for the essential fatty acids (see [Tables 6 and 7](#table-6)) and recommends that generally healthy adults increase their intake of long-chain omega-3 [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) by eating fish twice weekly and consuming foods rich in ALA, such as walnuts, flaxseeds, and flaxseed or canola oil. If you don't regularly consume fish, consider taking a two-gram fish oil [supplement](../glossary#supplement) several times a week. If you are prone to bleeding or take [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs, consult your physician.

Contents All dietary fibers are resistant to digestion in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine), meaning they arrive intact in the large intestine [(1)](#references). Although most fibers are [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), one important factor that determines their susceptibility to digestion by human [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) is the conformation of the chemical bonds between sugar molecules (glycosidic bonds). Humans lack digestive enzymes capable of [hydrolyzing](../glossary#hydrolysis) (breaking apart) most -glycosidic bonds, which explains why amylose, a [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [polymer](../glossary#polymer) with -1,4 glycosidic bonds, is digestible by human enzymes, while cellulose, a glucose polymer with -1,4 glycosidic bonds, is indigestible (Figure 1). Although nutritional scientists and clinicians generally agree that a healthy diet should include plenty of fiber-rich foods, agreement on the actual definition of fiber has been more difficult to achieve [(2-4)](#reference2). In the 1970s, dietary fiber was defined as remnants of plant cells that are resistant to digestion by human [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) [(5)](#reference5). This definition includes a component of some plant cell walls called lignin, as well as indigestible [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) found in plants. However, this definition omits indigestible carbohydrates derived from animal sources (e.g., chitin) and synthetic (e.g., fructooligosaccharides, polydextrose, wheat dextrin) and carbohydrates that are inaccessible to human digestive enzymes (e.g., resistant starch) [(6)](#reference6). These compounds share many of the characteristics of fiber present in plant foods. Before establishing intake recommendations for fiber in 2001, a panel of experts convened by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) developed definitions of fiber that made a distinction between fiber that occurs naturally in plant foods (dietary fiber) and isolated or synthetic fibers that may be added to foods or used as dietary [supplements](../glossary#supplement) (functional fiber) [(4)](#reference4). However, these distinctions are controversial, and there are other classification systems for dietary fiber (see [Other classification systems](#classification-systems) below). According to the Institute of Medicine's definition, functional fiber \"consists of isolated, nondigestible [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) that have beneficial physiological effects in humans\" [(4)](#reference4). Functional fibers may be nondigestible carbohydrates that have been isolated or extracted from a natural plant or animal source, or they may be manufactured or synthesized. However, designation as a functional fiber by the Institute of Medicine requires the presentation of sufficient evidence of physiological benefit in humans. Fibers identified as potential functional fibers by the Institute of Medicine include: Total fiber is defined by the Institute of Medicine as \"the sum of dietary fiber and functional fiber\" [(4)](#reference4). Fibers can be classified into four clinically meaningful categories according to their physiochemical properties, i.e., their [solubility](../glossary#soluble), viscosity, and [fermentability](../glossary#fermentation) (reviewed in [11](#reference11)): E.g., -glucans from oats and barley, raw guar gum [Soluble](../glossary#soluble) fibers dissolve in water, while [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fibers do not. Viscous fibers thicken in the presence of water, forming very viscous solutions or even visco-elastic gels. [Fermentable](../glossary#fermentation) fibers are readily [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) by the gut [microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) (i.e., [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally colonize the [large intestine](../glossary#large-intestine)). Fermentation of fiber results in the formation of short-chain [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) and gases [(1)](#references). Short-chain fatty acids can be absorbed and metabolized to produce energy. Interestingly, the preferred energy source for colonocytes ( [epithelial](../glossary#epithelium) cells that line the colon) is butyrate. Fermentation of fiber is estimated to contribute up to 10% of daily energy intake [(12)](#reference12). Fibers that are fermentable and can stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial gut bacteria are called [prebiotic](../glossary#prebiotic) fibers [(13)](#reference13). Fibers that are soluble, viscous, and fermentable have been shown to improve glycemic control and to lower blood [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentration. However, their water-holding capacity is lost when they are fermented in the colon such that they have no laxative effect (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). E.g., psyllium These fibers can dissolve in water and form viscous gels. They can improve glycemic control and lower blood [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentration. In addition, they retain their water-holding/gel-forming capacity in the [large intestine](../glossary#large-intestine) since they are resistant to fermentation. As a consequence, they can exert a stool-normalizing effect, preventing constipation or softening hard stool as well as firming loose/liquid stool in diarrhea and incontinence inulin, wheat dextrin, oligosaccharides, resistant starches Although these fibers can dissolve in water, they cannot provide any health benefits associated with fiber viscosity. They are fully [fermented](../glossary#fermentation) and thus do not exert a laxative effect. They can nonetheless exert a [prebiotic](../glossary#prebiotic) effect by influencing the composition of the gut [microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota). [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) studies have shown inulin to selectively stimulate the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) of beneficial [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) and limit the growth of potentially [pathogenic](../glossary#pathogen) bacteria ) (see [Isolated fibers and supplements](#isolated-fibers-supplements)) (reviewed in [14](#reference14)). However, no health benefit is currently associated with this fiber-driven prebiotic effect. E.g., wheat bran, cellulose, lignin These fibers do not dissolve in water, do not trap water, and are poorly [fermented](../glossary#fermentation). Large/coarse fiber particles can have a laxative effect. They can irritate the [large intestine](../glossary#large-intestine) mucosa and trigger the secretion of mucus and water, which increases the water content of stools. Small, insoluble fiber particles (e.g., finely ground wheat bran) have no laxative effect and can actually have a constipating effect by adding only to the dry stool mass (see [Improving regularity in stool elimination](#improving-regularity-stool-elimination)). Some, but not all, fibers can improve blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) abnormalities observed in conditions like [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia), overweight/ [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and with highly viscous fibers (i.e., gel-forming [soluble](../glossary#soluble) fibers), such as high molecular weight (MW) -glucan (found in oat bran), raw guar gum, and psyllium, has been shown to decrease total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations when compared to appropriate controls (e.g., fiber-free supplement, low-fiber supplement, or supplementation with [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fiber) [(15)](#reference15). A 2009 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that combined the results of 21 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 1,717 participants with hypercholesterolemia found dose- and time-dependent reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol with psyllium supplementation (3.0-20.4 g/day for >2 weeks) [(16)](#reference16). Additionally, results from two trials showed that, compared to [statins](../glossary#statin) alone, combining psyllium and statins resulted in larger reductions in LDL-cholesterol concentrations in individuals with hypercholesterolemia [(17)](#reference17). Another more recent meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials examined the cholesterol-lowering effect of psyllium fiber on LDL-cholesterol, non- [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) [(18)](#reference18) \u2014 non-HDL-cholesterol and apo B appear to better predict cardiovascular events than LDL-cholesterol [(19)](#reference19). Supplementation with psyllium at a median dose of 10.2 g/day and for a median of eight weeks to participants with or without hypercholesterolemia reduced LDL-cholesterol by and apo B by 0.05 g/L (9 trials; 895 participants) [(18)](#reference18). Despite considerable [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) across studies, the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of other highly viscous fibers, including -glucans from oat or barley and glucomannan (a hemicellulose), was also reported in recent meta-analyses of trials conducted by one research team [(20-22)](#reference20). The cholesterol-lowering effect of soluble fibers, such as psyllium and -glucan, is directly linked to their high viscosity. Reduction of the gel-forming capacity of these fibers with pressure and/or heat during processing leads to the loss of their cholesterol lowering capacity [(23)](#reference23). Accordingly, low-viscosity soluble fibers (e.g., gum arabic/acacia gum, wheat dextrin), and insoluble fibers (e.g., wheat bran) do not decrease [serum](../glossary#serum) cholesterol at physiologic levels [(15)](#reference15). Highly viscous fibers can trap [bile](../glossary#bile) that is released in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) in response to a meal to assist the digestion and absorption of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid). The main mechanism underlying the cholesterol-lowering effect of these fibers is thus linked to their ability to prevent the reabsorption of bile in the terminal [ileum](../glossary#ileum) and facilitate its elimination in the stool. In order to maintain sufficient bile for digestion, hepatocytes must increase LDL-cholesterol clearance to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) more bile acids as cholesterol is a component of bile [(15)](#reference15). These findings led the FDA to approve health claims in relation to the prevention of heart disease on labels of low cholesterol/ [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) foods containing 0.75 g/serving of -glucan from whole oat or barley or 1.7 g/serving of psyllium (see also [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)) [(24)](#reference24). As with [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) lowering, the efficacy of fiber on glycemic control is dependent on viscosity. A 2017 review of 14 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) showed that none of the examined (i.e., inulin, oligofructose) could lead to reductions in and/or fasting blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations [(15)](#reference15). Supplementation with [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fiber also failed to improve glycemic control in subjects with elevated fasting blood glucose concentrations [(25)](#reference25). In contrast, the capacity of dietary viscous fiber [(26, 27)](#reference26) and isolated viscous fibers [(28-31)](#reference28) to improve glycemic control has been demonstrated in numerous controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) conducted over three decades [(15)](#reference15). A 2015 review of the efficacy of psyllium showed evidence of reductions in postprandial blood glucose concentration following a single meal in people with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) (6 studies) as well as in nondiabetic/ [euglycemic](../glossary#euglycemia) subjects (11 studies) [(32)](#reference32). Supplementation with psyllium also resulted in reductions in postprandial blood [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentrations in subjects without type 2 diabetes (6 studies) but not in those with type 2 diabetes (3 studies). Longer-term studies of psyllium supplementation also found reductions in mean fasting glucose (4 studies) and mean [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) ( [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c); 3 studies) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Finally, while there was no effect of long-term exposure to psyllium on fasting glucose concentration in healthy individuals with euglycemia (14 studies), the glycemic benefit of psyllium was found to increase proportionally with the increase of baseline fasting glucose concentration (reviewed in [32](#reference32)). The role of soluble viscous fibers on glycemic control is related to their ability to increase [chyme](../glossary#chyme) viscosity, thereby slowing the degradation of complex nutrients and allowing the absorption of nutrients, including glucose, along the entire [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) rather than in the upper small intestine. Absorption of nutrients in the distal ileum has been associated with a reduction in gastric emptying and intestinal transit \u2014 through a distal to proximal feedback mechanism \u2014 which in turn reduces hunger and food intake (reviewed in [15](#reference15)). Nutrient delivery in the distal ileum also triggers the release of short-lived glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) into the circulation. GLP-1 improves insulin secretion by [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) -cells in response to glucose absorption and is involved in the regulation of food intake at the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) level [(33)](#reference33). An analysis of 2004-2014 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 18,433 participants found [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between either total, cereal, or vegetable fiber intake and the odds of [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) (defined according to new 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines; [34](#reference34)). A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 22 randomized control trials that examined the effect of isolated [soluble](../glossary#soluble) fiber [supplements](../glossary#supplement) or diets enriched with soluble viscous fiber in either normotensive or hypertensive participants found an overall 1.59 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) reduction in [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and 0.39 mm Hg reduction in [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) [(35)](#reference35). Further analyses showed that, among all the soluble viscous fiber under examination (-glucan, guar gum, konjac glucomannan, pectin, and psyllium), only psyllium could reduce systolic blood pressure (mean reduction of 2.39 mm Hg) [(35)](#reference35). It is not yet understood how soluble viscous fiber would induce a lowering of blood pressure, but this effect may be indirect and dependent on established benefits of these fiber on other cardiometabolic parameters (see the above sections). The benefit of fiber on the regularity with which bulky, soft, easy-to-pass stools are eliminated is best assessed by an increase in stool output and an increase in the water content of stool. There are two mechanisms that support the laxative effects of certain fiber types: (i) large/coarse [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fiber (e.g., wheat bran) has an irritating effect on the [colonic](../glossary#colon) mucosa, which stimulates the secretion of water and mucus (unlike finely ground wheat bran that has a stool-hardening/constipating effect); and (ii) the presence of [soluble](../glossary#soluble) viscous, gel-forming fiber (e.g., psyllium) helps stool to resist dehydration in the colon [(15)](#reference15). Therefore, only fibers that remain relatively intact during the transit throughout the length of the colon (i.e., that resists [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) [fermentation](../glossary#fermentation)) and are thus found in the stool can have a potential laxative effect. A 2016 review of fiber interventions conducted by McRorie and Chey [(36)](#reference36) examined the potential laxative effect of fermentable fiber; the main findings of this review are summarized in Table 1. |Fiber||Type of Fiber||Number of Studies||Doses||Laxative fermentable||5 studies: all conducted in healthy participants; 3 studies with and 2 studies hardening effect and minimal increase in stool output (-glucan) No effect on stool output and stool consistency (guar gum, xanthan gum) | | Not reported |Inulin||Soluble, nonviscous, fermentable||11 studies: 3 studies in people with constipation and 8 studies in healthy people||5-20 g/day|| No effect on colonic transit time, stool consistency, stool water content, or participants||8-30 g/day|| No effect on stool output, consistency, bowel movement frequency, or colonic transit time||Flatulence healthy g/day|| | Stool hardening effect and reduction in stool output (2 studies) No effect on consistency, stool water content, stool output, or bowel movement frequency (4 studies) |Not reported| In summary, although the bulk of evidence comes primarily from studies in healthy subjects, supplementation with fermentable fibers appears unlikely to exert a laxative effect in people suffering from constipation (Table 1). In contrast, a 2016 meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials identified psyllium and nonprebiotics as effectively able to increase stool frequency and improve stool consistency in participants affected by and reductions in [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) [risk](../glossary#risk) have generally assessed only fiber-rich foods, rather than fiber itself, making it difficult to determine whether the observed benefits are related to fiber or other nutrients and [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) commonly found in fiber-rich foods. In contrast, [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) often use isolated fibers to determine whether a specific fiber component has beneficial health effects. [Prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have consistently reported associations between high intakes of fiber-rich foods and low [risks](../glossary#risk) of [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) and total [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). Three large prospective cohort studies [(38-40)](#reference38) found that dietary fiber intakes of approximately 14 g per 1,000 kcal of energy were associated with substantial (16-33%) decreases in the risk of CHD; these results are the basis for the Institute of Medicine's [Adequate Intake](../glossary#AI) (AI) recommendation for fiber (see [Intake Recommendations](#intake-recommendations)) [(4)](#reference4). A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 prospective cohort studies found each 7 g/day increase in total dietary fiber intake to be associated with a 9% decrease in risk of coronary or total cardiovascular events [(41)](#reference41). The most recent meta-analysis that included 18 prospective studies, with a total of 672,408 participants, found a 7% lower risk of CHD and a 17% lower risk of CHD-related mortality with the highest versus lowest intakes of total dietary fiber [(42)](#reference42). Subgroup analyses by type or source of dietary fiber showed evidence of [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between cereal, fruit, or [soluble](../glossary#soluble) fiber intake and the risk of CHD [(42)](#reference42). The US FDA has approved health claims like the following on the labels of foods containing at least 0.75 g/serving of -glucan soluble fiber: \"Diets low in [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) that include at least 3 g/day of -glucan soluble fiber from either whole oats or barley or a combination of both may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease\" [(24)](#reference24). Similarly, the FDA has approved health claims on the labels of foods containing at least 1.7 g/serving of psyllium: \"Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include at least 7 g/day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk may reduce the risk of heart disease\" [(24)](#reference24). While the cholesterol-lowering effect of viscous/gel-forming soluble fibers is recognized as a major contributor to the cardioprotective effects of fiber (see [Lowering serum cholesterol](#lowering-serum-cholesterol)), other mechanisms are likely to be involved. Findings from pooled analyses of prospective cohort studies found some evidence of an inverse association between the risks of CHD and total CVD and intakes of [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fiber [(41, 42)](#reference41). In addition, a [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data found dietary fiber intake to be inversely associated with [serum](../glossary#serum) [LDL](../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentration, but also with blood pressure, [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI), and serum [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentration [(43)](#reference43). Beneficial effects of fiber-rich diets or isolated fiber consumption on blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) and insulin responses and on blood pressure may also likely contribute to observed reductions in CHD risk (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (488,293 participants) found intakes of total fiber (12 studies), cereal fiber (10 studies), fruit fiber (8 studies), and [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fiber (3 studies) to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(44)](#reference44). A dose-response data analysis reported a nonlinear relationship between total fiber intake and diabetes risk, with evidence of risk reduction with total fiber intakes 25 g/day. A linear dose-response relationship between cereal fiber intake and diabetes risk indicated a 6% reduction in diabetes risk for each 2 g-increment in daily cereal fiber intake. There was no evidence of an inverse association between either vegetable fiber (9 studies) or [soluble](../glossary#soluble) fiber (3 studies) and the risk of type 2 diabetes [(44)](#reference44). Similar findings were reported in another meta-analysis of 18 prospective cohort studies in 617,968 participants [(45)](#reference45). Higher versus lower intakes of total fiber were found to be associated with a 15% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (17 studies); the risk of type 2 diabetes was inversely related to the intake of cereal fiber (13 studies) and insoluble fiber (3 studies) but not related to the intake of fruit fiber (11 studies), vegetable fiber (11 studies), or soluble fiber (3 studies) [(45)](#reference45). However, only randomized controlled interventions can establish whether there is a link of causality between an exposure (fiber intake) and an outcome (type 2 diabetes). For a discussion of the difference between observational studies and intervention studies, see the article \"Epidemiological Studies\" in the [Spring/Summer LPI 2016 Research Newsletter](../../../sites/lpi.oregonstate.edu/files/pdf/newsletters/ss16.pdf#page=7). contain insoluble cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. To date, [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) examining the effect of cereal fiber supplementation on the risk of type 2 diabetes are limited [(46)](#reference46). In a [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of 61 adults with [metabolic syndrome](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#metabolic-syndrome), the consumption of a diet based on several whole-grain cereal products for 12 weeks had no effect on fasting plasma concentrations of [glucose](../glossary#glucose), [insulin](../glossary#insulin), or [lipids](../glossary#lipid), or on measures of [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) compared with a refined grain-based diet [(47)](#reference47). There was only some weak evidence of an effect of whole-grain cereals on [postprandial](../glossary#postprandial) insulin response [(47)](#reference47). A recent 24-month, randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial examined the effect of daily supplementation with 15 g of primarily insoluble fiber on glycemic control in 180 adults with [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) who were counselled to adopt more healthy lifestyle habits. Insoluble fiber supplementation failed to improve fasting glucose concentration, measures of [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitivity), [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c) concentration (a marker of glycemic control), as well as glucose and insulin responses after a glucose load compared to placebo [(25)](#reference25). Although [observational data](../glossary#observational-study) suggest a protective association of cereal fiber against type 2 diabetes, the current (yet limited) evidence from intervention trials does not support a role for insoluble fiber in glycemic control in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes. Fiber-related benefits on glucose [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) have been linked to the viscosity of certain soluble fibers (e.g., psyllium, -glucan, raw guar gum) (see [Improving glycemic control](#improving-glycemic-control)). Soluble viscous fibers in cereal, particularly -glucans, rather than insoluble fiber (and soluble nonviscous fiber), are thus more likely to be involved in a protective effect of cereal intake against type 2 diabetes [(48)](#reference48). Apart from fiber, other bioactive compounds in cereal, like magnesium, might contribute to improving glycemic control in people with impaired glucose tolerance (see the article on [Magnesium](../minerals/magnesium#diabetes-prevention)) [(49)](#reference49). The current position of the American Diabetes Association is to encourage people at risk of type 2 diabetes to achieve the daily Adequate Intake (AI) of 14 g/1,000 kcal for dietary fiber (see [Intake Recommendations](#intake-recommendations)) [(50, 51)](#reference50). Adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet, the composition of which intends to meet the AI for fiber, has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes [(52, 53)](#reference52). [Metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) is estimated to affect nearly 35% of US adults and half of those older than 60 years [(54)](#reference54). The term metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of metabolic disorders that increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The diagnosis in an individual is based on the presence at once of at least three of the following metabolic risk factors: abdominal obesity, [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia), of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between total fiber intake and odds of metabolic syndrome in [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) but [(55, 56)](#reference55). Numerous [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined the relationship between consumption of fiber and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) at various sites. A 2014 review compiled published analyses of data from the large, multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) prospective cohort (>500,000 participants). This umbrella review reported evidence of [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between higher versus lower daily total fiber intakes (28.5 g/day versus 16.4 g/day) and the risk of [colorectal](../glossary#colorectal-cancer), liver, and breast cancers [(57)](#reference57). Total fiber intakes were not associated with the risk of cancer at other sites, i.e., the biliary tract, endometrium, prostate, kidney, or bladder. In addition, further analyses suggested that the consumption of cereal fiber was inversely related to the risk of colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers, and vegetable fiber intake was inversely associated with breast cancer. Yet, associations between the consumption of specific fiber types were not examined in relation to the risk of endometrial, kidney, or bladder cancer in EPIC participants [(57)](#reference57). Pooling information from individual observational studies can be helpful to draw conclusions regarding the potential associations between dietary fiber consumption and cancer risk. Results from the most recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies are reported in Table 2. |Type of Cancer||Type of Observational Studies||Risk Ratio [RR] or Odds Ratio [OR]* (95% Confidence Interval)||Risk Ratio [RR] in Subgroup Analyses (e.g., by fiber type, study type, and cancer subtype)||References| reporting on fruit fiber | RR: 0.99 (0.92-1.07) in studies reporting on vegetable fiber RR : 0.96 (0.90-1.02) in studies reporting on cereal fiber RR: 0.91 (0.84-0.99) in studies reporting on soluble fiber RR: 0.95 (0.89-1.02) in studies reporting on insoluble fiber | Aune et al. (2012) | Three most recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have reported evidence of an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) (see [Table 2](#table-2)) [(58-60)](#reference58). A recent review that included earlier meta-analyses reached a similar conclusion [(61)](#reference61). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why consuming fiber can have a protective effect against colorectal cancer. First, the presence of [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble), coarse fiber can increase stool bulk thereby promoting the fecal [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen) like nitrosamines [(62)](#reference62). Fiber can also reduce exposure of the gut mucosa to carcinogens by shortening transit time [(62)](#reference62). Secondly, fiber consumption influences the composition of the gut [microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota). [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) studies have shown inulin to selectively stimulate the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) of beneficial [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) while limiting the growth of potentially [pathogenic](../glossary#pathogen) bacteria (reviewed in [14](#reference14)). Gut bacterial imbalance ( [dysbiosis](../glossary#dysbiosis)) has been associated with the incidence of several conditions, including colorectal cancer [(63)](#reference63). The major health benefits conferred by the consumption of fiber are thus likely mediated by the bacteria the fiber contributes to feed. Depending on the physicochemical characteristics of fiber, some fiber, like inulin, can be fermented by colonic bacteria and lead to the formation of short-chain fatty acids, namely acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These short-chain fatty acids have been found to protect against [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) bacterial pathogens [(64)](#reference64) and to display anti-inflammatory [(65, 66)](#reference65). A few controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of fiber consumption on the recurrence of [colorectal adenomas](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) (precancerous [polyps](../glossary#polyp)), but none have been conducted in the last two decades. These trials examined the effect of wheat bran fiber [(67-71)](#reference67), psyllium [(72)](#reference72), and a high-fiber diet [(73)](#reference73) on the risk of adenomas in participants with a history of adenomas. A 2017 meta-analysis of these trials found no difference between intervention and control groups in the number of participants with at least one new adenomatous polyp during the follow-up period (2-8 years), regardless of the type of fiber intervention [(74)](#reference74). Dietary fiber might interfere with estrogen reabsorption by reducing -glucoronidase activity [(80)](#reference80). Alterations in gut bacteria composition have also been reported in women with breast cancer and might contribute to increased estrogen metabolism and absorption, resulting in higher circulating estrogen concentrations [(81)](#reference81). However, it is not known whether fiber-associated effects on [endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) estrogen concentrations have a clinically significant impact on breast cancer risk [(4)](#reference4). Finally, a healthy [microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) might also promote the degradation of plant-derived molecules other than fiber, such as lignans, which are precursors of [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) with anti-estrogenic activities [(82)](#reference82). A review of the most recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggests that dietary fiber consumption is [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) the [risk](../glossary#risk) [(87, 88)](#reference87). The evidence linking fiber intake and esophageal cancer was exclusively based on observations from [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), and for the other cancer sites, the evidence is primarily derived from case-control studies (Table 2). It is important to note that the evidence of an inverse association between fiber intake and risk of ovarian cancer (2 meta-analyses) was observed in case-control but not in prospective cohort studies (Table 2). Additionally, there was no evidence of an association between fiber intake and risk of endometrial cancer (1 meta-analysis; [83](#reference83)), prostate cancer (2 meta-analyses; [ 91, 92)](#reference91), or renal cell carcinoma (1 meta-analysis; [93](#reference93)) (Table 2). At present, evidence from randomized controlled trials of a causal relationship between fiber intake and risk of any cancer is lacking. Of note, a recent study in a mouse model presenting a [dysbiotic](../glossary#dysbiosis) [microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) characterized by an increase in fiber- [fermenting](../glossary#fermentation) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) showed that the consumption of an obesogenic, high-fat diet enriched with soluble fiber could cause icteric hepatocarcinoma [(94)](#reference94). Such findings suggest that a prolonged consumption of fermentable fiber may have detrimental consequences in contexts of dysbiosis. No such observations were found when insoluble fiber were substituted for soluble fiber [(94)](#reference94). [Gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disorders associated with enteral nutrition prolong the time to recovery. A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) found that fiber-enriched enteral formulas and/or fiber [supplements](../glossary#supplement) reduced the overall incidence of diarrhea in patients requiring enteral nutrition [(95)](#reference95). There was no reduction in incidental diarrhea when the analysis was restricted to studies that used [prebiotic](../glossary#prebiotic) fiber (i.e., fermentable fiber influencing [microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) composition). Subgroup analyses also showed a benefit of fiber in non-critically ill patients but not in critically ill patients [(95)](#reference95). A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed nearly 60,000 older women for four years found that the highest versus lowest level of fiber intake (mean, 25 g/day versus 13.5 g/day) was associated with a 17% lower risk of developing fecal [incontinence](../glossary#incontinence) (defined here as an incontinence episode of liquid or solid stool at least once a month) [(96)](#reference96). A limited number of studies have also examined whether fiber [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) might help treat established fecal incontinence. In one [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial, 206 subjects suffering from fecal incontinence were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) for 32 days to receive fibers with different degrees of fermentability: gum arabic (on average, 16.6 g/day; highly fermentable), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (16.2 g/day; partially fermentable), and psyllium (14.6 g/day; poorly fermentable) [(97)](#reference97). The frequency of fecal incontinence increased with sodium carboxymethylcellulose but decreased with gum arabic and psyllium compared to placebo. Stool consistency and amount did not differ among groups [(97)](#reference97). A randomized, [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in 80 community-dwelling participants with at least one fecal incontinence episode per week found that the reduction in fecal incontinence frequency and severity with psyllium supplementation was equivalent to that observed with antidiarrheal drug loperamide (Imodium) [(98)](#reference98). It has been suggested that higher fiber intakes could help maintain weight or promote weight loss by increasing satiation (causing meal termination) and/or extending the feeling of fullness after a meal (satiety). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the potential satiating effect of fibers and the subsequent reduction in food intake. The presence of fiber in food may indirectly stimulate the production of hormones involved in the regulation of appetite in particular through (i) increasing the processing time in the mouth due to increased efforts required to masticate large particles containing fibers, and/or (ii) increasing the duration of stomach distention due to a lower rate of gastric emptying, and/or (iii) increasing the colonic production of short-chain [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) that can bind to [receptors](../glossary#receptor) present on gut endocrine cells (reviewed in [99](#reference99)). Adverse effects like gas production and bloating observed with the supplementation of isolated fibers (e.g., wheat dextrin) might also reduce hunger and increase satiety. A 2013 review of 44 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that -glucans from oat or barley, lupin kernel fiber, whole grain rye, rye bran, and a mixed high-fiber diet could enhance satiety, whereas psyllium, whole grain barley, whole grain buckwheat, resistant starch, and wheat bran had no benefit or even reduced measures of satiety [(100)](#reference100). However, for many types of fiber examined, results from interventions were mixed, some showing a positive effect on satiety, and others showing no effect. Additionally, there seemed to be no relationship between the physicochemical properties of fiber (i.e., solubility, viscosity, fermentability) and evidence of efficacy. For example, among soluble viscous fibers, -glucans appeared to enhance satiety, but pectin or psyllium did not. Similarly, among fermentable fibers, -glucans enhanced satiety, but guar gum, inulin, fructooligosaccharides, and resistant starch did not. Finally, a positive effect of fiber on satiety was not consistently associated with a reduction in food intake [(100)](#reference100). A 2011 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 61 randomized controlled studies examined the effect of different fiber types on body weight [(101)](#reference101). This analysis found that dextrins and marine polysaccharides reduced body weight in all the studies, while chitosan, arabinoxylans, and fructans reduced body weight in at least two-thirds of the studies. Average weight reductions were greatest for the fructans and marine polysaccharides groups (~1.3 kg or 2.8 lb/4 weeks for a 79 kg person in both groups). For all fiber types combined, however, the average weight reduction was only 0.3 kg (0.7 lb) per 4 weeks for a 79-kg person [(101)](#reference101). A few randomized controlled trials in overweight or obese subjects suggested that psyllium supplementation may influence body composition and/or promote weight loss (reviewed in [102](#reference102)). In one randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 159 Australian with [body mass indices](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) 25 kg/m2, psyllium (5 g/day) reduced waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat percentage, and increased the percentage of lean mass after 3, 6, and 12 months [(103)](#reference103). Psyllium appeared to transiently reduce body weight at 3 and 6 months, yet there was no difference in body weight between psyllium and placebo at the end of the intervention (12 months) [(103)](#reference103). More research needs to be conducted in order to clarify which types of fiber might play a role in appetite regulation and weight management [(99)](#reference99). Several [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined dietary fiber intake in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality. A 2015 report from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, which followed 364,442 older adults for an average of 14 years, found that men and women in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of dietary fiber intake (mean, 10.2 g/day versus 2.0 g/day) had lower risks of all-cause [(104)](#reference104). Another prospective study that made use of data collected from 15,740 participants in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994 found a 13% lower risk of all-cause mortality in subjects with total fiber intake between 14.5 g/day and 22.1 g/day \u2014 but not in those with higher intake (>22.1 g/day) \u2014 compared to those with fiber intake less than 9.3 g/day, over a mean follow-up period of 13.7 years [(105)](#reference105). No associations were found between intakes of either insoluble or soluble fiber and all-cause mortality [(105)](#reference105). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of prospective cohort studies published before 2013, which included a total of 1,752,848 participants followed for a mean 12.4 years, found higher versus lower total fiber intake to be associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (-23%; 9 studies), cancer-related mortality (-17%; 5 studies), and cardiovascular disease-related mortality (-23%; 16 studies) [(106)](#reference106). Another meta-analysis identified 14 prospective cohort studies that examined cereal fiber intake in relation to mortality [(107)](#reference107). Participants in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of cereal fiber intake had lower risks of all-cause mortality (-19%; 3 studies), cardiovascular disease-related mortality (-18%; 10 studies), and cancer-related mortality (-25%; 2 studies) [(107)](#reference107). A 2004 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that combined the results of 23 [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) in patients with type 1 or type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found that high-fiber diets kcal) [(108)](#reference108). Based on the evidence from this meta-analysis, the authors recommended a dietary fiber intake of 25-50 g/day (15-25 g/1,000 kcal) for individuals with diabetes, which is slightly higher than recommendations for the general public (14 g/1,000 kcal) [(4)](#reference4). However, recommendations from the American Diabetes Association and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics to people with diabetes are similar to those prescribed for the population as a whole [(50](#reference50), [109)](#reference109). Adhering to one of the USDA's healthy dietary patterns, like the Mediterranean-style diet (which is rich in fruit, vegetables, and whole grains), would contribute to meeting the daily intake recommendation for total fiber (see [Intake Recommendations](#intake-recommendations)) [(110)](#reference110). A 2015 meta-analysis of nine [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in a total of 1,178 participants with type 2 diabetes showed evidence of body weight loss and improvements in glycemic control and blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile with the consumption of a Mediterranean-style diet compared to a control diet [(111)](#reference111). Numerous controlled clinical trials have shown that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with soluble viscous fibers improves markers of glycemic control in people who have type 2 diabetes mellitus. A meta-analysis of 28 trials in 1,394 adults with type 2 diabetes found reductions in [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c) concentration (20 trials), fasting glucose concentration (28 trials), and [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) (11 trials) with soluble viscous fiber supplementation (median doses of 10.5-15 g/day for 6-8 weeks) [(112)](#reference112). Another meta-analysis of 35 trials showed that the effect of psyllium varied with baseline fasting glucose concentration: psyllium supplementation had no effect on markers of glycemic control in [euglycemic](../glossary#euglycemia) participants but showed a modest benefit in subjects with [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), and a greater effect in those with overt type 2 diabetes (see also [Biological Activities](#biological_activities)) [(32)](#reference32). A small randomized uncontrolled trial in 20 healthy participants suggested that supplemental wheat dextrin, which is partially absorbed as sugar in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-instestine), could increase fasting glucose concentration into the prediabetes range after one month of supplementation [(113)](#reference113). Since there is little evidence from clinical trials that increasing nonviscous fiber alone is beneficial [(114)](#reference114), individuals with diabetes should preferably increase fiber intake from sources of soluble viscous fibers, such as oats and barley (-glucans), vegetables, beans, and legumes [(108)](#reference108). Only [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fibers and [soluble](../glossary#soluble) viscous fibers that resist [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) [fermentation](../glossary#fermentation) in the [colon](../glossary#colon) have a potential laxative effect (see [Improving regularity in stool elimination](#improving-regularity-stool-elimination)) [(15)](#reference15). The [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of chronic constipation is higher among people with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), in women during pregnancy and after delivery, or in older people. The management of constipation in these patients is usually similar to the management in the rest of the population, although the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) might be different. Bulk-forming laxatives, including psyllium, bran, and methylcellulose, are commonly recommended to improve stool regularity in patients with diabetes mellitus [(115)](#reference115). However, there is no evidence that methylcellulose and bran are efficacious in patients with constipation [(116)](#reference116). In these patients, psyllium is also recognized to improve glycemic control (see [Diabetes mellitus](#diabetes-mellitus-treatment)). There is a need for good quality, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trials to examine the effect of fiber [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in the treatment of constipation in older adults in long-term care [(117)](#reference117) or in pregnant women and new mothers [(118, 119)](#reference118). The American College of Gastroenterology recognizes the efficacy of soluble fiber in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation. It also recognizes that the evidence from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) is mixed, as constipation is associated with low-fiber diets in some, but not all, studies [(120)](#reference120). It recommends a gradual increase in fiber intake, in particular to limit the potential adverse effects associated with the intake of insoluble fiber, i.e., bloating, distension, flatulence, and cramping [(121)](#reference121). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder of the intestines, characterized by episodes of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered gut mobility and changes in bowel habits (i.e., with constipation, diarrhea, or both) [(122)](#reference122). Although the pathophysiology of IBS remains unclear, certain food components have been recognized as a cause for symptoms of IBS. Dietary restriction of highly [fermentable](../glossary#fermentation), including some dietary fibers (e.g., fructans, galactooligosaccharides), has been found to relieve IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain/discomfort, abdominal bloating/distension, and flatulence [(123)](#reference123). On the other hand, soluble, poorly fermentable, long-chain carbohydrate fiber types may improve the symptoms related to excessive gas production. Two [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) and [cross-over studies](../glossary#cross-over-trial) found a beneficial effect of fiber that was limited to soluble fiber, primarily psyllium [(124, 125)](#reference124). Accordingly, the American College of Gastroenterology recognizes that soluble fiber like psyllium can provide overall symptom relief in IBS, while insoluble fiber (e.g., wheat bran) can cause bloating and abdominal discomfort [(121)](#reference121). More research is needed to document the effect of specific soluble fibers, considering physicochemical properties (viscosity and fermentability), doses, and duration of supplementation, and to provide stronger recommendations to individuals diagnosed with IBS [(125)](#reference125). Future trials should also consider subjects with all of the IBS types, i.e., constipation-predominant, diarrhea-predominant, and mixed-diarrhea-and-constipation IBS. Diverticular disease or [diverticulosis](../glossary#diverticulosis) is a rather common [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) condition in Western countries characterized by the formation of small pouches (diverticula) in the [colon](../glossary#colon) [(126)](#reference126). Acute [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) or infection of diverticula \u2014 known as [diverticulitis](../glossary#diverticulitis) \u2014 occurs in about 10%-25% of all symptomatic cases of diverticulosis and is caused by the irritation of the mucosa by fecalith obstructing diverticula. Complications of diverticulitis include obstruction, and perforation [(126)](#reference126). The [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of diverticulosis is thought to be multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental risk factors. Despite little supporting evidence, it has been proposed that low fiber intakes that characterize Western diets might contribute to increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of diverticulosis [(127, 128)](#reference127). This low-fiber [hypothesis](../glossary#hypothesis) particular, a 2012 [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 2,104 adults found higher odds of diverticula (assessed by colonoscopy) among participants in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of fiber intake, measured by [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) [(129)](#reference129). A 2017 review identified interventions \u2014 published over four decades \u2014 that examined the effect of dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) fiber on the reduction of abdominal pain in patients suffering from symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), as well as on the risk of acute diverticulitis [(130)](#reference130). However, a meta-analysis could not be conducted nor any conclusion provided regarding the efficacy of fiber in the treatment of SUDD due to the very poor quality of the studies and their substantial [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) in terms of study design and quantity and quality of fiber types used [(130)](#reference130). Another recent review of the literature focused on the effect of fiber-restricted diets in the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [(131)](#reference131). Based on the review of three [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) and two [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), the authors found a reduced length of hospital stay with non-restricted diets compared to restricted diets, but no difference regarding the incidence of treatment failure (i.e., the risk of no clinical improvement with therapy and the development of complications) and the risk of post-discharge reoccurrence of diverticulitis. While there appears to be no clinical benefit in restricting fiber intake in subjects with uncomplicated diverticulitis, the quality of the studies was once again deemed to be very low [(131)](#reference131). Despite the lack of high-quality evidence regarding the potential benefit of fiber in the management of diverticular disease, many national guidelines recommend the use of high-fiber diets in patients with SUDD and for the prevention of diverticulitis [(132, 133)](#reference132). A limited number of [interventions](../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the effect of fiber [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in subjects with symptomatic [hemorrhoids](../glossary#hemorrhoids). A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 67 participants found that supplementation with psyllium (7 g/day for 6 weeks) improved stool consistency and regularity, reduced the use of laxatives, and increased the quality of life compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(134)](#reference134). Another randomized controlled trial in 50 patients with hemorrhoidal prolapse (grades II-IV) and rectal bleeding showed that psyllium supplementation (11.6 g/day for 40 days) reduced the number of bleeding episodes and the number of congested hemorrhoidal cushions but had no effect on the degree of prolapse [(135)](#reference135). Finally, a more recent uncontrolled intervention in 102 individuals with advanced hemorrhoids (grades II-IV) examined the effect of counseling patients to follow a therapy meant to improve defecatory habits and involving an increase of psyllium intake to 20 g/day-25 g/day. A follow-up for a median 40 months suggested that psyllium supplementation might help halt the progression of hemorrhoidal prolapse and reduce the number of bleeding episodes [(136)](#reference136). An analysis of the 2009-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data reported average dietary fiber intakes of 13.6 g/day in children and adolescents and 17 g/day in adults\u2014well below recommended intake levels (see [Intake Recommendations](#intake-recommendations)) [(137)](#reference137). Fiber is identified as a shortfall nutrient of public health concern in the 2010-2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans [(51)](#reference51). Good sources of dietary fiber include [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains), bran products, fruit, and nonstarchy vegetables. Legumes (e.g., dry beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and whole grains are generally more concentrated sources of fiber than fruit and vegetables [(138)](#reference138). These higher fiber foods are currently underconsumed, contributing to only about 6% of total dietary fiber intake [(137)](#reference137). Although refined grains are often perceived as being poor sources of fiber, they can provide as much fiber as either fruit or vegetables when comparable serving sizes are consumed [(138)](#reference138). In addition, not all whole grains are good sources of fiber, yet they provide key [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) and [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) that contribute to the health benefit associated with whole grain consumption (see the article on [Whole Grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains)) [(12)](#reference12). All plant-based foods contain a mixture of and [insoluble](../glossary#insoluble) fiber [(138)](#reference138). Bran flaxseed, oat cereal, legumes, nuts, fruit, and vegetables are good sources of soluble viscous and nonviscous fiber. Wheat bran, brown rice, barley, cabbage, celery, and whole grains are rich sources of insoluble fiber. The total fiber content of some fiber-rich foods is presented in Table 3. Some strategies for increasing dietary fiber intake include increasing fruit and nonstarchy vegetable intake, increasing intake of legumes, eating whole-grain cereal or oatmeal for breakfast, substituting whole grains for refined grains, and substituting nuts or popcorn for less healthy snacks. For more information about the fiber content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData are viscous, easily [fermented](../glossary#fermentation), [soluble](../glossary#soluble) fibers found naturally in oats, barley, mushrooms, yeast, [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria), and algae. -Glucans extracted from oats, mushrooms, and yeast are available in a variety of nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement) without a prescription. Glucomannan, sometimes called konjac mannan, is classified as a [soluble](../glossary#soluble) fiber isolated from konjac flour, which is derived from the plant Amorphophallus konjac. Glucomannan is available as powder and in capsules, which should be taken with plenty of liquids [(8)](#reference8). Glucomannan forms gels that are firmer than regular gelatin products (e.g., \"jello\") and do no melt in the mouth. The FDA has banned gel candies containing glucomannan (e.g., \"mini-cup jelly products\") because of their potential to cause choking [(139)](#reference139). Pectins are readily fermented [soluble](../glossary#soluble) viscous fibers, most often extracted from citrus peels and apple pulp. Pectins are widely used as gelling agents in food but are also available as dietary [supplements](../glossary#supplement) without a prescription [(8)](#reference8). Inulins and oligofructose, extracted from chicory root or synthesized from sucrose, are used as food additives [(9)](#reference9). Isolated inulin is added to replace fat in products like salad dressing, while sweet-tasting oligofructose is added to products like fruit yogurts and desserts. Inulins and oligofructose are highly [fermentable](../glossary#fermentation) fibers that are also classified as [prebiotics](../glossary#prebiotic) because of their ability to stimulate the growth of potentially beneficial Bifidobacteria species in the human [colon](../glossary#colon) [(140)](#reference140). Encouraging the growth of Bifidobacteria might promote intestinal health by suppressing the growth of [pathogenic](../glossary#pathogen) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) known to cause diarrhea or by enhancing the immune response [(141)](#reference141). Although a number of dietary [supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing inulins and oligofructose are marketed as prebiotics, the health benefits of prebiotics have not yet been convincingly demonstrated in humans [(11](#reference11), [142)](#reference142). Raw guar gum is a viscous, [fermentable](../glossary#fermentation) fiber derived from the Indian guar or cluster bean [(4)](#reference4). It is used as a thickener or emulsifier in many food products. Dietary [supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing guar gum have been marketed as weight-loss aids, but there is no evidence of their efficacy [(143)](#reference143). Unlike guar gum, partially hydrolyzed guar gum is nonviscous and therefore does not exhibit the biological activities of guar gum (i.e., it has no effect on [serum](../glossary#serum) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and glycemic control) (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Psyllium, a viscous, soluble, gel-forming fiber isolated from psyllium seed husks, is available without a prescription in laxatives, ready-to-eat cereal, and dietary [supplements](../glossary#supplement) [(8)](#reference8). Psyllium is proven to be efficacious to lower [serum](../glossary#serum) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and improve glycemic control (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Because it also normalizes stool form, psyllium is the only fiber recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology to treat chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (see [Gastrointestinal disorders](#gastrointestinal-disorders-treatment)). Chitosan is an indigestible glucosamine [polymer](../glossary#polymer) derived from chitin. Chitosan is available as a dietary [supplement](../glossary#supplement) without a prescription in the US, being marketed to promote weight loss and lower [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol). A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled](../glossary#randomized-design), [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) found with chitosan supplementation (0.3-6.75 g/day for no effect on [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol or [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) [(144)](#reference144). Another recent pooled analysis of trials found chitosan to be more effective than [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in promoting weight loss [(145)](#reference145). Note: All fiber supplements should be taken with sufficient fluids. Most clinicians recommend taking fiber supplements with at least 8 ounces (240 mL) of water and consuming a total of at least 64 ounces (~2 liters or 2 quarts) of fluid daily [(146, 147)](#reference146). Some people experience abdominal cramping, bloating, or gas when they abruptly increase their dietary fiber intake [(146, 147)](#reference146). These symptoms can be minimized or avoided by increasing intake of fiber-rich foods gradually and increasing fluid intake to at least 64 oz/day (~2 liters or 2 quarts/day). There have been rare reports of intestinal obstruction related to large intakes of oat bran or wheat bran, primarily in people with impaired intestinal motility or difficulty chewing [(148-151)](#reference148). The National Academy of Medicine (formerly, the Institute of Medicine) has not established a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for dietary or functional fiber [(4)](#reference4). Gastrointestinal symptoms: The following fibers have been found to cause [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) distress, including abdominal cramping, bloating, polydextrose, resistant starch, and psyllium [(4)](#reference4). It is recommended to gradually introduce a new fiber [supplement](../glossary#supplement), not exceeding 3 to 4 g/day the first week, in order to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms [(152)](#reference152). In subjects who are constipated, the initiation of a fiber supplement should start once the hard stool is cleared [(152)](#reference152). Use of a guar gum-containing supplement for weight loss has been associated with [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) and [small bowel](../glossary#small-intestine) obstruction [(153)](#reference153). Additionally, several cases of intestinal obstruction by psyllium have been reported when taken with insufficient fluids or by people with impaired swallowing or gastrointestinal motility [(154, 155)](#reference154). Colorectal adenomas: One history of [colorectal adenomas](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) (precancerous polyps) found that supplementation with 3.5 g/day of psyllium for three years resulted in a significant increase in colorectal adenoma recurrence compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) (see [Colorectal cancer](#colorectal-cancer-prevention)) [(72)](#reference72). Allergy and anaphylaxis: Since chitin is isolated from the exoskeletons of crustaceans, such as crabs and lobsters, and chitosan is derived from chitin, people with shellfish allergies should avoid taking chitosan supplements [(8)](#reference8). [Anaphylaxis](../glossary#anaphylaxis) has been reported after [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) (IV) administration of inulin [(156)](#reference156), as well as ingestion of margarine containing inulin extracted from chicory [(157)](#reference157). Anaphylaxis has also been reported after the ingestion of cereal containing psyllium, and [asthma](../glossary#asthma) has occasionally been reported in people with occupational exposure to psyllium powder [(158)](#reference158). Gel-forming fibers (e.g., -glucan, psyllium, raw guar gum, pectin) have the potential to slow the absorption of drugs if taken at the same time. Psyllium may reduce the absorption of lithium, carbamazepine (Tegretol), digoxin (Lanoxin), and warfarin (Coumadin) when taken at the same time [(8)](#reference8). Guar gum may slow the absorption of digoxin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), and bumetanide (Bumex) and decrease the absorption metformin (Glucophage), penicillin, and some formulations of glyburide (Glynase) when taken at the same time [(159)](#reference159). Pectin may decrease the absorption of lovastatin (Mevacor) when taken at the same time [(160)](#reference160). Concomitant administration of a kaolin-pectin antidiarrheal suspension has been reported to decrease the absorption of clindamycin, tetracycline, and digoxin, but it is not known whether kaolin, pectin, or both were responsible for the interaction [(8)](#reference8). In general, medications should be taken at least one hour before or two hours after fiber [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and gel-forming dietary fibers (e.g., oatmeal). The addition of cereal fiber to meals has generally been found to decrease the absorption of [iron](../minerals/iron), [zinc](../minerals/zinc), [calcium](../minerals/calcium), and [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium) in the same meal, but this effect appears to be related to the phytate present in the cereal fiber rather than the fiber itself [(161)](#reference161). In general, dietary fiber as part of a balanced diet has not been found to adversely affect the calcium, magnesium, iron, or zinc [status](../glossary#status) of healthy people at recommended intake levels [(4)](#reference4). Evidence from animal studies and limited research in humans suggests that inulin and oligofructose may enhance calcium absorption [(162, 163)](#reference162). The addition of pectin and guar gum to a meal significantly reduced the absorption of the [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids) -carotene, lycopene, and lutein from that meal [(164, 165)](#reference164). The Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) recommendations for total fiber intake, set by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, are based on the findings of several large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that dietary fiber intakes of approximately 14 g for every 1,000 calories (kcal) consumed were associated with significant reductions in the risk of [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD). The FDA approved specific health claims related to the cardioprotective effects of two soluble, gel-forming fibers only: -glucan and psyllium (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). For adults who are 50 years of age and younger, the AI recommendation for total fiber intake is 38 g/day for men and 25 g/day for women. For adults over 50 years of age, the recommendation is 30 g/day for men and 21 g/day for women. The AI recommendations for males and females of all ages are presented in Table Adopting one of USDA healthy dietary patterns (i.e., healthy US-style, healthy Mediterranean-style, and healthy vegetarian dietary patterns) recommended in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans will help meet the recommendations for total fiber intake [(110)](#reference110). Fruit, vegetables, and whole grains available in the USDA dietary patterns contribute nearly 90% of the recommended dietary fiber intake. Within the vegetable group, beans, peas, and starchy vegetables are the main contributor of total fiber intake (22%). Refined grains provide 9% of total fiber intake [(110)](#reference110).

Contents L-Carnitine (-hydroxy--N-trimethylaminobutyric acid) is a derivative of the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid), lysine (Figure 1). It was first isolated from meat (carnus in Latin) in 1905. Only the L- [isomer](../glossary#isomer) of carnitine is biologically active [(1)](#references). L-Carnitine appeared as a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) in the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) and was therefore termed vitamin BT [(2)](#reference2). Vitamin BT, however, is a misnomer because humans and other higher organisms can synthesize L-carnitine (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Under certain conditions, the demand for L-carnitine may exceed an individual's capacity to synthesize it, making it a [conditionally essential nutrient](../glossary#conditionally-essential-nutrient) [(3, 4)](#reference3). In healthy [endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) of L-carnitine, absorption of carnitine from dietary sources, and reabsorption of carnitine by the kidneys [(5)](#reference5). Humans [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) lysine and [methionine](../glossary#methionine) in process several cell compartments ( [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol), [lysosomes](../glossary#lysosome), and [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria)) (reviewed in [6](#reference6)). [protein](../glossary#protein)-bound lysine is [methylated](../glossary#methylation) to form -N-trimethyllysine in a reaction [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by specific lysine methyltransferases that use S-adenosyl-methionine (derived from methionine) as a methyl donor. -N-Trimethyllysine is released for carnitine synthesis by protein [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis). Four [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) are involved in endogenous L-carnitine biosynthesis (Figure 2). They are all ubiquitous except -butyrobetaine hydroxylase is absent from cardiac and skeletal muscle. This enzyme is, however, highly expressed in human liver, testes, and kidney [(7)](#reference7). L-carnitine is primarily synthesized in the liver and transported via the bloodstream to cardiac and skeletal muscle, which rely on L-carnitine for [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) yet cannot synthesize it [(8)](#reference8). The rate of L-carnitine biosynthesis in humans was studied in strict vegetarians (i.e., in people who consume very little dietary carnitine) and estimated to be 1.2 \u00b5mol/kg of body weight/day [(9)](#reference9). The rate of L-carnitine synthesis depends on the extent to which peptide-linked lysines are methylated and the rate of protein turnover. There is some indirect evidence to suggest that excess lysine in the diet may increase endogenous L-carnitine synthesis; however, changes in dietary carnitine intake level or in renal reabsorption do not appear to affect the rate of endogenous L-carnitine synthesis [(6)](#reference6). The [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of L-carnitine from food can vary depending on dietary composition. For instance, one study reported that bioavailability of L-carnitine in individuals adapted to low-carnitine diets (i.e., vegetarians) was higher (66%-86%) than in those adapted to high-carnitine diets (i.e., regular red meat eaters; 54%-72%) [(10)](#reference10). The is degraded by [colonic](../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria). While [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of L-carnitine from the diet is quite high (see [Dietary L-carnitine](#absorption)), absorption from oral L-carnitine [supplements](../glossary#supplement) is considerably lower. The bioavailability of L-carnitine from oral supplements (doses, 0.6 to 7 g) ranges between 5% and 25% of the total dose [(5)](#reference5). Less is known regarding the metabolism of the [acetylated](../glossary#acetylation) form of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR); however, the bioavailability of ALCAR is thought to be higher than that of L-carnitine. The results of [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) experiments suggested that ALCAR might be partially [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) upon intestinal absorption [(11)](#reference11). In humans, administration of 2 g/day of ALCAR for 50 days increased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) ALCAR concentrations by 43%, suggesting that either ALCAR was absorbed without prior [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) or that L-carnitine [Renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption of free L-carnitine is normally very efficient; in fact, an estimated 95% is thought to be reabsorbed by the kidneys [(1)](#references). Therefore, carnitine excretion by the kidney is usually very low. However, several conditions can decrease the efficiency of carnitine reabsorption and, correspondingly, increase carnitine deficiency](#primary-deficiency)) [(12)](#reference12). In addition, when circulating L-carnitine concentration increases, as in the case of oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement), renal reabsorption of L-carnitine may become saturated, resulting in increased urinary excretion of L-carnitine [(5)](#reference5). Dietary or supplemental L-carnitine that is not absorbed by [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) is degraded by [colonic](../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) to form two principal products, trimethylamine and -butyrobetaine. -Butyrobetaine is eliminated in the feces; trimethylamine is efficiently absorbed and [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) to trimethylamine-N-oxide, which is excreted in the urine [(13)](#reference13). L-Carnitine is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) primarily in the liver but also in the kidneys and then transported to other tissues. It is most concentrated in tissues that use [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) as their primary fuel, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle. In this regard, L-carnitine plays an important role in energy production by [conjugating](../glossary#conjugation) to fatty acids for transport from the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol) into the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) L-Carnitine is required for energy acids must be esterified to L-carnitine (acylcarnitine) in order to enter the mitochondrial matrix where -oxidation occurs (Figure 3). On the outer mitochondrial membrane, CPTI (carnitine-palmitoyl transferase I) esterified to coenzyme A (CoA) to L-carnitine. This reaction is a rate-controlling step for the -oxidation of fatty acid [(13)](#reference13). A transport protein called CACT (carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase) facilitates the transport of acylcarnitine across the inner mitochondrial membrane. On the inner mitochondrial membrane, CPTII (carnitine-palmitoyl transferase II) catalyzes the transfer acids from L-carnitine to free CoA. Fatty acyl-CoA is then metabolized through -oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix, ultimately yielding propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA [(6)](#reference6). Carnitine is eventually recycled back to the cytosol (Figure 3). Free (nonesterified) CoA is required as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for numerous cellular reactions. The flux through pathways that require nonesterified CoA, such as the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of [glucose](../glossary#glucose), may be reduced if all the CoA available in a given cell compartment is esterified. Carnitine can increase the availability of nonesterified CoA for these other metabolic pathways CoA to carnitine (Figure 3). The resulting acylcarnitine [esters](../glossary#ester) (e.g., acetylcarnitine) can remain in the mitochondrial matrix or be exported back into the cytosol via CACT. Free (nonesterified) CoA can then participate in other reactions, such as the generation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate in a reaction catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase [(14)](#reference14). Acetyl-CoA can then be oxidized produce energy ( [ATP](../glossary#ATP)) in the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle). In addition to its importance for energy production, L-carnitine was shown to display direct [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) properties [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(15)](#reference15). Age-related declines in [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) function and increases in mitochondrial [oxidant](../glossary#oxidation) production are thought to be important contributors to the adverse effects of aging. Tissue L-carnitine concentrations have been found to decline with age in humans and animals [(16)](#reference16). The expression of most [proteins](../glossary#protein) involved in the transport of carnitine (OCTN2) and the acylcarnitine shuttling system across the mitochondrial membrane (CPTIa, CPTII, and CAT; Figure 3) was also found to be much lower in the white blood cells of healthy older adults than of younger adults [(17)](#reference17). Preclinical studies in rodents showed that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with high doses of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR; Figure 1) reversed a number of age-related changes in liver mitochondrial function yet increased liver mitochondrial oxidant production [(18)](#reference18). ALCAR supplementation in rats has also been found to improve or reverse age-related mitochondrial declines in skeletal and cardiac muscular function [(19, 20)](#reference19). Co-supplementation of aged rats with L-carnitine and [DNA](../glossary#DNA) strand breaks in a variety of tissues (heart, skeletal muscle, and brain) [(21-30)](#reference21). Co-supplementation for three months improved both the number of total and intact mitochondria and mitochondrial ALCAR exerts antioxidant activities in rodents, it is not known whether taking high doses of ALCAR will have similar effects in humans. Nutritional carnitine deficiencies have not been identified in healthy people without metabolic disorders, suggesting that most people can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) enough L-carnitine [(1)](#references). Even strict vegetarians (vegans) show no signs of carnitine deficiency, despite the fact that most dietary carnitine is derived from animal sources [(9)](#reference9). Infants, particularly premature infants, are born with low stores of L-carnitine, which could put them at [risk](../glossary#risk) of deficiency given their rapid rate of growth. One study reported that infants fed carnitine-free, soy-based formulas grew normally and showed no signs of a clinically relevant carnitine deficiency; however, some biochemical measures related to [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) differed significantly from infants fed the same formula [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with L-carnitine [(31)](#reference31). Soy-based infant formulas are now [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with the amount of L-carnitine normally found in human milk [(32)](#reference32). [Renal](../glossary#renal) filtration maintains [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of free carnitine around 40 to 50 micromoles (\u00b5mol)/L, while plasma concentrations of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR; the most abundant carnitine ester) are around 3 to 6 \u00b5mol/L [(8)](#reference8). Regardless of the [etiology](../glossary#etiology), plasma concentrations of free carnitine 20 \u00b5mol/L and increased acylcarnitine/free carnitine ratios (0.4) are considered abnormal [(6)](#reference6). Low carnitine [status](../glossary#status) is generally due to impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism or to carnitine not being efficiently reabsorbed by the kidneys. The rate of carnitine [excretion](../glossary#excretion) is not a useful indicator of carnitine status because it can vary with dietary carnitine intake and other physiologic parameters. At present, there is no test that assesses functional carnitine deficiency in humans [(6)](#reference6). Primary systemic carnitine deficiency is a rare, [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorder caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) (including deletions) in the SLC22A5 [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for carnitine transporter protein OCTN2 (organic cation transporter novel 2) [(33)](#reference33). Individuals with defective carnitine transport have poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, impaired L-carnitine reabsorption by the kidneys (i.e., increased urinary loss of L-carnitine), and defective L-carnitine uptake by muscles [(4)](#reference4). The clinical presentation can vary widely depending on the type of mutation affecting SLC22A5 and the phenotypic manifestation of the mutation, i.e., age of onset, organ involvement, and severity of symptoms at the time of diagnosis [(34)](#reference34). The disorder usually presents in early childhood and is characterized by episodes of hypoketotic [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia) (that can cause [encephalopathy](../glossary#encephalopathy)), [hepatomegaly](../glossary#hepatomegaly), [(34, 35)](#reference34). The metabolic and myopathic symptoms in infants and children can be fatal such that treatment should start promptly to prevent irreversible organ damage [(34)](#reference34). The diagnosis is established by demonstrating abnormally low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) free carnitine concentrations, reduced carnitine transport of [fibroblasts](../glossary#fibroblast) from skin biopsy, and molecular analysis of the gene coding for OCTN2 [(33, 34)](#reference33). Treatment consists of [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of L-carnitine that are meant to maintain a normal blood carnitine concentration, thereby preventing the risk of hypoglycemia and correcting metabolic and myopathic manifestations [(34)](#reference34). Secondary carnitine deficiency or depletion may result from either genetic or acquired conditions. Hereditary causes include genetic defects in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid), [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [(36)](#reference36). Such inherited disorders lead to a buildup of organic acids, which are subsequently removed from the body via urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of acylcarnitine [esters](../glossary#ester). Increased urinary losses of carnitine can lead to the systemic depletion of carnitine [(6)](#reference6). Systemic carnitine depletion can also occur in disorders of impaired [renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption. For instance, Fanconi's syndrome is a hereditary or acquired condition in which the proximal tubular reabsorption function of the kidneys is impaired [(37)](#reference37). This malfunction consequently results in increased urinary losses of carnitine. Patients with renal disease who undergo [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) are at [risk](../glossary#risk) for secondary carnitine deficiency because hemodialysis removes carnitine from the blood (see [End-stage renal disease](#end-stage-renal-disease-treatment)) [(38)](#reference38). One example of an exclusively acquired carnitine deficiency involves chronic use of pivalate-conjugated antibiotics. Pivalate is a branched-chain fatty acid anion that is metabolized to form an acyl-CoA ester, which is transesterified to carnitine and subsequently excreted the urine as pivaloyl carnitine. Urinary losses of carnitine via this route can be 10-fold greater than the sum of daily carnitine intake and [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) and lead to systemic carnitine depletion (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)) [(39)](#reference39). Finally, a number of [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in carnitine shuttling and fatty acid [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) pathways do not systematically result in carnitine depletion (such that carnitine supplementation may not help mitigate the symptoms) but lead to abnormal profiles of acylcarnitine esters in blood [(35](#reference35), [40)](#reference40). [Endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) of L-carnitine [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by the action of four different [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) (Figure 2). This process and the form of nicotinamide may also require [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) (ascorbate) [(4)](#reference4). One of the earliest symptoms of vitamin C deficiency is fatigue, thought to be related to decreased synthesis of L-carnitine [(41)](#reference41). In most studies discussed below, it is important to note that treatment with L-carnitine or acyl-L-carnitine esters (i.e., acetyl-L-carnitine [ALCAR], propionyl-L-carnitine; Figure 1) was generally used as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to standard medical therapy, not in place of it. It is also important to consider the fact that the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of L-carnitine and acylcarnitine derivatives administered orally is low (~10-20%) (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration is more likely to increase [plasma](../glossary#plasma) carnitine concentration, yet [homeostatic](../glossary#homeostasis) mechanisms tightly control blood concentration through [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and [renal](../glossary#renal) [excretion](../glossary#excretion): Up to 90% of 2 g of L-carnitine administered intravenously is excreted into the urine within 12 to 24 hours. Only a fraction of the dose is thought to enter the endogenous carnitine pool \u2014 largely found in skeletal muscle (reviewed in [8](#reference8)). Several small [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have explored whether [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) L-carnitine could improve [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance) in people with impaired glucose [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). A potential benefit of L-carnitine in these patients is based on the fact that it can (i) increase the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of long-chain [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) which accumulation may contribute to [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) in skeletal muscle, and (ii) enhance [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization by reducing acyl-CoA concentration within the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) matrix (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)) [(42)](#reference42). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of five trials in participants with either impaired fasting glucose, type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis found evidence of an improvement in insulin resistance with supplemental L-carnitine compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(43)](#reference43). Another meta-analysis of four [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trials found evidence of a reduction in fasting plasma glucose concentration and no improvement of [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) concentration in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus supplemented with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) [(44)](#reference44). A third meta-analysis of 16 trials suggested that supplementation with (acyl)-L-carnitine may reduce fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations, but not resistance to [insulin](../glossary#insulin) [(45)](#reference45). In a recent [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the effect of ALCAR was examined in 229 participants treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), and [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia) [(46)](#reference46). ALCAR supplementation (1 g/day had no effect on [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) or [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure), markers of kidney function (i.e., glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria), markers of glucose [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) (i.e., glucose disposal rate, glycated hemoglobin concentration, and a measure of insulin resistance), and blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile (i.e., concentrations of [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides), [lipoprotein (a)](../glossary#lipoprotein-a), [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol, and total cholesterol) [(46)](#reference46). In the studies discussed below it is important to note that treatment with L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine was used as an [ adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) (in addition) to appropriate medical therapy, not in place of it. [Myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (MI) occurs when an [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaque in a [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) ruptures and obstructs the blood supply to the heart muscle, causing injury or damage to the heart (see the page on [Heart Attack](../health-disease/heart-attack)). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have explored whether L-carnitine administration immediately after MI diagnosis could reduce injury to heart muscle resulting from [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) and improve clinical outcomes. An early trial in 160 men and women diagnosed with a recent MI showed that oral L-carnitine (4 g/day) in addition to standard pharmacological treatment for one year significantly reduced mortality and the occurrence of [angina](../health-disease/angina-pectoris) attacks compared to the control [(47)](#reference47). In another controlled trial in 96 patients, treatment with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) L-carnitine (5 g bolus followed by 10 g/day for three days) following a MI resulted in lower concentrations of creatine kinase-MB and troponin-I, two markers of cardiac injury [(48)](#reference48). However, not all clinical trials have found L-carnitine supplementation to be beneficial after MI. For example, in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 60 participants diagnosed with an acute MI, neither mortality nor [echocardiographic](../glossary#echocardiography) measures of cardiac function differed between patients treated with intravenous L-carnitine (6 g/day) for seven days followed by oral L-carnitine (3 g/day) for three months and those given a placebo [(49)](#reference49). Another randomized placebo-controlled trial in 2,330 patients with acute MI, L-carnitine therapy (9 g/day intravenously for five days, then 4 g/day orally for six months) did not affect the risk of [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) and death six months after MI [(50)](#reference50). A 2013 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that L-carnitine therapy in patients who experienced an MI reduced the risks of all-cause mortality (-27%; 11 trials; 3,579 angina attacks (-40%; 2 trials; 261 participants), but had no effect on the risks of having a subsequent myocardial infarction or developing heart failure [(51)](#reference51). Because about 90% of oral L-carnitine supplements is unlikely to be absorbed, one could ask whether the efficacy is equivalent between protocols using both intravenous and oral administration and those using oral administration only [(8)](#reference8). This has not been examined in subgroup analyses. Heart failure is described as the heart's inability to pump enough blood for all of the body's needs (see the page on [Heart Failure](../health-disease/heart-failure)). In [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), accumulation of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaque in the [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-artery) may prevent heart regions from getting adequate circulation, ultimately resulting in cardiac damage and impaired pumping ability. [Myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) may also damage the heart muscle, which could potentially lead to heart failure. Further, the diminished heart's capacity to pump blood in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy may lead to heart failure. Because physical exercise increases the demand on the weakened heart, measures of exercise tolerance are frequently used to monitor the severity of heart failure. [Echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography) is also used to determine the left [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) ejection fraction (LVEF), an objective measure of the heart's pumping ability. An LVEF of less than 40% is indicative of systolic heart failure [(52)](#reference52). An abnormal acylcarnitine profile and a high acylcarnitine to free carnitine ratio in the blood of patients with heart failure have been linked to disease severity and poor prognosis [(53-55)](#reference53). Addition of L-carnitine to standard medical therapy for heart failure has been evaluated in several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies in a total of 1,625 participants with heart failure found that oral L-carnitine (1.5-6 g/day for seven days to three years) significantly improved several measures of cardiac functional capacity (including exercise tolerance and markers of the left ventricle function), yet had no impact on all-cause mortality [(56)](#reference56). Angina pectoris is chest pain that occurs when the coronary blood supply is insufficient to meet the metabolic needs of the heart muscle (as with [ischemic](../glossary#ischemia) heart disease; see the page on [Angina Pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris)) [(57)](#reference57). In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in over 4,000 participants with suspected angina pectoris, elevated concentrations of certain acylcarnitine intermediates in blood were associated with fatal and non-fatal acute myocardial infarction [(58)](#reference58). In early studies, the addition of oral L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine to pharmacologic therapy for chronic stable angina modestly improved exercise tolerance and decreased [electrocardiographic](../glossary#electrocardiogram) signs of ischemia during exercise testing in some angina patients [(59-61)](#reference59). Another early study examined hemodynamic and [angiographic](../glossary#angiography) variables before, during, and after administering [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) propionyl-L-carnitine (15 mg/kg body weight) in men with myocardial dysfunction and angina pectoris [(62)](#reference62). In this study, propionyl-L-carnitine decreased myocardial ischemia, evidenced by significant reductions in ST-segment depression and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure [(62)](#reference62). No recent and/or large-scale studies have been conducted to further examine the potential benefit of L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine in the management of angina pectoris. In [peripheral arterial disease](../glossary#peripheral-arterial-disease), [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) of the arteries that supply the lower extremities may diminish blood flow to the point that the metabolic needs of exercising muscles are not sufficiently met, thereby leading to [ischemic](../glossary#ischemia) leg or hip pain known as claudication (see the page on [Intermittent Claudication in Peripheral Arterial Disease](../health-disease/intermittent-claudication)) [(63)](#reference63). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that treatment with propionyl-L-carnitine improves exercise tolerance in some patients with intermittent claudication. In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, dose-titration study, 1 to 3 g/day of oral propionyl-L-carnitine for 24 weeks was well tolerated and improved maximal walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication [(64)](#reference64). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled study of 495 patients with intermittent claudication, 2 g/day of propionyl-L-carnitine for 12 months significantly increased maximal walking distance and the distance walked prior to the onset of claudication in patients whose initial maximal walking distance was less than 250 meters (m), but no effect was seen in patients who had an initial maximal walking distance greater than 250 m [(65)](#reference65). More recent trials have associated oral propionyl-L-carnitine supplementation (2 g/day for several months) with improved walking distance and claudication onset time [(66, 67)](#reference66), as well as with higher pain-free walking distance and higher ankle-brachial index (a diagnostic measure of peripheral arterial disease) [(68)](#reference68). Two 2013 [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) of interventions concluded that the modest benefit of propionyl-L-carnitine on walking performance was equivalent or superior to that obtained with drugs approved for claudication in the US (e.g., pentoxyphylline, cilostazol) yet inferior to improvements seen with supervised exercise interventions [(69, 70)](#reference69). L-Carnitine and short/medium-chain acylcarnitine molecules are removed from the circulation during [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis). Both L-carnitine loss into the dialysate and impaired synthesis by the kidneys contribute to a progressive carnitine deficiency in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) [(71)](#reference71). The low clearance of long-chain acylcarnitine molecules leads to a high acylcarnitine-to-L-carnitine ratio that has been associated with a higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) mortality [(72)](#reference72). Carnitine depletion in patients undergoing hemodialysis may lead to various conditions, such as muscle weakness and fatigue, [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [lipid](../glossary#lipid) abnormalities, and refractory [anemia](../glossary#anemia). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 31 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in a total of 1,734 patients with ESRD found that L-carnitine treatment \u2014 administered either orally or [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) \u2014 resulted in reductions of [serum](../glossary#serum) [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (a marker of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and predictor of mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis) and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), although the latter was not deemed to be clinically relevant [(73)](#reference73). There was no effect of L-carnitine on other serum [lipids](../glossary#lipid) (i.e., total and anemia-related indicators (i.e., [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentration, [hematocrit](../glossary#hematocrit), albumin, and required dose of recombinant [erythropoietin](../glossary#erythropoietin)) [(73)](#reference73). The US National Kidney Foundation did not recommend routine administration of L-carnitine to subjects undergoing dialysis yet encouraged the development of trials in patients with select symptoms that do not respond to standard therapy, i.e., persistent muscle cramps or hypotension during dialysis, severe fatigue, skeletal muscle weakness or [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy), [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy), and anemia requiring large doses of erythropoietin [(74, 75)](#reference74). Finally, the use of L-carnitine (10-20 mg/kg body weight given as a slow bolus injection) is approved by the US FDA to treat L-carnitine deficiency in subjects with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis [(76)](#reference76). The use of certain antiretroviral agents ( [nucleoside](../glossary#nucleoside) [analogs](../glossary#analog)) has been associated with an increased developing [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy) in [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-positive individuals [(77, 78)](#reference77). Small, uncontrolled, [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial) intervention studies have suggested a beneficial effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) in patients with painful neuropathies. An early uncontrolled study found that 10 out of 16 HIV-positive subjects with painful neuropathy reported improvement after three weeks of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) or intramuscular ALCAR treatment [(79)](#reference79). Results from another uncontrolled intervention in 21 HIV-positive patients suggested that long-term (two to four years) oral ALCAR supplementation (1.5 g/day) may be a beneficial [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to antiretroviral therapy to improve neuropathic symptoms in some HIV-infected individuals [(80, 81)](#reference80). Additionally, two small studies in participants presenting with antiretroviral-induced neuropathy found significant reduction in subjects' mean pain intensity with oral ALCAR (1-3 g/day) for 4 to 24 weeks, but no effect on objective neurophysiological parameters was found [(82, 83)](#reference82). A [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 90 HIV-positive patients with symptomatic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy found no benefit of intramuscular injection with 1 g/day of ALCAR for two weeks in the intention-to-treat analysis, but there was some pain relief in the group of 66 patients who completed the trial [(84)](#reference84). Large-scale, controlled studies are needed before any conclusions can be drawn. Peripheral nerve dysfunction occurs in about 50% of people with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and chronic neuropathic pain is present in about one-third of people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy [(85)](#reference85). Advanced stages of diabetic peripheral neuropathy can lead to recurrent foot ulcers and infections, and eventually amputations [(86)](#reference86). A 2019 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) [(87)](#reference87) identified three [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled interventions that examined of oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR; 1.5-3.0 g/day for one with diabetic peripheral neuropathy [(3](#reference3), [88)](#reference88). Low-quality evidence suggested a lower level of pain with ALCAR, as measured with a visual scale analog. Low-quality evidence from another trial that compared the effect of ALCAR (1.5 g/day) with that of [methylcobalamin](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) (1.5 mg/day) for 24 weeks suggested no difference between treatments regarding the extent of functional disability (using the Neuropathy Disability Scale) or measures of symptom quality and severity (using the Neuropathy Symptom Scale) [(89)](#reference89). A few [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have examined whether ALCAR might help prevent or treat [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy)-induced peripheral neuropathy. A trial in 150 participants with either ovarian [cancer](../glossary#cancer) or castration-resistant [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer found no evidence that ALCAR (1g every 3 days) given with the anticancer drug sagopilone (for up to six cycles of treatment) reduced the overall risk of peripheral neuropathy compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(90)](#reference90). However, ALCAR reduced the risk of high-grade sagopilone-induced neuropathy [(90)](#reference90). In contrast, another trial in 409 women with breast cancer found that ALCAR (3 g/day for 24 weeks) increased anticancer drug (taxanes)-induced peripheral neuropathy and decreased measures of functional status compared to placebo [(91)](#reference91). A follow-up study reported that the negative impact of 24-week treatment with ALCAR was still observed at week 52; however, no differences between ALCAR and placebo were apparent at week 104 [(92)](#reference92). Finally, one trial in 239 participants already suffering from chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy reported a reduction in the severity of neuropathic symptoms with ALCAR (3 g/day for eight weeks) compared to placebo [(93)](#reference93). Improvements in electrophysiological parameters were also observed with ALCAR treatment [(93)](#reference93). The results from these trials are conflicting and thus difficult to interpret. The efficacy of ALCAR in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy remains to be established [(94)](#reference94). A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) identified 12 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including 791 participants, that examined the effect of ALCAR on symptoms of depression [(95)](#reference95). Evidence from nine trials suggested a reduction in depressive symptoms with ALCAR (3 g/day for a median 8 weeks) compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo). Three trials that compared ALCAR treatment (1-3 g/day for 7-12 weeks) and antidepressant medications found ALCAR was as effective as antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms [(95)](#reference95). Another meta-analysis of trials that compared the safety profile of antidepressants found evidence of fewer adverse effects, and consequently, better adherence to treatment with ALCAR compared to placebo and in contrast to classical pharmaceutical agents [(96)](#reference96). The metabolomic profiling of acylcarnitine molecules showed variations in serum concentrations of subjects along the continuum from [cognitively](../glossary#cognitive) healthy to affected by [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) [(97)](#reference97). Changes in the blood concentrations of specific acylcarnitines in subjects with either subjective memory complaints, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease, compared to cognitively healthy peers may reflect changes in the transport of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) into the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) and/or impairments in energy production. Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) conducted in the 1990s examined the effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) treatment on the cognitive performance of patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Early, small trials suggested a beneficial effect of ALCAR with respect to cognitive decline [(98-100)](#reference98), whereas later, larger trials found little-to-no effect compared to placebo [(101-103)](#reference101). However, a 2003 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) highlighted differences in methodologies between early and later studies that make it difficult to compare results [(104)](#reference104). Nevertheless, the pooled analysis of 16 trials suggested improvements in the summary measure of patients' global functioning (assessed with the Clinical Global Impressions [CGI-I] scale) after 12 and 24 weeks of (but not after 52 weeks) of ALCAR treatment (1-3 g/day) and in cognitive performance (assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] scale) after 24 weeks (but not at 12 or 52 weeks) [(104)](#reference104). A 2003 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 21 trials found that ALCAR was superior to placebo in several psychometric tests assessing global patient functioning, attention, memory, and some intellectual functions [(105)](#reference105). [Hepatic encephalopathy](../glossary#hepatic-encephalopathy) refers to the occurrence of a spectrum of neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms in individuals with acute or chronic liver disease [(106)](#reference106). [Subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) hepatic encephalopathy may not feature any symptoms beyond abnormal behavior on psychometric tests or symptoms that are nonspecific in nature. In contract, overt hepatic encephalopathy can present with disorientation, obvious personality change, inappropriate behavior, somnolence, stupor, confusion, and coma [(106)](#reference106). Changes in mental status are thought to be caused by the liver failing to detoxify neurotoxic compounds like ammonia. A 2019 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of five [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials conducted by one group of investigators examined the effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) in 398 participants with [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) and portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the portal vein) and presenting with either subclinical or overt hepatic encephalopathy. ALCAR was either administered orally (4 g/day for 90 days) in four trials or [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) (4 g/day for three days) in one trial. ALCAR was found to significantly reduce blood ammonium concentration compared to placebo. However, none of the trials reported on serious adverse outcomes, including mortality. Additionally, the evidence was too limited to assess the impact on quality of life or mental and physical fatigue. Fatigue is not uncommon in people who have undergone [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) and survived [cancer](../glossary#cancer), with fatigue symptoms depending on the specific type of cancer and treatment. Cancer-related fatigue can persist well beyond the end of chemotherapy and be associated with [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) and functional decline, insomnia, depression, and a reduction in the quality of life [(107)](#reference107). A 2017 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) identified 12 the effect of L-carnitine or ALCAR on cancer-related fatigue (reported as a primary or secondary outcome) in cancer survivors [(108)](#reference108). Three studies had no control arm, eight studies were [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), and eight studies included fewer than 100 participants. Overall, only three studies were deemed of good quality. The meta-analysis of these three [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found no effect of L-carnitine (0.25-4 g/day for 1 week to 3 months) or ALCAR (3 g/day for 6 months) on the level of cancer-related fatigue [(108)](#reference108). L-Carnitine is concentrated in the [epididymis](../glossary#epididymis), where sperm mature and acquire their motility [(109)](#reference109). An early [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 101 fertile and infertile men found that L-carnitine concentrations in semen were positively correlated with the number of sperm, the percentage of motile sperm, and the percentage of normal appearing sperm in the sample [(110)](#reference110), suggesting that L-carnitine may play an important role in male fertility. One [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in 86 subjects with fertility issues found that supplementation with L-carnitine (2 g/day) for two months improved sperm quality, as evidenced by increases in sperm concentration and motility [(111)](#reference111). In another placebo-controlled trial conducted by the same group, similar improvements in sperm motility were observed in participants supplemented with 2g/day of L-carnitine and 1 g/day of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) for six months [(112)](#reference112). In both trials, the effect of carnitine was greater in the most severe cases of asthenozoospermia (reduced sperm motility) at baseline [(111, 112)](#reference111). Another [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) study in 44 men with [idiopathic](../glossary#idiopathic) asthenozoospermia found an increase in sperm motility in those given ALCAR alone (3 g/day) or ALCAR (1 g/day) plus L-carnitine (2 g/day) compared to those given L-carnitine alone (2 g/day) or a placebo [(113)](#reference113). However, a pooled analysis of the two trials that employed ALCAR found no significant effect of ALCAR and L-carnitine on sperm concentration, motility, and morphology [(114)](#reference114). Evidence from larger scale [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) is still needed to determine whether L-carnitine and ALCAR could play a role in the treatment of male infertility. Frailty is a syndrome [prevalent](../glossary#prevalent) among geriatric populations and characterized by a functional decline and a loss of independence to perform the activities of daily living. Frailty in individuals may include at least three of the following symptoms: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion (poor endurance), weakness (low grip strength), slowness, and physical inactivity [(115)](#reference115). It is believed that early stages of frailty are amenable to interventions that could avert adverse outcomes, including the increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hospitalization and premature death [(116)](#reference116). The suggestion that carnitine deficiency may lead to frailty through [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction [(117)](#reference117) has been examined in one trial. This [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 58 older adults identified as \"pre-frail\" found an decrease in a Frailty Index score and an improvement in the hand grip test in individuals supplemented with L-carnitine (1.5 g/day) over 10 weeks but not in those given a placebo [(118)](#reference118). However, there was no difference in Frailty Index and hand grip test scores between supplemental L-carnitine and placebo groups. Loss of skeletal muscle mass is associated with a decrease in muscle strength and occurs with aging [(119)](#reference119), as well as in several [pathological](../glossary#pathology) conditions [(120-122)](#reference120). Based on preclinical studies, it has been suggested that L-carnitine supplementation could limit the imbalance between protein anabolism (synthesis) and [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) (degradation) that leads to skeletal muscle wasting [(42)](#reference42). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 28 older women (ages, 65-70 years) found no effect of L-carnitine supplementation (1.5 g/day for 24 weeks) on [serum](../glossary#serum) pro-inflammatory [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine) concentrations, body mass and composition (lean [fat-free] mass and skeletal muscle mass), or measures of skeletal muscle strength [(123)](#reference123). In contrast, a [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) cohort study in patients with [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) found a reduced rate of skeletal muscle loss over at least six months in those who were administered L-carnitine (N=35; mean dose, 1.02 g/day) compared to those who were not [(124)](#reference124). Of note, supplementation with L-carnitine was given in patients with cirrhosis to control hyperammonemia (N=27), to reduce muscle cramps (N=6), or to prevent carnitine deficiency (N=2). One major limitation of this study beyond its retrospective design is that patients who received L-carnitine had a significantly different clinical presentation; in particular, liver dysfunction was significantly more severe in these patients than in those who were not supplemented [(124)](#reference124). Muscle cramps are involuntary and painful contractions of skeletal muscles. Two uncontrolled studies conducted in participants with [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) found that L-carnitine [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) was safe to use at doses of 0.9 to 1.2 g/day for eight weeks [(125)](#reference125) and 1 g/day for 24 weeks [(126)](#reference126) and might be considered to control the frequency of cramps. However, whether supplemental L-carnitine can be efficacious to limit the incidence of muscle cramps in patients with cirrhosis remains unknown. An [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), non-randomized trial in 69 patients with either type 1 or type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found a reduction in the incidence of muscle cramps and an improvement in the quality of life of those prescribed 0.6 g/day of L-carnitine for four months compared to controls [(127)](#reference127). In contrast, there is little evidence to date to suggest that supplemental L-carnitine could reduce muscle cramps in patients undergoing [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) [(128)](#reference128). Well-designed trials are necessary to examine whether L-carnitine could be helpful in the management of cramps. Interest in the potential of L-carnitine supplementation to improve athletic performance is related to its important roles in energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). A number of small, poorly controlled studies have reported that either acute (dose given one hour before exercise bout) or short-term (two to three weeks) supplementation with L-carnitine (2 to 4 g/day) supported energy production, cardiorespiratory fitness, and endurance capacity during physical exercise (reviewed in [129](#reference129)). However, in a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 32 healthy adults, propionyl-L-carnitine (1 g/day or 3 g/day) for eight weeks did not improve aerobic or anaerobic exercise performance [(130)](#reference130). An intervention study compared the effect of L-carnitine supplementation (2 g/day for 12 weeks) on [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and skeletal muscle carnitine concentrations and physical performance between 16 vegetarian and 8 omnivorous male participants [(131)](#reference131). At baseline, plasma carnitine concentration was about 10% lower in vegetarian compared to omnivorous participants. However, the content carnitine in skeletal muscle, phosphocreatine, [ATP](../glossary#ATP), [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen), and lactate, as well as measures of physical performance during exercise were equivalent between vegetarians and omnivores. While L-carnitine supplementation normalized plasma carnitine concentration in vegetarians to that observed in omnivores, there was no effect on energy metabolism and physical performance compared to no supplementation and between vegetarians and omnivores [(131)](#reference131). The normal rate of L-carnitine [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) in humans ranges from 0.16 to 0.48 mg/kg of body weight/day [(4)](#reference4). Thus, a 70 kg (154 1b) person would synthesize between 11 and 34 mg of carnitine per day. This rate of synthesis, combined with efficient (95%) L-carnitine reabsorption by the kidneys, is sufficient to prevent deficiency in generally healthy people, including strict vegetarians [(132)](#reference132). Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products are the richest sources of L-carnitine, while fruit, vegetables, and grains contain relatively little L-carnitine. Omnivorous diets have been found to provide 23 to 135 mg/day of L-carnitine for an average 70 kg person, while strict vegetarian diets may provide as little as 1 mg/day for a 70 kg person [(8)](#reference8). Between 54% and 86% of L-carnitine from food is absorbed, compared to 5%-25% from oral supplements (0.6-7 g/day) [(13)](#reference13). Non-milk-based infant formulas (e.g., soy formulas) should be [fortified](../glossary#fortification) so that they contain 11 mg/L of L-carnitine. Some carnitine-rich foods and their carnitine content in milligrams (mg) are of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.| Intravenous L-carnitine is available by prescription only for the treatment of primary and secondary L-carnitine deficiencies [(76)](#reference76). Oral L-carnitine is available by prescription for the treatment of primary and secondary L-carnitine deficiencies [(76)](#reference76). It is also available without a prescription as a nutritional [supplement](../glossary#supplement); supplemental doses usually range from 0.5 to 2 g/day. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is available without a prescription as a nutritional [supplement](../glossary#supplement). In addition to providing L-carnitine, it provides [acetyl](../glossary#acetylation) groups that may be used in the formation of the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter), acetylcholine. Supplemental doses usually range from 0.5 to 2 g/day [(133)](#reference133). Propionyl-L-carnitine is not approved by the US FDA for use as a drug to prevent or treat any condition. It is, however, available without prescription as a nutritional [supplement](../glossary#supplement). See [Figure 1](#figure-1) for the chemical structures of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine. In general, L-carnitine appears to be well tolerated; no toxic effects have been reported in relation to intakes of high doses of L-carnitine. L-Carnitine [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may cause mild [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Supplements providing more than 3 g/day may cause a \"fishy\" body odor. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) has been reported to increase agitation in some [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) patients [(133)](#reference133). Despite claims that L-carnitine or ALCAR might increase [seizures](../glossary#seizure) in some individuals with seizure disorders [(133)](#reference133), these are not supported by any scientific evidence [(134)](#reference134). Only the L- [isomer](../glossary#isomer) of carnitine is biologically active; the D-isomer may actually compete with L-carnitine for absorption and transport, thereby increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of L-carnitine deficiency [(4)](#reference4). Supplements containing a mixture of the D- and L-isomers (D,L-carnitine) have been associated with muscle weakness in patients with kidney disease. Long-term studies examining the safety of ALCAR supplementation in pregnant and breast-feeding women are lacking [(133)](#reference133). Pivalic acid combines with L-carnitine and is [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine as pivaloylcarnitine, thereby increasing L-carnitine losses (see also [Secondary carnitine deficiency](#secondary-deficiency)). valproic acid (Depakene) interferes with L-carnitine [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) the liver and forms with L-carnitine a valproylcarnitine [ester](../glossary#ester) that is excreted in the urine. However, L-carnitine supplements are necessary only in a subset of patients taking valproic acid. Risk factors for L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid include young age (<2 years), severe [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) problems, use of multiple antiepileptic drugs, poor nutrition, and consumption of a ketogenic diet [(135)](#reference135). There is insufficient evidence to suggest that [nucleoside](../glossary#nucleoside) analogs used in the treatment (i.e., ifosfamide, cisplatin) increase the risk of secondary L-carnitine deficiency [(135)](#reference135).

Carnitine: Accessed 7/1/19.] Contents Coenzyme Q10 is a member of the ubiquinone family of compounds. All animals, including humans, can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) ubiquinones, hence, coenzyme Q10 is not considered a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [(1)](#references). The name ubiquinone refers to the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in living organisms and their chemical structure, which contains a functional group known as a benzoquinone. Ubiquinones are fat-soluble molecules with anywhere from 1 to 12 isoprene (5-carbon) units. The ubiquinone found in humans, ubidecaquinone or coenzyme Q10, has a \"tail\" of 10 isoprene units (a total of 50 carbon atoms) attached to its benzoquinone \"head\" (Figure 1) [(1).](#references) Coenzyme Q10 is [soluble](../glossary#soluble) in (fats) and in virtually all [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), including [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) membranes. The ability of the benzoquinone head group of coenzyme Q10 to accept and donate [electrons](../glossary#electron) is a critical feature to its function. Coenzyme Q10 can exist in three [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) states (Figure 1): (i) the fully [reduced](../glossary#reduction) ubiquinol form, CoQ10H2; (ii) the radical semiquinone intermediate, CoQ10H\u00b7; and (iii) the fully oxidized ubiquinone form, CoQ10. The conversion of energy from [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and fats to [ATP](../glossary#ATP), the form of energy used by cells, requires the presence of coenzyme Q10 in the inner [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) membrane. As part mitochondrial [electron transport chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain), coenzyme Q10 accepts during [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) and [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and then transfers them to electron acceptors. At the same time, coenzyme Q10 contributes to transfer [protons](../glossary#proton) (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy released when the protons flow back into the mitochondrial interior is used to form ATP (Figure 2) [(1)](#references). In addition to its role in ATP synthesis, mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 mediates the oxidation of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. [Lysosomes](../glossary#lysosome) are [organelles](../glossary#organelle) within cells that are specialized for the digestion of cellular debris. The digestive [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) within lysosomes function optimally at an [acidic](../glossary#acidic) [pH](../glossary#pH), meaning they require a permanent supply of [protons](../glossary#proton). The lysosomal membranes that separate those digestive enzymes from the rest of the cell contain relatively high concentrations of coenzyme Q10. Research suggests that coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in the transport of protons across lysosomal membranes to maintain the membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) and [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) from [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation). The presence of a significant amount of CoQ10H2 in cell membranes, along with [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) capable of reducing oxidized CoQ10 back to CoQ10H2 (i.e., NAD(P)H oxidoreductases), supports the idea that CoQ10H2 is an important cellular antioxidant [(4)](#reference4). CoQ10H2 has been found to inhibit [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) when cell membranes and [low-density lipoproteins](../glossary#LDL) (LDL) are exposed to oxidizing conditions. When LDL is oxidized, CoQ10H2 is the first antioxidant consumed. In isolated [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria), coenzyme Q10 can protect membrane [proteins](../glossary#protein) and mitochondrial the oxidative damage that accompanies lipid peroxidation [(5)](#reference5). Moreover, when present, CoQ10H2 was found to limit the formation of oxidized [lipids](../glossary#lipid) and the consumption of -tocopherol (a form of [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) with antioxidant properties) in addition coenzyme Q10 as an antioxidant is also exemplified by recent evidence showing that mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 deficiency causes an increased production of mitochondrial superoxide radical anion (O2-) which might be driving insulin adipose tissues [(7)](#reference7). -Tocopherol -tocopherol radical](../glossary#free-radical), as a lipid peroxyl radical (LOO\u00b7), it becomes [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) itself, forming -TO\u00b7, which can in turn promote the oxidation of lipoproteins under certain conditions in the test tube, thus propagating a chain reaction. However, when the [reduced](../glossary#reduction) form Q10 radical (CoQ10H\u00b7) is formed. It is possible for CoQ10H\u00b7 to react with oxygen (O2) to produce superoxide anion radical (O2\u00b7-), which is a less reactive [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant) than LOO\u00b7. However, CoQ10H\u00b7 can also reduce -TO\u00b7 back to -TOH, resulting in the formation of fully oxidized coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which does not react with O2\u00b7- (Figure 3) [(6, 8)](#reference6). Coenzyme Q10 deficiency has not been described in the general population, so it is generally assumed that normal [biosynthesis](../glossary#synthesis), with or without a varied diet, provides sufficient coenzyme Q10 to sustain energy production in healthy individuals [(9)](#reference9). Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway. To date, mutations in at least nine of these genes have been identified [(1)](#references). As a result, primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a clinically [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) disorder that includes five major phenotypes: (i) severe infantile multi-systemic disease, (ii) encephalomyopathy, (iii) cerebellar [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), (iv) isolated (v) nephrotic syndrome. Whereas most [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) disorders are hardly amenable to treatments, oral coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been shown to improve muscular symptoms in some (yet not all) patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency [(10)](#reference10). [Neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in patients with [(10)](#reference10). Secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency results from mutations or deletions in genes that are not directly related to coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway. Evidence of secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency has been reported in several mitochondrial disorders, such as mitochondrial [DNA](../glossary#DNA) depletion syndrome, Kearns-Sayre (MADD) [(10)](#reference10). Secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency has also been identified in non-mitochondrial disorders, such as cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Niemann-Pick-type C disease [(11)](#reference11). Because the therapeutic potential of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 is limited to its capacity to restore [electron](../glossary#electron) transfer in a defective mitochondrial respiratory chain and/or to increase [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) defense, patients with secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency may fail to respond to supplementation (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Coenzyme Q10 concentrations have been found to decline gradually with age in a number of different tissues [(5](#reference5), [12)](#reference12), but it is unclear whether this age-associated decline constitutes a deficiency (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(13)](#reference13). Decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of coenzyme individuals [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) (see activity 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (statins), inhibitors [statins]](#statins)), although it remains unproven that this has any clinical implications. According to the [free radical](../glossary#free-radical) and [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) theories of aging, [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) of cell structures by [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) plays an important role in the functional declines that accompany aging [(14)](#reference14). ROS are generated by mitochondria as a byproduct of [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production. If not neutralized by [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), ROS may damage mitochondria over time, causing them to function less efficiently and to generate more damaging ROS in a self-perpetuating cycle. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in mitochondrial ATP synthesis and functions as an antioxidant in mitochondrial membranes (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). One of the hallmarks of aging is a decline in energy metabolism in many tissues, especially liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Tissue concentrations of coenzyme Q10 have been found to decline with age, thereby accompanying age-related declines in energy metabolism [(12)](#reference12). Early animal studies have not been able to demonstrate an effect of lifelong dietary [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 on the lifespan of rats or mice [(15-17)](#reference15). Nonetheless, more recent studies have suggested that supplemental coenzyme Q10 could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and delay senescence in transgenic mice [(19)](#reference19). Presently, there is limited scientific evidence to suggest that coenzyme Q10 supplementation prolongs life or prevents age-related functional declines in humans. In a small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), elderly individuals (>70 years) who received a combination of selenium (100 \u00b5g/day) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) for four years reported an improvement in vitality, physical performance, and quality of life [(20)](#reference20). Further, a 12-year follow-up of these participants showed a reduction in [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) mortality with supplemental selenium and coenzyme [low-density lipoproteins](../glossary#LDL) (LDL) in arterial walls is thought to represent an early event leading to the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis). Reduced coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10H2) inhibits the oxidation of LDL in the test tube ( [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro)) and works together with -tocopherol (-TOH) LDL oxidation by regenerating -TO\u00b7 back to -TOH. In the absence of a co- [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), such as CoQ10H2 or vitamin C, -TO\u00b7 can, under certain conditions, promote the oxidation of LDL in vitro [(6)](#reference6). [Supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 increases the concentration of CoQ10H2 in human LDL [(22)](#reference22). Studies in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, an animal model found lipoprotein oxidation in the blood vessel wall and the formation of atherosclerotic lesions [(23)](#reference23). Interestingly, co-supplementation of these mice with -TOH and coenzyme Q10 was more effective in inhibiting atherosclerosis supplementation with either -TOH or coenzyme Q10 alone [(24)](#reference24). Another important step in the development of atherosclerosis is the recruitment of immune cells known as [monocytes](../glossary#monocyte) into the blood vessel walls. This recruitment is dependent in part on monocyte expression of cell adhesion molecules (integrins). Supplementation of 10 healthy men and women with 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for 10 weeks resulted in significant decreases in monocyte expression of integrins, suggesting another potential mechanism for the coenzyme Q10 inhibitor of LDL oxidation and atherosclerosis, more research is needed to determine whether coenzyme Q10 supplementation can inhibit the development or progression of atherosclerosis in humans. Inherited coenzyme Q10 deficiencies are rare diseases that are clinically and genetically [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). In individuals with primary coenzyme in adults) may improve the [pathological](../glossary#pathology) phenotype, yet the effectiveness depends on the type of [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic coenzyme Q10 essential to limit irreversible organ damage in coenzyme Q10-responsive deficiencies [(1)](#references). It is not clear to what extent coenzyme Q10 supplementation might have therapeutic benefit in patients with inherited secondary Q10 deficiencies. For example, multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), caused by mutations in [genes](../glossary#gene) that impair the activity of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron) from acyl-CoA to coenzyme Q10, is usually responsive to [riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin) [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) yet patients with low coenzyme Q10 concentrations might benefit from co-supplementation with coenzyme Q10 and riboflavin [(27)](#reference27). Another study suggested clinical improvements in secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency with supplemental coenzyme Q10 in patients presenting with [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia) [(28)](#reference28). Because the cause of secondary coenzyme Q10 in inherited conditions is generally unknown, it is difficult to predict whether improving coenzyme Q10 status with supplemental coenzyme Q10 would lead to clinical benefits for the patients. Finally, coenzyme Q10 deficiency can be secondary to the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statin drugs (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six small, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no reduction in statin-induced muscle pain with 100 to 400 mg/day of supplemental coenzyme Q10 for one to three months [(29)](#reference29). The trials failed to establish a diagnosis of relative coenzyme Q10 deficiency before the [intervention](../glossary#intervention-trial) started, hence limiting the conclusion of the meta-analysis. While statin therapy may not necessary lead to a reduction in circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations, further research needs to examine whether secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency might be predisposing patients to statin-induced [myalgia](../glossary#myalgia) [(30)](#reference30). Impairment of the heart's ability to pump enough blood for all of the body's needs is known as [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure). In [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), accumulation of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaque in the [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-arteries) may prevent parts of the cardiac muscle from getting adequate blood supply, ultimately resulting in heart damage and impaired pumping ability. Heart failure can also be caused by [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), diseases of the heart valves, [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy), and [congenital](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) heart diseases. Because physical exercise increases the demand on the weakened heart, measures of exercise tolerance are frequently used to monitor the severity of heart failure. [Echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography) is also used to determine the left [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) ejection fraction, an objective measure of the heart's pumping ability [(31)](#reference31). A study of 1,191 heart failure patients found that low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration was a good [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of advanced heart disease [(32)](#reference32). A number of small [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) that administered [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 to congestive heart failure patients have been conducted. A 2014 literature review identified seven small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examining the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation (60-200 mg/day for 3 months in most trials) in heart failure patients [(33)](#reference33). Pooling data from some of the trials showed an increase in [serum](../glossary#serum) coenzyme Q10 concentrations (three studies) but no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (two studies) or exercise capacity (two studies) [(33)](#reference33). However, a recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in 2,149 participants with heart failure found that supplemental coenzyme Q10 (30-300 mg/day) resulted in a 39% reduction in mortality (seven studies), improved exercise capacity (four studies), but had no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (nine studies) compared to placebo [(34)](#reference34). A trial is presently being conducted to assess the value of supplemental coenzyme Q10 and/or D-ribose in the treatment of congestive heart failure in patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction [(35)](#reference35). The heart muscle may become oxygen-deprived ( [ischemic](../glossary#ischemia)) as the result of [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or during cardiac surgery. Increased generation of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) when the heart muscle's oxygen supply is restored (reperfusion) might be an important contributor to myocardial damage occurring during ischemia-reperfusion [(36)](#reference36). Pretreatment of animals with coenzyme Q10 has been found to preserve myocardial function following ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing [ATP](../glossary#ATP) concentration, enhancing [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage), regulating [autophagy](../glossary#autophagy), and reducing cardiomyocyte [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) [(37)](#reference37). Another potential source of ischemia-reperfusion injury is aortic clamping during some types of cardiac surgery, such as [coronary artery bypass graft](../glossary#coronary-artery-bypass-graft) (CABG) surgery. (60-300 mg/day for 7-14 days prior to surgery) provided some benefit in short-term outcome measures after CABG surgery [(38, 39)](#reference38). In a small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 30 patients, oral administration of coenzyme Q10 for 7 to 10 days before CABG surgery reduced the need for mediastinal drainage, [platelet](../glossary#platelet) transfusion, and positive inotropic drugs (e.g. dopamine) and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia) within 24 hours post-surgery [(40)](#reference40). In one trial that did not find preoperative coenzyme Q10 supplementation to be of benefit, patients were treated with 600 mg of coenzyme Q10 12 hours prior to surgery [(41)](#reference41), suggesting that preoperative coenzyme Q10 treatment may need to commence at least one week prior to CABG surgery to improve surgical outcomes. The combined two weeks before CABG surgery and four weeks after was examined in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trial in 117 patients with heart failure [(42)](#reference42). The treatment resulted in lower concentration of troponin-I (a marker of cardiac injury), shorter length of hospital stay, and reduced risk of postoperative transient cardiac dysfunction compared to placebo [(42)](#reference42). Although trials have included relatively few people and examined mostly short-term, post-surgical outcomes, the results are promising [(43)](#reference43). [Coronary angioplasty](../glossary#angiography) (also called percutaneous coronary intervention) is a nonsurgical procedure for treating obstructive [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), including unstable [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris), acute [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), and multivessel coronary heart disease. Angioplasty involves temporarily inserting and inflating a tiny balloon into the clogged artery to help restore the blood flow to the heart. Periprocedural myocardial injury that occurs in up to one-third of patients undergoing otherwise uncomplicated angioplasty increases the risk of morbidity and mortality at follow-up. A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) followed 55 patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (a type of heart attack characterized by the death of some myocardial tissue) who underwent angioplasty [(44)](#reference44). [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration month correlated with less [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and predicted favorable left ventricular end-systolic volume remodeling at six months [(44)](#reference44). One [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) has examined the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on periprocedural myocardial injury in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty [(45)](#reference45). The administration of 300 mg of coenzyme Q10 12 hours before the angioplasty to 50 patients reduced the concentration of [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) ([CRP]; a marker of inflammation) within 24 hours following the procedure compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo). However, there was no difference in concentrations of two markers of myocardial injury (creatine kinase and troponin-I) or in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events one month after angioplasty between active treatment and placebo [(45)](#reference45). Additional trials are needed to examine whether coenzyme Q10 therapy can improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Myocardial [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) may also lead to chest pain known as [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris). People with angina pectoris often experience symptoms when the demand for oxygen exceeds the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver it to the heart muscle, e.g., during exercise. Five small [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies have examined the effects of oral coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (60-600 mg/day) in addition to conventional medical therapy in patients with chronic stable angina [(46)](#reference46). In most of the studies, coenzyme Q10 supplementation improved exercise tolerance and reduced or delayed [electrocardiographic](../glossary#electrocardiogram) changes associated with myocardial ischemia compared to placebo. However, only two of the studies found significant decreases in symptom frequency and use of nitroglycerin with coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Presently, there is only limited evidence suggesting that coenzyme Q10 supplementation would be a useful [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to conventional angina therapy. Very few high-quality trials have examined the potential therapeutic benefit of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in the treatment of primary review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified two small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials that found little evidence of a reduction in [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) or [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) following the administration of coenzyme Q10 (100-200 mg/day) for three months [(47)](#reference47). In contrast, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that used less stringent selection criteria included 17 small trials and found evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of coenzyme Q10 in patients with [cardiovascular metabolic disorders [(48)](#reference48). The effect of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure needs to be examined in large, well-designed [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). [Endothelial dysfunction: Normally blood vessel relaxation ( [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation)) when needed (for example, during exercise) and inhibits the formation of blood clots. [Atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) is associated with impairment of vascular endothelial function, thereby compromising vasodilation and normal blood flow. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in individuals with elevated serum [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, as well as in patients with [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). A 2012 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) examining the results of five small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 194 subjects in total found that supplemental coenzyme Q10 (150-300 mg/day for 4 to 12 weeks) resulted in a clinically significant, 1.7% increase in flow-dependent endothelial-mediated dilation [(49)](#reference49). Evidence from larger studies is needed to further establish the effect of coenzyme Q10 on endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Inflammation: Several in patients at increased [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) risk or with established cardiovascular disease have examined the effect of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 for 3 months on circulating [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) markers i.e., [CRP](../glossary#c-reactive-protein), interleukin-6, and/or tumor necrosis factor-. Recently published pooled analyses of these trials have given mixed results [(50-52)](#reference50). Larger studies are needed to examine the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on low-grade inflammation. Blood lipids: Elevated an independent [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six controlled trials (of which five were randomized) in 409 participants found a reduction in plasma lipoprotein(a) concentration with coenzyme Q10 supplementation Q10 on blood lipids have not been reported [(51, 53, 54)](#reference51). A therapeutic approach combining coenzyme Q10 with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) might prove to be more effective to target co-existing metabolic disorders in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease [(55)](#reference55). [Diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) is a condition of increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of reduced coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10H2) have been found to be lower in diabetic patients than healthy controls after normalization to plasma [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations [(56, 57)](#reference56). [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) found little evidence of benefits on glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six trials in participants with type 2 diabetes and one trial in participants with type 1 diabetes found that 100 to 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for three to six months lowered neither fasting plasma [glucose](../glossary#glucose) nor levels of [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) ([HbA1c]; a measure of glycemic control). Maternally inherited diabetes mellitus-deafness syndrome (MIDD) is caused by a [mutation](../glossary#mutation) in [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [DNA](../glossary#DNA), which is inherited exclusively from one's mother. MIDD accounts for less than 1% of all cases of diabetes. Some early evidence suggested that long-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation (150 mg/day) may improve [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion and prevent progressive hearing loss in these patients [(58, 59)](#reference58). Of note, the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus involves the early onset of [glucose intolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and hyperinsulinemia associated with the progressive loss of tissue responsiveness to insulin. Recent experimental studies tied [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) to a decrease in coenzyme Q10 expression and supplementation might thus be a more useful tool for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes rather than for its management. [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) is a degenerative [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) disorder characterized by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow movements. It is estimated to affect approximately 1% of Americans over the age of 65. [Mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra may play a role in the development of the disease [(60)](#reference60). Decreased ratios of [reduced](../glossary#reduction)-to- [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) coenzyme Q10 have been in [platelets](../glossary#platelet) of individuals with Parkinson's disease [(61, 62)](#reference61). One study also found higher concentrations of oxidized coenzyme Q10 in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of patients with untreated Parkinson's disease compared to healthy controls [(63)](#reference63). Additionally, a study in postmortem Parkinson's disease patients found lower concentrations of total coenzyme Q10 in the cortex region of the brain compared to age-matched controls, but no differences were seen in other brain areas, including the striatum, clinical trial](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) evaluated the safety and efficacy of 300, 600, or 1,200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 in 80 people with early Parkinson's disease [(65)](#reference65). Coenzyme Q10 supplementation was well tolerated at all doses and resulted in a slower deterioration of function in Parkinson's disease patients in the group taking 1,200 mg/day. A [phase III clinical trial](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial) was then designed to further examine the effect of motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. This trial was prematurely terminated because it was unlikely that such a treatment was effective in treating Parkinson's disease [(66)](#reference66). A smaller placebo-controlled trial showed that oral administration of 300 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for 48 to 96 months moderately improved motor symptoms in treated patients (with Levodopa) with re-emerging symptoms but not in patients at an early stage of the disease [(67)](#reference67). Two recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of randomized, placebo-controlled trials found no evidence that coenzyme Q10 improved motor-related symptoms or delayed the progression of the disease when compared to placebo [(68, 69)](#reference68). [Huntington's disease](../glossary#huntington-disease) is an inherited [neurodegenerative disorder](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by selective degeneration of nerve cells known as striatal spiny neurons. Symptoms, such as movement disorders and impaired [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function, typically develop in the fourth decade of life and progressively deteriorate over time. Animal models indicate that impaired [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) function and [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate)-mediated neurotoxicity may be involved in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of Huntington's disease. Some, but not all, studies in mouse models of Huntington's disease have suggested that coenzyme Q10 supplementation could improve motor performance, overall survival, and various hallmarks of Huntington's disease, antagonist), the antibiotic minocycline, or creatine led to greater improvements in most biochemical and behavioral parameters [(70-72)](#reference70). To date, only two [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined whether coenzyme Q10 might be efficacious in human patients with Huntington's disease. A 30-month, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial of coenzyme Q10 (600 mg/day), remacemide, or both in 347 patients with early Huntington's disease found that neither coenzyme Q10 nor remacemide significantly altered the decline in total functional capacity, although coenzyme Q10 supplementation (with or without remacemide) resulted in a nonsignificant trend toward a slower decline [(73)](#reference73). A 20-week [pilot trial](../glossary#pilot-study) examined the safety and tolerability increasing dosages of coenzyme Q10 (1,200 mg/day, 2,400 mg/day, and 3,600 mg/day) in eight healthy subjects and in 20 patients with Huntington's disease; 22 of the subjects completed the study [(74)](#reference74). All dosages were generally well tolerated, with [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms being the most frequently reported adverse effect. Blood concentrations of coenzyme Q10 at the end of the study were maximized with the daily dose of 2,400 mg [(74)](#reference74). This dose was tested in a multicenter [phase III clinical trial](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial) in 609 participants with early-stage Huntington's disease. Participants were randomized to receive either 2,400 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 or placebo for five years [(75)](#reference75). The trial was prematurely halted because it appeared unlikely to demonstrate any health benefit in supplemented patients \u2014 about one-third of participants completed the trial at the time of study termination [(75)](#reference75). Although coenzyme Q10 is generally well tolerated, there is no evidence that supplementation can improve functional and cognitive symptoms in Huntington's disease the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) frataxin. Frataxin for the making of [iron](../minerals/iron)-sulfur clusters (ISC). ISC-containing subunits are especially important for the mitochondrial [respiratory for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing proteins [(76)](#reference76). Frataxin deficiency is associated with imbalances in iron-sulfur containing proteins, mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction and lower [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production, and accumulation of iron in the mitochondria, which increases [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to macromolecules of the respiratory chain [(77)](#reference77). Clinically, FRDA is a progressive disease characterized by [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), [areflexia](../glossary#areflexia), speech disturbance (dysarthria), sensory loss, to 10 FDRA patients found that energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of cardiac and skeletal muscle was improved after only three months of therapy [(78)](#reference78). Follow-up assessments at 47 months indicated that cardiac and skeletal muscle improvements were maintained and that FRDA patients showed significant increases in fractional shortening, a measure of cardiac function. Moreover, the therapy was effective at preventing the progressive decline of [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) function [(79)](#reference79). Another study reported both coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E deficiencies among FRDA patients and suggested that co-supplementation with both compounds, at doses as low as 30 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 and 4 IU/day of vitamin E, might improve disease symptoms [(80)](#reference80). Large-scale, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are necessary to determine whether coenzyme Q10, in conjunction with vitamin E, has therapeutic benefit in FRDA. At present, about one-half of patients use coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E [supplements](../glossary#supplement) despite the lack of proven therapeutic benefit [(77)](#reference77). Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs): SCAs are a group of rare [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) dominant [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by gait difficulty, loss of hand dexterity, dysarthria, and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline. SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 most common SCAs [(81)](#reference81). [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) coenzyme Q10 treatment of forearm skin [fibroblasts](../glossary#fibroblast) isolated from patients with SCA2 was found to reduce [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and normalize complex I and II-III [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) [(82)](#reference82). A cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 319 patients with SCAs (15 years) found no difference in the rate of disease progression over two years between those taking [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 (median dose, 600 mg/day) and nonusers [(81)](#reference81). interest in coenzyme Q10 as a potential therapeutic agent in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) was stimulated by an [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) that found that individuals with lung, [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and especially breast cancer were more likely to have low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentrations than healthy controls [(83)](#reference83). Two [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have explored the effect of coenzyme Q10 as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to conventional therapy for breast cancer. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 failed to improve measures of fatigue and quality of life in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer [(84)](#reference84) and in patients receiving [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) [(85)](#reference85). There is little evidence that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 improves athletic performance in healthy individuals. A few [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have examined the effects of 100 to 150 mg/day of supplemental coenzyme Q10 for three to eight weeks on physical performance in trained and untrained men. Most did not find significant differences between the group taking coenzyme Q10 and the group taking placebo with respect to measures of aerobic exercise performance, such as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and exercise time to exhaustion [(86-90)](#reference86). One study found the maximal cycling workload to be slightly (4%) increased after eight weeks of coenzyme Q10 supplementation compared to placebo, although measures of aerobic power were not increased [(91)](#reference91). Two studies actually found significantly greater improvement in measures of anaerobic [(87)](#reference87) and aerobic [(86)](#reference86) exercise performance with a placebo than with supplemental coenzyme Q10. More recent studies have suggested that coenzyme Q10 could help reduce both muscle damage-associated [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and low-grade [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) induced by strenuous exercise [(92-95)](#reference92). Studies on the effect of supplementation on physical performance in women are lacking, but there is little reason to suspect a gender difference in the response to coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Coenzyme Q10 is biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 involves three major steps: (1) synthesis of the benzoquinone structure from 4-hydroxybenzoate derived from either tyrosine or phenylalanine, two amino acids; (2) synthesis of the polyisoprenoid side chain from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) via the mevalonate pathway; and (3) the joining (condensation) of these two structures to form coenzyme Q10. In the mevalonate pathway, biosynthetic pathways of both coenzyme and pyridoxine ( [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6)), in the form of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, is required for the conversion of tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid that constitutes the first step in the biosynthesis of the benzoquinone structure of coenzyme Q10. It is not known to what extent the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway may be affected by inadequate pantothenic acid and/or vitamin B6 nutritional [status](../glossary#status). It has been estimated that dietary consumption contributes to about 25% of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10, but there are currently no specific dietary intake recommendations for coenzyme Q10 from the US National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) or other agencies [(96)](#reference96). The extent to which dietary consumption contributes to tissue coenzyme Q10 concentrations is not clear. Based on studies employing [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire), the average dietary intake of coenzyme Q10 is about 3 to 6 mg/day [(97)](#reference97). Rich sources of dietary coenzyme Q10 include mainly meat, poultry, and fish. Other good sources include soybean, corn, olive, and canola oils; nuts; and seeds. Fruit, vegetables, eggs, and dairy products are moderate sources of coenzyme Q10 [(97)](#reference97). Some dietary sources are meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| Coenzyme Q10 is available without a prescription as a dietary [supplement](../glossary#supplement) in the US. Doses in supplements for adults range from 30 to 100 mg/day, which are considerably higher than typically estimated dietary coenzyme Q10 intakes. Coenzyme Q10 is fat-soluble and is best absorbed with fat in a meal. Doses higher than 100 mg/day are generally divided into two or three doses throughout the day [(101)](#reference101). Less than 5% of orally administered coenzyme Q10 is thought to reach the circulation [(102)](#reference102). Therefore, [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of coenzyme Q10 as high as 1,200 to 3,000 mg/day for adults and 30 mg/kg/day for children are usually needed to relieve symptoms in patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency [(26)](#reference26). Oral supplementation with coenzyme Q10 is to increase blood and to reach a supplementation with a dose of 2,400 mg/day [(103, 104)](#reference103). Yet, under normal circumstances, uptake of supplemental coenzyme Q10 from peripheral tissues/organs is likely limited because is ubiquitously [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) [(105)](#reference105). Nonetheless, under aging) or in [pathologies](../glossary#pathology), coenzyme Q10 [status](../glossary#status) might be compromised and it is then presumed that supplementation might increase coenzyme Q10 concentrations in tissues that are deficient [(106)](#reference106). For example, a study in 24 older adults supplemented with 300 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for at least seven days prior to cardiac surgery found that the coenzyme Q10 content of atrial tissue was significantly increased in those taking coenzyme Q10, especially in patients greater than 70 years of age [(38)](#reference38). In another study of patients with left ventricular dysfunction, supplementation with 150 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for four weeks before cardiac surgery increased coenzyme Q10 concentrations in the heart but not in skeletal muscle [(107)](#reference107). Finally, a 2007 review of the literature highlighted that plasma coenzyme Q10 concentrations higher than 'normal' were likely needed to promote coenzyme Q10 uptake by peripheral tissues and different tissues may indeed require different plasma thresholds for the uptake of coenzyme Q10 [(102)](#reference102). There have been no reports of significant adverse side effects of oral coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) at doses as high as 3,000 mg/day for up to eight months [(103)](#reference103), 1,200 mg/day for up to 16 months [(65)](#reference65), and 600 mg/day for up to 30 months [(73)](#reference73). According to the observed safe level (OSL) risk assessment method, evidence of safety is strong with doses up to 1,200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 [(108)](#reference108). Some people have experienced [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, appetite suppression, heartburn, and abdominal discomfort, especially with daily doses 200 mg [(109)](#reference109). These adverse effects may be minimized if daily doses >100 mg are divided into two or three daily doses [(101)](#reference101). During pregnancy, the use of coenzyme Q10 supplements (100 mg twice daily) from 20 weeks' [gestation](../glossary#gestation) was found to be safe [(110)](#reference110). Because reliable data in lactating women are not available, supplementation should be avoided during breast-feeding [(110)](#reference110). Concomitant use of warfarin (Coumadin) and coenzyme Q10 [supplements](../glossary#supplement) has been reported to decrease the [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) effect of warfarin in a few cases [(111)](#reference111). An individual on warfarin should not begin taking coenzyme Q10 supplements without consulting the health care provider who is managing his or her anticoagulant therapy. If warfarin and coenzyme Q10 are to be used concomitantly, blood tests to assess clotting time (prothrombin time; PT/INR) should be monitored frequently, especially in the first two weeks. HMG-CoA reductase is an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) a biochemical reaction common are widely used as cholesterol-lowering medications. Statins can thus also reduce the [endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) coenzyme Q10 [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration by the concentration of circulating lipids [(122, 123)](#reference122). It is likely that circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations are decreased because statins reduce circulating lipids rather than because they inhibit coenzyme Q10 synthesis [(124)](#reference124). In addition, very few studies have examined coenzyme Q10 concentrations in tissues other than blood such that the extent to which statin therapy affects coenzyme Q10 concentrations in the body's tissues is unknown [(118](#reference118), [120](#reference120), [125)](#reference125). Finally, there is currently little evidence to suggest that secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is responsible for statin-associated muscle symptoms in treated patients.

Lipoic acid is [covalently](../glossary#covalent-bond) bound to certain [proteins](../glossary#protein), which function as part of essential [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) multi [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) complexes involved in energy and [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). In addition to the physiological functions of protein-bound lipoic acid, there is increasing scientific and medical interest in potential therapeutic uses of [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of free (unbound) lipoic acid [(3)](#reference3). Lipoic acid contains two thiol (sulfur) groups, which may be [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) or [reduced](../glossary#reduction); dihydrolipoic acid is the reduced form of lipoic acid (Figure 1) [(4)](#reference4). Lipoic acid also contains an asymmetric carbon, which means that lipoic acid can exist as one of two possible optical [isomers](../glossary#isomer), also called [enantiomers](../glossary#enantiomer). These enantiomers are mirror images of each other: R-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid (Figure 1). Only the R-enantiomer is [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) synthesized and covalently bound to protein. R-lipoic acid occurs naturally in food (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Free (unbound) lipoic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) or 50:50 ( [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture)) mixture of R-lipoic and S-lipoic acid (see [Supplements](#supplements)). The [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of lipoic acid has been characterized in detail in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not all genes involved in the process have been identified in humans [(5)](#reference5). Lipoic acid is synthesized [de protein (ACP; article on [Pantothenic Acid](../vitamins/pantothenic-acid#function)) during the process of fatty acid synthesis (Figure 2). An enzyme called lipoyl (octanoyl) transferase 2 [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the from octanoyl-ACP to a conserved lysine of the H protein of the glycine cleavage system (see also [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). The next reaction is the insertion of two sulfur atoms at positions 6 and 8 of the protein H-bound octanoyl moiety, thereby producing a dihydrolipoyl moiety. This step by the lipoic (also called lipoyl synthase), an enzyme containing iron-sulfur clusters that act as sulfur donors in the reaction [(5)](#reference5). Finally, the enzyme lipoyl transferase 1 catalyzes the transfer of the dihydrolipoyl moiety from the H protein of the glycine cleavage system to conserved lysine residues of the by a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Figure 2). Consumption of lipoic acid from food has not yet been found to result in detectable increases of free lipoic acid in human [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or cells [(3](#reference3), [6)](#reference6). In contrast, high oral doses of free lipoic acid (50 mg) significantly, yet transiently, increase the concentration of free lipoic acid in plasma and cells. [Pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies in humans have found that about 30%-40% of an oral dose of a [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture of R-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid is absorbed [(6, 7)](#reference6). Oral lipoic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are better absorbed on an empty stomach than with food: taking lipoic acid with food (versus without food) decreased peak plasma lipoic acid concentrations by about 30% and total plasma lipoic acid concentrations by about 20% [(8)](#reference8). A liquid formulation of R-lipoic acid was found to be better absorbed and more stable in the plasma, suggesting that it might be more efficacious than the solid form in the management of a condition like diabetic neuropathy [(9, 10)](#reference9). There may also be differences in [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the two [isomers](../glossary#isomer) of lipoic acid. Following single oral doses R,S-lipoic acid (racemic mixture), peak plasma concentrations of R-lipoic acid were found to be 40%-50% higher than S-lipoic acid, suggesting a differential absorption in favor of the R-enantiomer [(6](#reference6), [8](#reference8), [11)](#reference11). Yet, following oral ingestion, both enantiomers are rapidly [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) and [excreted](../glossary#excretion). Plasma lipoic acid concentrations generally peak within one hour or less and decline rapidly [(6, 7](#reference6), [11, 12)](#reference11). In cells, lipoic dihydrolipoic acid, and [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) studies indicate that dihydrolipoic acid is then rapidly exported from cells [(3)](#reference3). Moreover, a [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 19 healthy adults suggested that the bioavailability of R,S-lipoic acid and R-lipoic acid may vary with age and gender [(13)](#reference13). Finally, there is no evidence in humans that exogenous lipoic acid can be 'activated' with [ATP](../glossary#ATP) or by a lipoyl a loss of lipoic acid-dependent enzymatic activity caused by defects in endogenous lipoic acid synthesis (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)) cannot be rescued by the provision of exogenous lipoic acid [(5)](#reference5). R-lipoic acid is an essential [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for several [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) multi [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) complexes that [catalyze](../glossary#catalyze) critical reactions related to the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) (breakdown) of [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) and the production of energy [(15)](#reference15). R-lipoic acid is [covalently](../glossary#covalent-bond) bound to a specific lysine [residue](../glossary#residue) in at least one of the [proteins](../glossary#protein) in each multienzyme complex. Such a non- [protein](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#protein) cofactor is known as a \"prosthetic group.\" R-lipoic acid functions as a prosthetic group for the biological activity of the following multienzyme complexes: (i) the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), an important [substrate](../glossary#substrate) for energy production via the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle); (ii) the -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex that catalyzes the conversion of -ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA, another important intermediate of the citric acid cycle; (iii) the branched-chain -ketoacid dehydrogenase complex that is involved in the decarboxylation of ketoacids in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids, namely leucine, isoleucine, and valine; (iv) decarboxylation the hydroxylysine, tryptophan. All four as group essential for E2 transacetylase activity, dehydrogenase R-lipoic acid is also found in the E3-binding protein (protein X component) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [(5)](#reference5). When considering the biological activities of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) (unbound) lipoic acid, it is important to keep in mind the limited and transient nature of the increases in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and tissue lipoic acid (see [Metabolism and [reactive nitrogen species](../glossary#reactive-nitrogen-species) (RNS) are highly reactive compounds with the potential to damage [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [proteins](../glossary#protein), and [lipids](../glossary#lipid) in [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Both dihydrolipoic acid can directly [scavenge](../glossary#scavenge) (neutralize) physiologically relevant ROS and RNS in the test tube (reviewed in [3](#reference3)). However, whether direct quenching reactions occur [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) is unknown. The highest tissue concentrations of free lipoic acid likely to be achieved through oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) are at least 10 times lower than those of other intracellular [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), such as [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) and [glutathione](../glossary#gluathione). Moreover, free lipoic acid is rapidly eliminated from cells, so any increases in direct radical scavenging activity are unlikely to be sustained. Regeneration of other antioxidants: When an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) [scavenges](../glossary#scavenge) a [free radical](../glossary#free-radical), it becomes [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) itself and is not able to scavenge additional [ROS](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) or [RNS](../glossary#reactive-nitrogen-species) until it has been [reduced](../glossary#reduction). In the test tube, dihydrolipoic acid is a potent reducing agent with the capacity to reduce the oxidized forms of several important antioxidants, including [coenzyme 17)](#reference16). reduce the oxidized form of -tocopherol ( [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E)) directly or indirectly through regenerating oxidized vitamin C (see the article on [Vitamin E](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-E#function)) [(18)](#reference18) or oxidized coenzyme effectively unclear Metal metal [ions](../glossary#ion), as [copper](../minerals/copper), can induce [oxidative [(20)](#reference20). Compounds that [chelate](../glossary#chelate) free metal ions in a way that prevents them from generating free radicals offer promise in the treatment of [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) and other [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) in which metal-induced may play a [pathogenic](../glossary#pathogen) role [(21)](#reference21). Both lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid have been found to inhibit copper- and iron-mediated oxidative damage in the test tube [(22, 23)](#reference22) and to inhibit excess iron and copper accumulation in animal models [(24, 25)](#reference24). Lipoic acid may also be helpful as an adjunct treatment against heavy metal toxicity. No clinical trial has examined the use of lipoic acid as a chelating agent in mercury toxicity, yet it has proven to be effective in several mammalian species [(26, 27)](#reference26). Activation of antioxidant signaling pathways: [Glutathione](../glossary#gluathione) is an important intracellular [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) that also plays a role in the detoxification and elimination of potential [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen) and toxins. Reductions in glutathione [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and tissue glutathione concentrations in aged animals (compared to younger ones) are suggestive of a potentially lower ability to respond to [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) or toxin exposure [(28)](#reference28). Lipoic acid has been found to increase glutathione concentrations in cultured cells and in the tissues of aged animals fed lipoic acid [(29, 30)](#reference29). Lipoic acid might be able to increase glutathione synthesis in aged rats by up-regulating the increasing cellular uptake of cysteine, an [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) required for glutathione synthesis [(32)](#reference32). Lipoic acid was found to upregulate the expression of -GCL and other antioxidant enzymes via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway [(31](#reference31), [33)](#reference33). Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol). Keap1 responds to oxidative stress signals by freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) where it can bind to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) region of [genes](../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant enzymes and scavengers. Lipoic acid \u2014 but not dihydrolipoic acid \u2014 can react with specific sulfhydryl residues of Keap1, causing the release of Nrf2 [(34)](#reference34). Nrf2/ARE target genes code for several upregulation of the Nrf2 pathway by lipoic acid in cultured hepatocytes and in the liver of obese or diabetic rats prevented [lipid](../glossary#lipid) overload-induced [steatosis](../glossary#steatosis) [(35)](#reference35) and cell death [(36)](#reference36). Lipoic acid protected liver from oxidative stress-induced liver injury in methotrexate-treated rats through the activation of Nrf-2 pathway and other anti-inflammatory pathways [(37)](#reference37). Pre-treatment and and reversed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced enzymatic complex that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the production of superoxide from oxygen and NADPH and has been involved in innate immune defense against microbes [(39)](#reference39). Lipoic acid prevented NOX-induced superoxide production in a rat model of [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) and limited infarct volume limited NOX-generated [ROS](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) production and reduced cancer cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) induced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection [(41)](#reference41). The binding of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) the insulin [receptor](../glossary#receptor) stimulates a cascade of [protein](../glossary#protein) [phosphorylations](../glossary#phosphorylation) leading to of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) transporters (GLUT4) to the [cell membrane](../glossary#cell-membrane) and an increased cellular uptake of glucose [(3](#reference3), [42)](#reference42). Lipoic acid has been found to activate the insulin signaling cascade in cultured cells [(3](#reference3), [42, 43)](#reference42), increase GLUT4 translocation to cell membranes, and increase glucose uptake in cultured [adipose](../glossary#adipose) and muscle cells [(44, 45)](#reference44). A computer modeling study suggested that lipoic acid might bind to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor and stabilize the active form of the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) [(43)](#reference43). In addition to Nrf2 and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) signaling pathways, lipoic acid was found to target other [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules thereby affecting a variety of cellular processes, including [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), stress responses, [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), and survival. For example, in cultured [endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells, lipoic acid was found to inhibit IKK-, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that promotes the translocation the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) [(46)](#reference46). Lipoic acid also been shown to improve [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO)-dependent [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation) in aged rats by NO synthase (eNOS) and triggering [AMP](../glossary#AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-induced transcription factor PGC-1 activation in skeletal muscle of aged mice [(48)](#reference48). Several reviews of the literature have described pathways that are potential targets of lipoic acid in various models and under different experimental conditions [(49-52)](#reference49). Lipoic acid deficiency has been described in rare cases of inherited [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the lipoic acid biosynthetic pathway. Mutations identified in patients with defective lipoic acid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) affect [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of iron-sulfur clusters genes for is the hallmark of [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). Type 1 diabetes is caused by the [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) destruction of the [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-producing -cells of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), leading to an insufficient production of insulin. Exogenous insulin is required to maintain a normal blood glucose concentration (i.e., fasting blood glucose <100 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]). In contrast, impaired tissue glucose uptake in response to insulin (a phenomenon called [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance)) plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes [(55)](#reference55). Although patients with type 2 diabetes may eventually require insulin, interventions that enhance [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) may be used to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. The term 'prediabetes' is sometimes used to describe early metabolic abnormalities that place individuals at high [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes. Of note, these patients are also at high risk for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). According to the American Diabetes Association, prediabetes can be defined by a condition of impaired fasting glucose, characterized by a fasting blood glucose concentration between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL and/or a condition of impaired glucose tolerance, characterized by a 2-hour blood glucose concentration 140 mg/dL following an oral glucose tolerance test [(56)](#reference56). The effect of high-dose lipoic acid on [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization has been primarily examined in individuals with type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). An early [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) in 13 patients with type 2 diabetes found that a single [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) infusion of 1,000 mg of lipoic acid improved [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-stimulated glucose disposal (i.e., [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive)) by 50% compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) infusion [(57)](#reference57). A placebo-controlled study of 72 patients with type 2 diabetes found that oral administration of lipoic acid at doses of 600 mg/day, 1,200 mg/day or 1,800 mg/day improved insulin sensitivity by 25% after four weeks of treatment [(58)](#reference58). There were no significant differences among the three doses of lipoic acid, suggesting that 600 mg/day may be the maximum effective dose [(55)](#reference55). However, in a more recent randomized, placebo-controlled study in 102 subjects, daily supplementation with 600 mg of lipoic acid (+/- 800 mg of vitamin E [-tocopherol]) for 16 weeks had no effect on fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, or a measure of insulin resistance called the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index [(59)](#reference59). A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis identified 20 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (published between 2007 and 2017) that examined the effect of supplemental lipoic acid on markers of glucose utilization in 1,245 subjects with metabolic disorders (not limited to type 2 diabetes) [(60)](#reference60). Administration of lipoic acid (200 to 1,800 mg/day for 2 weeks to 1 year), alone or together with other nutrients, was found to lower fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin resistance, and blood HbA1c concentration \u2014 a marker of glycemic control over the past few months [(60)](#reference60). The inner lining of blood vessels, known as the [vascular endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium), plays an important role in the maintenance of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) health. In particular, [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) regulates vascular tone and blood flow by promoting the relaxation of all types of blood vessels, including arteries \u2014 a phenomenon called [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation). Alterations in NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation results in widespread [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction) and [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities and is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis). The presence of chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia), [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and pro-inflammatory [(61)](#reference61). The measurement of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is often used as a surrogate marker of endothelial function. Two techniques are being used to measure endothelium-dependent vasodilation. One technique measures the forearm blood flow by venous occlusion plethysmography during infusion of acetylcholine. Using this invasive technique, intra-arterial infusion of lipoic acid was found to improve [endothelium-dependent vasodilation](../glossary#endothelium-dependent-vasodilation) in 39 subjects with type 2 diabetes but not in 11 healthy controls [(62)](#reference62). A more recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes found that [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) infusion of 600 mg of lipoic acid improved the response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator measure flow-mediated vasodilation was used in two additional studies conducted by Xiang et al. [(64, 65)](#reference64). The results of these randomized, placebo-controlled studies showed that intravenous lipoic acid could improve endothelial function in patients with impaired fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [(64)](#reference64) or impaired glucose tolerance [(65)](#reference65). One randomized placebo-controlled trial that assessed the effect of oral lipoic acid supplementation in 58 patients diagnosed with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome), a condition characterized by abnormal glucose and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), showed that flow-mediated vasodilation improved by 44% with 300 mg/day of lipoic acid for four weeks [(66)](#reference66). Peripheral neuropathy: Up to 50% of diabetic patients develop [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy), a type of nerve damage that may result in pain, loss of sensation, and weakness, particularly in the lower extremities [(67)](#reference67). Peripheral neuropathy is also a leading cause of lower limb amputation in diabetic patients [(68)](#reference68). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia)-induced nerve damage, such as intracellular accumulation of sorbitol, glycation reactions, and [oxidative](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and nitrosative stress (reviewed in [69](#reference69)). The results of several large [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) indicated that maintaining blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) at near normal concentrations was the most important step in limiting the [risk](../glossary#risk) of diabetic neuropathy and lower extremity amputation [(70-72)](#reference70). However, evidence of the efficacy of enhanced control of glycemia in preventing neuropathy is stronger in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes [(73)](#reference73). Moreover, this glucose control intervention increased the risk of hypoglycemic episodes [(73)](#reference73). The efficacy of lipoic acid, administered either [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) or orally, in the management of neuropathic symptoms has been examined in patients with diabetes. [Meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of randomized controlled trials suggest that infusion of 300 to 600 mg/day of lipoic acid for two to four weeks significantly reduced the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy to a clinically meaningful degree [(55](#reference55), [74)](#reference74). Regarding the efficacy of oral lipoic acid supplementation, an initial short-term study in 24 patients with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found that the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy improved in those who took 600 mg of lipoic acid three times a day for three weeks compared to those who took a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(75)](#reference75). A larger [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) randomly assigned more than 500 patients with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic peripheral neuropathy to one of the following treatments: (i) 600 mg/day of intravenous lipoic acid for three weeks followed by 1,800 mg/day of oral lipoic acid for six months, (ii) 600 mg/day of intravenous lipoic acid for three weeks followed by oral placebo for six months, or (iii) intravenous placebo for three weeks followed by oral placebo for six months [(76)](#reference76). Evidence of improvements in sensory and motor deficits \u2014 assessed by physicians \u2014 could be observed after three weeks of intravenous lipoic acid therapy, yet not at the end of six months of oral lipoic acid therapy. However, another [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial in 181 patients with diabetic neuropathy found that oral supplementation with either 600 mg/day, 1,200 mg/day, or 1,800 mg/day of lipoic acid for five weeks significantly improved neuropathic symptoms [(77)](#reference77). In this study, the 600 mg/day dose was as effective as the higher doses. Finally, a four-year, multicenter, clinical trial in 421 diabetic patients with distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy found no difference between oral administration of 600 mg/day of lipoic and placebo on the primary endpoint, a composite score that assessed neuropathic impairment of the lower limbs and nerve conduction [(78)](#reference78). Yet, measures of specific neuropathic impairments (secondary outcomes) improved with lipoic acid supplementation [(78)](#reference78). A post-hoc analysis suggested that oral lipoic acid supplementation may reduce neuropathic symptoms particularly in subjects with a high burden of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), diabetes, and neuropathy yet with normal and [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) is cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), which occurs in as many as 25% of diabetic patients [(55)](#reference55). CAN is characterized by damage to the nerve fibers that innervate the heart and blood vessels, leading to reduced heart rate variability (variability in the time interval between heartbeats) and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality [(80)](#reference80). In a [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of 72 patients with type 2 diabetes and reduced heart rate variability, oral supplementation with 800 mg/day of lipoic acid for four months resulted in significant improvement in two out of four measures of heart rate variability compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(81)](#reference81). Summary: Overall, the available research suggests that treatment with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) or oral lipoic acid may help reduce symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The use of lipoic acid is currently approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy in Germany [(4)](#reference4). It is important to note that many of the studies that examined the efficacy of lipoic acid in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy have been primarily conducted by one German research group and funded by the manufacturer of lipoic acid in Germany [(82)](#reference82). Chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) can damage blood vessels in the [retina](../glossary#retina) and cause a potentially sight-threatening condition called diabetic retinopathy [(83)](#reference83). One placebo-controlled study examined the effect of lipoic acid on the visual capability of 80 participants of whom 12 had type 1 diabetes, 48 had type 2 diabetes, and 20 were diabetes-free. The result showed that daily oral administration of 300 mg of lipoic acid for three months prevented the deterioration of contrast sensitivity in patients with diabetes and improved it in healthy patients compared to placebo [(84)](#reference84). [Multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) is an [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) disease of unknown [etiology](../glossary#etiology) that is characterized by the progressive destruction of [myelin](../glossary#myelin) and nerve fibers in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), causing [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in affected individuals [(85)](#reference85). There are four main types of multiple sclerosis defined according to the disease course: (i) clinically isolated syndrome, (ii) relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, (iii) secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and (iv) primary progressive multiple sclerosis (for more information, visit the [National Multiple Sclerosis Society website](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/)) [(86)](#reference86). Lipoic acid was found to effectively slow disease progression when administered either orally [(87)](#reference87), [intraperitoneally](../glossary#intraperitoneal-injection) [(88)](#reference88), or [subcutaneously](../glossary#subcutaneous) [(89)](#reference89) to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) and animal studies have found that lipoic acid exhibits immunomodulatory properties through mechanisms that stimulate the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) [(90, 91)](#reference90) \u2014 a central regulator of [innate immune](../health-disease/immunity#innate-immunity) functions \u2014 and inhibits the migration of immune cells into the brain and spinal cord [(92)](#reference92), possibly by decreasing endothelial expression of cell adhesion molecules, inhibiting expression of enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and/or reducing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier [(87, 89](#reference87), [93, 94)](#reference93). Only a few studies have examined lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in humans. A small [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) designed to evaluate the safety of lipoic acid in 30 people with relapsing or progressive multiple sclerosis found that treatment with 1,200 to 2,400 mg/day of oral lipoic acid for two weeks was generally well tolerated (see [Safety](#safety)) [(95)](#reference95). In this study, higher [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of lipoic acid were associated with the lowest serum concentrations of MMP-9 \u2014 a marker of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) [(95)](#reference95). Another study suggested that an oral dose of 1,200 mg of lipoic acid in subjects with multiple sclerosis could help achieve serum lipoic acid concentrations similar to those found to be therapeutic in mice [(96)](#reference96). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 52 subjects (mean age, 30 years) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis found an increase in total [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity in blood with lipoic acid supplementation (1,200 mg/day for 12 weeks) yet not in the activity of specific antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) [(97)](#reference97). Supplemental serum concentrations of some (IFN-, ICAM-1, TGF-, IL-4), but not markers (TNF-, and other inflammation [(98)](#reference98). In addition, lipoic acid supplementation did not reduce the severity of multiple sclerosis symptoms, as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scoring system [(98, 99)](#reference98). A two-year [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) designed to assess the effect of lipoic acid (1,200 mg/day) on loss of mobility and changes in brain volume in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis is ongoing [(85)](#reference85). Studies in animal models of aging and [neurodegenerative disease](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) have indicated that lipoic acid administration might improve measures of spatial memory, learning capacity, and/or motor function (reviewed in [100](#reference100)). It is not known whether oral lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) can slow [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline related to aging or [pathological](../glossary#pathology) conditions in humans. An uncontrolled, [open-label trial](../glossary#open-label-trial) in nine patients with probable [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/Alzheimer-disease) and related [dementias](../glossary#dementia), who were also taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, reported that oral supplementation with 600 mg/day of lipoic acid appeared to stabilize cognitive function over a one-year period [(101)](#reference101). A subsequent study that followed 43 patients for up to four years found those with mild dementia or moderate-early dementia who took lipoic acid (600 mg/day), in addition to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, experienced slower cognitive decline compared to the typical cognitive decline of Alzheimer's patients as reported in the literature [(102)](#reference102). However, the significance of these findings is difficult to assess without a control group for comparison. A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that oral supplementation with 1,200 mg/day of lipoic acid for 10 weeks was of no benefit in treating [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-associated cognitive impairment [(103)](#reference103). The results of another randomized trial in 39 patients with Alzheimer's disease suggested that supplementation with fish oil concentrate (high in [omega-3 fatty acids](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids)) with or without lipoic acid (600 mg/day) for one year could delay the progression in cognitive and functional impairments assessed by the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scoring system compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(104)](#reference104). Interestingly, patients who took fish oil concentrate together with lipoic acid showed no worsening of global cognitive function (as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score system) over 12 months as opposed to those who took either the fish oil concentrate alone or a placebo [(104)](#reference104). Larger trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings and further evaluate the usefulness of supplemental lipoic acid in the prevention and/or management of neurodegenerative diseases. A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found that lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in those with high [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) resulted in significant, yet modest, reductions in weight (9 studies) and BMI (11 studies) in the absence of caloric restriction (except in one study) [(105)](#reference105). Subgroup analyses revealed that weight loss was greater in overweight versus obese participants, in unhealthy versus healthy participants, with daily doses 600 mg, and for intervention period shorter than 10 weeks. There was no reduction in waist circumference with supplemental lipoic acid (5 studies) [(105)](#reference105). Substantial weight and BMI reductions with lipoic acid supplementation in overweight or obese subjects were also reported in a prior meta-analysis [(106)](#reference106). R-lipoic acid is synthesized [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) by humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). R-lipoic acid occurs naturally in food in [proteins](../glossary#protein) (lipoyllysine; see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). Although lipoic acid is found in a wide variety of foods from plant and animal sources, quantitative information on the lipoic acid or lipoyllysine content of food is limited; published databases are lacking. Animal tissues with high lipoyllysine content (~1-3 g/g dry wt) include kidney, heart, and liver, while lipoyllysine-rich vegetables include spinach and broccoli [(107)](#reference107). Somewhat lower amounts of lipoyllysine (~0.5 g/g dry wt) have been measured in tomatoes, peas, and Brussels sprouts. Unlike lipoic acid in foods, lipoic acid in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) is not bound to [protein](../glossary#protein). Moreover, the amounts of lipoic acid available in dietary supplements (50-600 mg) are likely as much as 1,000 times greater than the amounts that could be obtained from the diet. In Germany, lipoic acid is approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathies and is available by prescription [(108)](#reference108). Lipoic acid is available as a dietary supplement without a prescription in the US. Most lipoic acid supplements contain a [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture of R-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid (sometimes noted d,l-lipoic acid). Supplements that claim to contain only R-lipoic acid are usually more expensive, and information regarding their purity is not publicly available [(109)](#reference109). Since taking lipoic acid with a meal decreases its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability), it is generally recommended that lipoic acid be taken 30 min prior to a meal (see also [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(8)](#reference8). R-lipoic acid is the [isomer](../glossary#isomer) that is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by plants and animals and functions as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in its [protein](../glossary#protein)-bound form (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Direct comparisons of the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the oral [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture and R-lipoic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) have not been published. Following the ingestion of R,S-lipoic acid, peak [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of R-lipoic acid were found to be 40%-50% higher than S-lipoic acid, suggesting better absorption of R-lipoic acid. Both isomers were nonetheless rapidly [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) and eliminated [(6](#reference6), [8](#reference8), [11)](#reference11). In rats, R-lipoic acid was more effective than S-lipoic acid in enhancing [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-stimulated [glucose](../glossary#glucose) transport and metabolism in skeletal muscle [(110)](#reference110), and R-lipoic acid was more effective than R,S-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid in preventing [cataracts](../glossary#cataract) [(111)](#reference111). However, all of the published human studies have used R,S-lipoic acid (racemic mixture). It has been suggested that the presence of S-lipoic acid in the racemic mixture may limit the polymerization of R-lipoic acid and enhance its bioavailability [(52)](#reference52). At present, it remains unclear which supplemental form is best to use in [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). In general, high-dose lipoic acid administration has been found to have few serious side effects. [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of lipoic acid at doses of 600 mg/day for three weeks [(112)](#reference112) and oral lipoic acid at doses as high as 1,800 mg/day for six months [(113)](#reference113) and 1,200 mg/day for two years [(76)](#reference76) did not result in serious adverse effects when used to treat [diabetic](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events in patients with diabetic neuropathy who took 600 mg/day of lipoic acid for four years compared to those in the [placebo](../glossary#placebo) group [(78)](#reference78). Oral intake of 2,400 mg/day for two weeks was also found to be safe in a [pilot study](../glossary#placebo) that included participants with [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) [(95)](#reference95). Two mild [anaphylactoid](../glossary#anaphylaxis) reactions and one severe [anaphylactic](../glossary#anaphylaxis) reaction, including laryngospasm, were reported after intravenous lipoic acid administration [(55)](#reference55). The most frequently reported side effects of oral lipoic acid supplementation are allergic reactions affecting the skin, including rashes, hives, and itching. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and vertigo have also been reported, and one trial found that the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and vertigo was dose-dependent [(77)](#reference77). Further, malodorous urine has been noted by people taking 1,200 mg/day of lipoic acid orally [(95)](#reference95). A [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) reported that daily oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 600 mg of lipoic acid ( [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture) during pregnancy and without interruption from a period spanning between week 10 and week 30 of gestation and until the end of week 37 was not associated with any adverse effect in mothers and their newborns [(114)](#reference114). In absence of further evidence, lipoic acid supplementation during pregnancy should only be considered under strict medical supervision. The safety of lipoic acid supplements in lactating women has not been established and should thus be discouraged [(115)](#reference115). A case of intoxication was reported in a 20-month old child (10.5 kg bw) after the accidental ingestion of four 600-mg tablets of lipoic acid [(116)](#reference116). The child was admitted to hospital with [seizure](../glossary#seizure), acidosis, and unconsciousness. Symptomatic management and rapid elimination of lipoic acid led to a full recovery without sequelae within five days. The non-accidental ingestion of a very high dose of lipoic acid led to multi-organ failure and subsequent death of an adolescent girl [(117)](#reference117). In theory, because lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may improve [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-mediated [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization (see [Diabetes mellitus](#diabetes-treatment)), there is a potential [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia) in diabetic patients using insulin or oral anti-diabetic agents [(118)](#reference118). Consequently, blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely when lipoic acid supplementation is added to diabetes treatment regimens. Yet, one study in 24 healthy volunteers reported no significant drug interactions with the co-administration of a single oral dose of lipoic acid (600 mg) and the oral anti-diabetic agents, glyburide (also called glybenclamide) or acarbose (Precose/Prandase/Glucobay) [(119)](#reference119). The chemical structure of [biotin](../vitamins/biotin) is similar to that of lipoic acid, and there is some evidence that high concentrations of lipoic acid can compete with biotin for transport across [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) [(120, 121)](#reference120). The administration of high doses of lipoic acid by injection to rats decreased the activity of two biotin-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) by about 30%-35% [(122)](#reference122), but it is not known whether oral or [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) lipoic acid supplementation substantially increases the requirement for biotin in humans [(123)](#reference123).

However, the term is generally used to describe chemicals from plants that may affect health, but are not essential nutrients. While there is ample evidence to support the health benefits of diets rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts, evidence that these effects are due to specific nutrients or phytochemicals is limited. Because plant-based foods are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, information on the potential health effects of individual phytochemicals is linked to information on the health effects of foods that contain those phytochemicals. Select a phytochemical from the list for more information. The information on dietary phytochemicals from the Linus Pauling Institute's Micronutrient Information Center is now available in a book titled, An Evidence-based Approach to Phytochemicals and Other Dietary Factors. The book can be purchased from the [Linus Pauling Institute](/books) or [Thieme Medical Publishers](http://www.thieme.com/books-main/complementary-medicine/product/1635-an-evidence-based-approach-to-phytochemicals-and-other-dietary-factors). Contents Carotenoids are a class of more than 750 naturally occurring pigments [synthesized](../../glossary#synthesis) by plants, algae, and photosynthetic [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) [(1)](#references). These richly colored molecules are the sources of the yellow, orange, and red colors of many plants. [Fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) provide most of the 40 to 50 carotenoids found in the human diet. -Carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein, -carotene and -cryptoxanthin are provitamin A carotenoids, meaning they can be converted by the body to retinol (Figure 1). Lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene are nonprovitamin A carotenoids because they cannot be converted to retinol (Figure 2). For dietary carotenoids to be absorbed intestinally, they must be released from the food matrix and incorporated into mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) (mixtures of [bile salts](../../glossary#bile-acids) and several types of [lipids](../../glossary#lipid)). Food processing and cooking help release carotenoids embedded in their food matrix and increase intestinal absorption [(1)](#references). Moreover, carotenoid absorption requires the presence of fat in a meal. As little as 3 to 5 g of fat in a meal appears sufficient to ensure carotenoid absorption [(2, 3)](#reference2), although the minimum amount of dietary fat required may be different for each carotenoid. The type of fat (e.g., medium-chain vs. long-chain [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides)), the presence of [soluble](../../glossary#soluble) [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber), and the type and amount of carotenoids (e.g., [esterified](../../glossary#ester) vs. non-esterified) in the food also appear to influence the rate and extent of carotenoid absorption (reviewed in [4](#reference4)). Because they do not need to be released from the plant matrix, carotenoid [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) (in oil) are more efficiently absorbed than carotenoids in food [(3)](#reference3). Although carotenoids were initially thought to be absorbed within the cells that line the intestine ( [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte)) only by passive diffusion, recent investigations identified the apical membrane transporters, Scavenger Receptor-class B type I (SR-BI) and Cluster Determinant 36 (CD36), suggesting active uptake of carotenoids as well [(5)](#reference5). Within the enterocytes, provitamin A be the cleavage provitamin A carotenoids into retinal, which is further [reduced](../../glossary#reduction) to retinol (vitamin A) or [oxidized](../../glossary#oxidation) to retinoic acid (the biologically active form of vitamin A). -Apocarotenal derived from the cleavage of -carotene by BCO2 can be cleaved further by BCO1 to produce retinal. Although provitamin A carotenoids can be converted into apocarotenals by BCO2, the activity of this [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) is higher toward nonprovitamin A carotenoids. Conversely, BCO1 shows limited affinity [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein) called [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicron), secreted into lymphatic vessels, and then released in the bloodstream [(1)](#references). Triglycerides are depleted from circulating chylomicrons through the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, resulting in the formation of chylomicron remnants. Chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver, where carotenoids can be cleaved by BCO1/BCO2 or incorporated into lipoproteins and secreted back into the circulation for delivery to extrahepatic tissues. Of note, more [hydrophilic](../../glossary#hydrophilic) molecules in the enterocytes like retinoic acid and apocarotenals can be transported directly to the liver through the portal blood system. The conversion of provitamin A carotenoids to retinol is influenced by the vitamin A [status](../../glossary#status) of the individual [(6)](#reference6). The regulatory mechanism involving the intestine-specific homeobox (ISX) [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) can block carotenoid uptake and vitamin A production by inhibiting the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of SR-BI and BCO1. ISX is under the control of retinoid acid and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-dependent mechanisms such that, when vitamin A stores are high, ISX is activated and both provitamin A carotenoid absorption and conversion to retinol are inhibited. Conversely, during vitamin A insufficiency, the expression of both SR-BI and BCO1 is no longer repressed by ISX, allowing for provitamin A carotenoid absorption and conversion to retinol [(1)](#references). Interindividual variations in blood and tissue concentrations of carotenoids have been attributed to genetic differences among individuals. Specifically, a number of single [nucleotide](../../glossary#nucleotide) [polymorphisms](../../glossary#polymorphism) (SNPs) \u2014 corresponding to changes of one nucleotide in the sequence of [genes](../../glossary#gene) \u2014 have been identified in genes coding for [proteins](../../glossary#protein) involved in intestinal uptake, transport, and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of carotenoids [(7)](#reference7). Specifically, SNPs within genes coding for SR-BI, CD36, and BCO1 are suspected to affect the expression and/or activity of these proteins and, in turn, individual carotenoid status [(7)](#reference7) Vitamin A is essential for normal growth and development, immune system function, and vision (see the article on [Vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A#function)). Currently, the only essential function of carotenoids recognized in humans is that of the provitamin A carotenoids, -carotene, -carotene, and -cryptoxanthin, to serve as a source of vitamin A [(8)](#reference8). Provitamin A carotenoids are less easily absorbed than preformed vitamin A and must be converted to retinol and other retinoids by the body (Figure 3). The efficiency of conversion of provitamin A carotenoids into retinol is highly variable, depending on factors like food matrix, food preparation, and one's digestive and absorptive capacities [(9)](#reference9). The most recent international standard of measure for vitamin A is retinol activity equivalent (RAE), which represents vitamin A activity as retinol. It has been determined that 2 micrograms (\u00b5g) of -carotene in oil provided as a [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) could be converted by the body to 1 \u00b5g of retinol, giving it an RAE ratio of 2:1. However, 12 \u00b5g of -carotene from food are required to provide the body with 1 \u00b5g of retinol, giving dietary -carotene an RAE ratio of 12:1. Other provitamin A carotenoids in food are less easily absorbed than -carotene, resulting in RAE ratios of 24:1. RAE ratios are shown in Table 1. |Quantity Consumed||Quantity Bioconverted to Retinol||RAE the function of quenching (deactivating) singlet oxygen, an [oxidant](../../glossary#oxidation) formed during photosynthesis [(10)](#reference10). Test tube studies indicated that lycopene is one of the most effective quenchers of singlet oxygen among carotenoids [(11)](#reference11). They also suggested that carotenoids could inhibit the oxidation of fats (i.e., [lipid peroxidation](../../glossary#lipid-peroxidation)) under certain conditions, but their actions in humans appear to be more complex [(12)](#reference12). Although important for plants, the relevance of singlet oxygen quenching to human health is less clear [(1)](#references). Some evidence suggests that carotenoids and/or their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) may upregulate the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) and detoxifying [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the Kelch-like ECH-associated (Keap1) in the stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoter](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes and scavengers. Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code for numerous mediators [(14)](#reference14). A recent study showed an increase in the level of the major antioxidant [glutathione](../../glossary#gluatathione) and a protection against TNF-induced oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) following lycopene-mediated Nrf2 activation and GCL induction [(15)](#reference15). shown Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway in various cell types [(16-18)](#reference16). At present, evidence from animal and human studies is very limited [(13)](#reference13). The long system of alternating double and single bonds common to all carotenoids allows them to absorb light in the visible range of the spectrum [(10)](#reference10). This feature has particular relevance to the eye, where lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin (derived from lutein) efficiently absorb blue light. Depending on the carotenoid pigment density at the center of the eye's [retina](../../glossary#retina) ( [macula](../../glossary#macula)), up to 90% of blue light can be absorbed by these pigments. Reducing the amount of short-wavelength light that reaches the critical visual structures of the eye may protect them from light-induced [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) [(19)](#reference19). Because the only source of these plant pigments in the eye is diet, a number of [observational](../../glossary#observational-study) and [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the potential of dietary and [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) lutein and zeaxanthin to protect against age-related [Age-related macular degeneration](#age-related-macular-degeneration-prevention) and [Cataracts](#cataracts-prevention)). Supplemental lutein, alone or with zeaxanthin, was found to improve contrast sensitivity and protect against visual fatigue in young and/or healthy individuals [(20-23)](#reference20). Lutein has also been suggested to improve visual function through stimulating [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) signaling efficiency in the eye [(24)](#reference24). Carotenoids can facilitate communication between neighboring cells grown in culture by stimulating the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) of connexin [proteins](../../glossary#protein) [(25)](#reference25). Connexins form pores (gap junctions) in [cell membranes](../../glossary#cell-membrane), allowing cells to communicate through the exchange of small molecules. This type of intercellular communication is important for maintaining cells in a [differentiated](../../glossary#differentiation) state and is often lost in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells. Carotenoids facilitate intercellular communication by increasing the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of the [gene](../../glossary#gene) encoding a connexin protein, an effect that appears unrelated to the vitamin A or antioxidant activities of various carotenoids [(26)](#reference26) and involving a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-independent mechanism [(27)](#reference27). Because vitamin A is essential for normal immune system function, it is difficult to determine whether the effects of provitamin A carotenoids are related to their vitamin A activity or other activities of carotenoids. Although some [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that -carotene supplementation improves several [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) immune function [(28-30)](#reference28), increasing intakes of lycopene and lutein \u2014 carotenoids without vitamin A activity \u2014 have not resulted in similar improvements in biomarkers of immune function [(31-33)](#reference31). Although consumption of provitamin A carotenoids (-carotene, -carotene, and -cryptoxanthin) can prevent vitamin A deficiency (see the article on [Vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A#deficiency)), no overt deficiency symptoms have been identified in people consuming low-carotenoid diets if they consume adequate vitamin A [(8)](#reference8). After reviewing the published scientific research in 2000, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine concluded that the existing evidence was insufficient to establish a recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../../glossary#RDA)) or adequate intake ( [AI](../../glossary#AI)) for carotenoids. The Board has set an RDA for vitamin A (see the article on [Vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A#RDA)). Recommendations by the National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and American Heart Association to consume a variety of [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) daily are aimed, in part, at increasing intakes of carotenoids. Dietary carotenoids: Several large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), have examined potential associations between carotenoid intake and/or blood concentrations and lung [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(36)](#reference36). In a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight prospective cohort studies, including NHS and HPFS, the highest versus lowest quantile of total carotenoid intake was significantly associated with a 21% reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of lung cancer. For the individual carotenoids, the risk of lung cancer was estimated to be 20% and 14% lower with the highest versus lowest intakes of -cryptoxanthin and lycopene, respectively. In contrast, dietary intakes of -carotene, -carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were not found to be significantly linked to a reduced risk of developing lung cancer [(36)](#reference36). In addition, an analysis of the pooled results of 11 [nested case-control](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) and four prospective cohort studies found no association between [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of total carotenoids, -carotene, -lycopene, -cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin and lung cancer. Only high versus low serum lycopene concentrations could be linked to a 29% lower risk of lung cancer [(36)](#reference36). Any protective effect of dietary carotenoids against the development of lung cancer is likely small and not statistically significant [(36)](#reference36). [Supplemental -carotene: The effect of -carotene ] [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) on the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing lung cancer has been examined in three large [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials. In Finland, the -Tocopherol eta-Carotene (ATBC) cancer prevention trial evaluated the effects of 20 mg/day of -carotene and/or 50 mg/day of -tocopherol on more than 29,000 male smokers [(37)](#reference37), and in the United States, the -Carotene And Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) evaluated the effects of a combination of 30 mg/day of -carotene and 25,000 IU/day of retinol (preformed vitamin A) in 18,314 men and women who were smokers, former smokers, or had a history of occupational asbestos exposure [(38)](#reference38). Unexpectedly, the risk of lung cancer in the groups taking -carotene supplements was increased by 16% after six years in the ATBC participants and by 28% after four years in the CARET participants. In contrast, the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) examined the effect of -carotene supplementation (50 mg every other day) on cancer risk in 22,071 male physicians in the United States, of whom only 11% were current smokers [(39)](#reference39). In that lower risk population, -carotene supplementation for more than 12 years was not associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. In addition, in the Linxian General Population trial conducted in about 29,000 Chinese participants, randomization to 15 mg/day of -carotene, 30 mg/day of -tocopherol, and 15 \u00b5g/day of selenium, was not found to be associated with lung cancer mortality 10 years after the intervention ended [(40)](#reference40). Although the reasons for the increase in lung cancer risk are not yet clear and several mechanisms have been proposed [(41)](#reference41). The US Preventive Services Task Force estimated that the risks of high-dose -carotene supplementation outweigh any potential benefits for cancer prevention and recommended against supplementation, especially in smokers or other high-risk populations [(42)](#reference42). [Prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) is the most common cancer affecting US men, more [prevalent](../../glossary#prevalence) than lung and colorectal cancers [(34)](#reference34). Dietary lycopene: Several early [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have suggested that lycopene-rich diets were associated with significant reductions in the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), particularly more aggressive forms [(43)](#reference43). However, pooled data analyses of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that examined potential links between dietary intakes and/or circulating concentrations of lycopene and risk of prostate cancer have given mixed results. An early [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) that combined the results of 10 case-control and four prospective studies found that men with the highest intakes of raw tomatoes, cooked tomatoes, or dietary lycopene had a 11 to 19% lower risk of prostate cancer [(44)](#reference44). In addition, pooled data from two [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and five [nested case-control studies](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) showed a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer in participants with the highest [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of lycopene [(44)](#reference44). Most recently, a meta-analysis of observational studies found no association of prostate cancer risk with dietary lycopene intakes (10 case-cohort and two prospective cohort studies) but an [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) with blood lycopene concentrations (two case-control, nine nested case-control, and one cohort studies) [(45, 46)](#reference45). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 15 nested case-control studies conducted by the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers, and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group showed an inverse association between circulating lycopene concentrations and risk of advanced stage and/or aggressive prostate cancer, while no association was found with risk of non-aggressive or localized disease [(47)](#reference47). While there is considerable scientific interest in the potential for lycopene to help prevent prostate cancer, it is not yet clear whether the prostate cancer risk reduction observed in some observational studies is related to lycopene itself, other compounds in tomatoes, or other factors associated with lycopene-rich diets [(48)](#reference48). Of note, the 2014 World Cancer Research Fund International report on Diet, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Prostate Cancer suggested the need for better designed studies to establish whether consumption of lycopene-containing foods could be linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer [(49)](#reference49). Supplemental lycopene: To date, a few short-term, dietary [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) using lycopene in patients prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia; HGPIN) or [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) have been completed. Specifically, two small [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have recently examined the effect of lycopene supplementation for up to six months in men with HGPIN [(50, 51)](#reference50). The consumption of 30 to 35 mg/day of supplemental lycopene in the form of tomato extract [(50)](#reference50), or together with selenium (55 mg/day) and green tea catechins (600 mg/day) [(51)](#reference51), showed no benefit on the rate of progression to prostate cancer at six-month [(50, 51)](#reference50) and 37-month follow-ups [(51)](#reference51). Earlier small trials in men with HGPIN led to similar conclusions (reviewed in [52](#reference52)). Additionally, a randomized controlled trial in men with localized prostate cancer found that supplementation with 15, 30, or 45 mg of lycopene (until prostatectomy) did not significantly increase [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) lycopene concentration, modify the ratio of [steroid](../../glossary#steroid) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone) in blood, or reduce the concentration of markers of [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) (i.e., prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and Ki-67) compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(53)](#reference53). In another trial, 54 patients with [metastatic](../../glossary#metastasize) prostate cancer were randomized to orchidectomy alone or orchidectomy plus 4 mg/day of lycopene [(54)](#reference54). The proportion of complete clinical response to treatment \u2014 assessed by serum PSA and/or bone scan returning to normal \u2014 and patient survival rate were found to be significantly higher in patients supplemented with lycopene [(54)](#reference54). Large-scale, controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to further examine the safety and efficacy of long-term use of lycopene supplements for prostate cancer prevention or treatment. In a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), no association was found between total and individual carotenoid intake and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of breast cancer, except with -carotene for which a 5% reduction in breast cancer risk was estimated for every 5 mg/day increment in consumption [(55)](#reference55). In a pooled analysis of 14 [nested case-control studies](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) and one follow-up study of a [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial), reductions in breast cancer risk were found to be associated with blood concentrations of total carotenoids (-26%), -carotene (-20%), and lutein (-30%) [(55)](#reference55). Another study that recalibrated data for consistency across eight large prospective cohorts before pooled analysis found reduced breast cancer risk to be associated with the highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of blood concentrations of total carotenoids (-21%), -carotene association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between the blood concentrations of -carotene and -carotene and risk of estrogen receptor-negative (ER-), but not estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), breast tumors [(56)](#reference56). A similar result was recently reported in a case-control study nested within the multicenter, large, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study [(57)](#reference57). Another case-control study nested within the EPIC study found a 31% lower risk of [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) with the highest versus lowest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of -carotene intake, while no associations were shown with blood concentrations of other carotenoids or total carotenoids [(58)](#reference58). The nested case-control study was included in a recent meta-analysis of 22 [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that failed to find associations between carotenoid intakes and colorectal cancer [(59)](#reference59). Pooled data from mostly [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) also suggested that higher intakes of individual carotenoids, especially -cryptoxanthin and lycopene, might be associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and [larynx](../../glossary#larynx) [(60)](#reference60). However, the results of case-control studies are more likely to be distorted by bias than results of prospective studies. Examining blood concentrations of each carotenoid in relation to cancer subsites may help overcome limitations associated with dietary data and differences in carotenoid absorption. In Western countries, degeneration of the [macula](../../glossary#macula), the center of the eye's [retina](../../glossary#retina), is a leading cause of blindness in older adults. Long-term blue light exposure and [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) in the outer segments of photoreceptors may lead to drusen and/or pigment abnormalities in the macula, increasing the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and central blindness. Dietary lutein and zeaxanthin: The carotenoids found in the [retina](../../glossary#retina) are lutein and zeaxanthin, which are both of dietary origin, and meso-zeaxanthin, which is derived from lutein. These three carotenoids are present in high concentrations in the macula (known as macular pigment), where they are efficient absorbers of blue light. They may prevent a substantial amount of the blue light entering the eye from reaching the underlying structures involved in vision and protect against light-induced [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage), which is thought to play a role in the [pathology](../../glossary#pathology) of age-related macular degeneration (reviewed in [19](#reference19)). It is also possible, though not proven, that lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin, act directly to neutralize [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidation) formed in the retina. Increasing dietary consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin was shown to raise their [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentration and macular pigment density [(61, 62)](#reference61). Some, but not all, [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have provided evidence that higher intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin are associated with lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of age-related degeneration (AMD) [(63)](#reference63). While [cross-sectional](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and retrospective [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) found that higher levels of lutein and zeaxanthin diet [(64-66)](#reference64), blood [(67, 68)](#reference67), and retina [(69, 70)](#reference69) were associated with a lower incidence of AMD, several prospective cohort studies found no relationship between baseline dietary intakes or serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and the risk of developing AMD over time [(71-74)](#reference71). A recent report examined the association between the incidence of AMD and calculated dietary intakes and predicted [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin in older adults (50 years) from two large prospective cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 63,443 women) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 38,603 men), followed for 26 years and 24 years, respectively [(75)](#reference75). The highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of predicted plasma lutein and zeaxanthin scores was associated with a 41% lower risk of advanced AMD, yet no association was found with intermediate AMD. The evidence also suggested that the consumption of about 6 mg/day of lutein and zeaxanthin from [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) (compared with less than 2 mg/day) may decrease the risk of advanced AMD [(75)](#reference75). Supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin: The first [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in patients with [atrophic](../../glossary#atrophy) AMD found that supplementation with 10 mg/day of lutein slightly improved visual acuity after one year compared to a placebo [(76)](#reference76). The effects of long-term lutein supplementation on atrophic AMD were further investigated in combination with [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [vitamins](../../glossary#vitamin) and [minerals](../../glossary#mineral) in the Age-Related mg/day), vitamin C (500 mg/day), vitamin E (400 IU/day), zinc (80 mg/day as zinc oxide), and copper (2 mg/day as cupric oxide) for five years was shown to reduce the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% [(77)](#reference77). In the AREDS2 study conducted in 4,203 participants at risk for developing late AMD, supplemental lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day), in combination with -carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and copper (the 'AREDS' formulation), did not slow the progression to advanced AMD, although subgroup analyses revealed a benefit in those with the lowest dietary intakes of lutein + zeaxanthin [(77)](#reference77). A total of 3,036 subjects were further randomized to various combinations of carotenoids; supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin significantly reduced the risk of progression to late AMD and to neovascular AMD compared to supplementation with -carotene [(78)](#reference78). Several smaller (n=30-433) randomized controlled trials also suggested that supplementation with xanthophyll carotenoids would be beneficial in the management of AMD (reviewed in [79](#reference79)). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight trials that examined the effect of supplemental lutein (6 to 20 mg/day) or/and zeaxanthin (0 to 10 mg/day) in 1,176 AMD subjects for up to 36 months found improvements in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity with increased levels of xanthophyll carotenoids [(80)](#reference80). Finally, a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial found daily consumption of a buttermilk drink with egg yolks enriched with lutein (1.4 mg), zeaxanthin (0.2 mg), and an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (DHA; 160 mg) for one year improved visual acuity and macular pigment optical density in subjects with drusen and/or retinal pigment abnormalities (about half of them being classified as having early AMD) [(81)](#reference81). Supplemental -carotene: The first [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) designed to examine the effect of a carotenoid [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) on AMD used -carotene in combination with vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc because lutein and zeaxanthin were not commercially available as supplements at the time the trial began [(82)](#reference82). Although the combination of [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) and zinc lowered the risk of developing advanced macular degeneration in individuals with signs of moderate-to-severe macular degeneration in at least one eye, it is unlikely that the benefit was related to -carotene since it is not present in the [retina](../../glossary#retina). Supplementation of male smokers in Finland with 20 mg/day of -carotene for six years did not decrease the risk of AMD compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(83)](#reference83). A placebo-controlled trial in a cohort of 22,071 healthy US men found that -carotene supplementation (50 mg every other day) had no effect on the incidence of age-related maculopathy \u2014 an early stage of AMD [(84)](#reference84). Recent [systematic reviews](../../glossary#systematic-review) of randomized controlled trials have concluded that there is no evidence that -carotene supplementation prevents or delays the onset of AMD [(85, 86)](#reference85). Retinopathy of prematurity Preterm infants have an immature retinal vascular system that places them at [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Basically, preterm birth halts the normal development of [retinal](../../glossary#retina) vascular system, which results in a retina that is poorly vascularized and highly susceptible to hyperoxia. In order to meet metabolic demand, the hypoxic retina induces the production of proangiogenic factors like VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). These factors stimulate the development of new blood vessels ( [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis)), causing aberrant vessels sprouting from the retina into the vitreous. It is thought that an imbalance between the production of [reactive oxygen species](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) and the reduced levels of [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) in preterm infants contributes to ROP pathogenesis and causes additional damage to the retina (reviewed in [87](#reference87)). Supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin: A [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 62 preterm infants (32 weeks of [gestational](../../glossary#gestation) age) failed to observe any benefits regarding ROP incidence and severity with lutein (0.5 mg/kg/day) and zeaxanthin (0.02 mg/kg/day) supplemented from the seventh day post birth until about 10 weeks of age [(88)](#reference88). In two other multicenter, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in a total of 343 preterm infants, a daily oral dose of 0.14 mg of lutein and 0.006 mg of zeaxanthin administered from the first week after birth did not significantly reduce ROP incidence or the rate of progression from early to more advanced stages of ROP occurrence [(89, 90)](#reference89). A fourth multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 203 preterm infants found that administration of a formula containing carotenoids (lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and -carotene) had no effect on ROP incidence but limited the progression to severe ROP stages in infants with mild ROP compared to a carotenoid-free formula [(91)](#reference91). Compared with the control formula, preterm infants free of ROP fed the carotenoid-containing formula had significantly increased [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) carotenoid concentrations, which were correlated with greater rod photoreceptor sensitivity [(91)](#reference91). More research is needed to examine whether carotenoid supplementation might promote normal photoreceptor development and prevent ROP in preterm infants. Diabetic retinopathy Supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin has been shown to help preserve [retina](../../glossary#retina) integrity in [diabetic](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) rodents by reducing [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) (-carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin) was associated with a reduced risk of diabetic retinopathy in a [cross-sectional analysis](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 111 individuals with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(92)](#reference92). Recent data from 1,430 individuals participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study found no association between lutein intake and diabetic retinopathy after adjustment for [confounding](../../glossary#confounder) variables [(93)](#reference93). To date, the role of carotenoids in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy has not been examined in [clinical studies](../../glossary#clinical-trial). The primary function of the eye's [lens](../../glossary#lens) is to collect and focus light on the [retina](../../glossary#retina). Ultraviolet light and [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidation) can damage [proteins](../../glossary#protein) in the lens, causing structural changes that result in the formation of opacities known as [cataracts](../../glossary#cataract). As people age, cumulative damage to lens proteins often results in cataracts that are large enough to interfere with vision [(10)](#reference10). Risk factors other than aging and sunlight exposure include smoking, [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), higher [body mass index](../../glossary#body-mass-index), and use of [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) replacement therapy. An estimated 50 million US adults are projected to be affected by age-related cataracts by 2050 [(94)](#reference94). Dietary lutein and zeaxanthin: The observation that lutein and zeaxanthin are the only carotenoids in the human [lens](../../glossary#lens) has stimulated interest in the potential for increased intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin to prevent or slow the progression of cataracts (reviewed in [79](#reference79)). Large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have found that men and women with the highest intakes of foods rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, particularly spinach, kale, and broccoli, were 18%-50% less likely to require cataract extraction [(95, 96)](#reference95) or develop cataracts [(97-99)](#reference97). Moreover, [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin have been found to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) to the progression of nuclear cataract. Additional research is required to determine whether these findings are related specifically to lutein and zeaxanthin intake or to other factors associated with diets high in carotenoid-rich foods [(63)](#reference63). Supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin: The Age-related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) failed to show an effect of supplemental lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day; supplementation for a median of 4.7 years) on the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing [cataract](../../glossary#cataract), on the progression to severe cataract or to cataract surgery, and on visual acuity [(100)](#reference100). However, the results might have been [confounded](../../glossary#confounder) by the fact that most participants were better nourished than the general population and/or used multivitamins that have been found to decrease the risk of developing cataract [(101)](#reference101). Additional limitations to consider in interpreting the results have been reviewed elsewhere [(100)](#reference100). Additional [interventions](../../glossary#intervention-trial) are required to study whether supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin might be helpful in the prevention of cataract. Supplemental -carotene: Evidence from [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that [cataracts](../../glossary#cataract) were less [prevalent](../../glossary#prevalence) in people with high dietary intakes and blood concentrations of carotenoids led to the inclusion of -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in several large [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant). The results of those trials have been somewhat conflicting. -Carotene supplementation (20 mg/day) for more than six years did not affect the prevalence of cataracts or the frequency of cataract surgery in male smokers living in Finland [(83)](#reference83). In contrast, a 12-year study of male physicians in the US found that -carotene supplementation (50 mg every other day) decreased the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of cataracts in smokers but not in nonsmokers [(102)](#reference102). Note that use of -carotene supplements have been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers (see [Supplemental -carotene in lung cancer](#supplemenal-beta-carotene-lung-cancer)). Three randomized controlled trials examined the effect of an antioxidant combination that included -carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E on the progression of cataracts. Two trials found no benefit after supplementation for five years [(103)](#reference103) or more than six years [(104)](#reference104), but one trial found a small decrease in the progression of cataracts after three years of supplementation [(105)](#reference105). Overall, the results of randomized controlled trials suggest that the benefit of -carotene supplementation in slowing the progression of age-related cataracts does not outweigh the potential risks. Dietary carotenoids: Because carotenoids are very [soluble](../../glossary#soluble) in fat and very insoluble in water, they circulate in [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein), along with [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and other fats. Evidence that low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)) [oxidation](../../glossary#oxidation) plays a role in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) led scientists to investigate the role of [antioxidant ](../../glossary#antioxidant)compounds like carotenoids in the prevention of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(106)](#reference106). The thickness of the inner layers of the [carotid arteries](../../glossary#carotid-arteries) can be measured noninvasively using [ultrasound](../../glossary#ultrasonography) technology. This measurement of carotid intima-media thickness is considered a reliable marker of atherosclerosis [(107)](#reference107). A number of [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and [cross-sectional studies](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have found higher blood concentrations of carotenoids to be associated with significantly lower measures of carotid artery intima-media thickness [(108-113)](#reference108). Additionally, higher [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) carotenoids at baseline have been associated with significant reductions in [risk](../../glossary#risk) of cardiovascular disease in some [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [(114-118)](#reference114) but not in others [(119-122)](#reference119). More recently, an analysis of data from the 2003-2006 US National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in a sample of 2,856 adults found that [serum](../../glossary#serum) total carotenoid concentration was [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) to blood concentrations of two cardiovascular risk factors, [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) and total [homocysteine](../../glossary#homocysteine) [(123)](#reference123). [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol concentration was to be positively associated with -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations, but only the latter was inversely associated with LDL-cholesterol [(123)](#reference123). Finally, a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (-12%) and [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) (-18%) in individuals in the highest versus lowest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of blood lutein concentration [(124)](#reference124). While the results of several prospective studies indicate that people with higher intakes of carotenoid-rich [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) are at lower risk of cardiovascular disease [(122](#reference122), [125-127)](#reference125), it is not yet clear whether this effect is a result of carotenoids or other factors associated with diets high in carotenoid-rich fruit and vegetables. Supplemental -carotene: In contrast to the results of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggesting that high dietary intakes trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no evidence that -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in doses ranging from 20 to 50 mg/day were effective in preventing cardiovascular disease [(39](#reference39), [128-130)](#reference128). Based on the results of these randomized controlled trials, the US Preventive Health Services Task Force found good evidence to suggest that -carotene supplements provided no benefit in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in healthy adults [(42)](#reference42). Thus, although diets rich in -carotene have generally been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk in observational studies, there is no evidence that -carotene supplementation reduces cardiovascular disease risk [(131)](#reference131). A recent experimental study found that the administration of -cryptoxanthin to ovariectomized mice limited bone [resorption](../../glossary#resorption) by inhibiting [osteoclast](../../glossary#osteoclast) [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation) but had no effect on [osteoblast](../../glossary#osteoblast)-driven bone formation [(132)](#reference132). Yet, evidence of a protective role of -cryptoxanthin \u2014 and other individual carotenoids \u2014 against bone loss in humans is scarce. In the [prospective](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) Framingham Osteoporosis Study, data analysis of 603 participants found no association between -cryptoxanthin intake and changes in [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) over a four-year period [(133)](#reference133). total and individual carotenoids (-carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin) were positively associated with proximal BMD in men over a four-year period, while lycopene intake was positively linked to lumbar spine BMD in women [(133)](#reference133). The 17-year follow-up of participants in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study (946 participants) showed those in the highest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of total carotenoid intake (median intake: 23.7 mg/day) had a 51% lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../../glossary#fracture) compared to those in the lowest tertile (median intake: 7.3 mg/day) [(134)](#reference134). In a much larger prospective study \u2014 the Singapore Chinese Health Study \u2014 in 63,257 men and women followed for 10 years, the highest versus lowest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of total carotenoid intake was associated with a 37% lower risk of hip fracture in men but not in women [(135)](#reference135). Dietary intakes of - and -carotene \u2014 but not of -cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin \u2014 were [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with hip fracture risk in men [(135)](#reference135). Nevertheless, in a small, four-year, Japanese prospective cohort study in 457 adults, the risk of [osteoporosis](../../glossary#osteoporosis) was 93% lower in postmenopausal women in the highest versus lowest tertile of [serum](../../glossary#serum) -cryptoxanthin concentration [(136)](#reference136). No such association was reported with serum concentrations of other individual carotenoids. Whether carotenoid supplementation may help prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of osteoporosis in older individuals is currently unknown. [Observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have suggested that dietary lutein may be of benefit in maintaining [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) health [(137, 138)](#reference137). As stated above, among the carotenoids, lutein and its [isomer](../../glossary#isomer) zeaxanthin are the only two that cross the blood- [retina](../../glossary#retina) barrier to form macular pigment in the eye. Lutein also preferentially accumulates in the brain [(139, 140)](#reference139). Recent studies suggested that lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations in the [macula](../../glossary#macula) were correlated with brain lutein and zeaxanthin status and might be used as a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) to assess cognitive health [(140-142)](#reference140). Additionally, in the Georgia Centenarian Study, the analysis of [cross-sectional](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data from 47 centenarian decedents showed a positive association between post-mortem measures of brain lutein concentrations and pre-mortem measures of cognitive function [(139)](#reference139). Brain lutein concentrations were found to be significantly lower in individuals with mild cognitive impairment compared to those with normal cognitive function [(139)](#reference139). In a small, four-month, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in older women (ages, 60 to 80 years) without cognitive impairment, supplementation with lutein (12 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (~0.5 mg/day) significantly improved cognitive test performance [(143)](#reference143). Nevertheless, the Age-related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) failed to show an effect of supplemental lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day; supplementation for a median of 4.7 years) on the cognitive test scores of 3,741 participants (mean age, 72.7 years) [(144)](#reference144). The most prevalent carotenoids in the and zeaxanthin the all-trans form (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) and [Figure 2](#figure-2) above), although cooking may result in the formation of other [isomers](../../glossary#isomer). The relatively low [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of carotenoids from most foods compared to [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) is partly due to the fact that they are associated with [proteins](../../glossary#protein) in the plant matrix [(145)](#reference145). Chopping, homogenizing, and cooking disrupt the plant matrix, increasing the bioavailability of carotenoids [(3)](#reference3). For example, the bioavailability of lycopene from tomatoes is substantially improved by heating tomatoes in oil [(146, 147)](#reference146). -Carotene and -carotene are provitamin A carotenoids, meaning they can be converted in the body to vitamin A. The vitamin A activity of -carotene in food is 112 that of retinol (preformed vitamin A). Thus, it would take 12 \u00b5g of -carotene from food to provide the equivalent of 1 \u00b5g (0.001 mg) of retinol. The vitamin A activity of -carotene from foods is 124 that of retinol, so it would take 24 \u00b5g of -carotene from food to provide the equivalent of 1 \u00b5g of retinol. Orange and yellow vegetables like carrots and winter squash are rich sources of - and -carotene. Spinach is also a rich source of -carotene, although the chlorophyll in spinach leaves hides the yellow-orange pigment. Some foods that are good sources of -carotene and -carotene are listed in Table 2 provitamin A carotenoid. The vitamin A activity of -cryptoxanthin from food was estimated to be 124 that of retinol, so it would take 24 \u00b5g of -cryptoxanthin from food to provide the equivalent of 1 \u00b5g of retinol. Orange and red fruit and vegetables like sweet red peppers and oranges are particularly rich sources of -cryptoxanthin. Some foods that are good sources of -cryptoxanthin are listed in raw||1 wedge (116 of a melon that is 15 inches long x 7.5 inches grapefruit, watermelon, and guava their red color. It has been estimated that 80% of the lycopene in the US diet comes from tomatoes and tomato products like tomato sauce, tomato paste, and ketchup (catsup) [(149)](#reference149). Lycopene is not a provitamin A carotenoid because it cannot be converted to retinol. Some foods that are good sources of lycopene are listed in Table raw||1 wedge (116 of a melon that is 15 inches long x 7.5 inches in and zeaxanthin are different compounds, they are both classified as xanthophylls and nonprovitamin A carotenoids (see [Figure 2](#figure-2) above). Some methods used to quantify lutein and zeaxanthin in food do not separate the two compounds, so they are typically reported as lutein and zeaxanthin or lutein + zeaxanthin. Both pigments are present in a variety of [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables). Dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale are particularly rich sources of lutein but poor sources of zeaxanthin [(150)](#reference150). Although relatively low in lutein, egg yolks and avocados are highly [bioavailable](../../glossary#bioavailability) sources of lutein. Good sources of dietary zeaxanthin include yellow corn, orange pepper, orange juice, honeydew (melon), and mango [(150)](#reference150). Some foods containing lutein and zeaxanthin are content of certain foods, search [USDA's FoodData Central database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). Dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) providing purified carotenoids and combinations of carotenoids are commercially available in the US without a prescription. Carotenoids are best absorbed when taken with a meal containing fat. [Supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing a mixture of carotenoids may include -carotene. As a provitamin A carotenoid, supplemental -carotene can contribute to fulfill vitamin A requirements. It is not known whether the relative [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of supplemental -carotene is greater than that of dietary -carotene. [Supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing a mixture of carotenoids may include -cryptoxanthin. As a provitamin A carotenoid, supplemental -cryptoxanthin can contribute to fulfill vitamin A requirements. It is not known whether the relative bioavailability of supplemental -cryptoxanthin is greater than that of dietary -cryptoxanthin. -Carotene is sold as individual [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) and also found in supplements marketed to promote visual health [(151)](#reference151). Commercially available -carotene supplements usually contain between 1.5 mg and 15 mg of either synthetic -carotene or natural -carotene (mainly from the algae Dunaliella salina) per softgel capsule [(150)](#reference150). As a provitamin A carotenoid, -carotene may be used to provide all or part of the vitamin A in [multivitamin supplements](../../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements). The provitamin A activity of -carotene from supplements is much higher than that of -carotene from food: it takes only 2 micrograms [\u00b5g] (0.002 mg) of -carotene from supplements to provide 1 \u00b5g of retinol (preformed vitamin A) compared to 12 \u00b5g of dietary -carotene. Of note, the -carotene content of supplements is often listed in international units (IU) rather than \u00b5g: 3,000 \u00b5g (3 mg) of supplemental -carotene provides 5,000 IU of vitamin A. Lycopene has no provitamin A activity. Synthetic lycopene and lycopene from natural sources, mainly tomatoes, are available as nutritional [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing up to 15 mg of lycopene per softgel capsule [(150)](#reference150). Lutein as [esters](../../glossary#ester) (esterified to [fatty acids](../../glossary#fatty-acid)). Both forms appear to have comparable [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) [(152)](#reference152). Many commercially available lutein and zeaxanthin supplements have much higher amounts of lutein than zeaxanthin [(150)](#reference150). Supplements containing only lutein or zeaxanthin are also available. Although -carotene can be converted to vitamin A, the conversion of -carotene to vitamin A decreases when body stores of vitamin A are high (see [Absorption, Metabolism, and Bioavailability](#absorption-metabolism-bioavailability)). This may explain why high doses of -carotene have never been found to cause vitamin A toxicity. High doses of -carotene (up to 180 mg/day) have been used to treat erythropoietic protoporphyria, a photosensitivity disorder, without toxic side effects [(8)](#reference8). No toxicities have been reported [(153)](#reference153). Increased lung cancer risk: Two [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in smokers and former asbestos workers found that [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) with 20 to 30 mg/day of -carotene for 4 to 6 years was associated with significant 16%-28% increases in the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of lung [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) (see [Supplemental -carotene in lung cancer)](#supplemenal-beta-carotene-lung-cancer). Although the reasons for these findings are not yet clear, the potential risk of lung cancer in smokers and other high-risk groups supplemented with high-dose -carotene outweigh any possible benefits for [chronic disease](../../glossary#chronic-disease) prevention [(42)](#reference42). It should be noted that there is no evidence that -carotene supplementation may harm nonsmokers. Carotenodermia: High doses of -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) (30 mg/day) and the consumption of large amounts of carotene-rich food have resulted in a yellow discoloration of the skin (xanthoderma) known as carotenodermia. Carotenodermia is not associated with any underlying health problems and resolves when supplementation with -carotene is discontinued or dietary carotene intake is reduced. Lycopenodermia: High intakes of lycopene-rich food or [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) may result in a deep orange discoloration of the skin known as lycopenodermia. Because lycopene is more intensely colored than the carotenes, lycopenodermia may occur at lower doses than carotenodermia [(8)](#reference8). Lutein and zeaxanthin Adverse effects of lutein and zeaxanthin have not been reported [(150)](#reference150). Unlike vitamin A, high doses of -carotene taken by pregnant women have not been associated with increased risk of birth defects [(8)](#reference8). However, the safety of high-dose -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in pregnancy and lactation has not been well studied. Although there is no reason to limit dietary -carotene intake, pregnant and breast-feeding women should avoid consuming more than 3 mg/day (1,500 \u00b5g RAE/day; 5,000 IU/day) of -carotene from supplements unless they prescribed under medical supervision. The safety of carotenoid [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) other than -carotene in pregnancy and lactation has not been established, so pregnant and breast-feeding women should obtain carotenoids from food rather than supplements. There is no reason to limit the consumption of carotenoid-rich [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) during fat- and carotenoids, as can mineral oil and Orlistat (Xenical), a drug used to treat obesity [(150)](#reference150). Colchicine, a drug used to treat [gout](../../glossary#gout), can cause intestinal [malabsorption](../../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome). However, long-term use of 1 to 2 mg/day of colchicine did not affect [serum](../../glossary#serum) -carotene concentrations in one study [(154)](#reference154). Increasing gastric [pH](../../glossary#pH) through the use of proton-pump inhibitors (Omeprazole, Lansoprazole) may decrease the absorption of a single dose of a -carotene supplement, but the effect is unlikely to be clinically significant [(155)](#reference155). A three-year [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 patients with documented [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) and low [serum](../../glossary#serum) high density lipoprotein ( [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)) concentrations found that a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and [niacin](../../vitamins/niacin) increased HDL2 levels, inhibited the progression of [coronary artery](../../glossary#coronary-arteries) [stenosis](../../glossary#stenosis), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) events, [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) and [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) [(156)](#reference156). Surprisingly, when an [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) combination of 1,000 mg of vitamin C, 536 mg of RRR--tocopherol (vitamin E), 100 \u00b5g of selenium, and 25 mg of -carotene daily was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects were diminished. Since the antioxidants were taken together in this trial, the individual contribution of -carotene cannot be determined. In contrast, a much larger randomized controlled trial of simvastatin and an antioxidant combination of 297 mg of RRR--tocopherol, 250 mg of vitamin C, and 20 mg of -carotene daily in more than 20,000 men and women with CHD or [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found that the antioxidant combination did not diminish the cardioprotective effects of simvastatin therapy over a five-year period [(157)](#reference157). These contradictory findings indicate that further research is needed on potential interactions between antioxidant supplements and cholesterol-lowering agents, such as niacin and statins. In a controlled feeding study, consumption of 18 g/day of the fat substitute Olestra (sucrose polyester; Olean) resulted in a 27% decrease in [serum](../../glossary#serum) carotenoid concentrations after three weeks [(158)](#reference158). Studies in people before and after the introduction of Olestra-containing snacks to the marketplace found that total serum carotenoid concentrations decreased by 15% in those who reported consuming at least 2 g/day of Olestra [(159)](#reference159). One study in adults found that those who consumed more than 4.4 g of Olestra weekly experienced a 9.7% decline in total serum carotenoids compared to those not consuming Olestra [(160)](#reference160). Some studies found that the regular use of plant sterol-containing spreads resulted in modest, 10%-20% decreases in the [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of some carotenoids, particularly -carotene, -carotene, and lycopene (see the article on [Phytosterols](phytosterols)) [(161, 162)](#reference161). However, advising people who use plant sterol- or stanol-containing margarines to consume an extra serving of carotenoid-rich [fruit or vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) daily prevented decreases in plasma carotenoid concentrations [(163, 164)](#reference163). The relationships between alcohol consumption and carotenoid [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) are not well understood. There is some evidence that regular alcohol consumption inhibits the conversion of -carotene to retinol [(165)](#reference165). Increases in lung supplementation in two [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) were enhanced in those with higher alcohol intakes [(38](#reference38), [166)](#reference166). The results of metabolic studies suggested that high doses of -carotene competed with lutein and lycopene for absorption when consumed at the same time [(167-169)](#reference167). However, the consumption of high-dose -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) did not adversely affect serum carotenoid concentrations in long-term clinical trials [(170-173)](#reference170).

Plants use chlorophyll to trap light needed for photosynthesis [(1)](#references). The basic structure of chlorophyll is a porphyrin ring similar to that of [heme](../../glossary#heme) in [hemoglobin](../../glossary#hemoglobin), although the central atom in chlorophyll is [magnesium](../../minerals/magnesium) instead of [iron](../../minerals/iron). The long hydrocarbon (phytol) tail attached to the porphyrin ring makes chlorophyll fat-soluble and insoluble in water. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b represent about 99% of the chlorophyll species found in edible plants (Figure 1; [2](#reference2)), while some algae and microalgae contain minor quantities chlorophyll c pigments (e.g., Laminaria ochroleuca, Undaria pinnatifida) [(3)](#reference3). Chlorophyll a and b only have a small difference in one of the side chains but an intact phytol tail, while the common characteristic of chlorophyll c isoforms is the absence of a phytol tail. These structural differences cause each type of chlorophyll to absorb light at slightly different wavelengths. Metallo-chlorophyll derivatives, including chlorophyllins, can be chemically synthesized or produced in industrial food processing; these compounds contain [zinc](../../minerals/zinc), iron, or [copper](../../minerals/copper) in place of the central magnesium atom [(2)](#reference2). The most studied chlorophyllin, sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), is a semi-synthetic mixture of sodium copper salts derived from chlorophyll [(4, 5)](#reference4). SCC is often simply called 'chlorophyllin' in the older scientific literature, with newer publications specifying whether iron, zinc, copper, or magnesium chlorophyllin were studied. During its synthesis, the magnesium atom at the center of the ring is replaced with copper (or other metals), and the phytol tail is lost. Unlike natural chlorophyll, chlorophyllins (regardless of the metal used) are water-soluble. Although the content of different SCC mixtures may vary, two compounds commonly found in commercial SCC are trisodium copper chlorin e6 and disodium copper chlorin e4 (Figure 2). Little is known about the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of chlorophyll in humans, although it is known that chlorophyll undergoes extensive metabolism once consumed. Animal model studies show only about 1%-3% of chlorophyll is absorbed, while the rest is [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in the feces, primarily as pheopytin and pyropheophytin metabolites, indicating that significant transformation and microbial metabolism occur in the gastrointestinal tract (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). A recent study in eight healthy adults found pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives in the blood of most subjects following consumption of 1.2 kg boiled spinach, a concentrated source of chlorophyll [(6)](#reference6). Sodium copper chlorophyllin was originally thought to be poorly absorbed because of its lack of apparent toxicity. However, a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that significant amounts of copper chlorin e4 in the [serum](../../glossary#serum) of people taking chlorophyllin tablets (300 mg/day) [(7)](#reference7), indicating that it is indeed absorbed. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies have found chlorin e4 to have a higher stability than chlorin e6 [(2)](#reference2). More research, however, is needed to understand the bioavailability and metabolism of natural chlorophylls and chlorin compounds in synthetic chlorophyllin. Chlorophyll and sodium copper chlorophyllin are able to form tight molecular complexes with certain chemicals known or suspected to cause [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), including polyaromatic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke [(8)](#reference8), some amines found in cooked meat [(9)](#reference9), and aflatoxin-B1 [(10)](#reference10). The binding of chlorophyll or SCC to these potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) may interfere with [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption of potential carcinogens, reducing the amount that reaches susceptible tissues [(11)](#reference11). This has been demonstrated in humans: a [cross-over study](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) in three volunteers that used accelerator mass spectrometry to study the [pharmacokinetics](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) of an ultra-low dose of aflatoxin-B1 found a 150-mg dose of either SCC or chlorophyll could decrease absorption of aflatoxin-B1 [(12)](#reference12). SCC can neutralize several physically relevant [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidant) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(13-16)](#reference13), and limited data from animal studies suggest that SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) may decrease [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) induced by chemical [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) and radiation [(17, 18)](#reference17). While chlorophyll and its derivatives have demonstrated [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity in in vitro assays [(15](#reference15), [19)](#reference19), the relevance of these findings to humans is not clear. To initiate the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), some chemicals ( [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen)) must first be metabolized to active [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) that are capable of damaging [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) or other critical molecules in susceptible tissues. Since [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) in the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) family are required for the activation of some procarcinogens, inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes may decrease the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of some types of chemically induced cancers. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies indicate that SCC may decrease the activity cytochrome P450 enzymes [(8](#reference8), [20, 21)](#reference20). Phase II biotransformation enzymes promote the elimination of potentially harmful toxins and carcinogens from the body. Limited data from animal studies indicate that SCC may increase the activity of the phase II enzyme quinone reductase [(22)](#reference22). One [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) study showed that human [colon](../../glossary#colon) cancer cells undergo cell cycle arrest after treatment with SCC [(23)](#reference23). The mechanism involved inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity. Ribonucleotide reductase plays a pivotal role in [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) synthesis and repair and is a target of currently used cancer therapeutic agents, such as hydroxyurea [(23)](#reference23). While this may provide a potential avenue for SCC in the clinical setting, sensitizing cancer cells to DNA damaging agents, [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) studies are needed. The porphyrin structure of chlorophyll is analogous to the [heme](../../glossary#heme) structure found in blood and muscle tissue. Because heme-bound iron has higher [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) than nonheme iron (the most common form of iron in plant-based sources, e.g., [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), spinach), iron uptake from iron chlorophyll is of interest. Toxicity studies in rats suggest iron chlorophyllin is generally safe for mammalian consumption [(24)](#reference24). [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies demonstrate that iron chlorophyllin is as good as heme in delivering iron to intestinal cells, and significantly better than the most common supplemental form of iron (i.e., ferrous sulfate) when incorporated into most food matrices [(25)](#reference25). However, work in this area is nascent and has not yet been validated in humans. It is also not known if metallo-chlorophyll derivatives of copper or zinc increase absorption of these essential divalent metals. Aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1), a liver [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen) produced by certain species of fungus, is found in moldy grains and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), including corn, peanuts, and soybeans [(4](#reference4), [11)](#reference11). In hot, humid regions of Africa and Asia with improper grain storage facilities, high levels of dietary AFB1 are associated with increased [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [hepatocellular carcinoma](../../glossary#hepatocellular-carcinoma). Moreover, the combination of [hepatitis](../../glossary#hepatitis) B infection and high dietary AFB1 exposure increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma still further. In the liver, AFB1 is metabolized to a carcinogen capable of binding [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and causing [mutations](../../glossary#mutation). In animal models of AFB1-induced liver [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), administration of SCC at the same time as dietary AFB1 exposure significantly reduces AFB1-induced DNA damage in the livers of rainbow trout and rats [(26-28)](#reference26) and dose-dependently inhibits the development of liver cancer in trout [(29)](#reference29). Likewise, natural chlorophyll has also been found to inhibit AFB1-induced liver cancer in the rat [(28)](#reference28). Collectively, this evidence supports a role for SCC and/or chlorophyll itself in limiting cancer initiation. In contrast, data suggest a limited role for SCC in influencing cancer progression. For example, one rat study found that SCC did not protect against aflatoxin-induced liver damage when given after tumor initiation [(30)](#reference30). Because of the long time period between AFB1 exposure and the development of cancer in humans, an [intervention trial](../../glossary#intervention-trial) might require as long as 20 years to determine whether SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) can reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people exposed to high levels of dietary AFB1. However, a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of AFB1-induced DNA damage (AFB1-N7-guanine) can be measured in the urine, and high urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine have been associated with significantly increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma [(31)](#reference31). In order to determine whether chlorophyllin could decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage in humans, a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled intervention trial was conducted in 180 adults residing in a region in China where the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is very high due to unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure and a high [prevalence](../../glossary#prevalence) of chronic hepatitis B infection [(32)](#reference32). Participants took either 100 mg of SCC or a placebo before meals three times daily. After 16 weeks of treatment, urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine were 55% lower in those taking SCC than in those taking the placebo, suggesting that SCC supplementation before meals can substantially decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage. Although a reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma has not yet been demonstrated in humans taking SCC, scientists are hopeful that supplementation will provide some protection to high-risk populations with unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure [(11)](#reference11). It is not known whether SCC will be useful in the prevention of cancers in people who are not exposed to significant levels of dietary AFB1, as is the case for most people living in the US. Many questions remain to be answered regarding the exact mechanisms of cancer prevention by SCC, the implications for the prevention of other types of cancer, and the potential for natural chlorophylls in the diet to provide cancer protection. Observations in the 1940s and 1950s that [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC had deodorizing effects on foul-smelling wounds led clinicians to administer SCC orally to patients with [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy) in order to control fecal odor [(33)](#reference33). While early [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) indicated that SCC doses of 100 to 200 mg/day were effective in reducing fecal odor in ostomy patients [(34, 35)](#reference34), a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial found that 75 mg of oral SCC three times daily was no more effective than placebo in decreasing fecal odor assessed by colostomy patients 36. Several case reports have been published indicating that oral SCC (100-300 mg/day) decreased subjective assessments of urinary and fecal odor in incontinent patients [(33](#reference33), [37)](#reference37). [Trimethylaminuria](../../glossary#trimethylaminuria) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of trimethylamine, a compound with a \"fishy\" or foul odor. One study in a small number of Japanese patients with trimethylaminuria found that oral SCC (60 mg three times daily) for three weeks significantly decreased urinary trimethylamine concentrations [(38)](#reference38). Research in the 1940s indicated that chlorophyllin slowed the growth of certain [anaerobic](../../glossary#anaerobic) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) in the test tube and accelerated the healing of experimental wounds in animals. These findings led to the use of [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC solutions and ointments in the treatment of persistent open wounds in humans [(39)](#reference39). During the late 1940s and 1950s, a series of largely uncontrolled studies in patients with slow-healing wounds, such as vascular ulcers and pressure (decubitus) ulcers, reported that the application of topical SCC promoted healing more effectively than other commonly used treatments [(40, 41)](#reference40). In the late 1950s, SCC was added to papain and urea-containing ointments used for the chemical debridement of wounds in order to reduce local [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), promote healing, and control odor [(33)](#reference33). SCC-containing papain/urea ointments are still available in the US by prescription [(42)](#reference42). Several studies have reported that such ointments are effective in wound healing [(43)](#reference43). A spray formulation of the papain/urea/SCC therapy is also available [(44)](#reference44). A few small studies have investigated SCC as a topical treatment for various skin conditions. In a [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study) of 10 adults (ages 18-30 years) who had mild-to-moderate [acne vulgaris](../../glossary#acne-vulgaris) and enlarged facial pores, twice daily application of a 0.1% liposomal SCC gel for three weeks improved a number of clinical parameters of the Global Acne Assessment Scale (i.e., facial oiliness, facial blotchiness, presence and size of facial pores, and number of acne lesions) compared to baseline [(45)](#reference45). Additionally, a pilot study in 10 women (ages 40 years or older) with noticeable photodamage and solar lentigines found that twice daily topical application of a gel containing 0.66% SCC complex salts for eight weeks improved various clinical measures, including tactile and visual roughness of facial skin, skin radiance, fine lines, pore size, and overall photodamage [(46)](#reference46). A few [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) have also observed some improvement in facial redness and rosacea with application of topical SCC [(47)](#reference47). While the reports from these studies are interesting, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether SCC may have utility in treating various skin conditions. Chlorophylls are the most abundant pigments in plants, with chlorophyll a being two to four times as prevalent as chlorophyll b [(6](#reference6), [48)](#reference48). Dark-green leafy vegetables like spinach are rich sources of natural chlorophylls. The chlorophyll content of selected vegetables are presented in are often marketed as [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) sources of chlorophyll. Because natural chlorophyll is not as stable as SCC and is much more expensive, most over-the-counter chlorophyll supplements actually contain sodium copper chlorophyllin. Oral preparations of sodium copper chlorophyllin (also called chlorophyllin copper complex) are available as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) and as an over-the-counter drug (Derifil) used to reduce odor from [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy), or to reduce fecal odor due to incontinence [(50)](#reference50). Oral doses of 100 to 300 mg/day in three divided doses have been used to control fecal and urinary odor (see [Therapeutic Uses of Chlorophyllin](#therapeutic-uses)). In the US, SCC is found in minor quantities in some types of green table olives [(51)](#reference51). It is also used as a green color additive in foods like chewing gum [(52)](#reference52), as well as in drugs and cosmetics [(53)](#reference53). In US supermarkets, canned green beans thermally processed in a zinc chloride solution to produce zinc chlorophyll derivatives within the green beans themselves are sold under the trademarked name \"veri-green\" [(54)](#reference54). Because zinc chlorophyll derivatives are more robust to heat and acid treatment, they better retain a bright green color as compared to native magnesium-bound chlorophyll [(48)](#reference48). Natural chlorophylls are not known to be toxic, and no toxic effects have been attributed to chlorophyllin despite more than 50 years of clinical use in humans [(11](#reference11), [33](#reference33), [39)](#reference39). When taken orally, [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) chlorophyll or sodium copper chlorophyllin may cause green discoloration of urine or feces, or yellow or black discoloration of the tongue [(55)](#reference55). There have also been occasional reports of diarrhea related to oral SCC use. When applied [topically](../../glossary#topical) to wounds, SCC has been reported to cause mild burning or itching in some cases [(56)](#reference56). Oral chlorophyllin may result in false positive results on guaiac card tests for occult blood [(57)](#reference57). Since the safety of chlorophyll or chlorophyllin supplements has not been tested in pregnant or lactating women, they should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation.

Rhizomes are horizontal underground stems that send out shoots, as well as roots. The bright yellow-orange color of turmeric comes mainly from fat-soluble, polyphenolic pigments as curcuminoids. Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid found in turmeric, is generally considered its most active constituent [(1)](#references). Other curcuminoids found in turmeric include demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin (Figure 1). In addition to its use as a spice and pigment, turmeric has been used in India for medicinal purposes for centuries [(2)](#reference2). More recently, evidence that curcumin may have anti- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) and anticancer activities has renewed scientific interest in its potential to prevent and treat disease. [Clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in humans indicate that the systemic [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of orally administered curcumin is relatively low [(3-5)](#reference3) and that mostly [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) of curcumin, instead of curcumin itself, are detected in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) or [serum](../../glossary#serum) following oral consumption [(6, 7)](#reference6). In the intestine and liver, curcumin is readily [conjugated](../../glossary#conjugate) to form curcumin glucuronide and curcumin sulfate or, alternately, reduced to tetrahydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcumin, and octahydrocurcumin (Figure 2) [(4)](#reference4). An early clinical trial conducted in Taiwan indicated that serum curcumin concentrations peaked at 0.41 to 1.75 micromoles/liter (M) one hour after oral doses of 4 to 8 g of curcumin [(8)](#reference8). Another clinical trial conducted in the UK found that plasma concentrations of curcumin, curcumin sulfate, and curcumin glucuronide were in the range of 0.01 M one hour after a 3.6 g oral dose of curcumin [(9)](#reference9). Curcumin and its metabolites could not be detected in plasma at doses lower than 3.6 g/day. There is some evidence that orally administered curcumin accumulates in [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) tissues. For instance, when [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) patients took 3.6 g/day of curcumin orally for seven days prior to surgery, curcumin was detected in both [malignant](../../glossary#malignant) and normal colorectal tissue [(10)](#reference10). In contrast, curcumin was not detected in the liver tissue of patients with liver [metastases](../../glossary#metastasize) of colorectal cancer after the same oral dose of curcumin [(11)](#reference11), suggesting that oral curcumin administration may not effectively deliver curcumin to tissues outside the gastrointestinal tract. The safety and efficacy of several curcumin formulations are currently being explored in (pre)clinical settings with the aim of increasing the absorption, bioavailability, and tissue-targeted delivery of curcumin [(12-16)](#reference12). Examples of approaches include conjugation to [peptide](../../glossary#peptide) carriers to polylactic-co-glycolic acid effective of [reactive oxygen species](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) and [reactive nitrogen species](../../glossary#reactive-nitrogen-species) in the test tube [(18, 19)](#reference18). However, it is not clear whether curcumin acts as a direct [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo). Due to its limited oral [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) in humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)), [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and tissue curcumin concentrations are likely to be much lower than those of other fat-soluble antioxidants like -tocopherol ( [vitamin E](../../vitamins/vitamin-E)). Yet, curcumin taken orally may reach sufficient concentrations in the [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract and protect the intestinal mucosa against [oxidative](../../glossary#oxidation) [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage [(11)](#reference11). In addition to a potentially direct antioxidant activity, curcumin can induce the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of important intracellular antioxidant that plays a critical role in cellular adaptation to stress [(20)](#reference20). Curcumin was found to upregulate the expression of GCL through the activation of different [signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) [(21)](#reference21). In particular, curcumin increases the expression of GCL and other detoxifying enzymes via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway. Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../../glossary#cytosol). Keap1 responds stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoter](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) and [scavengers](../../glossary#scavenge). Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code tubular epithelial cells challenged with high [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) concentrations was shown to prevent phenotype changes resembling fibrosis and known to occur at an early stage of [diabetic](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) renal injury [(23)](#reference23). Curcumin also inhibited the progression of fibrosis in liver and lung in animal models of chronic [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) diseases [(24, 25)](#reference24). Curcumin mitigated the effect of chronic ethanol intake on mouse liver, partly by upregulating Nrf2 target genes by downstream genes for GCL, HO-1, NQO-1, and SOD in the brain of rats [(27)](#reference27). Additional studies have demonstrated the ability of curcumin to reduce oxidative stress in different experimental settings via the induction of Nrf2/ARE pathway (reviewed in [22](#reference22)). Curcumin has been shown to inhibit mediators of the [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) response, including [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine), chemokines, adhesion factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) induces the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of the COX-2 [gene](../../glossary#gene), other pro-inflammatory genes, and genes involved in cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), adhesion, survival, and [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation). The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin result from its ability to inhibit the NF-B pathway, as well as other pro-inflammatory pathways like dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis by curcumin in mice has been associated with a downregulation of the expression of p38-MAPK and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- and a reduction of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of [neutrophil](../../glossary#neutrophil) infiltration in intestinal mucosa [(29)](#reference29). Curcumin has also been shown to improve colitis by preventing STAT3 activation and STAT3-dependent induction of cell proliferation in mouse [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(30)](#reference30). Moreover, curcumin was shown to attenuate the immune response triggered by [collagen](../../glossary#collagen) injections in a mouse model of [rheumatoid arthritis](../../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis), partly by blocking the proliferation of T [lymphocytes](../../glossary#lymphocyte) in mouse splenocytes [(31)](#reference31). In addition, curcumin has been found to reduce the secretion of TNF- and IL-1 and the production of COX-2-induced prostaglandin G2. In one study, curcumin inhibited the secretion of matrix metalloproteins (MMPs) \u2014 responsible for the degradation of the synovial joints \u2014 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes [(31)](#reference31) and in human articular chondrocytes [(32)](#reference32). Curcumin has also been found to alleviate neuro-inflammation in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, reducing [macrophage](../../glossary#macrophage) and microglial activation and increasing [neuronal ](../../glossary#neuron)survival [(33)](#reference33). Some compounds are not [carcinogenic](../../glossary#carcinogen) until they are [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) in the body by phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), such as [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) of the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family [(34)](#reference34). Primarily based on evidence from rodent studies, it is thought that curcumin may inhibit [procarcinogen](../../glossary#procarcinogen) bioactivation and help prevent [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) by inhibiting the activity of multiple CYP enzymes in humans [(35-37)](#reference35). Curcumin may also increase the activity of phase II detoxification enzymes, such as GSTs and However, it is important to note that the effect of curcumin on biotransformation enzymes may vary depending on the route of administration, the dose, and the animal model. In addition, curcumin intakes ranging from 0.45 to 3.6 g/day for up to four months did not increase [leukocyte](../../glossary#leukocyte) GST activity in humans [(9)](#reference9). Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested to allow for DNA repair or for activation of pathways leading to programmed cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) if the damage is irreparable [(40)](#reference40). Defective cell-cycle regulation may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of cancer. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells [proliferate](../../glossary#proliferation) rapidly and are unable to respond to cell death signals that initiate apoptosis. Curcumin has been found to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by regulating a variety of [cell-signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) [(3](#reference3), [41-45)](#reference41). For example, the inhibition of cell proliferation by curcumin has been associated with the Nrf2-dependent downregulation of DNA repair-specific flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) in breast cancer cells in culture [(46)](#reference46). Curcumin has been shown to induce p53-dependent or -independent apoptosis depending on the cancer cell type [(47)](#reference47). In a panel of cancer cell lines, p53-independent apoptosis induced by curcumin was mediated by the rapid increase of [ROS](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) and the activation of MAPK and c-jun kinase curcumin also suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in cancer cells [(47)](#reference47). [Malignant](../../glossary#malignant) and aggressive forms of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) can invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant tissues once cancer cells have acquired the ability to leave the primary site (reduced cell-to-cell adhesion and loss of polarity), migrate, and disseminate. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process by which epithelial cells acquire the ability to migrate and invade through downregulating [proteins](../../glossary#protein) like E-cadherin and -catenin and expressing mesenchymal markers MMPs, N-cadherin, vimentin. In breast cancer cells, curcumin prevented morphological changes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating vimentin. It was further shown that curcumin inhibited NF-B/Snail signaling involved in LPS-induced EMT [(49)](#reference49). In another study, curcumin increased the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of the non-coding then [cytokines,](../../glossary#cytokine) CXCL1 as well as MMPs, thereby reducing the [metastatic](../../glossary#metastasize) potential of breast cancer cells. Curcumin inhibited IL-6-induced [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), migration, and invasiveness of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells by reducing JAK/STAT3 [phosphorylation](../../glossary#phosphorylation) (i.e., activation) and [(30)](#reference30). Curcumin was found to exert its anticancer activities in many different types of cancer cells by regulating a variety of [signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) (reviewed in [2](#reference2), [47](#reference47)). peptide) aggregates into oligomers and fibrils and forms deposits known as [amyloid (or senile) plaques](../../glossary#amyloid-plaque) outside [neurons](../../glossary#neuron) in the hippocampus and [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebrum) cortex of patients. Another feature of AD is the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by phosphorylated activation, [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress), and [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) death are also associated with the progression of the disease. Curcumin has been found to inhibit A fibril formation and extension and to destabilize preformed fibrils [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(51-53)](#reference51). Metal [chelation](../../glossary#chelate) metal ion (Cu2+/Zn2+)-induced A aggregation. Curcumin might also affect the trafficking of A peptide [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) (APP) and the generation of A peptides from APP [(54, 55)](#reference54). Abnormally activated microglia and hypertrophic astrocytes around amyloid plaques in AD brains release cytotoxic molecules, such as proinflammatory [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine) and [ROS](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), which enhance A formation and deposition and further damage neurons. Curcumin was found to reduce the [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) response triggered by A peptide-induced microglial activation and increase neuronal cell survival [(56)](#reference56). When injected into the carotid artery of a transgenic mouse model of AD, curcumin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier, bind to amyloid plaques, and block the formation of A oligomers and fibrils [(53)](#reference53). In other animal models of AD, dietary curcumin decreased [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of inflammation and [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage), increased A peptide clearance by [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage), dismantled amyloid plaques in the brain, stimulated neuronal cell growth in the hippocampus, and improved A-induced memory deficits (reviewed in [57](#reference57)). Note: It is important to keep in mind that some of the biological activities discussed above were observed in cultured cells and animal models exposed to curcumin at concentrations unlikely to be achieved in cells of humans consuming curcumin orally (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Oral curcumin administration has been found to inhibit the development of chemically-induced cancer in animal models of oral [(58, 59)](#reference58), 61)](#reference60), liver the Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) [gene](../../glossary#gene) similar to that in humans with [familial adenomatous polyposis](../../glossary#familial-adenomatous-polyposis), a genetic condition characterized by the development of numerous [colorectal adenomas](../../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) ( [polyps](../../glossary#polyp)) and a high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer). Oral curcumin administration has been found to inhibit the development of intestinal adenomas in ApcMin/+ mice [(66, 67)](#reference66). Despite promising results in animal studies, there is presently little evidence that high intakes of curcumin or turmeric are associated with decreased cancer risk in humans. A 30-day [phase II clinical trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) in 40 smokers with at least eight rectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF; precancerous lesions) found that the number of ACF was significantly lower with a daily supplementation with 4 g/day of curcumin compared to 2 g/day [(68)](#reference68). Several controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in humans designed to evaluate the effect of oral curcumin supplementation on precancerous colorectal lesions, such way [(69)](#reference69). [Oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and related vascular complications. A large body of preclinical evidence suggests that the [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant), anti-inflammatory, and [glucose](../../glossary#glucose)-lowering activities of curcumin and its [analogs](../../glossary#analog) may be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of type 2 diabetes [(70)](#reference70). In a nine-month, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 237 subjects with [impaired glucose tolerance](../../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) (pre-diabetes), no progression to overt diabetes was reported with a daily ingestion of a mixture of curcuminoids (0.5 g), while 16.4% of placebo-treated participants developed diabetes [(71)](#reference71). In addition, curcumin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) was shown to reduce [insulin resistance ](../../glossary#insulin-resistance)and improve measures of [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) -cell function and glucose tolerance. In an eight-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 67 individuals with type 2 diabetes, oral curcumin (a mixture of all three major curcuminoids; 0.6 g/day) failed to significantly lower the level of [glycated hemoglobin A1c](../../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) (HbA1c; a measure of glycemic [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides) [(72)](#reference72). Yet, supplemental curcumin found to be as effective as [lipid](../../glossary#lipid)-lowering drug atorvastatin (10 mg/day) in reducing circulating markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) and inflammation (endothelin-1, TNF, IL-6) and in improving [endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function. Another [randomized trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) also reported that oral curcumin supplementation (1.5 g/day) for six months improved endothelial function, [insulin sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitive), and metabolic markers associated with [atherogenesis](../../glossary#atherogenic) (plasma triglycerides, visceral fat, total body fat) in participants with type 2 diabetes [(73)](#reference73). Finally, in a two-month [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 40 individuals with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease), daily curcumin ingestion (66.3 mg) significantly reduced urinary concentrations of [proteins](../../glossary#protein) and inflammation markers (TGF-, IL-8), suggesting that curcumin might be helpful with slowing the progression of kidney damage and preventing kidney failure [(74)](#reference74). Larger trials are needed to assess whether curcumin could be useful in the prevention or management of type 2 diabetes and vascular complications. The ability of curcumin to regulate a variety of [signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) involved in cell growth, [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), invasion, [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasize), and [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis) in preclinical studies elicited scientific interest in its potential as an anticancer agent in tumor therapy [(75)](#reference75). To date, most of the controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) of curcumin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) patients have been [phase I trials](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial), which are aimed at determining feasibility, tolerability, safety, and providing early evidence of efficacy [(76)](#reference76). A phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) found that doses up to 3.6 g/day for four months were well tolerated, although the systemic [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of oral curcumin was low [(77)](#reference77). When colorectal cancer patients with liver [metastases](../../glossary#metastasize) took 3.6 g/day of curcumin orally for seven days, trace levels of curcumin [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) were measured in liver tissue, but curcumin itself was not detected [(11)](#reference11). In contrast, curcumin was measurable in normal and [malignant](../../glossary#malignant) colorectal tissue after patients with advanced colorectal cancer took 3.6 g/day of curcumin orally for seven days [(10)](#reference10). In a [pilot trial](../../glossary#pilot-trial) in patients awaiting [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) endoscopy or colorectal cancer resection, the administration of a mixture of three major curcuminoids (2.35 g/day for 14 days) resulted in detectable amounts of curcumin in colonic mucosa (mean concentration, 48.4 and bisdemethoxycurcumin (0.7 g/g) [(78)](#reference78). While these findings suggested that oral curcumin may likely be more effective as a therapeutic agent in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract than of other tissues, some phase I/II trials have also examined whether supplemental curcumin may confer additional benefits to conventional drugs against different types of cancer. Combining curcumin with anticancer drugs like gemcitabine in pancreatic and imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia [(82)](#reference82) may be safe and well tolerated. A recent single-arm, [phase II trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) combining three cycles of docetaxel/prednisone and curcumin (6 g/day) was carried out in 26 patients with castration-resistant [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer [(83)](#reference83). The level of [prostate-specific antigen](../../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) was decreased in most patients and was normalized in 36% of them, and the co-administration of curcumin with drugs showed no toxicity beyond adverse effects already related to docetaxel [monotherapy](../../glossary#monotherapy). Many registered phase I/II clinical trials designed to investigate the effectiveness of curcumin alone or with first-line treatment in patients with breast, prostate, [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas), lung, or colorectal cancer are under way [(69)](#reference69). Although curcumin has been demonstrated to have anti- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) and [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activities in cell culture and animal studies, few [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the efficacy of curcumin in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. A [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 40 men who had surgery to repair an inguinal hernia or hydrocele found that oral curcumin supplementation (1.2 g/day) for five days was more effective than placebo in reducing post-surgical [edema](../../glossary#edema), tenderness and pain, and was comparable to phenylbutazone therapy (300 mg/day) [(84)](#reference84). A preliminary [intervention curcumin with anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in 18 patients with [rheumatoid arthritis](../../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis) (RA) found that improvements in morning stiffness, walking time, and joint swelling after two weeks of curcumin supplementation (1.2 g/day) were comparable to those experienced after two weeks of phenylbutazone (NSAID) therapy (300 mg/day) [(85)](#reference85). In a more recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [open-label study](../../glossary#open-label-trial) in 45 RA patients, supplementation with a mixture of all three major curcuminoids (0.5 g/day for eight weeks) was found to be as effective as diclofenac (NSAID; 50 mg/day) in reducing measures of disease activity, tenderness, and swelling joints [(86)](#reference86). Larger [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether oral curcumin supplementation is effective in the treatment of RA. Radiation-induced skin [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) occurs in most patients receiving [radiation therapy](../../glossary#radiation-therapy) for sarcoma, lung, breast, or head and neck cancer. One [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 30 women prescribed radiation therapy for breast carcinoma in situ reported a reduction of radiation-induced [dermatitis](../../glossary#dermatitis) severity and moist desquamation with a [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) curcuminoid mixture (6 g/day for four to seven weeks). Curcumin failed to reduce skin redness and radiation-induced pain at the site of treatment [(87)](#reference87). [Ulcerative colitis](../../glossary#ulcerative-colitis) (UC) is a long-term condition characterized by diffuse and superficial [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) of the [colonic](../../glossary#colon) mucosa. Disease activity may fluctuate between periods of remission and periods of relapse. Preliminary evidence suggests that curcumin might be useful as an add-on therapy to control disease activity. One multicenter, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study has examined the efficacy of curcumin enema (2 g/day) in the prevention of relapse in 82 patients with quiescent UC [(88)](#reference88). Six-month treatment with curcumin significantly reduced measures of disease activity and severity and resulted in a lower relapse rate than with placebo in subjects on standard-of-care medication (sulfasalazine or mesalamine); yet, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who experienced relapse six months after curcumin was discontinued [(88)](#reference88). In another [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in active UC patients treated with mesalamine, the percentage of patients in clinical remission was significantly higher after a one-month treatment with oral curcumin (3 g/day) than with placebo [(89)](#reference89). Larger trials are needed to ensure that curcumin can be safely used with conventional UC treatments and to further support its potential therapeutic benefits for relapsing-remitting UC. Emerging evidence suggests that curcumin has anti-inflammatory and [antimicrobial](../../glossary#antimicrobial) properties that could be beneficial in the treatment of certain diseases of the oral cavity. For example, the [topical](../../glossary#topical) application of a curcumin gel was found to reduce [gingival](../../glossary#gingiva) bleeding and [periodontal](../../glossary#periodontium) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) after conventional periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing) [(90-92)](#reference90). A mouthwash containing curcumin was also found to be as effective as chlorhexidine in reducing [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) in individuals who underwent periodontal therapy for [gingivitis](../../glossary#gingivitis) [(93)](#reference93). Any part of the oral cavity may be affected by oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a currently incurable condition especially prevalent in Southeast Asia and India. OSMF is characterized by the formation of excess fibrous tissue (fibrosis) that leads to stiffness of the mucosa and restricted mouth opening. A few recent [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) showed that curcumin could improve some symptoms, such as burning sensations and reduced mouth opening (reviewed in [94](#reference94)). In an [open-label intervention study](../../glossary#open-label-trial) in 40 OSMF patients [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) to receive either the conventional treatment (weekly intra-lesional injections of [steroids](../../glossary#steroid)) or daily oral administration of a Curcuma longa Linn extract (600 mg/day) for three months, the burning sensation significantly improved in the curcumin-treated group, while tongue protrusion was reduced with conventional therapy. No differences between the two treatment groups were seen with respect to mouth opening [(95)](#reference95). A six-month follow-up of the effect of oral curcumin (2 g/day) in OSMF patients treated for three months found that curcumin outperformed steroid ointment in its ability to increase maximum mouth opening and to reduce self-reported burning sensation [(96)](#reference96). Further studies should assess the appropriate dose of curcumin to achieve the greatest benefits and determine whether curcumin can enhance the effect of standard-of-care treatment in limiting OSMF disease progression. [Alzheimer's disease](../../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) is a form of [dementia](../../glossary#dementia) characterized by deposition of [-amyloid plaques](../../glossary#amyloid-plaque), intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles, [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) loss, eventually leading to brain [atrophy](../../glossary#atrophy) and [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) impairment in affected individuals [(57)](#reference57). When injected into the [carotid artery](../../glossary#carotid-arteries), curcumin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier in an animal model of AD [(53)](#reference53), though it is not known whether curcumin taken orally can reach the blood-brain barrier at sufficient concentrations and impede cognitive decline in humans. As a result of promising findings in animal models (see [Neuroprotective activity](#neuroprotective-activity)), a few recent [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of oral curcumin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) on [cognition](../../glossary#cognition) in healthy older adults and AD patients [(57)](#reference57). A [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 60 healthy older adults (mean age, 68.5 years) investigated whether acute (80 mg) or chronic (80 mg/day for 4 weeks) oral intake of curcumin could improve their ability to cope with the mental stress and change in mood usually associated with undergoing a battery of cognitive tests [(97)](#reference97). A significant reduction in mental fatigue and higher levels of calmness and contentedness following cognitive test sessions were observed in individuals who consumed curcumin (either acutely or chronically) compared to the placebo group. Additionally, the results of cognitive ability tests suggested that curcumin treatment had limited benefits on cognitive function, as shown by better scores in measures of sustained attention and working memory compared to placebo [(97)](#reference97). The results of a six-month trial in 27 patients with AD found that oral supplementation with up to 4 g/day of curcumin \u2014 containing all three major curcuminoids \u2014 was safe [(6)](#reference6). Yet, measures of cognitive performance (using the Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] scoring scale) and levels of F2-isoprostanes ( [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) markers) and [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) in blood were not found to be significantly different between curcumin- and placebo-treated subjects at the end of the intervention period. In another six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with mild-to-moderate AD, curcumin failed to improve cognitive test scores and to reduce blood and [cerebrospinal fluid](../../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) (CSF) concentrations of -amyloid peptide, CSF concentrations of total and [phosphorylated](../../glossary#phosphorylation) Tau protein, and CSF concentrations of F2-isoprostanes [(98)](#reference98). Despite the lack of encouraging results from completed trials, several [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are under way to determine whether supplemental curcumin has the ability to reverse or prevent cognitive deficits in both healthy and cognitively impaired individuals [(57)](#reference57). Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with abnormal neurotransmission; it is primarily treated with drugs that improve the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of [neurotransmitters](../../glossary#neurotransmitter) like [serotonin](../../glossary#serotonin), noradrenaline, and dopamine in the brain [(99)](#reference99). Characteristics of MDD also include alterations in the [hypothalamus](../../glossary#hypothalamus)- [pituitary](../../glossary#pituitary-gland)- [adrenal](../../glossary#adrenal-glands) axis, increased neuroinflammation, defective [neurogenesis](../../glossary#neurogenesis), and [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) death. A few [clinical studies](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of curcumin alone or with conventional antidepressant drugs in MDD patients. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of six [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) with curcumin significantly reduced depression symptoms [(100)](#reference100). However, in one of the studies included in this meta-analysis \u2014 a [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), controlled study in 56 adults diagnosed with MDD \u2014 curcumin treatment (~880 mg/day of curcuminoids) for eight weeks was no more effective than [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) in reducing self-reported depression- and anxiety-related symptoms [(101)](#reference101). Significant improvements in the severity and frequency of specific depression-related symptoms only occurred after four weeks of treatment, suggesting that a longer treatment period might be needed to uncover the antidepressant effects of curcumin [(100, 101)](#reference100). In another randomized, placebo-controlled trial, supplemental curcumin (330 mg/day) for five weeks failed to relieve depressive symptoms in patients treated with conventional antidepressants [(102)](#reference102). In contrast, in a six-week, randomized, (~880 mg/day of curcuminoids) alone yielded a similar response to the antidepressant, fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [Prozac]; 20 mg/day) in terms of depressive symptoms; no additional effect was observed when both curcumin and fluoxetine treatments were combined [(103)](#reference103). Moreover, in a randomized controlled study in 100 participants taking escitalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [Lexapro]; 5 to 15 mg/week), supplemental curcumin (1,000 mg/day) for six weeks increased the antidepressant effect of the medication [(104)](#reference104). Curcumin also induced a reduction in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of inflammatory markers and an increase in plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared to placebo (antidepressant drug alone) [(104)](#reference104). Larger clinical trials are needed to address the long-term effect of curcumin in subjects with major depression. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a range of emotional (e.g., irritability, anxiety), behavioral (e.g., fatigue, insomnia), and physical symptoms (e.g., breast tenderness, headache) occurring prior to the monthly menstrual period in up to 90% of premenopausal women. In a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 70 women with PMS, the daily supplementation with 0.2 g of curcumin for 10 days during three consecutive menstrual cycles significantly reduced overall PMS severity, as assessed by a composite measure of all emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms [(105)](#reference105). Additional trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin in the management of PMS. Turmeric is the dried ground rhizome of Curcuma longa Linn [(106)](#reference106). It is used as a spice in Indian, Southeast Asian, and Middle Eastern cuisines. Curcuminoids comprise about 2%-9% of turmeric [(107)](#reference107). Curcumin is the most abundant curcuminoid in turmeric, providing about 75% of the total curcuminoids, while demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin generally represent 10%-20% and less than 5% of the total curcuminoids, respectively [(108)](#reference108). Curry powder contains turmeric along with other spices, but the amount of curcumin in curry powders is variable and often relatively low [(109)](#reference109). Curcumin extracts are also used as food-coloring agents [(110)](#reference110). Commercial curcumin is usually a mixture demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). Curcuminoid extracts are available as dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) without a prescription in the US. The labels of a number of these extracts state that they are standardized to contain 95% curcuminoids, although such claims are not strictly regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some curcumin preparations also contain piperine, which may increase the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of curcumin by inhibiting its [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) [(108)](#reference108). However, piperine may also affect the metabolism of drugs (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Optimal doses of curcumin for [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) chemoprevention or therapeutic uses have not been established. It is unclear whether doses less than 3.6 g/day are biologically active in humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Curcuminoid-containing supplements taken on an empty stomach may cause [gastritis](../../glossary#gastritis) and [peptic ulcer disease](../../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease) [(108)](#reference108). In the United States, turmeric is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA as a food additive [(110)](#reference110). An increase in [gallbladder](../../glossary#gallbladder) contractions was observed in 12 healthy people [supplemented](../../glossary#supplement) with single doses of 20 to 40 mg of curcumin [(111, 112)](#reference111). Yet, serious adverse effects have not been reported in humans taking high doses of curcumin. A dose escalation trial in 24 adults found that single oral dosages up to 12 g were safe, and adverse effects, including diarrhea, headache, rash, yellow stool, were not related to dose [(7)](#reference7). In a [phase I trial](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in Taiwan, curcumin supplementation up to 8 g/day for three months was reported to be well tolerated in patients with precancerous conditions or noninvasive [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(8)](#reference8). Another [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in the UK found that curcumin supplementation ranging from 0.45 to 3.6 g/day for four months was generally well tolerated by people with advanced [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer), although two participants experienced diarrhea and another reported nausea [(9)](#reference9). Increases in [serum](../../glossary#serum) alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase were also observed in several participants, but it was not clear whether these increases were related to curcumin supplementation or cancer progression [(3)](#reference3). In an [open-label](../../glossary#open-label-trial) [phase II trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial), curcumin treatment (8 g/day) in combination with the anticancer drug gemcitabine was associated with severe abdominal pain in 7 out of 17 patients with advanced [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) cancer, leading to the treatment being discontinued in five patients while curcumin dosage was reduced to 4 g/day in two patients [(79)](#reference79). Although there is no evidence that dietary consumption of turmeric as a spice adversely affects pregnancy or lactation, the safety of curcumin [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in pregnancy and lactation has not been established. Curcumin has been found to inhibit [platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation 114)](#reference113), [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) to increase the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of bleeding in people taking [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) or antiplatelet by the chemotherapeutic agents, camptothecin, mechlorethamine, and doxorubicin at concentrations of 1 to 10 M [(115)](#reference115). In an animal model of breast cancer, dietary curcumin inhibited cyclophosphamide-induced tumor regression. Yet, it is not known whether oral curcumin administration will result in breast tissue concentrations that are high enough to inhibit cancer chemotherapeutic agents in humans [(11)](#reference11).

Their [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and biological activities in humans appear to be strongly influenced by their chemical nature. Since the 1990s, there has been a growing interest in dietary flavonoids due to their likely contribution to the health benefits of fruit- and vegetable-rich diets. This article reviews some of the scientific evidence regarding the role of dietary flavonoids in health promotion and disease prevention in humans; it is not meant to be a comprehensive review on every health topic studied. Flavonoids are classified into 12 major subclasses based on chemical structures, six of which, namely anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, and isoflavones (Table 1-9) are of dietary significance. Glycosylated flavonols (bound to at least one sugar molecule) are the most widely distributed flavonoids in the diet [(2, 3)](#reference2). |Flavonoid Subclass||Dietary Flavonoids (aglycones)|| Some Common Food Sources (see also | Teas (particularly white, green, and oolong), cocoa-based products, grapes, berries, apples Apples, berries, cocoa-based products, red grapes, red wine Black tea Onions, scallions, kale, broccoli, apples, berries, teas Parsley, thyme, celery, hot peppers Citrus fruit and juices, grapefruits, lemons Daidzein, Genistein, Glycitein, Biochanin A, Formononetin Soybeans, soy foods, legumes For more detailed information on the health effects of isoflavones, a subclass of flavonoids with [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) activity, see the article on [Soy Isoflavones](soy-isoflavones). For more information on the health benefits of foods that are rich in flavonoids, see the articles on [Fruit and Vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), [Legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), and [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea). The amount of flavonoids present in ingested food has little importance unless dietary flavonoids are absorbed and become available to target tissues within the body. During and after intestinal absorption, flavonoids are rapidly and extensively [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) in intestinal and liver cells such that they are likely to appear as [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (e.g., phase II metabolites) in the bloodstream and urine [(4)](#reference4). Additionally, the biological activities of flavonoid metabolites are likely to be different from those of their parent compounds [(5)](#reference5). Some of the factors influencing the metabolic fate and [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of dietary flavonoids are mentioned below. Most flavonoids occur in edible plants and foods as -glycosides, i.e., bound to one or more sugar molecules [(6)](#reference6). Exceptions include flavan-3-ols (catechins and proanthocyanidins) and fermented that are exposed to microbial -glucosidases, which [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) the release of sugar molecules from glycosylated isoflavones [(7)](#reference7). Even after food processing and cooking, most glycosides reach the [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine) intact. Only flavonoid aglycones (not bound to a sugar molecule) and a few flavonoid glucosides (bound to glucose) are easily absorbed in the small intestine [(8)](#reference8). Glycosylated flavonoids might be able to penetrate the mucus layer of the intestine and be deglycosylated on the cell surface before absorption. Those that cannot be deglycosylated in the small intestine may be [hydrolyzed](../../glossary#hydrolysis) by [bacterial](../../glossary#bacteria) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) in the [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(7)](#reference7). Nevertheless, colonic might remove sugar moieties and rapidly degrade aglycone flavonoids, thus limiting their absorption in the colon [(9)](#reference9). In contrast to [monomeric](../../glossary#monomer) flavan-3-ols (catechins), the [polymeric](../../glossary#polymer) nature of proanthocyanidins likely prevents their intestinal absorption. Flavan-3-ol monomers and procyanidins are transformed by the [intestinal microbiota](../../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) to 5-(hydroxyphenyl)--valerolactones which appear in the circulatory system and are [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in urine as sulfate and glucuronide [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (Figure 10). Valerolactones may be further degraded by the colonic microbiota to smaller phenolic acids and aromatic compounds. also metabolize the gallate [esters](../../glossary#ester) pyrogallol. Microbe-derived flavonoid metabolites are readily absorbed into the circulatory system and excreted in both free forms and as phase II metabolites in urine [(9)](#reference9). The presence of [macronutrients](../../glossary#macronutrient) in food influences the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of co-ingested flavonoids (reviewed in [8](#reference8), [10, 11](#reference10)). affinity (non-) covalent interactions of flavonoids with food [proteins](../../glossary#protein), [carbohydrates](../../glossary#carbohydrate), and fats are directly associated with the physicochemical properties of flavonoids (reviewed in [8](#reference8)). Proteins in milk might reduce the absorption of polyphenols from cocoa or black tea. The presence of milk proteins bound to flavonoids was shown to weaken the flavonoid [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) capacity [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(12)](#reference12), and milk consumption has been shown to blunt the vascular benefits of tea flavonoids in healthy volunteers [(13)](#reference13). Some carbohydrate-rich foods may increase the deglycosylation and absorption of flavonoids by stimulating [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) motility, mucosal blood flow, and colonic [fermentation](../../glossary#fermentation). Conversely, dietary flavonoids have been shown to interfere with carbohydrate digestion and absorption (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). In the large intestine, gut deglycosylation, ring fission, dehydroxylation, demethylation, can then be absorbed or [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) [(9](#reference9), [14)](#reference14). The diversity and activity of [colonic](../../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria), which are partly dependent on a person's dietary habits, will determine which metabolites can be produced from ingested flavonoids [(15, 16)](#reference15). The composition of the colonic [microbiota](../../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) can therefore affect the metabolic fate and [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of dietary flavonoids [(17)](#reference17). Flavonoids are recognized as [xenobiotics](../../glossary#xenobiotic) by the body such that they undergo extensive modifications first in the intestinal mucosa and then in the liver. Depending on their structural characteristics, flavonoids can be rapidly transformed by phase II detoxification enzymes to form methylated, glucuronidated, and/or sulfated [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) aglycones and facilitates their [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) in the [bile](../../glossary#bile) and urine [(11)](#reference11). Free (unconjugated) aglycones are generally absent from the bloodstream, with the possible exception of trace levels of catechins [(17)](#reference17). Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is the detoxifying [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) the hydroxyl producing rs4680 G>A \u2014 causes a valine-to- [methionine](../../glossary#methionine) substitution in the sequence of the enzyme. Individuals with the A/A [genotype](../../glossary#genotype) have a form of the enzyme that is three- to four-fold less active than the wild-type variant in G/G genotype carriers [(18)](#reference18). It has been suggested that subjects who are less efficient at eliminating green tea flavonoids may be more likely to benefit from their consumption [(19)](#reference19). Flavonoid [conjugates](../../glossary#conjugate) are [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) via the action of efflux transporters from the [ATP](../../glossary#ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) family, including P-glycoprotein, MRPs (multidrug resistance proteins), or BCRPs (breast cancer-resistant proteins). Depending on their physicochemical properties, some flavonoids may interfere with the activity of ABC transporters [(20)](#reference20). This implies that flavonoids can affect their own [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability), as well as that of other [substrates](../../glossary#substrate) of these transporters (e.g., pharmacological drugs) (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Flavonoid [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) may be to their binding affinity to [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) [proteins](../../glossary#protein) [(21)](#reference21). Greater binding affinity to plasma proteins (and thus, possibly, lower flavonoid bioavailability) has been linked to structural characteristics, such as [methylation](../../glossary#methylation) and galloylation. On the contrary, glycosylation reduced binding affinity to plasma proteins, suggesting that aglycones might have a limited bioavailability compared to glycosylated flavonoids. While glucuronidation is thought to facilitate the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of flavonoids from the body, glucuronides show little affinity to plasma proteins and might thus be able to diffuse to target tissues where deglucuronidation can take place [(8)](#reference8). In general, the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of flavonoids is low due to limited absorption, extensive [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism), and rapid [excretion](../../glossary#excretion). Isoflavones are thought to be the most bioavailable of all flavonoid subclasses, while anthocyanins and galloylated catechins are very poorly absorbed [(8](#reference8), [22)](#reference22). Yet, given the wide variability in structures within subclasses, it is difficult to generalize the absorbability and bioavailability of flavonoids based only on their structural classification. In addition, when evaluating the data from flavonoid research in cultured cells, it is important to consider whether the flavonoid concentrations and [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) used are physiologically relevant [(23)](#reference23). In humans, peak [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of soy isoflavones and citrus flavanones have not been found to exceed 10 micromoles/liter (M) after oral consumption. Peak plasma concentrations measured after the consumption of anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols (including those from tea) are generally lower than 1 M [(2)](#reference2). A recent quantitative analysis of 88 polyphenolic metabolites (not limited to flavonoids) identified in human blood and urine found median peak concentrations of 0.9 M and 3.2 M after food intake and oral [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement), respectively [(4)](#reference4). Flavonoids are effective [scavengers](../../glossary#scavenge) ( [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and intracellular flavonoid concentrations in humans are likely to be 100 to 1,000 times lower than concentrations of other [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant), such as ascorbate ( [vitamin C](../../vitamins/vitamin-C)), uric flavonoids are actually flavonoid [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite), some of which have lower antioxidant activity than the parent flavonoid [(5)](#reference5). For these reasons, the relative contribution of dietary flavonoids to plasma and tissue antioxidant function [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) is likely to be very small or negligible [(26-28)](#reference26). Metal ions, such as [iron](../../minerals/iron) and [copper](../../minerals/copper), can [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) the production of [free radicals](../../glossary#free-radical). The ability of flavonoids to [chelate](../../glossary#chelate) (bind) metal ions appears to contribute to their [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(29, 30)](#reference29). In living organisms, most iron and copper are bound to [proteins](../../glossary#protein), limiting their participation in reactions that produce free radicals. Although the metal-chelating activities of flavonoids may be beneficial in [pathological](../../glossary#pathology) conditions of iron or copper excess, it is not known whether flavonoids or their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) function as effective metal chelators [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) [(26)](#reference26). Cells are capable of responding to a variety of different stresses or signals by increasing or decreasing the availability of specific [proteins](../../glossary#protein). The complex cascades of events that lead to changes in the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of specific [genes](../../glossary#gene) are known as [cell-signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways or signal transduction pathways. These pathways regulate processes, such as [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation), [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) responses, [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) (programmed cell death), and survival. Although it was initially [hypothesized](../../glossary#hypothesis) that the biological effects of flavonoids would be related to their [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity, available evidence from cell culture experiments suggests that many of the effects of flavonoids, including antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer, and neuroprotective activities, are their to modulate cell-signaling pathways [(27)](#reference27). Intracellular concentrations of flavonoids required to affect cellular signaling are considerably lower than those required to affect cellular antioxidant capacity. Flavonoid [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) may retain their ability to interact with cell-signaling proteins even if their antioxidant activity is diminished [(31, 32)](#reference31). Effective signal transduction requires proteins known as kinases that [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) the [phosphorylation](../../glossary#phosphorylation) of target proteins, which become either activated or inhibited. Cascades involving specific phosphorylations or dephosphorylations of signal transduction proteins ultimately affect the activity of [transcription factors](../../glossary#transcription-factor) \u2014 proteins that bind to specific response elements on [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and promote or prevent the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of target [genes](../../glossary#gene). Results of numerous studies in cell culture suggest that flavonoids may affect chronic disease by selectively inhibiting kinases [(27](#reference27), [33)](#reference33). Cell growth and proliferation are also regulated by growth factors that initiate cell-signaling cascades by binding to specific [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) in cell membranes. Flavonoids may alter growth factor signaling by inhibiting receptor phosphorylation or blocking receptor binding by growth factors [(34)](#reference34). Each flavonoid subclass contains many types of chemicals with varying biological activities (and potential health benefits) such that the activity of a specific flavonoid cannot easily be generalized. Some examples of major biological activities of flavonoids are highlighted below. Flavonoids have been shown to (1) reduce [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) by suppressing the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of pro-inflammatory mediators [(35-37)](#reference35); (2) down-regulate the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules, which contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory white blood cells from the blood to the arterial wall [(38, 39)](#reference38); (3) increase the production of [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibit [(41)](#reference41); (5) inhibit [platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation [(42)](#reference42); and (6) oppose smooth muscle cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and migration occurring during atherogenesis [(43)](#reference43). Flavonoids have been found to interfere with the digestion, absorption, and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../../glossary#carbohydrate) (reviewed in [44](#reference44)). Each subclass of flavonoids has also demonstrated anti- [diabetic](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) properties, including (1) improving [insulin](../../glossary#insulin) secretion and viability of pancreatic -cells under glucotoxic or pro- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) conditions, (2) increasing insulin-stimulated [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) uptake by target cells, (3) protecting muscle cells against [fatty acid](../../glossary#fatty-acid)-induced [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance), and (4) reducing [hyperglycemia](../../glossary#hyperglycemia) and improving glucose tolerance in animal models of [obesity](../../glossary#obesity) and/or type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(45)](#reference45). Flavonoids have been to can damage interfere with [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) and efflux transporters, possibly preventing the activation of [procarcinogenic](../../glossary#procarcinogen) chemicals and promoting their [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) from the body [(48, 49)](#reference48); (3) regulate [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), DNA repair, or activation of pathways leading to [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) (programmed cell death) in case of irreversible DNA damage [(50)](#reference50); and (4) inhibit tumor invasion and [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis) [(51, 52)](#reference51). Flavonoids are thought to (1) promote neurogenesis, [synaptic](../../glossary#synapse) growth, and [neuron](../../glossary#neuron) survival in the learning and memory-related brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) by stimulating the production of neurotrophins like BDNF; (2) protect hippocampal cells and in [neurodegenerative disorders](../../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease); (4) stimulate the production of [nitric oxide ](../../glossary#nitric-oxide)(NO), which improves endothelial function, increases [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebrum) blood flow, and protects artery walls against the buildup of [atherosclerotic](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) plaques (reviewed in [53, 54](#reference53)). Several [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted in the US and Europe have examined the relationship between some measure of dietary flavonoid intake and [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) or mortality. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 prospective studies published between 1996 and 2012 reported that higher intakes in each flavonoid subclass were significantly associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(55)](#reference55). Top versus bottom quantiles of intake for each of the flavonoid subclasses were associated with an approximate 10% reduction in the risk of CVD. Another meta-analysis of eight prospective studies found a 14% reduced risk of [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) with the highest versus lowest quintile of flavonol intakes [(56)](#reference56). However, several serious limitations highlighted in a recent publication by Jacques et al. suggested caution when interpreting these results [(57)](#reference57). In particular, most of the prospective studies in these meta-analyses did not include all flavonoid subclasses nor calculate intakes using the latest and more complete versions of the USDA databases for the flavonoid content of foods [(58-60)](#reference58). Another major concern is the lack of adjustment regarding the overall quality of the diet. Consumers with higher flavonoid intakes are likely to have a greater consumption of fruit and vegetables and overall healthier diets than those with poor flavonoid intakes. Additionally, none of the studies excluded potential [bias](../../glossary#bias) due to constituents of flavonoid-rich foods that are known to either lower (e.g., other [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical), [vitamins](../../glossary#vitamin), [dietary fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber)) or increase (e.g., [sodium](../../minerals/sodium), [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid)) the risk of cardiovascular events (discussed in [57](#reference57)). In the Framingham Offspring Cohort study that followed 2,880 adults for a mean of 14.9 years, consumption of all flavonoid subclasses except flavones and flavanones Yet, adjusting for [confounding factors](../../glossary#confounder), including fruit and vegetable intake and overall diet quality, attenuated these relationships such that they were no longer statistically significant. An analysis of a larger prospective study of the EPIC-Norfolk cohort (24,885 participants) that considered confounding by many dietary ( [vitamin C](../../vitamins/vitamin-C), [dietary fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber), fat, saturated fat, [potassium](../../minerals/potassium), sodium, and [alcohol](../../food-beverages/alcoholic-beverages)) found no significant association between flavan-3-ol intake and CVD-related or all-cause mortality [(61)](#reference61). A number of large prospective studies and small-scale, [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have investigated the effects of flavonoids on established [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of CVD, including those involved in [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress), [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), abnormal blood [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profile, [endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction, and [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension); some of these studies are highlighted below. In a [cross-sectional analysis](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of the Framingham Offspring Cohort study, the highest versus lowest intake of anthocyanins (3.5 mg/day versus 23.5 mg/day) was associated adjustment for [confounding](../../glossary#confounder) variables [(62)](#reference62). Interestingly, a food-based analysis revealed that intakes of foods rich in anthocyanins, e.g., apples, red wine, and strawberries, were also [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with an overall [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) score based on 12 different [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker). Higher intakes of polymeric flavan-3-ols (i.e., theaflavins, thearubigins, of pro-inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Intake levels of total flavonoids and flavan-3-ol [monomers](../../glossary#monomer) (i.e., catechins) were inversely associated with concentrations of the biomarkers of oxidative stress. Although tea is a major source of flavan-3-ols, tea consumption was not correlated with the composite inflammation score or any components of this score in this study [(62)](#reference62). Cocoa is another source of flavan-3-ols, in particular (-)-epicatechin and procyanidins, that may provide [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits [(63)](#reference63). Indeed, a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 100 healthy adults (ages, 35-60 years) suggested that short-term benefits of cocoa flavan-3-ol consumption on cardiovascular health, including improvements in [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) profile (i.e., higher [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and lower total and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol) and blood pressure, could be extrapolated to predict a 20%-30% reduced 10-year risk of [CVD](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and CVD-related mortality [(64)](#reference64). An increasing number of trials in which participants were fed with berries [(65-67)](#reference65) or juices [(68)](#reference68) rich in anthocyanins or with purified anthocyanins [(69)](#reference69) also reported reduced levels of inflammatory markers and/or improved [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) status, decreased LDL-cholesterol, improved [insulin sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitive), and lowered blood pressure (reviewed in [70](#reference70)). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 150 individuals with hypercholesterolemia, supplementation with a purified anthocyanin mixture (320 mg/day) for 24 weeks reduced circulating markers of inflammation, including dyslipidemic patients for 12 or 24 weeks with a mixture of 17 anthocyanins improved cholesterol clearance via the HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport from extra-hepatic tissues back to the liver and lowered LDL-cholesterol compared to a placebo in two randomized controlled trials [(72, 73)](#reference72). However, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 52 healthy postmenopausal women found that daily consumption of 500 mg of elderberry anthocyanins (as cyanidin-3-glucoside) had no effect on inflammation markers, markers of vascular health, lipid profile, and glycemia; all of these measures were in normal range of concentrations at baseline [(74)](#reference74). Whether exposure to high-dose anthocyanins could lower the risk of CVD in subjects with established CVD risk factors and/or help maintain cardiovascular health in apparently healthy individuals remains to be confirmed. The [vascular endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells that line the inner surface of all blood vessels [synthesize](../../glossary#synthesis) an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), whose function is essential to normal vascular physiology. Specifically, eNOS produces [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO), a compound that regulates vascular tone and blood flow by promoting the relaxation ( [vasodilation](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#vasodilation)) of all types of blood vessels, including arteries [(75)](#reference75). NO also regulates vascular [homeostasis](../../glossary#homeostasis) and protects the integrity cells [(76)](#reference76). In presence of [cardiovascular ](../../glossary#cardiovascular)risk factors (e.g., [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), hypercholesterolemia, [hyperglycemia](../../glossary#hyperglycemia)), early alterations in the structure and function of the vascular endothelium are associated with the loss of normal NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Endothelial dysfunction results in widespread [vasoconstriction](../../glossary#vasoconstriction) and [coagulation](../../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities and is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis). Measures of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a surrogate marker of endothelial function, have been found to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with risk of future cardiovascular events [(77)](#reference77). Preclinical studies have demonstrated the benefits of berry fruits, extracts, or purified anthocyanins on vascular function. Anthocyanin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) to diabetic mice was found to improve [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus)-induced vascular dysfunction by promoting for weeks) also increased [serum](../../glossary#serum) adiponectin concentrations and improved FMD in 58 individuals with type 2 diabetes [(78)](#reference78). In a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) trial of 150 participants with hypercholesterolemia, supplemental anthocyanins increased FMD values by 28.4% compared [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) group [(79)](#reference79). Several small-scale, [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have also examined the effect of flavan-3-ol-rich food and beverages, including tea, red wine, purple grape juice, cocoa, and chocolate, on endothelium-dependent vasodilation. A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine intervention studies in a total of 213 participants estimated that the acute ingestion of 2 to 3 cups of tea (500 mL) \u2014 containing about 248 mg of flavonoids in green tea and 415 mg in black tea \u2014 significantly increased brachial FMD (see also the article on [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea#endothelial-dysfunction-prevention)) [(80)](#reference80). Another meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled studies found that acute (2 h post-ingestion) and chronic (18 months) consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa beverages and chocolate bars significantly increased FMD in participants [(81)](#reference81). A small 15-day, [cross-over intervention study](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) in [hypertensive](../../glossary#hypertension) individuals with endothelial dysfunction found that 100 g/day of flavan-3-ol-rich dark chocolate, but not 90 g/day of flavan-3-ol-free white chocolate, could restore FMD values almost to normal levels [(82)](#reference82). Also, using a similar protocol, the authors showed that dark chocolate intake blunted acute endothelial dysfunction-induced by a [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) load challenge in 12 healthy volunteers [(83)](#reference83). Other benefits of dark chocolate consumption included reductions in arterial stiffness (measured through pulse wave analysis) and serum concentrations of markers of [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and vasoconstriction (8-isoprostaglandin F2 and endothelin-1). A randomized controlled trial in overweight and [obese](../../glossary#obesity) participants also reported that the daily consumption of a high-flavan-3-ol cocoa drink (902 mg/day of flavan-3-ols), but not that of a cocoa drink low in flavan-3-ols (38 mg/day), resulted in a sustained increase in FMD during the 12-week study [(84)](#reference84). A more recent four-week, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, controlled study in healthy overweight or obese adults found that the consumption of 22 g/day of natural cocoa (in the form of dark chocolate bar and cocoa drink; 814 mg/day of flavan-3-ols) increased arterial diameter and blood flow and lowered peripheral arterial stiffness, but there was no change in FMD [(85)](#reference85). Another recent [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to acute consumption of one bar (40 g) of dark chocolate (containing 10.8 mg of (+)-catechins and 36 mg of (-)-epicatechins) and daily consumption of two bars (80 g) for up to four weeks in 20 individuals with chronic heart failure [(86)](#reference86). Oral administration of pure flavan-3-ol (-)-epicatechin to healthy volunteers showed [NO](../../glossary#nitric-oxide)-dependent vasodilatory effects similar to those observed following flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa ingestion [(87)](#reference87). Administration of (-)-epicatechin also improved acetylcholine-induced vasodilation [(88)](#reference88). Endothelial nitric oxide production also inhibits the adhesion and aggregation of platelets, one of the first steps in atherosclerosis and blood clot formation [(76)](#reference76). A number of clinical trials that examined the potential for high flavonoid intakes to decrease various measures of platelet function outside of the body (ex vivo) have reported mixed results. A recent [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) of these intervention studies suggested that consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa and grape seed extract was generally found to improve platelet function by inhibiting platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation [(89)](#reference89). Interestingly, in a cross-over, controlled study, the acute consumption of a flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa beverage (897 mg of total (-)-EC and procyanidins) exhibited additive anti-platelet effects to aspirin (81 mg) in healthy volunteers [(90)](#reference90). In contrast, the results of interventions using apigenin-rich soup, quercetin-rich supplements or onion soups, isoflavone-rich soy protein isolates, black tea, wines, berries, or grape juices have given inconsistent results (reviewed in [89](#reference89)). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 20 short-term, [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including a total of 856 mainly healthy participants, found that consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich dark chocolate and cocoa products significantly reduced [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) by 2.77 [mm Hg](../../glossary#mm-Hg) and [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) by 2.20 mm Hg. However, [heterogeneity](../../glossary#heterogeneity) across studies was high, and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [bias](../../glossary#bias) was significant [(91)](#reference91). A greater blood pressure-reducing effect was observed in a subanalysis of studies using flavan-3-ol-free rather than flavan-3-ol-low control groups [(91)](#reference91). Another meta-analysis of 22 trials (highly heterogeneous) found reductions in diastolic blood pressure (-1.60 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (-1.64 mm Hg) with chocolate or cocoa intake but no change in systolic blood pressure [(81)](#reference81). Additionally, green tea flavan-3-ols have been shown to lower blood pressure especially in (pre-) [hypertensive](../../glossary#hypertension) subjects. A pooled analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials in 1,040 subjects found a 2.05 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 1.71 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure with green tea consumption for at least three weeks [(92)](#reference92). The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key regulator of arterial blood pressure, may partly explain how flavan-3-ol-rich food and beverages might exert blood pressure-lowering effects [(93)](#reference93). Some [intervention trials](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have also examined the effect of the flavonol quercetin on blood pressure in human subjects. In a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [cross-over](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 96 participants diagnosed disorders, supplementation with 150 mg/day of quercetin aglycone significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.6 mm Hg without affecting diastolic blood pressure and other cardiometabolic markers [(94)](#reference94). Similar results were found with 730 mg/day of quercetin in hypertensive individuals [(95)](#reference95) and with 500 mg/day of quercetin in women with type 2 [diabetes In a recent six-week, cross-over, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, daily ingestion of 162 mg of quercetin decreased 24 h-ambulatory blood pressure \u2014 but not systolic blood pressure in the resting state \u2014 in hypertensive but not in pre-hypertensive participants [(97)](#reference97). There was plasma endogenous NOS inhibitor. Additional trials may help establish whether the blood pressure-lowering effect of some flavonoids could be translated into long-term benefits for [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) health. The association between flavonoid consumption and [risk](../../glossary#risk) for type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) has been examined in a recent European, multicenter, [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) \u2014 the \"EPIC-InterAct\" project \u2014 that included 16,835 diabetes-free participants and 12,043 diabetics. In this study, participants in the highest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of total flavonoid intake (>608.1 mg/day) had a 10% lower risk of diabetes than those in the lowest quintile (<178.2 mg/day) [(98)](#reference98). Specifically, the risk of diabetes with the intake of of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the possible health effects of green tea flavan-3-ol monomers (catechins) on [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and have provided conflicting results. A meta-analysis of seven trials in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients found no effect of green tea or green tea extracts on fasting [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) [glucose](../../glossary#glucose), fasting [serum](../../glossary#serum) [insulin](../../glossary#insulin), or sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitive) of 17 trials in pre-diabetic, diabetic, or overweight/obese subjects found that administration of green tea extracts for 4 to 16 weeks improved fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c level [(101)](#reference101). The effect on fasting glucose was observed only with high doses of catechins (457 mg/day) and when the [confounding](../../glossary#confounder) effect of caffeine was removed. Finally, a third meta-analysis of 25 trials found that ingestion of green tea extracts for at least two weeks could lower fasting blood glucose in both the presence or absence of caffeine [(102)](#reference102). Dark chocolate is another good source of flavan-3-ols such that the effects of cocoa flavan-3-ols have been examined in individuals at-risk or with established type 2 diabetes. In a 15-day, [cross-over](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), randomized controlled study, the daily consumption of 100 g of dark chocolate bars containing 110.9 mg of (-)-EC and 36.1 mg of (+)-C significantly improved measures of [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) -cell function and insulin sensitivity, along with cardiometabolic markers in glucose-intolerant and hypertensive subjects [(103)](#reference103). Daily supplementation with flavonoid-enriched chocolate containing 850 mg of flavan-3-ols and 100 mg of isoflavones for one year significantly improved insulin sensitivity and reduced a predicted risk of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) at 10 years in 93 postmenopausal women treated for type 2 diabetes [(104)](#reference104). The EPIC-InterAct study did not find any association between dietary anthocyanin intake and risk of diabetes [(98, 99)](#reference98). Yet, a 10-fold increase in anthocyanin consumption was correlated with a 15% lower risk of diabetes in the pooled analysis of three large US [prospective cohorts](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (120,003 participants) [(105)](#reference105). Of note, this pooled analysis also reported a moderately higher risk of diabetes (+6%) in individuals in the highest versus lowest quintiles of flavone and flavanone intakes. Moreover, the consumption of berries, rich in anthocyanins, has been shown to trigger favorable glycemic responses in type 2 diabetics (reviewed in [70](#reference70)). In recent [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial), anthocyanins demonstrated beneficial effects on metabolic abnormalities in patients at-risk or diagnosed with diabetes. In an eight-week, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 38 healthy overweight and [obese](../../glossary#obesity) subjects, the consumption of 2 g/day of grape polyphenols rich in proanthocyanidins and challenge [(106)](#reference106). Another six-week randomized trial in individuals with diabetes showed that daily supplementation with Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas) extracts containing 600 mg of anthocyanins significantly lowered [serum](../../glossary#serum) levels of HbA1c and [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides) and increased serum insulin concentrations [(107)](#reference107). The administration of 320 mg/day of anthocyanins for 24 weeks also improved serum [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) and [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) profile, decreased markers of oxidative stress and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), elevated [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) capacity, and reduced insulin resistance compared to a placebo in patients with diabetes [(108)](#reference108). Further, supplemental anthocyanins up-regulated adiponectin expression and improved [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide)-mediated endothelium-dependent weeks of treatment (see also [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)) [(78)](#reference78). These promising findings warrant additional randomized controlled trials to confirm preventive and/or therapeutic benefits of (cocoa) flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins in type 2 diabetes. Although various flavonoids have been found to inhibit the development of chemically-induced [cancers](../../glossary#cancer) in animal models provide convincing evidence that high intakes of dietary flavonoids are associated with substantial reductions in human cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) (reviewed in [118](#reference118)). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and 10 [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found little-to-no evidence to support a preventive role of dietary flavonoid intake in gastric and [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) [(119)](#reference119). In addition, a recently published analysis of two large prospective studies (the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [HPFS] and the Nurses' Health Study [NHS]) \u2014 using the most up-to-date flavonoid food composition databases \u2014 found no association between the risk of colorectal cancer and intakes of each subclass of flavonoids or flavonoid-rich foods (tea, blueberries, oranges) [(120)](#reference120). A meta-analysis of 19 case-control studies and 15 cohort studies found that total flavonoid intake and intakes of of the aerodigestive tract (mouth, pharynx, [larynx](../../glossary#larynx), esophagus, and stomach) in smokers but not in nonsmokers [(121)](#reference121). The risk of lung cancer was not significantly associated with high flavonoid intakes [(121)](#reference121), although an earlier meta-analysis of eight prospective studies (with substantial [heterogeneity](../../glossary#heterogeneity) across them) suggested a protective role of flavonoids against lung cancer in smokers only [(122)](#reference122). Further, a prospective analysis of over 45,000 postmenopausal women from the Multiethnic Cohort Study found a reduced risk of [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) cancer with the highest intakes of total isoflavones, daidzein, and genistein [(123)](#reference123). Additionally, limited evidence from [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggests no relationship between total flavonoid intake and ovarian cancer [(124-127)](#reference124). To date, there is little evidence that flavonoid-rich diets might protect against various cancers, but larger prospective cohort studies are needed to address the association. Because isoflavones are [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen), it is thought that they may interfere with the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) and activity of [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone), eventually influencing hormone-dependent A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that examined breast cancer incidence in 369,934 women found an overall 11% reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of breast cancer with the highest versus lowest intake of soy isoflavones [(129)](#reference129). Subgroup analyses revealed a 24% lower risk of cancer in Asian but not in European or US women, and the risk was 22% lower in postmenopausal but not lower in premenopausal women. In addition to the ethnicity and menopausal status, [polymorphisms](../../glossary#polymorphism) for hormone [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) [(130)](#reference130) and phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) [(131)](#reference131) have been found to modify the association between isoflavone intake and breast cancer. Another recent meta-analysis of 12 observational studies (six [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), one case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study), flavonoids (except isoflavones) The results suggested that intakes of flavonols and flavones may also be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of breast cancer. Further, a pooled analysis of four case-control studies that stratified by menopausal status showed inverse associations between breast cancer and intakes of flavonols, flavones, or flavan-3-ols in postmenopausal women only. Finally, a meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies found an overall 16% reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence in women with high versus low isoflavone intakes [(129)](#reference129). A meta-analysis of 13 observational studies also suggested an inverse relationship between prostate cancer risk and consumption of soy products, especially tofu [(133)](#reference133). Yet, further analyses supported a protective role of soy food based only on case-control studies, which have inherent flaws such that associations may often be overestimated or underestimated. In a recent 12-month, multicenter, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [phase II clinical trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) in 158 Japanese men (aged 50 years) with elevated risk of prostate cancer, oral isoflavone (60 mg/day) resulted in a significant decrease in prostate cancer incidence in participants aged 65 years and older [(134)](#reference134). In this study, no changes were reported in sex hormone concentrations in blood, suggesting that isoflavones may reduce prostate cancer incidence without interfering with hormone-dependent pathways. Additional investigations will be necessary to determine whether supplementation with specific flavonoids could benefit cancer prevention or treatment. For more information on flavonoid-rich foods and cancer, see articles on [Fruit and Vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables#cancer-prevention), [Legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes#cancer-prevention), and [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea#cancer-prevention). [Inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress), and transition metal accumulation appear to play a role in the [pathology](../../glossary#pathology) of several [neurodegenerative diseases](../../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease), including [Parkinson's disease](../../glossary#parkinson-disease) [(135)](#reference135). Therefore, the various properties of flavonoids, including their role in protecting vascular health, could have beneficial effects on the brain, possibly in the protection against [cerebrovascular disorders](../../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease), [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) impairments, and subsequent [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) and [dementias](../../glossary#dementia). Dietary flavonoids and/or their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier [(54)](#reference54) and exert preventive effects towards cognitive impairments in animal models of normal and pathological aging [(53)](#reference53). The [cross-sectional](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data analysis of 2,031 participants (ages, 70-74 years) from the Hordaland Health Study in Norway indicated that, when compared to non-consumers, consumers of flavonoid-rich chocolate, tea, and wine had better global cognitive function, assessed by a battery of six cognitive tests [(136)](#reference136). The [risk](../../glossary#risk) of poor performance in all tests was estimated to be 60 to 74% lower in consumers of all three flavonoid-rich foods compared to non-consumers. An early [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 1,367 older French men and women (aged 65 years; free from dementia at baseline) found that those with the lowest flavonoid intakes (<11.5 mg/day) had a 50% higher risk of developing dementia over the next five years than those with higher intakes [(137)](#reference137). In addition, those with higher dietary flavonoid intakes at baseline experienced significantly less age-related cognitive decline over a 10-year period than those with the lowest flavonoid intakes [(138)](#reference138). The effect of cocoa flavan-3-ols have been investigated in an eight-week, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind) trial \u2014 the Cognitive, Cocoa, and Aging (CoCoA) study \u2014 in 90 individuals (ages, 64-82 years) with mild cognitive impairments (MCI); participants were given dairy-based cocoa drinks with either high (993 mg/day) or low (48 mg/day) levels of flavan-3-ols [(139)](#reference139). The daily consumption of the cocoa drink high in flavan-3-ols improved some, but not all, measures of cognitive process speed and flexibility and verbal fluency compared to baseline test scores and scores following low flavan-3-ol drink consumption. A composite test score reflecting overall cognitive performance was found to be significantly greater in those given cocoa drinks high rather than low in flavan-3-ols. The study also reported reductions in [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk markers (i.e., [systolic](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure), total and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance)), and these changes were proposed to partly contribute to ameliorate cognitive performance in those who consumed the flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa drink [(139)](#reference139). The data could be replicated in cognitively healthy older people (ages, 61-85 years), suggesting that cocoa flavan-3-ols might enhance some aspects of cognitive function during healthy aging [(140)](#reference140). Interestingly, a two-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled study has reported an increase in blood flow velocity in the middle [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebrum) artery of 21 healthy subjects (mean age, 72 years) following the daily intake of a flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa drink (900 mg/day of flavan-3-ols) [(141)](#reference141). Because cerebral blood flow is correlated with cognitive function in humans, these preliminary data suggest that cocoa flavan-3-ol consumption could exert a protective effect against dementia [(54)](#reference54). Yet, in other [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(142-144)](#reference142), the lack of an effect of cocoa flavan-3-ols on blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, mental fatigue, and cognitive performance in healthy young and old adults suggested that benefits may only be seen in very demanding cognitive exercises [(145)](#reference145). Some randomized controlled studies also reported improvements in measures of cognitive function in healthy and cognitively impaired subjects with other and flavonoid-rich foods may enhance cognitive function in the aging brain, it is not yet clear whether their consumption could lower the risk of cognitive impairments and dementia in humans. For more detailed information on flavan-3-ol-rich tea and cognitive function, see the article on [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea). Recent data analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimated flavonoid intakes in US adults (aged 19 years) average between 200 and 250 mg/day, with 80% being The main dietary sources of flavonoids include [tea](../../food-beverages/tea), citrus fruit, citrus fruit juices, berries, red wine, apples, and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes). Individual flavonoid intakes may vary considerably depending on whether tea, red wine, soy products, or fruit and vegetables are commonly consumed (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). Information on the flavonoid content of some flavonoid-rich foods is presented in Tables 2-8. These values should be considered approximate since a number of factors may affect the flavonoid content of foods, including agricultural practices, environmental conditions, ripening, storage, and food processing. For additional information about the flavonoid content of food, the USDA provides databases for the content of selected foods in flavonoids [(60)](#reference60) and proanthocyanidins [(58)](#reference58). For more information on the isoflavone content of soy foods, see the article on [Soy Isoflavones](soy-isoflavones#sources) or the USDA database for the isoflavone g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| |Food||Flavon-3-ol Monomers# and Shiraz||6.8||-||10||-||-||-||-| *per 100 g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces. | #Catechins: C, (+)-catechin; g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| |Eriodictyol||Hesperetin||Naringenin| g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| 100 g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| Bilberry, elderberry, black currant, blueberry, red grape, and mixed berry extracts that are rich in anthocyanins are available as dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) without a prescription in the US. The anthocyanin content of these products may vary considerably. Standardized extracts that list the amount of anthocyanins per dose are available. Numerous tea extracts are available in the US as dietary supplements and may be labeled as tea catechins or tea polyphenols. Green tea extracts are the most commonly marketed, but black and oolong tea extracts are also available. Green tea extracts generally have higher levels of catechins (flavan-3-ol [monomers](../../glossary#monomer)), while black tea extracts are richer in theaflavins and thearubigins (tea flavan-3-ol dimers and [polymers](../../glossary#polymer), respectively). Oolong tea extracts fall somewhere in between green and black tea extracts with respect to their flavan-3-ol content. Some tea extracts contain caffeine, while others are decaffeinated. Flavan-3-ol and caffeine content vary considerably among different products, so it is important to check the label or consult the manufacturer to determine the amounts of flavan-3-ols and caffeine that would be consumed daily with each supplement (for more information on tea flavan-3-ols, see the article on [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea#flavonoids)). Citrus bioflavonoid supplements also available in hesperidin-complex supplements, with daily doses from 500 mg to 2 g [(153)](#reference153). The peels and tissues of citrus fruit (e.g., oranges, tangerines, and clementines) are rich in Although dietary intakes of these naturally occurring flavones are generally low, they are often present in citrus bioflavonoid complex supplements. Several dietary supplements may also contain various amounts of baicalein (aglycone) and/or baicalin (glycoside). Some tea flavonol aglycone, quercetin, and its glycoside rutin are available as dietary supplements without a prescription in the US. Other names for rutin include rutoside, quercetin-3-rutinoside, and sophorin [(153)](#reference153). Citrus quercetin or rutin. A 50-mg soy isoflavone supplement usually isoflavones: mg), daidzein (daidzin; 19 mg), and (glycitin; about 6 mg). Smaller amounts of daidzein, genistein, and formononetin are also found in biochanin A-containing supplements (derived from red clover) [(153)](#reference153). No adverse effects have been associated with high dietary intakes of flavonoids from plant-based food. This lack of adverse effects may be explained by the relatively low [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and rapid [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination of most flavonoids. Oral supplementation with quercetin [glycosides](../../glossary#glycoside) at doses ranging between 3 mg/day-1,000 mg/day for up to three months has not resulted in significant adverse effects in clinical studies (reviewed in [154](#reference154)). A [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 30 patients with chronic prostatitis reported one case of headache and another of tingling of the extremities associated with supplemental quercetin (1,000 mg/day for one month); both issues resolved after the study ended [(155)](#reference155). In a [phase I clinical trial](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in cancer patients unresponsive to standard treatments, administration of quercetin via [intravenous](../../glossary#intravenous) infusion resulted in symptoms of nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, and dyspnea (difficulty breathing) at doses 10.5 mg/kg body weight (~756 mg of quercetin for a 70 kg individual) [(156)](#reference156). Higher doses up to 51.3 mg/kg body weight (~3,591 mg of quercetin) were associated with renal (kidney) toxicity, yet without evidence of nephritis, infection, or obstructive uropathy (reviewed in [154](#reference154)). In a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), controlled study in healthy adults, the daily intake of 2 g of cocoa flavan-3-ols for 12 weeks was found to be well tolerated with no adverse side effects [(157)](#reference157). In [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) employing caffeinated green tea extracts, cancer patients who took 6 g/day in three to six divided doses reported mild-to-moderate [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [(158, 159)](#reference158). [Central nervous system](../../glossary#central-nervous-system) symptoms, including agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tremors, dizziness, and confusion, have also been reported. In one case, confusion was severe enough to require hospitalization [(158)](#reference158). In a [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) published in 2008, the US Pharmacopeia (USP) Dietary Supplement Information Expert Committee identified 34 adverse event reports implicating the use of green tea extract products (containing 25%-97% of polyphenols) as the likely cause of liver damage (hepatotoxicity) in humans [(160)](#reference160). In a four-week clinical trial that assessed the safety of decaffeinated green tea extracts (800 mg/day of EGCG) in healthy individuals, a few of the participants reported mild nausea, stomach upset, dizziness, or muscle pain [(161)](#reference161). In the Minnesota Green Tea Trial (MGTT), 1,075 postmenopausal women were [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) to receive green tea extracts (1,315\u00b1116 mg/day of catechins; the equivalent of four 8-ounce mugs of brewed decaffeinated green tea) or a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) for one year. The total number of adverse events and the number of serious adverse events were not different between the treatment and placebo groups [(162)](#reference162). However, the use of green tea extracts was directly associated with abnormally high liver [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) levels in 7 out of the 12 women who experienced serious adverse events. Also, the incidence of nausea was twice as high in the green tea arm as in the placebo group [(162)](#reference162). The safety of flavonoid [supplements](../../glossary#supplment) in pregnancy and lactation has not been established [(153)](#reference153). ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters, including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP), function as [ATP](../../glossary#ATP)-dependent efflux pumps that actively regulate the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of a number of drugs limiting their systemic [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) [(8)](#reference8). ABC transporters are found throughout the body, yet they are especially important in organs with a barrier function like the intestines, the blood-brain barrier, blood-testis barrier, and the [placenta](../../glossary#placenta), as well as in liver and kidneys [(163)](#reference163). There is some evidence that the consumption of grapefruit juice inhibits the activity of P-glycoprotein [(164)](#reference164). and (-)-EGCG, and others have been found to inhibit the efflux activity of P-glycoprotein in cultured cells and in animal models [(163)](#reference163). Thus, very high or [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) intakes of these flavonoids could potentially increase the toxicity of drugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein, e.g., digoxin, protease inhibitors, immunosuppressive agents, H2 receptor antagonists, some antibiotics, and others (reviewed in [165](#reference165)). Many anthocyanins and anthocyanidins, as been identified as inhibitors of BRCP-mediated transport, theoretically affecting drugs like anticancer inhibit MRP, potentially affecting MRP-mediated transport of from purple grape juice (500 mL/day) and dark chocolate (235 mg/day of flavan-3-ols) have been found to inhibit [platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation ex vivo assays [(166-169)](#reference166). Theoretically, high intakes of flavonoids (e.g., from [supplements](../../glossary#supplement)) could increase the risk of bleeding when taken with [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs, such in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of a broad range of compounds, from [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) molecules to therapeutic agents. The most abundant CYP isoform in the liver and intestines is cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); the CYP3A family [catalyzes](../../glossary#catalyst) the metabolism of about one-half of all marketed drugs in the US and Canada [(171)](#reference171). One grapefruit or as little as 200 mL (7 fluid ounces) of grapefruit juice have been found to irreversibly inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 [(164)](#reference164). The most potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 in grapefruit are thought to be furanocoumarins, particularly dihydroxybergamottin, rather than flavonoids. All forms of the fruit \u2014 freshly squeezed juice, frozen concentrate, or whole fruit \u2014 can potentially affect the activity of CYP3A4. Some varieties of other citrus fruit (Seville oranges, limes, and pomelos) that contain furanocoumarins can also interfere with CYP3A4 activity. Specifically, the inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by grapefruit consumption is known or predicted to increase the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of toxicity of more than 85 drugs. Because drugs with very low bioavailability are more likely to be toxic when CYP3A4 activity is inhibited, they are associated with a higher risk of overdose with grapefruit compared to drugs with high bioavailability. Some of the drugs with low bioavailability include, but are not limited to, agents (darifenacin) (reviewed in [171](#reference171)). Because of the potential for adverse drug interactions, some clinicians recommend that people taking medications with low bioavailability (i.e., undergoing extensive metabolism by CYP3A4) avoid consuming grapefruit and grapefruit juice altogether during the treatment period [(171)](#reference171). Flavonoids can bind nonheme [iron](../../minerals/iron), inhibiting its intestinal absorption [(172, 173)](#reference172). Nonheme iron is the principal form of iron in plant foods, dairy products, and iron [supplements](../../glossary#supplement). The consumption of one cup of tea or cocoa with a meal has been found to decrease the absorption of nonheme iron in that meal by about 70% [(174, 175)](#reference174). Flavonoids can also inhibit intestinal [heme](../../glossary#heme) iron absorption [(176)](#reference176). Interestingly, ascorbic acid greatly enhances the absorption of iron (see the article on [Iron](../../minerals/iron#nonheme-iron)) and is able to counteract the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on nonheme and heme iron absorption [(173](#reference173), [176, 177)](#reference176). To maximize iron absorption from a meal or iron supplements, flavonoid-rich food and beverages and flavonoid supplements should not be consumed at the same time.

Cruciferous vegetables differ from other classes of vegetables in that they are rich sources of sulfur-containing compounds known as glucosinolates (for detailed information, see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#introduction)) [(2)](#reference2). The potential health benefits of consuming cruciferous vegetables are attributed to compounds derived from the [enzymatic](../../glossary#enzyme) [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) (breakdown) of glucosinolates. Among these compounds is indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a compound derived from the degradation of an indole glucosinolate commonly known as glucobrassicin (Figure 1). A number of commonly consumed [cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables), including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage, are good sources of glucobrassicin glucosinolates, is physically separated from glucosinolates in intact plant cells [(3)](#reference3). When raw cruciferous vegetables are chopped or chewed, plant cells are damaged such that glucobrassicin is exposed to myrosinase. The hydrolysis of glucobrassicin initially produces a [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) molecule and the unstable [aglycone](../../glossary#aglycone), thiohydroximate-O-sulfonate. The spontaneous release of a sulfate [ion](../../glossary#ion) results in the formation of another unstable intermediate form, 3-indolylmethylisothiocyanate [(4)](#reference4). This compound easily splits into thiocyanate ion and I3C (Figure 1). In the [acidic](../../glossary#acidic) environment of the stomach, I3C molecules can combine with each other to form a complex mixture of polycyclic aromatic compounds, known collectively as acid condensation products (Figure 2) [(5)](#reference5). Some of the most prominent acid condensation products include 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), 5,11-dihydroindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ), and a cyclic triindole (CT) (Figure 2). The biological activities of individual acid condensation products may differ from those of I3C (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). When cruciferous vegetables are cooked, plant myrosinase is inactivated thus the hydrolysis of glucosinolates is prevented. Intact glucosinolates then transit to the [colon](../../glossary#colon) and are [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) by human intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria). The generation of I3C from glucobrassicin may still occur to a lesser degree in the large intestine, due to the myrosinase activity of colonic bacteria [(4)](#reference4). Thus, when cruciferous vegetables are cooked, I3C can still form in the colon, but I3C-derived acid condensation products are less likely to form in the more [alkaline](../../glossary#alkaline) environment of the intestine. No I3C could be detected in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) following oral administration of single doses of I3C, ranging from 200 to 1,200 mg, to healthy women at high risk for breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(6)](#reference6). However, DIM was detected and peaked in plasma around two hours after I3C ingestion, at concentrations from <100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) with oral doses of 400 to 600 mg of I3C up to 500 ng/mL-600 ng/mL with oral doses of 1,000 to 1,200 mg of I3C. All DIM disappeared from the blood within 24 hours [(6)](#reference6). Formulation strategies, such as the encapsulation of I3C and DIM into nanoparticles or liposomes [(7-9)](#reference7), are being developed with the aim of increasing the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and evaluating the safety and efficacy of these compounds in humans. [Biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) play major roles in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination of many biologically active compounds, including physiologic regulators (e.g., [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen)), drugs, and environmental chemicals ( [xenobiotics](../../glossary#xenobiotic); e.g., [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen), toxins). In general, phase including the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family, [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) reactions that increase the reactivity of [hydrophobic](../../glossary#hydrophobic) (fat-soluble) compounds, which prepares them for reactions catalyzed by phase II detoxifying enzymes. Reactions catalyzed by phase II enzymes usually increase water solubility and promote the elimination of these compounds [(10)](#reference10). I3C and some I3C condensation products can bind to a [protein](../../glossary#protein) in the [cytoplasm](../../glossary#cytoplasm) of cells called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Figure 3) [(11-13)](#reference11). In fact, ICZ is one of the most potent ligands for the AhR known with an affinity approaching that of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). I3C acid condensation products, as well as indoles and their acid condensation products formed from tryptophan metabolism, appear to be important endogenous ligands for the AhR [(13)](#reference13). Binding allows AhR to enter the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) where it forms a complex with the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein. This AhR/Arnt complex binds to specific [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) sequences, known as xenobiotic response elements (XRE), in the regulatory regions ( [promoters](../../glossary#promoter)) of target [genes](../../glossary#gene), especially those involved in [xenobiotic](../../glossary#xenobiotic) [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) [(14)](#reference14). The promoters of genes coding for a number of [CYP enzymes](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) and several [phase II enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) profiling of I3C- or DIM-treated human [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells showed that both compounds upregulated the [phase I enzyme](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), CYP1A1, and the q1) and aldo-keto reductase [(15)](#reference15). Another study in human prostate cancer cells demonstrated that the removal of AhR abolished I3C- or DIM-induced CYP1A1 [mRNA](../../glossary#mRNA) expression [(16)](#reference16). The expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 was also upregulated in human primary liver cells challenged with DIM [(17)](#reference17). Further, I3C and DIM have been found to interfere with CYP activities involved in [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) metabolism (see [Anti-estrogenic activities](#anti-estrogenic-activities)). Increasing the activity of biotransformation enzymes is generally considered a beneficial effect because the elimination of potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) or toxins is enhanced. However, there is a potential for adverse effects because some [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen) require biotransformation by phase I enzymes to become active carcinogens [(18)](#reference18). I3C and DIM have been shown to induce the expression of [phase II](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) detoxifying and [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway. Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the [protein](../../glossary#protein) Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../../glossary#cytosol) (Figure Keap1 responds to [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals or chemical inducers by freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoters](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes and scavengers. Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code for numerous mediators isoform) expression in liver [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells [(20)](#reference20). In addition, the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of Nrf2 coding gene, which was abnormally repressed through promoter [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) hypermethylation, was enhanced in mouse [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer cells treated with DIM. DIM subsequently restored the expression of the Nrf2-target genes, NQO1 and GST\u00b51 [(21)](#reference21). DIM also reversed Nrf2 gene silencing in transgenic mouse prostate cancer tissues, inducing Nrf2 expression, and subsequently, NQO1 expression (Figure 4). This was accompanied by the suppression of [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and the induction of [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) in prostate cancer tissues [(21)](#reference21). Similar observations have been with I3C [(22)](#reference22). [Endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) are [steroid](../../glossary#steroid) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone) [synthesized](../../glossary#synthesis) mammals. In breast tissue, CYP19 (aromatase) [catalyzes](../../glossary#catalyst) the final steps in the conversion (testosterone or androstenedione) to [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) (17-estradiol or estrone, respectively). Both I3C and DIM have been found to downregulate the expression of CYP19 in non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic estrogen-responsive (ER+) breast expression increased in I3C/DIM-treated tumorigenic estrogen-independent (ER-) breast cells [(23)](#reference23). Prolonged exposure to [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) is thought to play a role in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) development through [CYP](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450)-mediated generation of estrogen reactive of estrogens. can CYP1A1/2 and CYP1B1, respectively. and 4HE2 are further metabolized to 2- and 4-metoxymetabolites by the phase II enzyme, catechol-O-methyltransferase 17-estradiol, while 4-HE2 can be converted to [free radicals](../../glossary#free-radical) that can form DNA adducts and promote [carcinogenesis](../../glossary#carcinogenesis) [(26, 27)](#reference26). In different breast cancer cell lines, I3C and DIM have been shown to upregulate the expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 at the transcript ( [mRNA](../../glossary#mRNA)) level but not at the [protein](../../glossary#protein) level [(28)](#reference28). the [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens to 2-hydroxyestrone (2HE1), 16HE1 is highly estrogenic and has been found to stimulate the [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) of several estrogen-sensitive cancer cell lines [(30, 31)](#reference30). It has been [hypothesized](../../glossary#hypothesis) that shifting the metabolism of 17-estradiol toward 2HE1, and away from 16HE1, could decrease the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of estrogen-sensitive cancers, such as breast cancer [(32)](#reference32). In controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial), oral supplementation with I3C or has consistently increased urinary 2HE1 concentrations or urinary 2HE1:16HE1 ratios in women [(33-39)](#reference33). However, large [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have failed to find significant associations between urinary 2HE1:16HE1 ratios and risk of breast and [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) cancer [(40-43)](#reference40). [Endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen), including 17-estradiol, exert their by binding to specific [nuclear](../../glossary#nucleus) [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) called estrogen receptors (ERs). Within the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus), estrogen-activated ERs can bind to specific [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) sequences, known as estrogen response coactivator [proteins](../../glossary#protein) and [chromatin](../../glossary#chromatin) remodeling factors to promoters, thereby triggering the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of target genes [(44)](#reference44). There are two major ER subtypes, ER and ER, coded by two separate genes ESR1 and ESR2, respectively. ER is the main driver of the [proliferative](../../glossary#proliferation) effect of estrogens, while the expression of ER has been [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with mammary gland tumorigenesis [(45)](#reference45). Elevated ER levels promote cellular proliferation in the breast and uterus, possibly increasing the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing estrogen-sensitive cancers [(46)](#reference46). In [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen)-sensitive human breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells challenged with 17-estradiol, I3C has been found to inhibit the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of estrogen-responsive [genes](../../glossary#gene) without binding to either ER or ER [(47, 48)](#reference47). In fact, the binding of I3C to AhR was shown to trigger the [proteasome](../../glossary#proteasome)-dependent degradation of ER [(49)](#reference49). I3C-induced loss of ER resulted in the downregulation of ER-responsive gene products like the [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) GATA3. Since GATA3 regulates the transcription of the ER coding gene ESR1, I3C prevented the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) of new ER transcripts and [proteins](../../glossary#protein), eventually abolishing the ER [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathway. The disruption of the GATA3/ER cross-regulatory loop by I3C ultimately halted ER-dependent cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) [(49)](#reference49). Acid condensation products of I3C that bind and activate AhR may also inhibit the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes by competing for co-activators or increasing ER degradation [(14](#reference14), [50)](#reference50). I3C treatment also affected the expression of other ER-responsive genes, including those coding for insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGFR1) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), involved in cell proliferation and deregulated in breast cancer (Figure 5) [(51)](#reference51). I3C and condensation derivatives have been found to affect multiple [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways that are often deregulated in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells. Below are some examples illustrating how I3C, DIM, or ICZ may influence cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), migration, invasion, [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis), and [immunity](../../health-disease/immunity) by targeting specific signaling pathways [(23)](#reference23). Once a cell divides, it passes through a sequence of stages \u2014 collectively known as the cell cycle \u2014 before it divides again. Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested at damage checkpoints, which allows for DNA repair or activation of pathways leading to cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) if the damage is irreparable [(52)](#reference52). Defective cell cycle regulation may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer). In addition, unlike normal cells, cancerous cells lose their ability to respond to death signals that initiate apoptosis. I3C-induced downregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt) cell survival [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathway in mice with nasopharyngeal carcinoma resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis [(53)](#reference53). Inactivation of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway in DIM-treated [colon](../../glossary#colon) cancer cells decreased the expression of downstream targets, c-myc and cyclin D1, that promote cell proliferation and survival [(54)](#reference54). In [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer cells, I3C opposed the anti-apoptotic effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) by limiting EGF receptor autophosphorylation (activation) and reducing EGF-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and expression of the pro-survival target molecules, Bcl-x(L) and BAD [(55)](#reference55). In another study, DIM caused apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by stimulating p38 mitogen-activated [(56)](#reference56). The anti-proliferative effect of DIM in cancer cells has also been linked to the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Specifically, DIM was found to reverse HDAC-mediated epigenetic silencing of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for key regulators of the cell cycle [(57, 58)](#reference57). A recent [genome](../../glossary#genome)-wide analysis of DNA [methylation](../../glossary#methylation) also showed that DIM could reverse aberrant promoter methylation in prostate cancer cells, at least partly through downregulating the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) [(59)](#reference59). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a process of epithelial cell transformation whereby cells lose their polarity and adhesion properties while gaining migratory and invasive properties through the expression of mesenchymal [genes](../../glossary#gene). Inhibition of EMT by I3C and ICZ in breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells has been associated with upregulation of an epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and downregulation of vimentin, adhesion metalloproteins \u2014 [proteins](../../glossary#protein) and [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) known to promote migration [(60)](#reference60). DIM also inhibited migration and invasion of liver cancer cells [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) and [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) through inactivating the FAK [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathway [(61)](#reference61). Moreover, DIM has been shown to reverse [methylation](../../glossary#methylation)-associated dysregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion, [chemotaxis](../../glossary#chemotaxis), and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) that contributes to cancer progression [(59)](#reference59). DIM was able to inhibit lung [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasis) in mice with liver [(61)](#reference61) or mammary tumors [(62)](#reference62). To fuel their rapid growth, invasive tumors must also develop new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels by a process known as [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis). I3C inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced [macrophage](../../glossary#macrophage) (VEGF), and prevented the formation of capillary-like structures from co-cultured human umbilical endothelial cells [(63)](#reference63). Similarly, cells [(64)](#reference64). DIM also activities in human umbilical endothelial cells [(65)](#reference65). Uncontrolled [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) has been associated with several [chronic diseases](../../glossary#chronic-disease), including [cancer](../../glossary#cancer). In the oxide synthase (iNOS), has been found to be mitigated by DIM treatment [(66)](#reference66). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) is a major [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) regulating the expression of many pro-inflammatory [genes](../../glossary#gene) like those coding for COX-2 and iNOS. Specifically, DIM inhibited TPA-induced activation of activity of NF-B [(66)](#reference66). In addition, recent animal studies showed that I3C and/or DIM could modulate cell-mediated immune response in experimental DIM differentially via the activation or suppression of [microRNA](../../glossary#microRNA)-dependent pathways controlling cell cycle progression and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis). The inclusion of I3C in the maternal diet was found to protect the offspring from lymphoma and lung tumors induced by dibenzo[a]pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [(70, 71)](#reference70). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are chemical pollutants formed during incomplete combustion of organic substances, such as coal, oil, wood, and tobacco [(72)](#reference72). However, the physiological relevance of cell culture and animal studies to human health is unclear since little or no I3C is available to tissues after oral administration (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(6)](#reference6). Some [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) provide some the [hypothesis](../../glossary#hypothesis) that higher intakes of [cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) are associated with lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) for some types of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#cancer-prevention)) [(1)](#references). Cruciferous vegetables are relatively good sources of nutrients that may have protective effects against cancer, including [vitamin C](../../vitamins/vitamin-C), [folate](../../vitamins/folate), [selenium](../../minerals/selenium), [carotenoids](carotenoids), and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber). In addition, glucosinolates be hydrolyzed to a variety of potentially protective [isothiocyanates](isothiocyanates), in addition to indole-3-carbinol (see the article on [Isothiocyanates](isothiocyanates#metabolism-bioavailability)). Consequently, evidence for an [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between cruciferous vegetable intake and cancer risk provides relatively little information about the specific effects of indole-3-carbinol on cancer risk. At present, the effects of I3C or DIM supplementation on cancer risk in humans are not known. Infection with certain strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) is an important [risk](../../glossary#risk) factor for cervical cancer [(73)](#reference73). Transgenic mice that express cancer-promoting HPV genes develop cervical cancer with chronic 17-estradiol administration. In this model, feeding I3C markedly reduced the number of mice that developed cervical cancer [(74)](#reference74). A small [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in women examined the effect of oral I3C supplementation on the progression of precancerous cervical lesions classified as [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia](../../glossary#cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia) (CIN) 2 or CIN 3 [(75)](#reference75). After 12 weeks, four out of the eight women who took 200 mg/day had complete regression of CIN, and four out of the nine who took 400 mg/day had complete regression; none of the 10 women who took a placebo had complete regression. HPV was present in 7 out of the 10 women in the placebo group, seven out of eight women in the 200 mg I3C group, and eight out of nine women in the 400 mg I3C group [(75)](#reference75). However compared to placebo, oral supplementation with DIM (2 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks in 64 women with CIN 2 or CIN 3 lesions failed to improve clinical parameters during a one-year follow-up period [(76)](#reference76). In another six-month [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind) DIM supplementation (150 mg/day) failed to promote HPV clearance and prevent CIN progression in 551 women with low-grade cell abnormalities in cervical smears [(77)](#reference77). Although oral supplementation of I3C or DIM appears relatively safe and well tolerated, results obtained with I3C are only preliminary, and interventions with DIM failed to show preventative or therapeutic efficacy in women with precancerous lesions of the cervix. The intravaginal administration of DIM in the form of suppositories may prove to be a more effective approach to reverse CIN in women [(78)](#reference78). HPV infection has also been associated with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a precancerous condition that may progress to vulval cancer [(79)](#reference79). A small [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) trial in 12 women with VIN found that supplementation with 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day of I3C for six months improved overall symptoms, as well as lesion size and appearance [(80)](#reference80). Additional trials are necessary to determine whether I3C might be an effective treatment for VIN. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare disease of children and adults, characterized by generally benign growths (papillomas) in the respiratory tract, which are caused by HPV infection [(81)](#reference81). These papillomas occur most commonly on or around the vocal cords in the [larynx](../../glossary#larynx) (voice box), but they may also affect the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. The most common treatment for RRP is surgical removal of the papillomas. Since papillomas often recur, [adjunct](../../glossary#adjunct) treatments may be used to help prevent or reduce recurrences [(82)](#reference82). In immune-compromised mice transplanted with HPV-infected laryngeal tissue, 25% of the mice fed I3C developed laryngeal papillomas compared to 100% of the control mice [(83)](#reference83). In a small [observational study](../../glossary#observational-study) of RRP patients, increased ratios of urinary 2HE1:16HE1 resulting from increased [cruciferous vegetable](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) consumption were associated with less severe RRP [(84)](#reference84). In an uncontrolled [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study), the effect of daily I3C supplementation (400 mg/day for adults and 10 mg/kg daily for children) on papilloma recurrence has been examined in RRP patients [(85)](#reference85). Over a five-year follow-up period, 11 of the original 49 patients experienced no recurrence, 10 experienced a reduction in the rate of recurrence, 12 experienced no improvement, and 12 were lost to follow-up [(86)](#reference86). I3C given for 6 months to 3 years to five children with an aggressive form of the disease halted the growth of the papillomas in three children after two years of treatment [(87)](#reference87). In some patients, I3C may be an effective adjunct treatment to reduce the growth or recurrence of respiratory papillomas. [Systemic lupus erythematosus](../../glossary#systemic-lupus-erythematosus) (SLE) is an [autoimmune disorder](../../glossary#autoimmune-disease) characterized by chronic [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) that may result in damage to the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, or brain [(88)](#reference88). [Estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) is thought to play a role in the [pathology](../../glossary#pathology) of SLE because the disorder is much more common in women than men, and its onset is most common during the reproductive years when [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogen levels are highest [(89)](#reference89). The potential for I3C toward the highly estrogenic metabolite 16HE1 (see [Anti-estrogenic activities](#anti-estrogenic-activities)), led to interest in its use in SLE [(35)](#reference35). In an animal model of SLE, I3C feeding decreased the severity of kidney disease and prolonged survival [(90)](#reference90). A small uncontrolled trial of I3C supplementation (375 mg/day) in female SLE patients found that I3C supplementation increased urinary 2HE1:16HE1 ratios, but the trial found no significant change in SLE symptoms after three months [(90)](#reference90). Controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether I3C supplementation could have beneficial effects in SLE patients. Glucobrassicin, the glucosinolate [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) of I3C, is found Brussels and turnip [(91, 92)](#reference91). Although glucosinolates are present in relatively high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables, glucobrassicin makes up only about 8%-12% of the total glucosinolates [(93)](#reference93). Total glucosinolate contents of selected cruciferous vegetables are presented in Table 1. However, the amount of total glucosinolates and the amount of indole-3-carbinol formed from glucobrassicin in food is variable and depends, in part, on the processing and preparation of foods (for more detailed information, see the article cup, | savoy||\u00bd chopped|| |Watercress||1 cup, | red||\u00bd chopped|| | |Broccoli||\u00bd cup, chopped|| | |Horseradish||1 tablespoon (15 g)|| | 24 |Cauliflower||\u00bd cup, chopped|| | 22 |Bok choi (pak choi)||\u00bd cup, chopped|| | 19 I3C is available without a prescription as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement), alone or in combination products. Dosage ranges between 200 mg/day and 800 mg/day [(95)](#reference95). I3C supplementation increased urinary 2HE1 concentrations in doses of 300 to 400 mg/day [(39)](#reference39). I3C doses of 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day improved the regression of [cervical (CIN) in a preliminary [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) [(75)](#reference75). I3C in doses up to 400 mg/day has been used to treat recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)) [(85, 86)](#reference85). DIM is available without a prescription as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement), alone or in combination products. In a small [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial), DIM supplementation at a dose of 108 mg/day for 30 days increased urinary 2HE1 [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) in postmenopausal women with a history of breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(34)](#reference34). Slight increases in the [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of the liver [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were observed in two women who took unspecified doses of I3C [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) for four weeks [(39)](#reference39). One person reported a skin rash while taking 375 mg/day of I3C [(35)](#reference35). High doses of I3C (800 mg/day) have been associated with symptoms of disequilibrium and tremor, which resolved when the dose was decreased [(85)](#reference85). In a [phase I study](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in women at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for breast cancer, 5 out of 20 participants had [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms with single doses 600 mg, although others had no adverse effects with single doses up to 1,200 mg [(6)](#reference6).

In some animal models, I3C supplementation was found to enhance [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen)-induced cancer development when given chronically after the carcinogen [(96-99)](#reference96). When administered before or at the same time as the carcinogen, oral I3C inhibited tumorigenesis in animal models of cancers of the long-term effects of I3C supplementation on cancer risk in humans are not known, the contradictory results of animal studies have led several experts to caution against the widespread use of I3C and DIM supplements in humans until their potential risks and benefits are better understood [(99](#reference99), [109, 110)](#reference109). The safety of I3C or DIM [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy or lactation has not been established [(95)](#reference95). No drug interactions with I3C or DIM supplementation in humans have been reported. However, preliminary evidence that I3C and DIM can increase the activity of CYP1A2 [(111, 112)](#reference111) suggests the potential for I3C or DIM supplementation to decrease [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of medications [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) by CYP1A2 [(113)](#reference113). Both I3C and DIM modestly increase the activity of CYP3A4 in rats when administered chronically [(114)](#reference114). This observation raises the potential for adverse drug interactions in humans since CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of approximately 60% of therapeutic drugs. The [acidic](../../glossary#acidic) environment of the stomach allows I3C molecules to condense and generate a number of biologically active I3C oligomers (Figure 2). Drugs that block the production of stomach acids, like antacids, Histamine2 (H2) [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) [antagonists](../../glossary#antagonist), and proton-pump inhibitors, would likely prevent the generation of DIM and ICZ. However, it is not known whether these drugs limit the biological activities attributed to I3C and its derivatives [(95)](#reference95).

Toxicol [(PubMed)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12730619) Contents Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and kale, are rich sources of sulfur-containing compounds called glucosinolates (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables)). are biologically active [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) (breakdown) products of glucosinolates. Cruciferous vegetables contain a variety of glucosinolates, each of which forms a different isothiocyanate when hydrolyzed (Figure 1) [(1)](#references). For example, broccoli is a good source of glucoraphanin, the glucosinolate [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) precursor of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), while garden cress rich of benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). At present, scientists are interested in the cancer-preventive activities of vegetables that are rich in glucosinolates (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#cancer-prevention)), as well as individual isothiocyanates [(3)](#reference3). The [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) of glucosinolates, which is [catalyzed](../../glossary#catalyst) by a class of [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) called myrosinases (-thioglucosidases), leads to the formation of breakdown such thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, indoles, oxazolidine-2-thiones (e.g., on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables)). In intact plant cells, myrosinase is physically separated from glucosinolates. Yet, when plant cells are damaged, myrosinase is released and comes in contact with glucosinolates, catalyzing their conversion into highly reactive [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) that impart a pungent aroma and spicy (some say bitter) taste. Likewise, when raw cruciferous vegetables are chopped during the food preparation process, glucosinolates are rapidly hydrolyzed by myrosinase, generating metabolites that are then absorbed in the proximal intestine. In contrast, cooking cruciferous vegetables before consumption inactivates myrosinase, thus preventing the breakdown of glucosinolates. However, lightly cooking (i.e., light steam for <5 minutes) will preserve some of the myrosinase and allow for isothiocyanate conversion. A small fraction of intact glucosinolates may be absorbed in the [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine), but a large proportion reaches the [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(4)](#reference4). In the colon, myrosinase produced by the microbiota can catalyze the generation of a wide range of metabolites from glucosinolates, depending on the [pH](../../glossary#pH) and the presence of [cofactors](../../glossary#cofactor) [(4, 5)](#reference4). The hydrolysis of glucosinolates at neutral pH results in the formation of unique isothiocyanates (Figure 1). For example, sinigrin, glucoraphanin, isothiocyanates (like sulforaphane) are promptly [conjugated](../../glossary#conjugation) to [glutathione](../../glossary#glutathione) by a class of phase II detoxification [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) known as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in the liver, and then sequentially metabolized in the mercapturic acid pathway (Figure 2). This mechanism is meant to increase the solubility of isothiocyanates, thereby promoting a rapid [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) in the urine. Using sulforaphane as the model isothiocyanate, it has indeed been established that its metabolites \u2014 sulforaphane-glutathione, sulforaphane-cysteine-glycine, sulforaphane-cysteine, and sulforaphane N-acetylcysteine \u2014 collectively known as dithiocarbamates (Figure 2), are ultimately excreted in the urine [(4)](#reference4). The composition and content of glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables are relatively stable but depend on the genus and species and can vary with plant growing and post-harvest storage conditions and culinary processing [(6, 7)](#reference6). Since most [cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) are cooked prior to eating, [bacterial](../../glossary#bacteria) myrosinase in the gut, rather than plant myrosinase, is responsible for the initial step in glucosinolate degradation (Figure 2). In a feeding study involving 45 healthy subjects, the mean conversion rate of glucosinolates (of which 85% was glucoraphanin) to dithiocarbamates over a 24-hour period was estimated to be around 12% with wide variations among participants (range, 1.1 to 40.7%) [(6)](#reference6). In contrast, 70%-75% of ingested isothiocyanates were found to be [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) to dithiocarbamates. Therefore, following the ingestion of cooked cruciferous vegetables, the conversion of glucosinolates into isothiocyanates by gut bacteria appears to be a limiting step in the generation of dithiocarbamates [(6)](#reference6). However, differences in individuals' capacity to metabolize glucosinolates have not been linked to differences in gut [microbiota](../../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) composition [(8)](#reference8). Many isothiocyanates, particularly sulforaphane, have been shown to induce the expression of [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway [(9, 10)](#reference9). Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../../glossary#cytosol) (Figure 3). Keap1 responds to [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals or chemical inducers by freeing Nrf2. Isothiocyanates can react with sulfhydryl residues of Keap1, causing the release of Nrf2. Nrf2 can then translocate to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and bind to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoters](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes and scavengers. Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code for several mediators administered [ip](../../glossary#intraperitoneal-injection), [iv](../../glossary#intravenous), or [sc](../../glossary#subcutaneous), rather than [po](../../glossary#oral-administration)) was shown to exert protective effects on many tissues and organs by activating the Nrf2/ARE-dependent pathway [(12)](#reference12). For example, sulforaphane reduced contrast agent-induced kidney damage in rats by increasing Nrf2 nuclear translocation and upregulating the expression of HO-1 damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage)-induced vascular endothelial cell injury mouse model of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(14)](#reference14). In a rat model of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury \u2014 whereby cellular damage is caused by the restoration of oxygen delivery to a hypoxic liver \u2014 pre-treatment with sulforaphane limited the reduction HO-1, and decreased ischemic death and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) of liver cells [(15)](#reference15). Human studies are limited. In a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, oral sulforaphane (in the form of broccoli sprout homogenate) increased the expression of NQO-1 and HO-1 in the upper airway within two hours of ingestion [(16)](#reference16). Yet, in a recent trial in patients with [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](../../glossary#chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease) (COPD), oral administration of sulforaphane for four weeks failed to induce the expression of Nrf2, NQO-1, and HO-1 in alveolar macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells [(17)](#reference17). The therapeutic potential of sulforaphane has also been linked to its capacity to target pro- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) pathways. Sulforaphane was found to attenuate [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) injury in a mouse model of acute pancreatitis by stimulating Nrf2-induced [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [(18)](#reference18). Concomitantly, nuclear factor of NF-B target [genes](../../glossary#gene) that code for mediators, (TNF-), interleukin-1 (Figure 3) [(18)](#reference18). the NF-B pathway, sulforaphane also targets other mediators of the inflammatory response, including the enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Sulforaphane in the lungs of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by downregulating the expression of NF-B, IL-6, TNF- and COX-2, as well as decreasing [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) and PGE2 [(19)](#reference19). Other isothiocyanates have been shown to prevent the degradation of the NF-B inhibitor, IB, the nuclear translocation activity of NF-B [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) or in cultured cells (Figure 3) [(20)](#reference20), which all can lead to a decrease in inflammatory responses. The modulation of Nrf2 and NF-B [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways by isothiocyanates is especially relevant to the prevention of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) because both [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) are significant contributors in the development and progression of cancer. [Biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) play important roles in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination of a variety of chemicals, including drugs, toxins, and [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen). In general, phase I metabolizing enzymes [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) reactions that increase the reactivity of [hydrophobic](../../glossary#hydrophobic) (fat-soluble) compounds, preparing them for reactions catalyzed by phase II biotransformation enzymes. Reactions catalyzed by phase II enzymes generally increase water solubility and promote the elimination of the compound from the body [(21)](#reference21). Isothiocyanates have been found to modulate the activity of phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), especially those of the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family. Using a primary rat hepatocyte-based model, (e.g., sulforaphane, AITC) and aromatic (e.g., BITC, PEITC) have been found to downregulate CYP3A2 [mRNA](../../glossary#mRNA) expression, as well as the activity of benzyloxyquinoline debenzylase, a marker of CYP3As [(22)](#reference22). Aromatic able to upregulate CYP1A1 CYP1A2 mRNA expression and the activity of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), a marker of CYP1A1/2 activities [(22)](#reference22). In this model, sulforaphane inhibited EROD activity, yet failed to affect CYP1A1/2 mRNA expression [(22)](#reference22). Using human liver microsomes, it was also recently reported that sulforaphane [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (0-200 M) had little-to-no effect CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 [(23)](#reference23). The ability of PEITC to alter the expression and activity of CYP enzymes has been generally associated with a protective effect against (pro)carcinogen-induced tumor development in animal experiments (reviewed in [24](#reference24)). Increasing the activity of biotransformation enzymes may be beneficial if the elimination of potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) or toxins is enhanced. Yet, some [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen) require phase I enzymes in order to become active carcinogens capable of binding [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and forming cancer-causing DNA adducts. Inhibition of specific CYP enzymes involved in carcinogen activation has been found to prevent the development of cancer in animal models [(3)](#reference3). Many isothiocyanates are potent inducers and [reactive oxygen species](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) [(25)](#reference25). The [genes](../../glossary#gene) for these and other phase II enzymes contain AREs and are therefore under the control of Nrf2 (see [Antioxidant activity](#antioxidant-activity)). Limited data from [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) suggest that glucosinolate-rich foods can increase phase II enzyme activity in humans. When smokers consumed 170 g/day of watercress, increased [(26)](#reference26). Brussels sprouts are rich in a number of glucosinolates, including [precursors](../../glossary#precursor) of AITC and sulforaphane. Consumption of 300 g/day (11 oz/day) of Brussels sprouts for one week significantly increased plasma and intestinal GST concentrations in nonsmoking men [(27, 28)](#reference27). After a cell divides, it passes through a sequence of stages \u2014 collectively known as the cell cycle \u2014 before dividing again. Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested to allow for DNA repair or activation of pathways leading to programmed cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) when the damage cannot be repaired [(29)](#reference29). Defective cell cycle regulation and pro-survival mechanisms may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer). Isothiocyanates have been found to modulate the expression of the cell cycle regulators, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), as well as trigger apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines [(20)](#reference20). In a mouse model of colorectal cancer, oral administration of PEITC reduced both the number and size of polyps; these changes were associated with activation of the CDK inhibitor, p21, inhibition of various of apoptosis [(30)](#reference30). In a transgenic [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) adenocarcinoma BITC limited the progress of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to a well-differentiated carcinoma [(31)](#reference31). This was related to a decreased expression of Ki67 (a marker of cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation)) and a downregulation of cyclin A, cyclin D1, and CDK2, which regulate cell cycle progression [(31)](#reference31). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a process of epithelial cell transformation whereby cells lose their polarity and adhesion properties while gaining migratory and invasive properties through the expression of mesenchymal [genes](../../glossary#gene). Inhibition of the EMT by sulforaphane in [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells has been associated with upregulation of an epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and downregulation of a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) (SNAI2), various [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) (matrix metalloprotein [MMP]-2 and MMP-9) known to contribute to EMT and promote migration [(32)](#reference32). In a [xenograft](../../glossary#xenograft) mouse model of breast cancer, BITC inhibited high fat diet-driven promotion of breast tumor growth, as well as lung and liver [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasis) [(33)](#reference33). This study suggested that BITC might prevent the infiltration of [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage) in the tumor environment [(33)](#reference33). In another model of breast tumor metastasis, PEITC inhibited the migration of tumor cells to the brain after injection into the heart of mice, limiting the growth of metastatic brain tumors [(34)](#reference34). To fuel their rapid growth, invasive tumors must also develop new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels by a process known as [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis). Isothiocyanates have been shown to prevent the formation of capillary-like structures from human umbilical endothelial cells (reviewed in [35](#reference35)). Isothiocyanates likely inhibit the expression and function of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) that control angiogenesis, as reported in endothelial cells and malignant cell lines [(35)](#reference35). In the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) of a cell, [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) is coiled around [proteins](../../glossary#protein) called [histones](../../glossary#histone), thereby forming the [chromatin](../../glossary#chromatin). The N-terminal tails of histones are targets for poly ADP ribosylation, patterns have differential effects on chromatin structure, and, in synergy with DNA methylation, are implicated in the regulating expression of the [genome](../../glossary#genome) [(36)](#reference36). Within [gene](../../glossary#gene) regulatory regions, the acetylation of lysine residues of histone tails has been correlated with activation of [transcription](../../glossary#transcription). Conversely, the deacetylation of histone deacetylases (HDAC) access of [transcription factors](../../glossary#transcription-factor) to the DNA and suppresses transcription. Because abnormal epigenetic marks disrupt the expression of specific tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells, compounds that re-induce their transcription, like those inhibiting HDACs, can potentially promote [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation) and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) in transformed (precancerous) cells [(37)](#reference37). Isothiocyanates have been found to inhibit HDAC expression and/or activity in cultured cancer cells [(38-43)](#reference38). Moreover, [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) evidence for HDAC inhibition by sulforaphane from a mouse model using [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer [xenografts](../../glossary#xenograft) [(44)](#reference44). In humans, HDAC activity was reduced in blood cells following ingestion of 68 g (one cup) of sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprouts [(44)](#reference44). Isothiocyanates may also affect [microRNA](../../glossary#microRNA)-mediated In bladder cancer cells, E-cadherin induction by sulforaphane was partly due to the upregulation of miR-200c expression resulting in the miR-200c-dependent inhibited androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells by repressing miR-141 expression and miR-141-mediated downregulation of small [heterodimer](../../glossary#heterodimer) partner (shp), repressor of AR [(46)](#reference46). Bacterial infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with a marked increase in the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [peptic ulcer disease](../../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease) and [gastric](../../glossary#gastric) cancer [(47)](#reference47). In the test tube and in tissue culture, purified sulforaphane inhibited the growth and killed multiple strains of H. pylori, including antibiotic resistant strains [(48)](#reference48). In an animal model of H. pylori infection, sulforaphane administration for five days eradicated H. pylori from 8 out of 11 [xenografts](../../glossary#xenograft) of human gastric tissue implanted in immune-compromised mice [(49)](#reference49). In another H. pylori-infected mouse model, a functional Nrf2 pathway was found to be required for the reduction of gastric [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) and infection in mice fed broccoli sprouts [(50)](#reference50). In a small [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial), consumption 56 g/day (2 oz/day) of glucoraphanin-rich broccoli sprouts for one week was associated with H. pylori eradication in only three out of nine gastritis patients [(51)](#reference51). In another trial, daily consumption of 70 g/day (~2-3 servings/day) of glucoraphanin-rich broccoli sprouts for two months significantly reduced markers of inflammation and infection in H. pylori-infected volunteers compared to those who consumed alfalfa sprouts [(50)](#reference50). However, the extent to which glucoraphanin was converted to sulforaphane in broccoli sprout-fed participants was not measured. Isothiocyanates are thought to play a prominent role in the potential anticancer and [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits associated with [cruciferous vegetable](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) consumption [(52, 53)](#reference52). Genetic variations in the sequence of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for GSTs may affect the activity of GSTs. Such variations have been identified in humans. Specifically, null variants of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 [alleles](../../glossary#allele) contain large deletions, and individuals who inherit two copies of the GSTM1-null or GSTT1-null alleles cannot produce the corresponding GST [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [(54)](#reference54). It has been proposed that a reduced GST activity in these individuals would slow the rate of [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of isothiocyanates, thereby increasing tissue exposure to isothiocyanates after cruciferous vegetable consumption [(55)](#reference55). In addition, GSTs are involved in \"detoxifying\" potentially harmful substances like [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen), suggesting that individuals with reduced GST activity might also be more susceptible to [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(56-58)](#reference56). Further, induction of the expression and activity of GSTs and other phase II detoxification/ [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) enzymes by isothiocyanates is an important defense mechanism against [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) associated with the development of diseases like cancer and [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(11)](#reference11). The ability of glucoraphanin-derived sulforaphane to reduce oxidative stress in different settings is linked to activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Yet, whether potential protection conferred by isothiocyanates via the Nrf2-dependent pathway is diminished in individuals carrying GST null variants is currently unknown. Some, but not all, [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have suggested that GST [genotypes](../../glossary#genotype) could influence the associations between cruciferous vegetable consumption and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of disease [(59)](#reference59). Naturally occurring isothiocyanates and their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) have been found to inhibit the development of chemically-induced cancers of the lung, liver, [esophagus](../../glossary#esophagus), stomach, [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine), [colon](../../glossary#colon), and breast in a variety of animal models [(20)](#reference20). Although observational studies provide some evidence that higher intakes of cruciferous vegetables are associated with decreased cancer risk in humans [(59)](#reference59), it is difficult to determine whether such protective effects are related to isothiocyanates or other factors associated with cruciferous vegetable consumption (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#cancer-prevention)). Clinical evidence of a protective effect of isothiocyanates in humans is scarce. For example, in a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [cross-over intervention](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), administration of PEITC (40 mg/day for five days) caused a modest, yet significant, 7.7% reduction in the metabolic activation of the tobacco-specific lung carcinogen, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, in cigarette smokers [(60)](#reference60). Another [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in men with biochemically relapsing cancer after radical prostatectomy suggested that [prostate-specific antigen](../../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) values tended to increase less in those given daily oral sulforaphane (4.4 or 26.6 mg/day) for six months compared to those receiving the [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(61)](#reference61). In a recent [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), randomized, placebo-controlled trial in women with abnormal mammograms, two-to-eight week consumption of about 250 mg/day of broccoli seed extract (~220 mg of glucoraphanin/day) before surgery failed to affect the expression of markers of [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and gene expression, including ki-67, p21, HDACs, and acetylated in breast tissues collected surgery [(62)](#reference62). [Cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables), such as bok choi, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, sources of isothiocyanates [(63)](#reference63). Unlike some other phytochemicals, glucosinolates are present in relatively high concentrations in commonly consumed portions of cruciferous vegetables. For example one-half cup of raw broccoli might provide more than 25 mg of total glucosinolates. The glucosinolate content of selected cruciferous vegetables is presented in Table 1 [(64)](#reference64). Note that while the composition and content of glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables are relatively stable, they depend on the genus and species and can vary greatly with plant growing and post-harvest storage conditions, as well as culinary processing. |Food (raw)||Serving||Total Glucosinolates g)|| | 98 |Mustard greens||\u00bd cup, chopped (28 g)|| | 79 |Turnip||\u00bd cup, cubes (65 g)|| | 60 |Cabbage, savoy||\u00bd cup, chopped (45 g)|| | 35 |Kale||1 cup, chopped (67 g)|| | 67 |Watercress||1 cup, chopped (34 g)|| | 32 |Kohlrabi||\u00bd cup, chopped (67 g)|| | 31 |Cabbage, red||\u00bd cup, chopped (45 g)|| | 29 |Broccoli||\u00bd cup, chopped (44 g)|| | 27 |Horseradish||1 tablespoon (15 g)|| | 24 |Cauliflower||\u00bd cup, chopped (50 g)|| | 22 |Bok choy (pak choi)||\u00bd cup, chopped (35 g)|| | 19 Table 2 lists vegetables that are relatively good sources of some of the isothiocyanates that are currently being studied for their isothiocyanates formed from glucosinolates in foods are variable and depend partly on food processing and preparation (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables)). In a recent study that examined total isothiocyanate content in 73 samples from nine types of raw cruciferous vegetables commonly consumed in the US (namely broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprout, kale, collard green, mustard green, and turnip greens), an average yield of 16.2 \u00b5mol/100 g wet weight was reported, with a 41-fold difference of isothiocyanate yield across the vegetables. The lowest mean level of isothiocyanate yield was found with raw cauliflower (1.5 \u00b5mol/100 g), while raw mustard greens had the highest yield (61.3 \u00b5mol/100g) [(66)](#reference66). The amount of glucoraphanin, the [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) of sulforaphane, in broccoli seeds remains more or less constant as those seeds germinate and grow into mature plants. Thus, three-day old broccoli sprouts are concentrated sources of glucoraphanin, which contain 10 to 100 times more glucoraphanin by weight than mature broccoli plants [(67)](#reference67). Broccoli sprouts that are certified to contain at least 73 mg of glucoraphanin (also called sulforaphane glucosinolate) per 1-oz serving are available in some health food and grocery stores. Dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing extracts of broccoli sprouts, broccoli, and other cruciferous vegetables are available without a prescription. Some products are standardized to contain a minimum amount of glucosinolates and/or sulforaphane. However, the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of isothiocyanates was found to be much lower with the consumption of broccoli supplements devoid of myrosinase than with the consumption of fresh broccoli sprouts. Peak concentrations of sulforaphane [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) were found to be eight- and five-times greater in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and urine, respectively, following fresh broccoli versus supplement consumption [(68)](#reference68). Interestingly, total HDAC activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of broccoli sprout consumers was reported to be significantly lower than in PBMC of subjects who consumed the supplement (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)) [(69)](#reference69). No serious adverse effects of isothiocyanates in humans have been reported. The majority of animal studies have found that isothiocyanates inhibited the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) when given prior to the chemical [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen) (pre-initiation). However, very high intakes of PEITC or BITC (25 to 250 times higher than average human dietary isothiocyanate intakes) have been found to promote bladder cancer in rats when given after cancer initiation by a chemical carcinogen [(70)](#reference70). The relevance of these findings to human urinary bladder cancer is not clear, since at least one [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found cruciferous vegetable consumption to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of bladder cancer in men [(71)](#reference71). Other potential toxic effects reported in rodents have not been corroborated by observations in humans [(20)](#reference20). Although high dietary intakes of glucosinolates from cruciferous vegetables are not known to have adverse effects during pregnancy or lactation, there is no information on the safety of purified isothiocyanates or [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing high doses of glucosinolates and/or isothiocyanates during pregnancy or lactation in humans. Isothiocyanates are not known to interact with any drugs or medications. However, the potential for isothiocyanates to inhibit various isoforms of the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family of [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) raises the potential for interactions with drugs that are CYP substrates (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Isothiocyanates may sensitize [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells to anticancer drugs and/or increase drug cytotoxicity, as shown in [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) and animal models. Yet, these potential benefits of isothiocyanates in cancer therapy have not been explored in clinical trials [(72)](#reference72).

Expert Opin The enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone (Figure 1), are formed by the action of intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) on lignan [precursors](../../glossary#precursor) found in plants [(1)](#references). Because enterodiol and enterolactone can mimic some of the effects of [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen), their plant-derived precursors are classified as [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogens). Lignan precursors that have been identified in the human diet include pinoresinol, lariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and others (Figure 2). Secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were among the first lignan precursors identified in the human diet and are therefore the most extensively studied. Lignan precursors are found in a wide variety of foods, including flaxseeds, sesame seeds, [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains), fruit, and vegetables. While most research on phytoestrogen-rich diets has focused on [soy isoflavones](../phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones), lignans are the principal source of dietary phytoestrogens in the typical Western diet [(2, 3)](#reference2). When plant lignans are ingested, they can be by intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) to the enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, in the intestinal [lumen](../../glossary#lumen) and then absorbed into the bloodstream [(4)](#reference4). Enterodiol can also be converted to enterolactone by intestinal bacteria. Thus, enterolactone levels measured in blood and urine reflect the activity of intestinal bacteria in addition to dietary intake of plant lignans. Not surprisingly, antibiotic use has been associated with lower [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentrations [(5)](#reference5). Because data on the lignan content of foods are limited, blood and urinary enterolactone levels are sometimes used as markers of dietary lignan intake. A [pharmacokinetic](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) study that measured [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and urinary levels of enterodiol and enterolactone after a single dose (0.9 mg/kg of body weight) of secoisolariciresinol, the principal lignan in flaxseed, found that at least 40% was available to the body as enterodiol and enterolactone [(6)](#reference6). Plasma enterodiol concentrations peaked at 73 nanomoles/liter (nmol/L) an average of 15 hours after ingestion of secoisolariciresinol, and plasma enterolactone concentrations peaked at 56 nmol/L an average of 20 hours after ingestion. Thus, substantial amounts of ingested plant lignans are available to humans in the form of enterodiol and enterolactone. Considerable variation among individuals in urinary and serum enterodiol:enterolactone ratios has been observed in flaxseed feeding studies, suggesting that some individuals convert most enterodiol to enterolactone, while others convert relatively little [(1)](#references). Individual differences in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of lignans, likely due to differing composition and activities of gut microbes, can influence the biological activities and health effects of these compounds [(7)](#reference7). Several other factors, including antibiotic use, age, [BMI](../../glossary#body-mass-index), and smoking, may also help explain the variation of circulating enterolignan concentrations among individuals [(7)](#reference7); these and other potential [confounding factors](../../glossary#confounder) should be controlled for in [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study). [Estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) are [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules (i.e., [hormones](../../glossary#hormone)) that exert their effects by binding to estrogen [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) within cells (Figure 3). The estrogen-receptor complex interacts [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) to change the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of estrogen-responsive [genes](../../glossary#gene). Estrogen receptors are present in numerous tissues other than those associated with reproduction, including bone, liver, heart, and brain [(8)](#reference8). Although [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) can also bind to estrogen receptors, their estrogenic activity is much weaker than [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens, and they may actually block or antagonize the effects of estrogen in some tissues [(9)](#reference9). Scientists are interested in the tissue-selective activities of phytoestrogens because anti-estrogenic effects in reproductive tissue could help reduce the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hormone-associated [cancers](../../glossary#cancer) (breast, uterine, ovarian, and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancers), while estrogenic effects in bone could help maintain [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density). The enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, are known to have weak estrogenic activity. At present, the extent to which enterolignans exert weak estrogenic and/or anti-estrogenic effects in humans is not well understood. Enterolignans have biological activities that are unrelated to their interactions with [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptors](../../glossary#receptor). By altering the activity of [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) involved in estrogen [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism), lignans may change the biological activity of [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens [(10)](#reference10). Lignans have also been shown to display [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity in laboratory studies [(11)](#reference11), although the significance in humans is not entirely clear since lignans are rapidly and extensively metabolized. For example, a [cross-sectional study](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) found that a with [serum](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#serum) enterolactone concentrations in men [(12)](#reference12), but this association could be due to enterolactone and/or other antioxidants present in lignan-rich foods. Moreover, enterolignans may have anti-inflammatory properties, as well as anti-proliferative and anticancer activities that are independent of estrogen signaling [(13-15)](#reference13). Diets in foods and seeds, [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), and [fruit vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables)) have been consistently associated with reductions in [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardioavascular-disease). However, it is likely that numerous nutrients and [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) found in these foods contribute to their cardioprotection. Higher dietary intakes of two lignans, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, were not linked to total cardiovascular disease in 16,162 middle-aged and older women participating in the Dutch PROSPECT European Prospective study Into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study [(16)](#reference16). A large [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted within Spain's PREDIMED trial \u2014 a trial evaluating the effects of a Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes \u2014 followed 7,172 older adults at high risk of cardiovascular disease for a mean of 4.3 years [(17)](#reference17). In this study, the highest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of dietary lignan intake (mean intake, 0.94 mg/day), measured by a [food frequency questionnaire](../../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) at baseline, was associated with a 49% lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease compared to the lowest quintile (mean intake, 0.44 mg/day of lignans). The primary dietary source of lignans in this cohort was virgin olive oil [(17)](#reference17), which itself is known to be cardioprotective. In a prospective, [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) in 334 middle-aged Finnish men, followed for an average of 7.7 years, higher [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentrations (a marker of plant lignan intake) were associated with a lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of acute [coronary](../../glossary#coronary-artery) events [(18)](#reference18). A [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 1,889 Finnish men followed for an average of 12 years, found those with the highest serum enterolactone concentrations were significantly less likely to die from [coronary heart disease](../../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) or [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardioavascular-disease) than those with the lowest concentrations [(19)](#reference19). However, a study in male smokers did not find strong support for an association between serum enterolactone concentration and CHD [(20)](#reference20). Additionally, a nested case-control study in men and women residing in the Netherlands did not find association between [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of enterolactone or enterodiol and nonfatal [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (236 cases and 283 controls), although the study population was young (ages 20-59 at baseline) and followed for only a mean of 4.5 years [(21)](#reference21). A 2017 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of three of these studies found no association between blood enterolactone concentration and non-fatal myocardial infarction [(22)](#reference22). Moreover, dietary lignan intake was not linked to coronary cardiovascular disease in women participating in the Dutch PROSPECT EPIC study [(16)](#reference16). Clinical trials of lignan [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) would be needed to determine the effects of lignans on coronary heart disease. Blood lipids. Flaxseeds are among the richest sources of plant lignans in the human diet, but they are also good sources of other nutrients and [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical) with cardioprotective effects, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](../../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids) (i.e., -linolenic acid) and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber). [Supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) trials have generally used ground or milled flaxseed (i.e., flax meal), which has a higher [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of enterolignans compared to whole flaxseed [(23)](#reference23). Five small [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that adding 30 to 50 g/day of flaxseed to the usual diet for 4 to 12 weeks resulted in modest 8%-20% decreases in low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentration [(24-28)](#reference24), but four other trials did not observe significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol after adding 30 to 40 g/day of flaxseed to the diet [(29-32)](#reference29). A [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) controlled trial in adults, ages 44 to 75 years, found that supplementation with 40 g/day of flaxseed led to significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol after five weeks, but the cholesterol reductions were not statistically significant following 10 weeks' supplementation [(33)](#reference33). Additionally, a one-year clinical trial in postmenopausal women reported that supplementation with 40 g/day of flaxseed did not lower LDL-cholesterol compared to a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) containing wheat germ [(34)](#reference34). Most of these trials were in healthy participants free of cardiovascular disease. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 84 patients with peripheral artery disease, 30 g/day of flaxseed for 12 months did not reduce total or LDL-cholesterol compared to placebo, although cholesterol reductions within the flaxseed-supplemented group were evident at 1 month and 6 months compared to baseline but not at 12 months [(35)](#reference35). Any effect of flaxseed supplementation on blood lipids might be attributed to flaxseed constituents other than lignans (i.e., protein, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, phytochemicals). At least two trials have investigated the effect of supplementation with isolated flaxseed lignan. In mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside \u2014 derived from flaxseed \u2014 had no effect on LDL-cholesterol concentration or other measured blood lipids despite significant increases in [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentration [(36)](#reference36). Additionally, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial in 68 patients with type 2 diabetes and mild hypercholesterolemia found no effect of 360 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside for 12 weeks on concentration of blood cholesterol or other blood lipids [(37)](#reference37). Large-scale supplementation trials with isolated lignans would be needed to determine whether lignans have cholesterol-lowering effects. Blood pressure. A 2016 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) pooled the results of 15 [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) controlled trials, some in healthy participants and some in participants with chronic disease (i.e., type 2 [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [metabolic syndrome](../../glossary#metabolic-syndrome), [peripheral arterial with flaxseed was linked to a 2.9 [mm Hg](../../glossary#mm-Hg) reduction in [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and a 2.4 mm Hg reduction in [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure); these blood pressure reductions were greater in trials of longer duration (12 weeks vs. <12 weeks; [38](#reference38)). Additionally, data stratification by supplement type revealed a benefit of supplemental flaxseed powder but not of lignan extracts containing 360 to 600 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside [(38)](#reference38), suggesting the non-lignan constituents of flaxseed may be responsible for any blood pressure-lowering effects. Overall, there is limited evidence that dietary intake of plant lignans is associated with breast cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk); studies on the association have reported conflicting results. Two [prospective cohort studies](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#prospective%20study) examining plant lignan intake and breast cancer found no association [(39, 40)](#reference39). A more recent prospective study reported no association between total lignan intake and breast cancer in premenopausal women [(41)](#reference41). In another prospective analysis, the same group of authors found postmenopausal women in the highest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of dietary lignan intake had a 17% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women in the lowest quartile, but this protective association was only observed in women with [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen)-positive and progesterone-positive tumors [(42)](#reference42). A prospective cohort study of 51,823 postmenopausal Swedish women, followed for an average of 8.3 years, found that women in the highest quartile of lignan intake (1,036 mg/day) had a 17% lower risk of invasive breast tumors compared to those in the lowest quartile (lignan intake <712 mg/day) [(43)](#reference43). In this study, a strong inverse association of lignan intake and breast cancer risk was observed in women who had used postmenopausal hormones at some point in their life, but no association was evident in those who had never used such hormones [(43)](#reference43). A 2009 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) did not find an overall association between dietary lignan intake and breast cancer, but when the analysis was limited to postmenopausal women, the authors reported a 15% reduction in risk of breast cancer with high lignan intake [(44)](#reference44). A similar result was found in a subsequent meta-analysis that included 11 prospective cohort and 10 [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study): no association of lignan intake and breast cancer was observed in women overall, but data stratification by menopausal status revealed that the highest lignan intakes were associated with a 14% lower risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women (13 studies; [45](#reference45)). Several studies, mainly case-control studies, have examined the relationship between blood or urine concentrations of enterolactone and breast cancer, reporting conflicting results [(46-48)](#reference46). Two meta-analyses did not find an association between blood concentrations of enterolactone and breast cancer [(44, 45)](#reference44). At present, it is not clear whether high intakes of plant lignans or high circulating levels of enterolignans offer significant protection against breast cancer. [Randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of lignan [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) would be needed to address this question. Overall, there is limited evidence that dietary lignan intake or circulating enterolignan concentration (a marker of lignan intake) is associated with [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) or ovarian cancer. In a [case-control study](../../glossary#case-control-study) of lignans and endometrial cancer, US women with the highest intakes of plant lignans had the lowest [risk](../../glossary#risk) of endometrial cancer, but the reduction in risk was statistically significant in postmenopausal women only [(49)](#reference49). However, two population-based, case-control studies, one conducted in the US [(50)](#reference50) and one in Australia [(51)](#reference51), found dietary lignan intake was not linked to endometrial cancer. Moreover, a prospective case-control study in three different countries (US, Sweden, and Italy) did not find an association between circulating enterolactone and endometrial cancer in premenopausal or in postmenopausal women [(52)](#reference52). A large case-cohort study among Danish women, ages 50-64 years, also reported no association of [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) enterolactone concentration and endometrial cancer [(53)](#reference53). In an early case-control study among US women ages 40 to 85 years, those with the highest combined intakes of the lignans, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol, had the lowest risk of ovarian cancer \u2014 intakes greater than 708 mg/day of these lignans were associated with a 57% lower risk of ovarian cancer compared with intakes less than 304 mg/day [(54)](#reference54). A case-control study in Australia reported no association of total dietary lignans and risk of ovarian cancer but found a significant, inverse association of matairesinol and lariciresinol, individually, with ovarian cancer [(51)](#reference51). However, two other studies, a population-based case-control study in the US [(55)](#reference55) and a [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in Sweden [(56)](#reference56) found no relationship between dietary lignan intake and ovarian cancer. Although some of these studies support the [hypothesis](../../glossary#hypothesis) that diets rich in plant foods may be helpful in decreasing the risk of hormone-associated cancers, they do not provide strong evidence that lignans in particular are protective against endometrial or ovarian cancer. Several [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have examined the association between dietary lignan intake or circulating enterolignan concentration (a marker of lignan intake) and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), with most reporting no association. A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of three studies (two population-based, [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) and one [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study)) found was not linked to prostate cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) [(57)](#reference57). Moreover, a meta-analysis of nested case-control studies did not find circulating concentration of enterolactone (total of 2,828 cases and 5,593 controls pooled from five studies) or enterodiol (total of 1,002 cases and 1,197 controls pooled from two studies) to be associated with prostate cancer [(58)](#reference58). Yet another meta-analysis found no association between dietary lignan intake (total lignans, or matairesinol or secoisolariciresinol, separately) or circulating enterolactone concentration and prostate cancer risk [(59)](#reference59). While adherence to a plant-based diet may be linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer [(60)](#reference60), evidence that dietary lignans are protective is lacking. Research on the effects of dietary lignan intake on [osteoporosis](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#osteoporosis) [risk](../../glossary#risk) is very limited. In a [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 2,580 postmenopausal women and 4,973 men enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study, dietary intake of matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol was not associated with bone density, when assessed by ultrasound of the heel bone [(61)](#reference61). In two much smaller [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study), urinary enterolactone [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) was used as a marker of dietary lignan intake. One study of 75 postmenopausal Korean women, who were classified as osteoporotic, [osteopenic](../../glossary#osteopenia), or normal on the basis of [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) measurements, found that urinary enterolactone positively with BMD of the [lumbar spine](../../glossary#lumbar-spine) and hip [(62)](#reference62). However, a study of 50 postmenopausal Dutch women found that higher levels of urinary enterolactone excretion were associated with higher rates of bone loss [(63)](#reference63). In two separate [placebo](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#placebo) controlled trials, [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) of postmenopausal women with 25 to 40 g/day of ground flaxseed for three to four months did not significantly alter biochemical markers of bone formation or bone [resorption](../../glossary#resorption) (loss) [(31](#reference31), [64)](#reference64). In a placebo-controlled trial that included a daily walking intervention in both groups of older adults, supplementation with a flaxseed lignan complex (containing 543 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol) for six months had no effect on bone mineral density measured by [DXA](../../glossary#DXA) [(65)](#reference65). More research is necessary to determine whether high dietary intakes of plant lignans can decrease the risk or severity of osteoporosis. More than 10% of the US population has type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and another 35% has [impaired glucose control](../../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) (prediabetes) that places them at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes [(66)](#reference66). A number of dietary [polyphenols](../../glossary#polyphenolic-compound) found in plant-based foods may affect [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and thus aid in the prevention or management of the condition. A few [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have examined the association of lignan intake and incidence of diabetes. A [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 6,547 Iranian adults, followed for a mean of 3.0 years, reported an [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between dietary lignan intake (measured by [food frequency questionnaire](../../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) and incidence of type 2 diabetes [(67)](#reference67). In particular, this study found the highest versus lowest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of lignan intake (median of 9.1 mg/day vs. 1.6 mg/day) to be associated with a 40% lower risk of type 2 diabetes [(67)](#reference67). However, no association between lignan intake (highest vs. lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of intake, median of 2.3 mg/day vs. 0.6 mg/day) and type 2 diabetes was reported in a prospective, case-cohort study conducted in Europe that included more than 15,000 adults (EPIC-InterAct; [68](#reference68)). Studies that utilize [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of lignan intake, such as urinary concentrations of enterodiol or enterolactone, provide a more accurate estimate of lignan intake compared to self-reported questionnaires [(69)](#reference69). A prospective, [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) of two cohorts of US women participating in the Nurses' Health Study (NHSI with mean age of 66 years and NHSII with mean age of 45 years) found lower concentrations of enterodiol and enterolactone in diabetic case subjects than in controls [(70)](#reference70). Upon adjustment for potential [confounders](../../glossary#confounder), only higher concentrations of urinary enterolactone were associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and this was driven by a significant association in the younger cohort of women [(70)](#reference70). A nested case-control study within men and women participating in the Singapore Chinese Health Study (mean age, 59.8 years) reported no association between urinary enterodiol or enterolactone and type 2 diabetes [(71)](#reference71). Because higher lignan intakes may be a marker of a healthy diet in general, randomized controlled trials of lignan [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) in healthy individuals would inform whether lignans affect glucose homeostasis and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hypercholesterolemic individuals found that lignan extract containing 600 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside decreased fasting glucose concentrations compared to placebo, and the effect was stronger in those with higher baseline glucose concentrations [(72)](#reference72). Supplementation with an extract containing 300 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside had no effect on fasting glucose concentrations [(72)](#reference72). A few studies have examined whether dietary lignan intake is related to all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) investigated the relationship between lignan intake and all-cause mortality in 40,622 adults (ages 29-70 years) [(73)](#reference73). After a mean follow-up of 13.6 years, dietary lignan intake was not associated with all-cause mortality [(73)](#reference73). Additionally, dietary lignan intake was not linked to all-cause mortality in a much smaller study that followed 570 older Dutch men for 15 years [(74)](#reference74). In this study, an inverse association was observed for intake of a specific lignan, matairesinol, with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality, including death from coronary heart disease, although wine consumption modified these associations [(74)](#reference74). However, an analysis of a 4.8-year trial that investigated the health effects of a Mediterranean diet in 7,172 older adults at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for cardiovascular disease (the PREDIMED trial in Spain) revealed that those in the highest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of lignan intake (mean of 0.94 mg/day) had a 40% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to the lowest quintile (mean of 0.44 mg/day of lignans; [75](#reference75)). A found no association of lignan intake with all-cause mortality (3 studies mentioned above) or with mortality related to cardiovascular disease (2 studies; [76](#reference76)). Other studies have assessed whether blood or urinary [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of lignan intake are associated with mortality. In a prospective cohort study of 1,889 healthy, middle-aged Finnish men, followed for a mean of 12.2 years, the highest quartile of [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentration was associated with a 56% lower risk of [coronary heart disease](../../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease)-related mortality and a 45% lower risk of cardiovascular disease-related mortality; no association of serum enterlactone and all-cause mortality was found in this study [(19)](#reference19). However, serum enterolactone was not associated with coronary death in a case-cohort study in Finnish male smokers [(20)](#reference20). In a national cross-sectional survey of US adults (NHANES 1999-2004), those in the highest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of urinary total enterolignan concentration had a lower risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality, and those with the highest urinary enterolactone concentrations had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality [(77)](#reference77). These measures were not associated with mortality from cancer in this analysis, and urinary enterodiol concentration was not related to any of the mortality endpoints [(77)](#reference77). A 2017 meta-analysis that combined results of these studies of lignan biomarkers found that enterolactone was inversely associated with both cardiovascular disease-related mortality and all-cause mortality [(22)](#reference22). Most recently, a case-cohort study within the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort found that higher pre-diagnostic [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of enterolactone were linked to a lower risk of all-cause and diabetes-specific mortality among adults with type 2 diabetes [(78)](#reference78). Lignans are present in a wide variety of plant foods, including seeds (flax, pumpkin, sunflower, poppy, sesame), [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains) (rye, oats, barley), bran (wheat, oat, rye), beans, fruit (particularly berries), vegetables, and beverages like tea, coffee, and wine [(47](#reference47), [79, 80)](#reference79). Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, total dietary lignan intakes, although this varies with dietary pattern [(80)](#reference80). Flaxseed is by far the richest dietary source of plant lignans [(81)](#reference81), and lignan [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) can be improved by crushing or milling flaxseed [(23)](#reference23). Lignans are not associated with the oil fraction of foods, so flaxseed oils do not typically provide lignans unless ground flaxseed has been added to the oil. A variety of factors may affect the lignan content of plants, including geographic location, climate, maturity, and storage conditions. Table 1 provides the total lignan (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, and lariciresinol) content [(82)](#reference82). The [Phenol-Explorer (version 3.6) database](http://phenol-explorer.eu/) lists content of 25 different lignans in various foods. Surveys have found median total lignan intake to be 0.98 mg/day in the 0.76 mg/day in [(85)](#reference85). Plant lignans are the principal source of [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) in the diets of people who do not typically consume soy foods. The daily phytoestrogen intake of postmenopausal women in the US was estimated to be less than 1 mg/day, with 80% chopped|| |Apricots||\u00bd cup, | cup, chopped|| |Strawberries||\u00bd | (4 oz)|| | 0.2 rye bread||1 slice|| | 0.1 Dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing lignans derived from flaxseed are available in the US without a prescription [(87)](#reference87); secoisolariciresinol is the primary lignan in such supplements [(82)](#reference82). Lignan [precursors](../../glossary#precursor) in food are not known to have any serious adverse effects. Flaxseeds, which are rich in lignan precursors as well as [dietary fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber), may increase stool frequency or cause diarrhea in doses of 45 to 50 g/day in adults [(24](#reference24), [88)](#reference88). One small, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study found that 50 mg/day of sesame lignans (1:1 mixture of sesamin and episesamin) for 28 days did not result in any serious adverse effects, although abdominal flatulence was associated with the sesame lignan supplementation [(89)](#reference89). The safety of lignan [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in pregnant or lactating women has not been established; therefore, lignan supplements should be avoided by women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or trying to conceive.

In addition to being rich in [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber) and plant [protein](../../glossary#protein), the diets of our ancestors were also rich in phytosterols \u2014 plant-derived compounds that are structurally very similar to [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) (Figure 1). There is increasing evidence to suggest that the reintroduction of plant foods providing phytosterols into the modern diet could improve [serum](../../glossary#serum) [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) (cholesterol) profiles and help reduce the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(1)](#references). Cholesterol in human blood and tissues is derived from the diet, as well as from [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) cholesterol [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis). In contrast, all phytosterols in human blood and tissues are derived from the diet because humans cannot synthesize phytosterols [(2)](#reference2). While cholesterol is the predominant sterol in animals, including humans, a variety of sterols are found in plants [(3)](#reference3). Nutritionists recognize two classes of phytosterols: (1) Plant sterols have a double bond in the sterol ring. The most abundant sterols in plants and the human diet are -sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol (Figure 2). (2) Plant stanols lack a double bond in the sterol ring. Stanols, especially sitostanol and campestanol, comprise only about 10% of total dietary phytosterols (Figure 3). Phytosterols: a collective term for plant-derived sterols and stanols. Plant sterols or stanols: to plant-derived sterols or stanols; these [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical) are added to food or supplements. Plant sterol or stanol esters: plant sterols or stanols that have been esterified by creating an [ester](../../glossary#ester) bond between a [fatty acid](../../glossary#fatty-acid) and the sterol or stanol. Esterification occurs in intestinal cells and is also an industrial process. Esterification makes plant sterols and stanols more fat-soluble so they are easily incorporated into fat-containing foods, including margarines and salad dressings. In this article, the weights of plant sterol and stanol esters are expressed as the equivalent weights of free (unesterified) sterols and stanols. Dietary [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) must be incorporated into mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) in order to be absorbed by the cells that line the intestine ( [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte)) [(4)](#reference4). Mixed micelles are mixtures formed in the [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine) after a fat-containing meal is consumed. Transport across the apical membrane of enterocytes is mediated by intestinal cholesterol transporter, Niemann Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is also involved in the uptake of phytosterols [(5)](#reference5). Inside the enterocyte, cholesterol is esterified in a reaction [catalyzed](../../glossary#catalyst) by intestinal acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs; also present in the liver) and incorporated into [triglyceride](../../glossary#triglycerides)-rich [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein) known as [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons), which are secreted into the intestinal lymphatics. The thoracic lymphatic duct then collects most of the lymph before draining into the systemic blood circulation [(6)](#reference6). As circulating chylomicrons become depleted of triglycerides, they become chylomicron remnants, which are taken up by the liver. In the liver, cholesterol from chylomicron remnants may be repackaged into other lipoproteins for transport throughout the circulation or, alternatively, secreted into [bile](../../glossary#bile), which is released into the small intestine. Although varied diets typically contain similar amounts of phytosterols and [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), [serum](../../glossary#serum) phytosterol concentrations are usually several hundred times lower than serum cholesterol concentrations in humans [(7)](#reference7). Less than 5% of dietary plant sterols and less than 0.5% of dietary plant stanols are systemically absorbed, in contrast to about 50%-60% of dietary cholesterol [(8, 9)](#reference8). Like cholesterol, phytosterols must be incorporated into mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) before they are taken up by [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte). Once inside the enterocyte, systemic absorption of phytosterols is inhibited by the activity of an efflux transporter, consisting of a pair of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) [proteins](../../glossary#protein) known as ABCG5 and ABCG8. ABCG5 and ABCG8 each form one half of a transporter that secretes phytosterols and unesterified cholesterol from the enterocyte into the intestinal [lumen](../../glossary#lumen). Phytosterols are secreted back into the intestine by ABCG5/G8 transporters at a much greater rate than cholesterol, resulting in much lower intestinal absorption of dietary phytosterols than cholesterol [(10)](#reference10). Within the enterocyte, phytosterols are not as readily esterified as cholesterol, so they are incorporated into [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons) at much lower concentrations. Those phytosterols that are incorporated into chylomicrons enter the circulation and are taken up by the liver. Once inside the liver, phytosterols are rapidly secreted into [bile](../../glossary#bile) by hepatic ABCG5/G8 transporters. Although cholesterol is also secreted into bile, the rate of phytosterol secretion into bile is much greater than cholesterol secretion [(11)](#reference11). Thus, the low serum concentrations of phytosterols relative to cholesterol can be explained by decreased intestinal absorption and increased [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of phytosterols into bile. It is well established that high intakes of plant sterols or stanols concentrations in humans (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)). Different mechanisms appear to underlie the cholesterol-lowering effect of phytosterols (reviewed in [12](#reference12)). In the intestinal [lumen](../../glossary#lumen), phytosterols displace cholesterol from mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) and reduce cholesterol absorption [(13)](#reference13). It is also suggested that phytosterols might interfere with the esterification and incorporation of cholesterol into [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons) inside the [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte) [(12)](#reference12). In a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [cross-over trial](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), (0.46 g/day) and high (2.1 g/day) phytosterol-enriched beverages reduced cholesterol absorption by about 10% and 25%, respectively [(14)](#reference14). Moderate and high phytosterol intakes also significantly increased the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of [biliary](../../glossary#bile) and dietary cholesterol in the feces by 36% and 74%, respectively [(14)](#reference14). Although the mechanisms are currently not clear, phytosterols might facilitate cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues and [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage) lining vessel walls. Cholesterol is then transported to the liver and incorporated into [bile](../../glossary#bile) stored in the [gallbladder](../../glossary#gallbladder). While plant sterols may promote the hepatobiliary secretion of cholesterol into the intestinal lumen, they are also [hypothesized](../../glossary#hypothesis) to facilitate the disposal of cholesterol via a nonbiliary route called transintestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE) [(12)](#reference12). A decrease in intestinal-derived [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) entering the circulation as [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons) triggers the [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) production of cholesterol in order to maintain cholesterol [homeostasis](../../glossary#homeostasis) [(14)](#reference14). Cell surface [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) expression is also up-regulated to enhance a receptor-mediated uptake of circulating LDL-cholesterol into cells [(15)](#reference15). This process results in an increased clearance of circulating LDL from the blood. Within the cells, LDL particles are dismantled in [lysosomes](../../glossary#lysosome) and cholesterol becomes available for metabolic needs. Through inhibiting the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, LDL and LDL-derived cholesterol then suppress the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of the [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and other [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) involved in the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) of cholesterol and of the LDL-receptor [(16)](#reference16). The net result is the maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis within tissues (especially in the liver) and a reduction in [serum](../../glossary#serum) LDL-cholesterol concentration. Of note, some individuals with low intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency [(17)](#reference17) and/or high basal cholesterol synthesis rate [(18)](#reference18) have been found to be poorly responsive to phytosterol therapy (reviewed in [19](#reference19)). Experiments in cell culture and animal models have suggested that phytosterols might have biological activities unrelated to cholesterol lowering. However, their significance in humans is not yet known. [Cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) is an important structural component of mammalian [cell membranes](../../glossary#cell-membrane) [(20)](#reference20). Displacement of cholesterol with phytosterols has been found to alter the physical properties of cell membranes [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(21)](#reference21), which [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) activity [(22, 23)](#reference22). Limited evidence from an animal model of [hemorrhagic stroke](../../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) suggested that very high intakes of phytosterols could displace cholesterol in red blood cell membranes, resulting in decreased deformability and potentially increased fragility [(24, 25)](#reference24). However, daily phytosterol supplementation (1 g/1,000 kcal) for four weeks did not alter red blood cell fragility in humans [(26)](#reference26). Limited evidence from animal studies suggests that very high phytosterol intake could alter testosterone [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) by inhibiting 5--reductase, a membrane-bound [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) dihydrotestosterone, a more potent [metabolite](../../glossary#metabolite) [(27, 28)](#reference27). It is not known whether phytosterol consumption alters testosterone metabolism in humans. No significant changes in free or total [serum](../../glossary#serum) testosterone concentrations were observed in men who consumed 1.6 g/day of plant sterol [esters](../../glossary#ester) for one year [(29)](#reference29). Phytosterols have been found to inhibit [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), induce [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), and reduce invasiveness of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells in culture (reviewed in [30](#reference30)). There is currently little evidence to suggest that phytosterol consumption could substantially contribute to lower the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of cancer in humans (see [Cancer](#cancer-prevention)). Limited data from cell culture and animal studies suggest that phytosterols may attenuate the [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) activity of immune cells, including [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage) and [neutrophils](../../glossary#neutrophil) [(31, 32)](#reference31). The result of a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 20 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that reductions in total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentrations with phytosterol-enriched foods were not associated with changes in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentration of [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP), a surrogate marker of chronic low-grade [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) [(33)](#reference33). Typical diets across different populations have been estimated to provide 150 to 450 mg/day of naturally occurring phytosterols. Nevertheless, the consumption of vegetarian diets and of food products enriched with phytosterols can help achieve much greater intakes of phytosterols (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Relatively few studies have considered the effects of naturally occurring dietary phytosterol intakes on [serum](../../glossary#serum) [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, while an abundance of studies have examined the [lipid](../../glossary#lipid)-lowering effect of phytosterol-enriched foods. Lipid-lowering effect: Elevated [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentration is a [risk](../../glossary#risk) disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) [(34, 35)](#reference34). Numerous [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that daily consumption of foods enriched with free or esterified forms of plant sterols or stanols lowers concentrations of [serum](../../glossary#serum) total and LDL-cholesterol [(36-40)](#reference36). This wealth of evidence has been summarized in several [meta-analyses](../../glossary#meta-analysis) combining the results of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(41-46)](#reference41). A dose-dependent relationship was reported between total phytosterol intake levels (from less than 1 g/day to 4 g/day) and LDL-cholesterol reduction in a recent meta-analysis of 124 human studies [(47)](#reference47). When analyzed separately, plant sterols and stanols showed similar dose-response effects on LDL-cholesterol concentrations for average doses ranging from 0.6 g/day to 3.3 g/day. Average doses of phytosterols between 0.6 and 1.1 g/day were found to significantly lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations by at least 5%, while an average intake of 3.3 g/day resulted in reductions of about 12.4% [(47)](#reference47). Another meta-analysis that analyzed the results of 59 randomized controlled trials suggested that reductions in LDL-cholesterol were greater in those with higher baseline concentrations of LDL-cholesterol [(41)](#reference41). Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of phytosterol-enriched food intake (1.8 to 6 g/day of phytosterols) in patients treated with statins (drugs that inhibit [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) cholesterol [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis)) found that co-administration of phytosterols and statins significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared to statin therapy alone [(48)](#reference48). The concentrations of [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol and [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides) were unaffected by the combination of phytosterols and statins compared to statin alone. In subgroup analyses, the effect of combining phytosterols and statins on blood [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profile was not found to be significantly influenced by lipid baseline values, phytosterol dosage, or study duration [(48)](#reference48). Effect on vascular health: Impairment of [vascular endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) and [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(49)](#reference49). A recent 5 mmol/L [193 consuming 3 g/day of phytosterols added to low-fat spread on brachial artery dilation (FMD), a surrogate marker of endothelial health [(50)](#reference50). Assessment of arterial stiffness \u2014 using measures of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) \u2014 and blood pressure also showed no difference between supplemented and placebo groups, despite a significant 6.7% reduction in total and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol. Other trials in individuals with hypercholesterolemia [(51, 52)](#reference51) and type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(53)](#reference53) also failed to find an effect of phytosterol-enriched spread consumption on brachial artery diameter, FMD, and/or arterial stiffness. Nonetheless, the results of a [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 92 individuals of whom 72% had serum cholesterol 5 mmol/L suggested beneficial effects of plant stanol-enriched spread consumption (corresponding to 3 g/day of stanols for six months) on arterial stiffness and endothelial function, as assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) measures, respectively [(54)](#reference54). Finally, a 21-month randomized controlled trial used retinal photography to examine the effect of phytosterol-enriched margarine consumption on retinal microcirculation in 43 statin-treated subjects [(55)](#reference55). Reductions in LDL-cholesterol concentration by 9.7% and 11.2% with plant sterols (2.5 g/day) and plant stanols (2.5 g/day), respectively, were not accompanied by significant changes in the diameter of retinal arterioles and venules, a proxy measure to assess microvascular health [(55)](#reference55). At present, whether phytosterols can improve vascular health in individuals with endothelial dysfunction is unclear. The lack of an effect of phytosterols in most of the abovementioned trials may be due to the inclusion of apparently healthy participants who may have normal endothelial function [(50)](#reference50). [Effect on the risk of coronary heart disease: Elevated ] [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) is an established [risk](../../glossary#risk) factor for [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) [(56)](#reference56). The pooled analysis of 27 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of statin drug therapy found a 24% decrease in the risk of major [coronary](../../glossary#coronary-artery) events and a 12% decrease in vascular mortality per 1 millimol/L (1 mM) reduction in LDL-cholesterol concentration, irrespective of gender and level of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk [(57)](#reference57). Yet, at present, the effect of long-term use of foods enriched with plant sterols or stanols on CHD risk is not known. The addition of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched foods to a heart-healthy diet that is low in [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and rich in [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains), and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber) offers the potential for additive effects in CHD risk reduction. For example, following a diet that substituted [monounsaturated](../../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid) and [polyunsaturated fats](../../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) for saturated fat resulted in a 9% reduction in [serum](../../glossary#serum) LDL-cholesterol after 30 days, but the addition of 1.7 g/day of plant sterols to the same diet resulted in a 24% reduction [(58)](#reference58). In addition, one-month adherence to a diet providing a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, including plant sterols (1 g/1,000 kcal), soy protein, almonds, and viscous fibers, lowered serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations by an average of 30% \u2014 a decrease that was not significantly different from that induced by statin therapy [(59)](#reference59). The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III included the use of plant sterol or stanol esters (2 g/day) as a component of maximal dietary therapy for elevated LDL-cholesterol [(60)](#reference60). The 2013 report of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) task force advised clinicians to consider the use of phytosterol-enriched foods as dietary [adjuncts](../../glossary#adjunct) for high-risk patients with insufficient LDL-cholesterol response to statin therapy [(61)](#reference61). However, stepping back from a general recommendation, the ACC and American Heart Association (AHA) did not include phytosterols in their 2013 report on lifestyle management guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk [(62)](#reference62). Likewise, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans \u2014 issued jointly by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture \u2014 does not mention phytosterols in the composition of healthy eating patterns [(63)](#reference63). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of health claims on food labels indicating that regular consumption of foods enriched with plant sterol or stanol esters, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease (see [Foods enriched with plant sterols and plant stanols](#enriched-food)) [(61, 64)](#reference61). In the EU, disease risk reduction claims for phytosterols are restricted to certain [fortified](../../glossary#fortification) food products and include a number of mandatory statements such as the fact that these products are not intended for people who do not need to control their blood cholesterol level [(65)](#reference65). [Clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) finding daily consumption of foods enriched with plant sterols or stanols can significantly lower [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations do not account for naturally occurring phytosterols in the diet [(66)](#reference66). Relatively few studies have considered the effects of dietary phytosterol intakes on [serum](../../glossary#serum) LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Limited evidence, primarily from [cross-sectional studies](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study), suggests that dietary phytosterols may play an important role in decreasing cholesterol absorption. A cross-sectional study in the UK found that dietary phytosterol intakes were [inversely related](../../glossary#inverse-association) to serum total and after adjusting for [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber) intake [(67)](#reference67). Similarly, an analysis in a Swedish population found that dietary intake of phytosterols was inversely associated with total cholesterol in both men and women and with LDL-cholesterol in women [(68)](#reference68). Dietary phytosterol intakes were also found to be inversely associated with LDL-cholesterol concentrations in another cross-sectional study in healthy Spanish participants [(69)](#reference69). In single-meal tests, removal of 150 mg of phytosterols from corn oil increased cholesterol absorption by 38% [(70)](#reference70), and removal of 328 mg of phytosterols from wheat germ increased cholesterol absorption by 43% [(71)](#reference71). Although these findings suggest that moderate intakes of phytosterols could have an important impact on [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) health, the intake of phytosterols (83 to 966 mg/day) from natural sources was not found to be associated with reduced risks of CHD, [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction), or total [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) during the 12.2-year follow-up of 35,597 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-The Netherlands (EPIC-NL) [(72)](#reference72). Limited data from animal studies suggest that very high intakes of phytosterols, particularly sitosterol, may inhibit the growth of breast and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) (reviewed in [73](#reference73)). Only a few [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have examined associations between dietary phytosterol intakes and cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) in humans [(30)](#reference30). A series of [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) in Uruguay found that dietary phytosterol intakes were lower in people diagnosed with stomach, lung, or breast cancer than in cancer-free control groups [(74-76)](#reference74). Case-control studies in the US found that women diagnosed with breast or [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) (uterine) cancer had lower dietary phytosterol intakes than women who did not have cancer [(77, 78)](#reference77). In contrast, another case-control study in the US found that men diagnosed with prostate cancer had higher dietary campesterol intakes than cancer-free men, but total phytosterol consumption was not associated with prostate cancer risk [(79)](#reference79). Although higher intakes of plant foods containing phytosterols may be associated with lower cancer risk, it is not clear whether potential anticancer health benefits can be attributed to phytosterols or to other compounds in plant foods (e.g., [vitamins](../../glossary#vitamin), [minerals](../../glossary#mineral), and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber)). [Benign prostatic to describe a noncancerous enlargement of the [prostate](../../glossary#prostate). The enlarged prostate may exert pressure on the urethra, resulting in difficulty urinating. Plant extracts that provide a mixture of phytosterols (marketed as -sitosterol) are often included in herbal therapies for urinary symptoms related to BPH. However, relatively few controlled studies have examined the efficacy of phytosterol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in men with symptomatic BPH. In a six-month study of 200 men with symptomatic BPH, 60 mg/day of a -sitosterol preparation improved symptom scores, increased peak urinary flow, and decreased post-void residual urine volume compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(80)](#reference80). A follow-up study reported that these improvements were maintained for up to 18 months in the 38 participants who continued -sitosterol treatment [(81)](#reference81). Similarly, in a six-month study of 177 men with symptomatic BPH, 130 mg/day of a different -sitosterol preparation improved urinary symptom scores, increased peak urinary flow, and decreased post-void residual urine volume compared to placebo [(82)](#reference82). A [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) that combined the results of these and two other controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that -sitosterol extracts increased peak urinary flow by an average of 3.9 mL/second and decreased post-void residual volume by an average of 29 mL [(83)](#reference83). Although the results of a few clinical trials suggest that relatively low doses of phytosterols can improve lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH, further research is needed to confirm these findings [(84)](#reference84). Unlike the typical diet in most developed countries today, the diets of our ancestors were rich in phytosterols, likely providing as much as 1 g/day [(1)](#references). Present-day dietary phytosterol intakes have been estimated to vary from 150 to 450 mg/day in different populations [(85)](#reference85). Vegetarians, particularly vegans, generally have the highest intakes of dietary phytosterols [(86)](#reference86). Phytosterols are found in all plant foods, but the highest concentrations are found in unrefined plant oils, including vegetable, nut, and olive oils [(3)](#reference3). [Nuts](../../food-beverages/nuts), seeds, [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains), and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes) are also good dietary sources of phytosterols [(4)](#reference4). The phytosterol content of selected foods are presented in Table 1. For information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search the [USDA food |Food||Serving||Phytosterols* (mg)| USDA food composition database, the values of phytosterol content of foods are likely to be underestimates since they account only for major sterols (sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol). In addition, the values correspond to the amounts of free and esterified phytosterols in foods, because phytosterol glycosides are not quantified by the current method unless glycosides (sugars) are removed before quantification [Clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) that demonstrated a [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering effect have primarily used plant sterol or stanol [esters](../../glossary#ester) solubilized in fat-containing foods, such as margarine or mayonnaise [(44)](#reference44). Additional studies indicate that low-fat or even nonfat foods can effectively deliver plant sterols or stanols if they are adequately solubilized [(37](#reference37), [(96)](#reference96), and orange juice [(97, 98)](#reference97) have been reported to lower [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol in [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial). A variety of foods containing added plant sterols or stanols, including margarines, mayonnaises, vegetable oils, salad dressings, yogurt, milk, soy milk, orange juice, snack bars, and meats, are available in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand [(37)](#reference37). A 2008 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) found that phytosterols added to fat spreads, mayonnaise, salad dressings, milk, or yogurt more effectively reduced LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared to phytosterols incorporated into chocolate, orange juice, cheese, meats, and cereal bars [(41)](#reference41). In most clinical trials, dividing the daily dose of phytosterols among two or three meals appeared to effectively lower LDL-cholesterol [(41)](#reference41). Nevertheless, consumption of the daily dose of plant sterols or stanols with a single meal has also been found to lower LDL-cholesterol in a few clinical trials [(89-91](#reference89), [99, 100)](#reference99). In the US, FDA-authorized health claims on food labels specify that the daily dietary intake of plant sterol (1.3 g/day) or stanol esters (3.4 g/day) that has been associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of heart disease should be consumed in two servings eaten at different times of the day with other foods, as part of a diet low in [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and cholesterol [(61, 64)](#reference61). In the EU, food labels must indicate that the beneficial effect of phytosterols is obtained with a daily intake of 1.5 to 3 g of plant sterols/stanols in order to use the following European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)-approved statement: \"Plant sterol and stanol esters have been shown to lower blood cholesterol. High cholesterol is a risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease\" [(65)](#reference65). Available without a prescription in the US, -sitosterol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) typically contain a mixture of -sitosterol with other phytosterols and/or with substances like pumpkin seed oil and saw palmetto extract [(101)](#reference101). Doses of 60 to 130 mg/day of -sitosterol have been found to alleviate the symptoms of [benign and phytostanol supplements should be taken with a meal that contains fat. In the US, plant sterols and stanols added to a variety of food products are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA [(102)](#reference102). Additionally, the Scientific Committee on Foods of the EU concluded that plant sterols and stanols added to various food products are safe for human use [(103)](#reference103). However, the Committee recommended that intakes of plant sterols and stanols from food products should not exceed 3 g/day because there is no evidence of health benefits at higher intakes and there might be undesirable effects at high intakes [(65)](#reference65). Few adverse effects have been associated with regular consumption of plant sterols or stanols for up to one year. People who consumed a plant sterol-enriched spread providing 1.6 g/day did not report any more adverse effects than those consuming a control spread for up to one year [(29)](#reference29), and people consuming a plant stanol-enriched spread providing 1.8 to 2.6 g/day for one year did not report any adverse effects [(104)](#reference104). Consumption of up to 8.6 g/day of phytosterols in margarine for three to four weeks was well tolerated by healthy men and women and did not adversely affect intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) or female [hormone](../../glossary#hormone) levels [(105)](#reference105). Although phytosterols are usually well tolerated, nausea, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation have occasionally been reported [(106)](#reference106). Sitosterolemia, also known as phytosterolemia, is a very rare hereditary disease that results from inheriting a [mutation](../../glossary#mutation) in both copies of the ABCG5 or ABCG8 [gene](../../glossary#gene) [(107)](#reference107). Individuals who are [homozygous](../../glossary#homozygous) for a mutation in either transporter [protein](../../glossary#protein) have dramatically elevated [serum](../../glossary#serum) phytosterol concentrations due to increased intestinal absorption and decreased [biliary](../../glossary#bile) [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of phytosterols. Although serum cholesterol concentrations may be normal or only mildly elevated, individuals with sitosterolemia are at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for premature [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis). Other clinical symptoms include tuberous and tendon xanthomas (i.e., cutaneous lipid depositions), [hematological](../../glossary#hematology) abnormalities, and sometimes joint pain and arthritis. People with sitosterolemia should avoid foods or [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) with added plant sterols [(37)](#reference37). Two studies have examined the effect of plant sterol consumption in [heterozygous](../../glossary#heterogeneous) carriers of sitosterolemia, a more common condition. Consumption of 3 g/day of plant sterols for four weeks by two heterozygous carriers [(108)](#reference108) and consumption of 2.2 g/day of plant sterols for 6 to 12 weeks by 12 heterozygous carriers did not result in abnormally elevated [serum](../../glossary#serum) phytosterols [(109)](#reference109). Because [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) has been reported in subjects with sitosterolemia, phytosterols have been attributed atherogenic effects. However, no relationship between serum concentrations of sitosterol and campesterol and risk of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) has been identified in a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) in 11,182 participants [(110)](#reference110). Phytosterol-enriched foods and [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) are not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women because their safety has not been studied [(106)](#reference106). At present, there is no evidence that high dietary intakes of naturally occurring phytosterols, such as those consumed by vegetarian women, adversely affects pregnancy or lactation. There is some evidence showing that statin administration initially reduces plant sterol concentrations in blood. This might be attributed to the reduction of circulating [LDL](../../glossary#LDL), the major transport [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) of plant sterols, due to enhanced [hepatic](../../glossary#hepatic) uptake of LDL. However, statin therapy appears to increase the absorption of plant sterols that can be then transported by the remaining LDL particles [(111)](#reference111). Further, the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of plant sterols or stanols may be additive to that of statins. The result of a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) suggested that consumption of 2 to 3 g/day of plant sterols or stanols by individuals on statin therapy may lower both total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and LDL-cholesterol by an additional 0.30 mmol/L (11.6 to alone [(48)](#reference48). Ezetimibe (marketed as Zetia) is another [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering drug that may interfere with the intestinal absorption of phytosterols, thus significantly reducing phytosterol concentration in blood [(112)](#reference112). Because plant sterols and stanols decrease [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) absorption and [serum](../../glossary#serum) [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentrations, their effects on fat-soluble [vitamin](../../glossary#vitamin) status studied in [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial). [Plasma](../../glossary#plasma) [vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A) (retinol) concentrations were not of plant sterol [esters](../../glossary#ester) or plant stanol esters for up to one year [(29](#reference29), [44)](#reference44). Although the majority of studies found no changes in plasma [vitamin D](../../vitamins/vitamin-D) (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) concentrations, one [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in individuals consuming 1.6 g/day of sterol esters for one year observed a small (7%) but statistically significant decrease in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations [(29)](#reference29). There is little evidence that plant sterol or stanol consumption adversely affects [vitamin K](../../vitamins/vitamin-K) status. Consumption of 1.6 g/day of sterol esters for six months was associated with a nonsignificant, 14% decrease in plasma vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) concentrations, and the level of [carboxylated](../../glossary#carboxylation) osteocalcin, a functional indicator of vitamin K status, was unchanged [(29)](#reference29). Other studies of shorter duration also found no change in plasma concentrations of phylloquinone [(113, 114)](#reference113) or vitamin K-dependent clotting factors with the consumption of plant sterol and stanol esters [(115)](#reference115). Consumption of phytosterol-enriched foods has been found to decrease plasma [vitamin E](../../vitamins/vitamin-E) (-tocopherol) concentration in a number of studies [(44](#reference44), [114)](#reference114). However, those decreases generally do not persist when plasma -tocopherol concentrations are standardized to LDL-cholesterol concentrations, suggesting that observed reductions in plasma -tocopherol are due in part to reductions in its [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) carrier, LDL. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) found no adverse effects of phytosterol-enriched food consumption (average dose of 2.5 g/day) on fat-soluble vitamin status in well-nourished people [(116)](#reference116). Dietary [carotenoids](carotenoids) are fat-soluble [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical) that [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein). A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) reported about 5 to 20% reductions in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) hydrocarbon carotenoids after consumption of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched foods for one month to one year [(116)](#reference116). Even when standardized to [serum](../../glossary#serum) total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, decreases in -carotene, -carotene, and lycopene may persist, suggesting that phytosterols could inhibit the absorption of these carotenoids. Total cholesterol-standardized concentrations of xanthophyll carotenoids, zeaxanthin and -cryptoxanthin, but not lutein, were also found to be significantly reduced by 5 to 15% with the consumption of phytosterol-enriched foods [(116)](#reference116). Although it is not clear whether reductions in plasma carotenoid concentrations confer any health [risks](../../glossary#risk) (see the article on [Carotenoids](carotenoids)), a few studies showed that increasing intakes of carotenoid-rich [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) would prevent phytosterol-induced decreases in plasma concentrations of carotenoids [(117)](#reference117). In one randomized controlled study, advice to consume five daily servings of fruit and vegetables, including one serving of carotenoid-rich vegetables, was enough to maintain plasma carotenoid levels in people consuming 2.5 g/day of plant sterol or stanol esters [(118)](#reference118). 2005 by: Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in September 2008 by: Victoria J.

Certain plants produce resveratrol and other stilbenoids in response to stress, injury, fungal infection, or ultraviolet (UV) radiation [(2)](#reference2). Resveratrol is a fat-soluble compound that occurs in both trans and cis molecular configurations (Figure 1). Both cis- and trans-resveratrol also occur as [glucosides](../../glossary#glucoside), i.e., bound to a [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) molecule. One major resveratrol derivative is resveratrol-3-O--glucoside, also called piceid (Figure 1) [(3)](#reference3). Since the early 1990s, when the presence of resveratrol in red wine was established [(4)](#reference4), the scientific community has been exploring the effects of resveratrol on health. Specifically, it was postulated that resveratrol intake via moderate red wine consumption might help explain the fact that French people have a relatively low incidence of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) in spite of consuming foods high in [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid), a phenomenon dubbed the \"French Paradox\" (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)) [(5)](#reference5). Since then, reports on the potential for resveratrol to prevent [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), delay the development of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) and [neurodegenerative diseases](../../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease), improve glycemic control in type 2 [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and extend lifespan in experimental models have continued to generate scientific interest (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). Initial studies of the [pharmacokinetics](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) of trans-resveratrol in humans found only traces of the unmetabolized resveratrol in the [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) upon oral exposure of single trans-resveratrol doses of 5 to 25 mg. Indeed, trans-resveratrol appears to be well absorbed by humans when taken orally, but its [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) is relatively low due to its rapid [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination [(6)](#reference6). Once absorbed, resveratrol is rapidly metabolized by conjugation to glucuronic acid and/or sulfate, forming resveratrol glucuronides, sulfates, and/or sulfoglucuronides. Sulfate conjugates are the major forms of resveratrol [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) found in plasma and urine in humans [(7)](#reference7). Preliminary studies found that the administration of single oral doses of 25 mg of trans-resveratrol to healthy volunteers resulted in peak blood concentrations of total resveratrol (i.e., trans-resveratrol plus its metabolites) around 60 minutes later, at about 1.8-2 moles/liter (M), depending on whether resveratrol was administered in wine, vegetable juice, or grape juice [(8, 9)](#reference8). A study in 40 healthy subjects who received single ascending doses of oral trans-resveratrol (i.e., 0.5 g, 1 g, 2.5 g, and 5 g) showed that plasma concentrations of unmetabolized resveratrol peaked between 0.8 and 1.5 hours after resveratrol administration at levels ranging from 0.3 M to 2.3 M [(10)](#reference10). Of note, these values were markedly below those used to elicit chemopreventive effects of resveratrol in [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) experiments (>5 M). In contrast, following a single oral dose of 5 g of trans-resveratrol, the peak plasma concentrations of certain resveratrol conjugates were found to be about two to eight times higher than those of unmetabolized resveratrol [(10)](#reference10). Also, compared to a single dose administration, the repeated intake of 5 g/day of trans-resveratrol for 29 days was found to result in significantly greater peak plasma concentrations of trans-resveratrol and two resveratrol glucuronide conjugates [(11)](#reference11). Repeated doses of 1 g/day of trans-resveratrol (a dose less likely to cause side effects; see [Safety](#safety)) could yield maximum plasma concentrations of about 22 M for resveratrol-3-O-sulfate (the most abundant sulfate conjugate in humans) and about 7-8 M for typical monoglucuronide conjugates [(12)](#reference12). A few studies have examined the influence of food matrix on resveratrol absorption and/or bioavailability (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). One study has reported that bioavailability of trans-resveratrol from red wine did not differ when the wine was consumed with a meal (low- or high-fat) versus on an empty stomach [(14)](#reference14). Yet, in another study, the absorption of [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) resveratrol was found to be delayed, but not reduced, by the presence of food in the stomach [(15)](#reference15). A third study found that the bioavailability of supplemental resveratrol was reduced by the amount of fat in the diet, but not by the co-administration of quercetin (another polyphenol) or alcohol [(16)](#reference16). Information about the bioavailability of resveratrol in humans is important because most of the experimental research conducted to date has been 'preclinical,' i.e., in vitro, exposing cells to resveratrol concentrations up to 100 times greater than peak plasma concentrations observed in humans, and in animal models given very high (non dietary) doses of resveratrol [(13)](#reference13). While cells that line the digestive tract are exposed to unmetabolized resveratrol, other tissues are likely exposed to resveratrol metabolites. At present, little is known about the biological activity of resveratrol metabolites. Yet, if some tissues are capable of converting resveratrol metabolites back to resveratrol, stable resveratrol conjugates in tissues could serve as a pool in the body from which resveratrol might be regenerated [(6](#reference6), [12)](#reference12). The biological significance of resveratrol has been primarily investigated in test tubes and cultured cells, and to a lesser extent, in animal models. Of note, a recent publication by Tom\u00e9-Carneiro et al. [(13)](#reference13) thoroughly reviewed the most relevant preclinical studies published in the most recent decades. It is important to keep in mind that many of the biological activities discussed below were observed in cells cultured in the presence of resveratrol at higher concentrations than those likely to be achieved in humans consuming resveratrol orally (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). In the test tube, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX) [(21)](#reference21). However, there evidence that resveratrol is an important antioxidant [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo). Upon oral consumption of resveratrol, circulating and intracellular levels of resveratrol in humans are likely to be much lower than that of other important antioxidants, such as [vitamin resveratrol [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite), which comprise most of the circulating resveratrol, may be lower than that of resveratrol [(22)](#reference22). [Endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) are [steroid](../../glossary#steroid-hormone) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone) [synthesized](../../glossary#synthesis) mammals; these hormones bind to estrogen [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) within cells. The estrogen-receptor complex [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) [genes](../../glossary#gene) [(23)](#reference23). The chemical structure of resveratrol is very similar to that of the synthetic estrogen agonist, diethylstilbestrol (Figure 2), suggesting that resveratrol might also function as an estrogen agonist, i.e., might bind to estrogen receptors and elicit similar responses to endogenous estrogens. However, in cell culture experiments, resveratrol was found to act either as an estrogen agonist or as an estrogen antagonist depending on such factors as cell type, estrogen receptor isoform (ER or ER), and the presence of endogenous estrogens [(23)](#reference23). Most recently, resveratrol was shown to improve endothelial wound healing through an ER-dependent pathway in an animal model of arterial injury [(24)](#reference24). Some compounds are not [carcinogenic](../../glossary#carcinogen) until they have been [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) in the body by phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), especially [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [(2)](#reference2). P450 enzymes [(25, 26)](#reference25), resveratrol might help prevent [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) by limiting the activation of [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen). In contrast, increasing the activity of phase II detoxification enzymes generally promotes the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of potentially toxic or carcinogenic chemicals. Resveratrol has been found to increase the expression and activity of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) in cultured cells [(27)](#reference27) and may be a weak inducer of other phase II enzymes [(28)](#reference28). Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested to allow for DNA repair or activation of pathways leading to cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) if the damage is irreparable [(29)](#reference29). Defective cell cycle regulation may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of cancer. Moreover, unlike normal cells, [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells [proliferate](../../glossary#proliferation) rapidly and are unable to respond to cell death signals that initiate apoptosis. Resveratrol has been found to induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (programmed cell death) in a number of cancer cell lines (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). [Cancerous](../../glossary#cancer) cells invade normal tissue aided by [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) called [matrix metalloproteinases](../../glossary#matrix-metalloproteinase). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the activity of at least one type of matrix metalloproteinase [(30, 31)](#reference30). To fuel their rapid growth, invasive tumors must also develop new blood vessels by a process known as [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis). Resveratrol has been found [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) [(36)](#reference36). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the activity of several inflammatory [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro), including an [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) process in which [lipids](../../glossary#lipid) deposit in plaques (known as atheromas) within arterial walls and increase the risk of [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) [(41)](#reference41). One of the earliest events in the development of atherosclerosis is the recruitment of inflammatory white blood cells from the blood to the arterial wall by vascular cell adhesion molecules [(42)](#reference42). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the expression of adhesion molecules in cultured endothelial cells [(43, 44)](#reference43). The [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays an important role in the progression of [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis), and [restenosis](../../glossary#restenosis) (when treated arteries become blocked again). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the proliferation of VSMCs in culture [(45-47)](#reference45), as well as [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) [(48)](#reference48). Resveratrol appeared to reduce VSMC proliferation via an ER-dependent mechanism, hence preventing the narrowing of vessels in a mouse model of arterial injury [(48)](#reference48). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) that the formation of nitric oxide (NO) by [vascular endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells. NO is needed to maintain arterial relaxation ( [vasodilation](../../glossary#vasodilation)), and impaired NO-dependent vasodilation is associated an increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(49)](#reference49). Because physiological concentrations of resveratrol were found to stimulate eNOS activity in cultured endothelial cells [(50-52)](#reference50), resveratrol might help maintain (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)). [Platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation is one of the first steps in the formation of a blood clot that can occlude a [coronary](../../glossary#coronary-artery) or [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebral) artery, resulting in [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) or [stroke](../../glossary#stroke), respectively. Resveratrol has been activation and aggregation [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vivo) [(53-55)](#reference53). Age-related mood alterations and memory deficits result from a decrease in the function of the hippocampus in the elderly. Resveratrol was shown to stimulate neurogenesis and blood vessel formation in the hippocampus of healthy old rats. These structural changes were associated with significant improvements in spatial learning, memory formation, and mood function [(56)](#reference56). One feature of [Alzheimer's disease](../../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the accumulation of -amyloid peptide into (amyloid) plaques](../../glossary#senile-plaque) outside [neurons](../../glossary#neuron) in the hippocampus and cortex of AD patients [(57)](#reference57). Senile plaques are toxic to cells, resulting in progressive neuronal dysfunction and death. Resveratrol was found to facilitate the clearance of -amyloid peptide and promote cell survival in primary neurons in culture and neuronal cell lines [(58-60)](#reference58). Resveratrol also reduced senile plaque counts in various brain regions of a transgenic AD mouse model [(61)](#reference61). Abnormally activated microglia and hypertrophic astrocytes around the senile plaques in AD brains release cytotoxic molecules, such as proinflammatory mediators and [ROS](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), which enhance the formation and deposition of -amyloid peptides and further damage [neurons](../../glossary#neuron) [(57)](#reference57). Resveratrol was found able to inhibit the inflammatory response triggered by -amyloid peptide-induced microglial activation in microglial cell lines and in a mouse model of [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebral) amyloid deposition [(62)](#reference62). A decreased occurrence of microglial activation and astrocyte hypertrophy was also reported in healthy aged rats treated with resveratrol [(56)](#reference56). [Mitochondrial](../../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) are thought to be involved in the [etiology](../../glossary#etiology) progression of several Resistance against oxidative stress-related damage in primary neuronal cells treated with resveratrol has been associated with the limited infarct size during [ischemia](../../glossary#ischemia)-reperfusion in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking the HO-1 [gene](../../glossary#gene) [(66)](#reference66). Also, resveratrol was able to correct experimentally induced oxidative stress and the associated [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) dysfunction in rats [(67)](#reference67). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) of a variety of human [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cell lines, including those from breast, [prostate](../../glossary#prostate), stomach, colon, [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas), and [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) cancers [(2)](#reference2). In animal models, oral administration, [topical](../../glossary#topical) application, and/or injection of resveratrol inhibited the development of chemically-induced cancer at many sites, including [gastrointestinal tract](../../glossary#gastrointestinal), liver, skin, breast, prostate, and lung (reviewed in [68, 69](#reference68)). The anti-cancer effects of resveratrol in rodent models involved the reduction of cell proliferation, the induction of [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), and the inhibition of [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis), tumor growth, and [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasize) (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). Yet, a few animal studies have reported a lack of an effect of oral resveratrol in inhibiting the development of lung cancer induced by [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) in cigarette smoke [(70, 71)](#reference70), and the study of resveratrol administration on colon cancer has given mixed results [(72-74)](#reference72). At present, it is not known whether resveratrol might be beneficial in the prevention and/or the treatment of cancer in humans. The low [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of resveratrol reported in human studies limits the clinical evaluation of possible systemic health effects of resveratrol in humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Yet, in a [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study), unmetabolized resveratrol and conjugates have been detected in colorectal tumor tissues from 20 cancer patients following daily oral supplementation with either 4 g or 8 g of resveratrol for 29 days. Resveratrol appeared to be well tolerated and significantly, though modestly, reduced cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) compared to baseline [(75)](#reference75). A micronized formulation of resveratrol (named SRT501), which was meant to increase resveratrol delivery to target tissues, was given for 14 days to 6 patients with [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) and liver metastasis trial [(76)](#reference76). Unmetabolized resveratrol was measurable in the liver of five out of six patients who consumed 5 g of SRT501, and SRT501 administration resulted in an increased detection of the apoptotic marker, cleaved caspase-3, in [hepatic](../../glossary#hepatic) tumor tissues. Yet, in an unrandomized and unblinded trial in patients with multiple myeloma, the administration of SRT501 was associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including kidney failure, such that the trial was halted [(77)](#reference77). Since kidney failure is a frequent complication in myeloma patients, it is unclear whether kidney failure cases should be solely attributed to the use of SRT501. Nevertheless, there is a need to find safe ways to increase resveratrol bioavailability in humans before exploring its putative benefits in clinical settings [(6](#reference6), [78)](#reference78). Significant reductions in [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) risk have been associated with moderate consumption of [alcoholic beverages](../../food-beverages/alcoholic-beverages) [(79)](#reference79). The \"French Paradox\" \u2014 the observation that incidence of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) was relatively low in France despite high levels of dietary [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and cigarette smoking \u2014 led to the idea that regular consumption of red wine might provide additional protection from cardiovascular disease [(80)](#reference80). Red wine contains variable and usually low concentrations of resveratrol (see [Sources](#sources)) and higher concentrations of [flavonoids](flavonoids) like procyanidins. These polyphenolic compounds have displayed [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant), anti-inflammatory, and other potentially anti-atherogenic effects in the test tube and in some animal models of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) [(81)](#reference81). The results of [epidemiological studies](../../glossary#epidemiological-study) addressing this question have been inconsistent. While some large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that wine drinkers were at lower risk of cardiovascular disease than beer or liquor drinkers [(82-84)](#reference82), others found no difference [(85-87)](#reference85). Socioeconomic and lifestyle differences between people who prefer wine and those who prefer beer or liquor may explain part of the additional benefit observed in some studies: people who prefer wine tend to have higher incomes, more education, smoke less, and eat more [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) and less saturated fat than those who prefer other alcoholic beverages [(87-92)](#reference87). Although moderate alcohol consumption has been consistently associated with reductions in coronary heart disease risk, it is not yet clear whether red wine polyphenols confer any additional risk reduction. Interestingly, studies that administered alcohol-free red wine to rodents noted improvements in various parameters related to cardiovascular disease [(93, 94)](#reference93), and a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled human study found that heart disease patients administered red grape polyphenol extract experienced acute improvements in [endothelial function](../../glossary#endothelial-dependent-vasodilation) [(95)](#reference95). Whether increased consumption of polyphenols from red wine provides any additional [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits beyond those associated with red wine's alcohol content needs to be further examined (see the article on [Alcoholic Beverages](../../food-beverages/alcoholic-beverages)) [(96)](#reference96). Endothelial dysfunction is usually associated with the presence of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk factors (e.g., [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance), [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), and hypercholesterolemia) and is thought to precede the clinical manifestation of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by abnormal vasoconstriction, to [vascular endothelial cells](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium), [coagulation](../../glossary#coagulation), and [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) [(97)](#reference97). studies: Resveratrol has been found to exert a number of protective effects on the [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) system [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro), [98, 99)](#reference98), of enhancing the production of [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) [(52)](#reference52), and control of the production of inflammatory [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) mediators [(38](#reference38), [100, 101)](#reference100). However, the concentrations of resveratrol required to produce these effects are often higher than those measured in human [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) after oral consumption of resveratrol [(9)](#reference9). Some animal studies also suggested that high oral doses of resveratrol could decrease the risk of thrombosis and atherosclerosis [(102, 103)](#reference102), although one study found increased atherosclerosis in animals fed resveratrol [(104)](#reference104). Other protective effects of resveratrol [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) include the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and the lowering of blood pressure in various models, as well as the limitation of infarct size in post [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) rats (reviewed controlled [cross-over study](../../glossary#cross-over-study), metabolic syndrome were randomized to receive resveratrol (100 mg/day) for three months either immediately at the beginning of the study or three months later. Resveratrol [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) resulted in improved values of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, a surrogate marker of vascular health. Yet, FMD returned to baseline values within three months after discontinuing resveratrol [(105)](#reference105). One study limitation was that the resveratrol formulation contained additional compounds (i.e., vitamin D3, quercetin, and rice bran phytate), which may also affect endothelial function. One [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in healthy overweight or obese volunteers (BMI, 25-34 kg/m2) found that a single dose of trans-resveratrol (30 mg, 90 mg, or 270 mg) improved brachial FMD around 60 minutes after administration [(106)](#reference106). In a second study, the same investigators found that FMD improvements were similar whether participants had received a single dose of resveratrol (75 mg) or a daily dose (75 mg/day of resveratrol) for six months [(107)](#reference107). In a few additional studies, resveratrol was shown to improve endothelial function by reducing vascular [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) and endothelial activation. A randomized, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study in 41 healthy subjects found that daily supplementation with resveratrol (400 mg), grapeseed extract (400 mg), and quercetin (100 mg), for one month significantly reduced the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) in endothelial cells, suggestive of a protective effect against endothelial dysfunction [(108)](#reference108). The daily intake of a resveratrol-rich grape supplement was compared to resveratrol-free grape supplement in a year-long, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 75 individuals at high risk for [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). Administration of the resveratrol-rich supplement (resveratrol: 8 mg/day for 6 months, then 16 mg/day for another 6 months) significantly improved the profile of circulating inflammatory markers, reducing levels of [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) and Tumor Necrosis Factor- (TNF-), as of thrombogenic factor, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) [(109)](#reference109). [low-density lipoprotein](../../glossary#LDL) (oxLDL) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) after suggested a cardioprotective effect of resveratrol [(110)](#reference110). Supplementation of patients with stable [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) with the same regimen also improved the profile of circulating inflammatory markers and reduced the expression of proinflammatory [genes](../../glossary#gene) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [(111)](#reference111). The expression of [microRNAs](../../glossary#microRNA) and [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine) specifically involved in atherogenic and pro-inflammatory signals were also found to be downregulated in the PBMCs of supplemented patients [(112)](#reference112). Finally, although it is not clear whether [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension) is a cause or an effect of endothelial dysfunction, a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) suggested that high doses of resveratrol (150 mg/for at least one month) might help lower [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) in individuals at risk for CVD [(113)](#reference113). While preliminary human studies suggest that resveratrol may have beneficial effects on [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) health, there is currently no convincing evidence that these effects can be achieved in the amounts present in one to two glasses of red wine (see [Sources](#sources)). For more information regarding resveratrol and cardiovascular disease, see [(114)](#reference114). Caloric restriction is known to extend the lifespan of a number of species, including yeast, worms, flies, fish, rats, and mice [(115)](#reference115). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), caloric restriction stimulates the activity of an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) known as Silent information regulator 2 protein (Sir2) or acetylated lysine residues in target [proteins](../../glossary#protein) (see the article on [Niacin](../../vitamins/niacin)). Providing resveratrol to yeast increased Sir2 activity in the absence of caloric restriction and extended the replicative (but not the chronological) lifespan of yeast by 70% [(117)](#reference117). Resveratrol feeding also extended the lifespan of worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) by a similar mechanism [(118)](#reference118). Additionally, resveratrol dose-dependently lifespan of a vertebrate fish (Nothobranchius furzeri) [(119)](#reference119). Resveratrol was also found to extend the lifespan of mice on a high-calorie diet such that their lifespan was similar to that of mice fed a standard diet [(120)](#reference120). Although resveratrol increased the activity of the Sir2 [homologous](../../glossary#homologous) human sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the test tube [(117)](#reference117), there are no [epidemiological](../../glossary#epidemiological-study) data to link resveratrol, SIRT1 activation, and extended human lifespan. Moreover, the supraphysiological concentrations of resveratrol required to increase human SIRT1 activity were considerably higher than concentrations that have been measured in human [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) after oral consumption. The results of a nine-year [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in over 700 older adults (65 years) indicated that participants who were alive at the end of the study had baseline concentrations of total urinary resveratrol [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (used as a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of resveratrol intake) similar to those who died during the study period [(121)](#reference121). Based on a lack of correlation with baseline [inflammatory](../../glossary#inlammation) markers, [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) incidence, and all-cause mortality, the authors concluded that higher versus lower [quartiles](../../glossary#quartile) of urinary resveratrol metabolite concentrations did not predict [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [chronic disease](../../glossary#chronic-disease) or mortality. However, key experts identified several limitations regarding the quality of the research [(122, 123)](#reference122). Specifically, the use of single measures of total urinary resveratrol metabolites at baseline has been highlighted as being unlikely to reflect lifetime consumption of wine or exposure to dietary resveratrol [(122)](#reference122). In a mouse model of [Alzheimer's disease](../../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD), caloric restriction has been shown to limit the production and deposition of neurotoxic -amyloid peptide in the brain [(124)](#reference124). Similar to the effect of caloric restriction, resveratrol was found to improve [obesity](../../glossary#obesity) and [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus)-related metabolic deregulations via the activation of and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [(125)](#reference125), as well as to promote the AMPK-dependent clearance of -amyloid peptide in the brain of an AD mouse model [(60)](#reference60). Resveratrol has also exhibited additional neuroprotective properties in cultured cells and animal models (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Although resveratrol [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) to the brain is uncertain [(78)](#reference78), a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study has reported an increase in [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebral) blood flow in the prefrontal cortex of healthy young subjects (ages, 18-29 years) following a single oral dose of 500 mg of resveratrol. However, resveratrol intake did not improve performance in [cognitively](../../glossary#cognitive) demanding tasks undertaken during the post-administration period [(126)](#reference126). More recently, the co-administration of resveratrol (200 mg/day) and quercetin (320 mg/day) for 26 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study significantly improved measures of memory function and enhanced blood [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) control in 46 healthy, overweight older adults (ages, 50-80 years; BMI, 25-30 kg/m2) [(127)](#reference127). Additional evidence of the of resveratrol to mimic the metabolic benefits of caloric restriction on cognitive health may come from ongoing [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in both healthy older individuals and AD patients [(128)](#reference128). More than one out of three American adults has [impaired glucose tolerance](../../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) (also known as prediabetes), which places them at increased risk of developing type 2 [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(129)](#reference129). Impaired glucose tolerance is associated with [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance) in skeletal muscle \u2014 the major peripheral tissue for [insulin](../../glossary#insulin)-mediated [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) uptake \u2014 as well as defective insulin secretion by [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) -cells. Muscle insulin resistance, which is thought to be the earliest stage in the development of type 2 diabetes, is characterized by excess [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) exposure, impaired insulin [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling), impaired glucose uptake, [mitochondrial](../../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction, reduced [fatty acid](../../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../../glossary#oxidation), and increased expression of pro-inflammatory [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine). In animal studies, resveratrol has been shown to improve [insulin sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitivity), glucose tolerance, and lipid profiles in obese and/or metabolically abnormal animals (reviewed in [130](#reference130)). In humans, short-term [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) with resveratrol has been associated with beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, the effect of oral resveratrol supplementation (1,000 mg/day for 45 days) on the control of glucose metabolism was assessed in 70 subjects with type 2 diabetes [(131)](#reference131). Comparison of changes between baseline and end-of-study measures between placebo and intervention groups showed that resveratrol significantly lowered both fasting glucose and fasting insulin concentrations and improved measures of glycemic control ( [HbA1c](../../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c) level) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR). In addition, the level of [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol was increased while the level of [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol and [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) were significantly reduced. No changes were found in measures of [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure), total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglyceride), and markers of liver function [(131)](#reference131). Additionally, in a randomized, [open-label](../../glossary#open-label-trial), and controlled study, the effect of oral resveratrol (250 mg/day) on glycemic control and lipid metabolism was assessed in 62 type 2 diabetics [(132)](#reference132). During the three-month study period, changes in biochemical and clinical parameters, including fasting glucose concentration, HbA1c level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, were significantly improved with resveratrol compared to control (i.e., no resveratrol). Doses as low as 10 mg/day of resveratrol also resulted in lower insulin resistance in a four-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 19 male subjects with type 2 diabetes [(133)](#reference133). Obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m2) is a well-known risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. A few clinical studies have evaluated the effects of resveratrol on key metabolic variables in overweight or obese subjects with no overt metabolic dysfunction and found little or no metabolic benefits following resveratrol treatment [(134-136)](#reference134). Yet, at present, there is no available evidence to suggest whether overweight or obese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance could benefit from resveratrol supplements and reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes [(137)](#reference137). Current data suggest that resveratrol could improve specific metabolic variables in individuals with type 2 diabetes [(138, 139)](#reference138), but more research is needed to assess its effect in individuals at risk for diabetes, including obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Resveratrol is found in grapes, wine, grape juice, peanuts, cocoa, and berries of Vaccinium species, including blueberries, bilberries, and cranberries [(140-143)](#reference140). In grapes, resveratrol is found only in the skins [(144)](#reference144). The amount of resveratrol in grape skins varies with the grape cultivar, its geographic origin, and exposure to fungal infection [(145)](#reference145). The amount of [fermentation](../../glossary#fermentation) time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is also an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Because grape skins are removed early during the production process of white and ros\u00e9 wines, these wines generally contain less resveratrol than red wines [(4)](#reference4). Therefore, because of variations between types of wine, vintages, and regions, it is very difficult to provide accurate estimates of resveratrol content in the thousands of wines from worldwide wineries. Yet, it appears that resveratrol content in wine is usually low, highly variable and unpredictable, and resveratrol is only a minor compound in the complete set of grape and wine polyphenols [(13)](#reference13). The predominant form of resveratrol in grapes and grape juice is trans-resveratrol-3-O--glucoside (trans-piceid), and wines contain significant amounts of resveratrol aglycones, thought to be the result of sugar cleavage during fermentation [(3](#reference3), [140)](#reference140). Many wines also contain significant amounts of cis-resveratrol (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above), which may be produced during fermentation or released from viniferins (resveratrol polymers) [(146)](#reference146). Red wine is a relatively rich source of resveratrol, but other polyphenols are present in red wine at considerably higher concentrations than resveratrol (see the article on [Flavonoids](flavonoids#food-sources)) [(147)](#reference147). Estimates of resveratrol content of some beverages and foods are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. These values should be considered approximate since the resveratrol content of foods and beverages can vary Most resveratrol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) available in the US contain extracts of the root of Polygonum cuspidatum, also known as Fallopia japonica, Japanese knotweed, or Hu Zhang [(150)](#reference150). Red wine extracts and grape extracts (from Vitis vinifera) containing resveratrol and other polyphenols are also available as dietary supplements. Resveratrol supplements may contain anywhere from less than 1 milligram (mg) to 500 mg of resveratrol per tablet or capsule, but it is not known whether there is a safe and effective dosage for chronic disease prevention in humans (also see the section on [Safety](#safety)). In rats, daily oral administration of trans-resveratrol at doses up to 700 mg/kg of body weight for 90 days resulted in no apparent adverse effects [(151)](#reference151). Other toxicity studies conducted in animal models estimated that the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for resveratrol was 200 mg/kg/days and 600 mg/kg/day in rats and dogs, respectively [(152)](#reference152). Resveratrol is not known to be toxic or cause significant adverse effects in humans, but there have been only a few controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) to date (reviewed in [153](#reference153)). A trial evaluating the safety of oral trans-resveratrol in 10 subjects found that a single dose of 5,000 mg resulted in no serious adverse effects [(10)](#reference10). In a follow-up study, mild-to-moderate [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects, including nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea, have been reported in participants who consume more than 1,000 mg/day of resveratrol for up to 29 consecutive days [(11)](#reference11). Mild diarrhea was also reported in six out of eight individuals who consumed 2,000 mg of resveratrol twice daily for two periods of eight days in an [open-label](../../glossary#open-label-trial) and within subject-control study [(16)](#reference16). The safety of resveratrol-containing [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy and lactation has not been established [(150)](#reference150). Because there is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption at any stage of pregnancy [(154)](#reference154), pregnant women should avoid consuming wine as a source of resveratrol. Until more is known about the [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) activity of resveratrol in humans, women with a history of estrogen-sensitive [cancers](../../glossary#cancer), such as breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers, should resveratrol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) (see [Estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities](#estrogenic-anti-estrogenic-activities)) (i.e., from [supplements](../../glossary#supplement)) could increase the risk of bruising and bleeding when taken with [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) involved in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of a broad range of compounds, from [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) molecules to therapeutic agents. The most abundant CYP isoform in the human liver and intestines is cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which [catalyzes](../../glossary#catalyze) the metabolism of about half of all marketed drugs in the US [(156)](#reference156). Resveratrol has been reported to inhibit CYP3A4 activity [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(157, 158)](#reference157) and in healthy Therefore, high intakes of resveratrol (i.e., from [supplements](../../glossary#supplement)) could potentially reduce the metabolic clearance of drugs that undergo extensive first-pass metabolism by CYP3A4, hence increasing the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of toxicity of these drugs. Some of the many drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 include HMG-CoA drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction (sildenafil). Of note, a recently completed [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) (NCT01173640) examined the potential for single and multiple doses of resveratrol (1,000 mg) to interfere with the metabolism of midazolam in healthy volunteers, and results are soon to be published [(153)](#reference153). Other CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP2D6 and CYP2C9) may also be inhibited by resveratrol (reviewed in [159](#reference159)). Finally, resveratrol was found to be a weak inducer of the expression and activity of CYP1A2, which catalyzes the metabolism of several drugs, including acetaminophen (paracetamol) and the antidepressant drugs, clomipramine and imipramine [(28](#reference28), [156)](#reference156). This suggests that resveratrol may interfere with CYP1A2-mediated drug metabolism by increasing drug clearance, possibly lowering circulating drug concentrations below therapeutic levels.

For this reason, they are classified as [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) \u2014 plant-derived compounds with estrogenic activity [(1)](#references). Isoflavones are the major [flavonoids](flavonoids) found in [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), particularly soybeans. In soybeans, isoflavones are present as glycosides, i.e., bound to a sugar molecule. Digestion or [fermentation](../../glossary#fermentation) of soybeans or soy products results in the release of the sugar molecule from the isoflavone [glycoside](../../glossary#glycoside), leaving an called genistein, daidzein, and glycitein (Figure 1). Unless otherwise indicated, quantities of isoflavones specified in this article refer to aglycones \u2014 not glycosides. The article on [Flavonoids](flavonoids) describes some of the factors influencing the absorption, metabolic fate, and [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of flavonoid family members, including isoflavones. [Pharmacokinetic](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies have indicated that [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of daidzein and genistein peaked about six hours after isoflavone intake, preceded by a smaller initial peak one hour post-meal [(2, 3)](#reference2). The initial peak reflects isoflavone absorption [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) of isoflavone [glycosides](../../glossary#glycoside) to [aglycones](../../glossary#aglycone) by -glucosidases in the intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine), while the second peak corresponds to isoflavone aglycones absorbed after the hydrolysis of glycosides by [bacterial](../../glossary#bacteria) the [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(2)](#reference2). composition of one's colonic microbiota can influence the metabolic fate and biological effects of isoflavones. Indeed, the extent of at least some of the potential health benefits of soy intake are thought to depend on one's capacity to convert isoflavones to key [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) during digestion. Specifically, some colonic bacteria can convert the soy isoflavone daidzein to equol, a metabolite that has greater [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) activity than daidzein, and to other metabolites, such as O-desmethylangolensin [O-DMA], that are less estrogenic (Figure 2) [(4, 5)](#reference4). Equol appears in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) about eight hours after isoflavone intake owing to the transit time of daidzein to the colon and its subsequent conversion to equol by the microbiota. Studies measuring urinary equol [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) after soy consumption indicated that equol was produced by about 25%-30% of the adult population in Western countries compared to 50%-60% of adults living in Asian countries and Western adult vegetarians [(4, 6)](#reference4). Note that individuals possessing equol-producing bacteria are called \"equol producers\" as opposed to \"equol non-producers.\" Although prolonged soy food consumption has not been associated with the ability to produce equol, the type of soy food consumed might influence the composition of microbiota to include equol-producing bacteria (discussed in [4](#reference4)). [Estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities] Soy isoflavones are known to have weak [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) or [hormone](../../glossary#hormone)-like activity due to their structural similarity with 17--estradiol (Figure 3). Estrogens are [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signailing) molecules that exert their effects by binding to estrogen [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) within cells (Figure 3). The estrogen-receptor complex interacts [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) to change the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of estrogen-responsive [genes](../../glossary#gene). Estrogen receptors (ER) are present in numerous tissues other than those associated with reproduction, including bone, liver, heart, and brain [(7)](#reference7). Soy isoflavones can preferentially bind to and transactivate estrogen receptor- (ER-) \u2014 rather than ER- \u2014 mimicking the effects of estrogen in some tissues and antagonizing (blocking) the effects of estrogen in others [(8)](#reference8). Scientists are interested in the tissue-selective activities of [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) because anti-estrogenic effects in reproductive tissue could help reduce the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hormone-associated cancers (breast, uterine, and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate)), while estrogenic effects in other tissues could help maintain [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) and improve blood [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profiles (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). The extent to which soy isoflavones exert estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects in humans is currently the focus of considerable scientific research. Soy isoflavones and their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) also have biological activities that are unrelated to their interactions with [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) [(9)](#reference9). By inhibiting the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) and activity of certain [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) involved in estrogen [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism), soy isoflavones may alter the activity of [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens and androgens [(10-13)](#reference10). Soy isoflavones to inhibit tyrosine kinases [(14)](#reference14), [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) that play critical roles in the signaling pathways that stimulate cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation). Additionally, isoflavones can act as [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(15)](#reference15), but the extent to which they contribute to the antioxidant status of humans is not yet clear. [Plasma](../../glossary#plasma) F2-isoprostanes, [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of [lipid peroxidation](../../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo), were significantly lower after two weeks of daily consumption of soy protein containing 56 mg of isoflavones than after consumption of soy protein providing only 2 mg of isoflavones [(16)](#reference16). However, daily supplementation with 50 to 100 mg of isolated soy isoflavones did not significantly alter plasma or urinary F2-isoprostane concentrations [(17, 18)](#reference17). Since soy isoflavones are structurally similar to [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen), it has been suggested that they might help protect against [hormone](../../glossary#hormone)-associated [cancers](../../glossary#cancer). High isoflavone intake from soy foods in Asian countries (average range, 25 to 50 mg/day) has been suggested to contribute to reducing the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of breast cancer; in contrast, the incidence of breast cancer remains elevated in Europe, North America, and Australia/New Zealand [(19)](#reference19) where average isoflavone intakes in non-Asian women are generally less than 2 mg/day [(20)](#reference20). Nevertheless, several hereditary and lifestyle factors likely also contribute to this difference [(19, 21)](#reference19). In a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of one [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and seven [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) conducted in Asian populations and in Asian Americans, higher versus lower intakes of dietary soy isoflavones (20 mg/day vs. 5 mg/day) were found to be associated with a 29% reduced risk of breast cancer [(22)](#reference22). In [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) conducted in Western populations, median intake of soy isoflavones was reportedly low (0.3 mg/day) and not associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer [(22, 23)](#reference22). Moreover, a lifelong exposure to isoflavones may be needed to lower the risk of developing breast cancer later in life [(21)](#reference21). This would explain why moderate versus low intakes of isoflavones (10.8 mg/day vs. 0.23 mg/day; cohort followed for a median of 7.4 years) during adulthood was not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in British women enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study [(24)](#reference24). A few case-control studies also reported that early soy exposure \u2014 during childhood and adolescence \u2014 might be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer later in life [(25-28)](#reference25). Further, a meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies suggested that high versus low isoflavone intakes might be associated with a modest reduction in risk of recurrence ( [RR](../../glossary#relative-risk)=0.84, 95% [CI](../../glossary#confidence-interval): 0.71-0.99) in breast cancer survivors (see for breast cancer survivors](#adverse-effects)) [(23)](#reference23). While lower circulating [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) concentrations have been linked to a lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women [(29)](#reference29), a meta-analysis of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in this population found no effect of soy isoflavone supplementation on the circulating concentrations of estrogenic [hormones](../../glossary#hormone), estradiol (21 studies) and estrone (7 studies), and of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG; 17 studies) [(30)](#reference30). Another meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials in 1,287 women found no overall effect of soy isoflavones (40 to 120 mg/day) consumed for six months to three years on mammographic breast density, used as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk [(31)](#reference31). Subgroup analyses showed no effect in postmenopausal women (four studies) but a modest increase in breast density \u2014 of unclear clinical significance \u2014 in premenopausal women (five studies). Further, in a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial, soy isoflavone supplementation (50 mg/day for one year) also failed to affect breast density in women (ages, 30 to 75 years) with breast cancer [(32)](#reference32). There is currently little evidence that taking soy isoflavone supplements decreases the risk of incident and recurrent breast cancer. It is thought that the development of [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) (uterine) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) could be related to prolonged exposure to unopposed [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen), i.e., estrogen not counterbalanced with the [hormone](../../glossary#hormone) progesterone [(33)](#reference33). Excess estrogen relative to progesterone may result in endometrial thickening, a potential [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of estrogen-induced [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and a of Whether high intakes of isoflavones with anti-estrogenic activity in uterine tissue could be associated with a lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of endometrial cancer has been examined in a number of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study). A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of two [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and eight [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) found the highest versus lowest quantile of isoflavone intake to be associated with a 19% lower risk of endometrial cancer [(35)](#reference35). One of the two prospective studies included in the meta-analysis found no association between consumption of total soy foods, [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), and tofu and risk of endometrial cancer in a cohort of 46,027 multiethnic US women (mean age at cohort entry, 61.6 years) followed for a median 13.6 years [(36)](#reference36). Nevertheless, a 34% lower risk of endometrial cancer was found to be associated with the highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of total this cohort [(36)](#reference36). In the second prospective study, no association was observed between the top versus bottom [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of isoflavone intakes (median intakes, risk of endometrial cancer risk in 49,121 Japanese women (ages, 45 to 74 years) [(37)](#reference37). Because the consumption of isoflavones is much lower in non-Asian versus Asian cohorts, comparisons among populations are quite problematic and limit the scope of pooled analyses of observational studies [(38)](#reference38). Finally, a recent meta-analysis of 23 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no overall effect of isoflavone supplementation (5 to 154 mg/day) for up to three years on endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women [(39)](#reference39). Nevertheless, a subgroup analysis of 10 trials showed that supplementation of postmenopausal women with isoflavone doses >54 mg/day of isoflavones could significantly decrease endometrial thickness [(39)](#reference39). Although limited evidence from case-control studies showed an [inverse relationship](../../glossary#inverse-association) between consumption of soy foods and endometrial cancer, there is little evidence from [intervention trials](../../glossary#intervention-trial) to suggest that taking soy isoflavone supplements could decrease the risk of endometrial cancer. Incidence rates of [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) are much higher in Northern America, Northern and Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand compared to Asian countries, such as Japan and China, where isoflavone-rich soybeans are common components of the diet [(19)](#reference19). Soy food consumption has been associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of prostate cancer in recent pooled analyses of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) [(40, 41)](#reference40). In a study of 19 men with prostate cancer, daily soy supplementation resulted in soy isoflavone concentrations six-fold higher in prostate tissue than in [serum](../../glossary#serum) [(42)](#reference42). The results of cell culture and animal studies have suggested a potential role for soy isoflavones in limiting the progression of prostate cancer (reviewed in [43](#reference43)). A number of small, short-term [randomized controlled interventions](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the effect of soy foods/isoflavones on [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of prostate cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) [(44)](#reference44). Compared to supplementation with milk protein, consumption of a diet supplemented with soy protein isolate high in isoflavones (~107 mg/day) limited the rise in androgen [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) density in prostate tissue after six months but did not modify prostatic estrogen receptor- expression or circulating sex steroid hormone profile in men at high risk of developing prostate cancer [(45)](#reference45). In addition, dietary soy protein supplementation had no effect on [prostate-specific antigen](../../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) in serum or markers of cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) in premalignant tissue. Yet, supplemental soy protein isolate \u2014 regardless of isoflavone content \u2014 for six months resulted in a lower cancer incidence compared to milk control [(46)](#reference46). In a multicenter, randomized, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 158 Japanese men (ages, 50 to 75 years) with negative prostate biopsy but rising serum PSA, supplemental isoflavones (60 mg/day) for one year had no effect on circulating concentrations of PSA and sex steroid hormones, or on the overall incidence of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer incidence was found to be significantly lower with isoflavones compared to placebo in the subset of men aged 65 years and older [(47)](#reference47). Some trials found that supplementation with soy products, soy dietary proteins, or soy isoflavones could reduce or slow down the rising of serum PSA concentration in men with localized prostate cancer prior to therapy [(48-50)](#reference48), as well as in those with PSA biochemical recurrence following radiotherapy and/or prostatectomy [(51-53)](#reference51). However, other trials failed to show an effect of soy food/isoflavones on serum PSA in prostate cancer patients prior to [(54, 55)](#reference54) or after therapy [(56-58)](#reference56). [Clinical studies](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have also failed to show a protective effect of soy isoflavones on circulating concentrations of sex hormones (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in patients with prostate cancer [(44)](#reference44). Pooled analyses of current data are hindered by the [heterogeneity](../../glossary#heterogeneous) in soy/soy isoflavone preparations and dosage regimens in short-term interventions (mostly 6 months) in small sample-size trials. Therefore, despite a good safety profile for supplemental soy isoflavones and soy proteins in prostate cancer patients, larger randomized controlled trials with longer periods of intervention are required to assess whether soy isoflavones could influence the development and/or progression of prostate cancer. More information about soy foods and prostate cancer risk may be found in the article on [Legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes#prostate-cancer-prevention). The decline in [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) production that accompanies menopause places middle-aged women at [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [osteopenia](../../glossary#osteopenia) and [osteoporosis](../../glossary#osteoporosis). The measurement [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) loss by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is generally used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis [(59)](#reference59). Whether the estrogenic properties of soy isoflavones might play any role in preserving bone health and preventing bone loss is unclear. To date, the results of [observational](../../glossary#observational-study) and [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) examining the potential protection of soy isoflavones against BMD loss have been inconsistent. A recent review by Zheng et al. [(60)](#reference60) discussed some potential factors relative to study design (e.g., intervention duration, isoflavone dosages) and target populations (e.g., ethnic and genetic differences, hormonal status) that could explain the conflicting study results. For instance, the results of short-term (6 months) [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) assessing the effects of increased soy intake on biochemical markers of bone formation and bone [resorption](../../glossary#resorption) are inconsistent. Some controlled trials in postmenopausal women have found that increasing intakes of soy foods, soy protein, or soy isoflavones improved markers of bone resorption and formation [(61-64)](#reference61) or attenuated bone loss [(64, 65)](#reference64), but other trials have found no significant benefit of increasing soy intakes [(66-69)](#reference66). Trials of longer duration also showed conflicting [results.](#reference60) A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (trial duration, 12 to 24 months) concluded that a mean dose of 87 mg/day of soy isoflavones resulted in no significant changes in [lumbar spine](../../glossary#lumbar-spine), total hip, or [femoral neck](../../glossary#femoral-neck) BMD of postmenopausal women [(70)](#reference70). Mixed results also emerged from studies conducted in different ethnic populations. Compared to Caucasian women, the incidence of hip [fractures](../../glossary#fracture) tend to be lower among Asian women who are habitual soy food consumers [(71, 72)](#reference71), suggesting that long-term soy food consumption might protect against bone loss or osteoporotic fracture [(73, 74)](#reference73). Moreover, pooled analyses combining intervention trials in Caucasian and Asian postmenopausal women reported significant increases in BMD with supplemental soy isoflavones [(75-77)](#reference75). In contrast, a meta-analysis of 12 placebo-controlled trials in Caucasian postmenopausal women found no effect of soy isoflavone supplementation (dose range, 52 to 120 mg/day) for six months to three years on lumbar spine BMD [(78)](#reference78). The rate of bone loss is not linear during the 10-year period surrounding the final menstrual period and is especially increased during the menopausal transition, starting about one year before to two years after the final menstrual period. Surprisingly, the recent US Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) that followed Black, White, Japanese, and Chinese women reported that Japanese women with the highest versus lowest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of dietary isoflavone intakes (median intakes, 36.3 mg/day versus 4 mg/day) had an increased rate of BMD loss during menopause transition [(79)](#reference79). In other ethnic groups, no such associations could be found between habitual dietary isoflavone intakes and the rate of bone loss before, after, or during menopause transition [(79)](#reference79). Most meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials to date have reported a weak, positive effect of supplemental soy isoflavones on BMD in postmenopausal women [(70](#reference70), [75-77)](#reference75). Yet, it remains to be elucidated whether supplementation with soy isoflavones might be of any benefit to perimenopausal/early postmenopausal women before the acute loss of estrogen or to older postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis [(60)](#reference60). Finally, some authors have proposed that the effect of soy isoflavones on bone health may be dependent on whether or not the individual produces the daidzein [metabolite](../../glossary#metabolite), equol (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(80-84)](#reference80). However, a randomized controlled trial found that supplementation with soy isoflavones increased calcium retention capacity in postmenopausal women regardless of their equol-producing capacity [(85)](#reference85). At present, the clinical benefits of soy isoflavones as an alternative to bone-sparing treatments in women undergoing menopause remain to be determined. To date, large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), mainly in Asian populations, investigating whether habitual soy food/isoflavone consumption is related to the incidence of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction), have found mixed results. In the Japan Public Health Center-based Study (mean follow-up, 13.5 years), consumption of soy foods was associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) in Japanese women (ages, 40 to 59 years) \u2014 but not in men. In this cohort, the highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of soy isoflavone intakes was found to be associated with a 65% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a 63% lower risk of myocardial infarction in women [(86)](#reference86). In addition, an early data analysis of 64,915 Chinese women (ages 40 to 70 years) enrolled in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) found an [inverse relationship](../../glossary#inverse-association) between soy food intake and risk of incident CHD during a 2.5-year follow-up period [(87)](#reference87). However, a higher soy protein intake was associated with a higher risk of incident CHD in 55,474 Chinese men (ages, 40 to 74 years) from the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS; mean follow-up of 5.4 years) [(88)](#reference88). Moreover, a recent report of the SWHS cohort followed for 10 years reported a 24% higher risk of ischemic stroke with the highest versus lowest quintile of isoflavone (mean [nested studies](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) within both Shanghai prospective studies found no correlations between soy food intake and incident CVD events when measures of urinary isoflavonoids were used as a more objective estimate of isoflavone exposure compared to dietary assessment with [food-frequency questionnaires](../../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) [(89, 90)](#reference89). Further, no significant associations were found between long-term soy food, soy protein, and soy isoflavone consumption and CHD-, stroke-, and total CVD-related mortality in a 14.7-year follow-up of 60,298 participants of the Singapore Chinese Health Study [(91)](#reference91). Low consumption of soy foods in Western cohorts makes it more difficult to analyze possible longitudinal associations between isoflavone intake and CVD incidence or mortality in these populations [(92-95)](#reference92). A number of [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined soy intake in relation to several cardiometabolic [risk](../../glossary#risk) factors. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) concluded that intake of either soy products (i.e., whole soybeans, soy milk, nuts, oil, and flour), soy protein isolate, or soy isoflavones for one month to one year could significantly improve [serum](../../glossary#serum) [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profiles in healthy and hypercholesterolemic individuals by lowering circulating triglycerides, total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol, and by increasing [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol [(96)](#reference96). Further analyses suggested that soy protein without isoflavones was more effective at lowering total and LDL-cholesterol than soy protein containing isoflavones, and the consumption of soy isoflavones alone (as [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) or extracts) showed no significant effects on serum lipid profiles [(96)](#reference96). In addition, a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) indicated that neither soy foods nor soy isoflavones could lower blood [homocysteine](../../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, a known risk factor for CVD, in high-risk middle-aged and older adults [(97)](#reference97). Another meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled studies reported a reduction in circulating [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) \u2014 an [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) marker associated with increased cardiovascular risk \u2014 following soy isoflavone intake (from soy foods or isoflavone extracts) in postmenopausal women with elevated baseline CRP concentrations (>2.2 mg/L) [(98)](#reference98). In a recent six-month 253 postmenopausal equol-producing women with prehypertension, supplementation with whole soy \u2014 but not daidzein \u2014 improved lipid profiles and lowered the concentrations of CRP [(99)](#reference99). Whether potential cardiovascular benefits of soy isoflavone intake depend on individuals' capacity to produce isoflavone [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (like equol) needs to be more closely examined. Current evidence suggests that whole soy components other than isoflavones may have favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors. The preservation of normal arterial function plays an important role in [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) prevention. The ability of all types of blood vessels, including arteries, to dilate in response to [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) produced by the [endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells that line their inner surface is compromised in people at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for cardiovascular disease [(100)](#reference100). In the presence of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk factors (e.g., [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), hypercholesterolemia, [hyperglycemia](../../glossary#hyperglycemia)), impaired endothelial function results in widespread [vasodilation](../../glossary#vasodilation) and [coagulation](../../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities and is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis). Measures of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a surrogate marker of endothelial function, have been found to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with risk of future cardiovascular events [(101)](#reference101). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine small [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found that supplementation with soy isoflavones (50 to 99 mg/day; isolated or from isoflavone-containing soy protein) for a median eight-week period significantly increased brachial FMD, especially in postmenopausal women with low FMD levels [(102)](#reference102). A more inclusive meta-analysis of 17 trials in either healthy individuals or in individuals with [hyperlipidemia](../../glossary#hyperlipidemia) showed an increase of FMD with the intake of isolated isoflavones but not of isoflavones-containing soy protein [(103)](#reference103). Arterial stiffness or impaired arterial distensibility, another marker of vascular damage and an indicator of cardiovascular disease risk, is generally assessed using measures of aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV) [(104)](#reference104). Some, but not trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have suggested that supplementation with isoflavone-containing soy protein or isoflavone extracts might significantly decrease arterial stiffness [(105-107)](#reference105). A recent randomized, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study found that carotid-femoral PWV could be significantly reduced 24 hours after a single oral intake of 80 mg of soy isoflavones but only in participants able to produce equol [(3)](#reference3). Long-term interventions are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of such a result. Finally, whether whole soy or isoflavones reduce the burden of [subclinical](../../glossary#subclinical) atherosclerosis [(99](#reference99), [108)](#reference108) and lower blood pressure [(109)](#reference109) in individuals at high CVD risk requires further examination. Scientific research on the effect of soy isoflavones on [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) function has been recently reviewed by Soni et al. [(110)](#reference110). An [observational study](../../glossary#observational-study) \u2014 the Honolulu-Asia Asian Study \u2014 that examined the relationship between soy intake and cognitive function found that Hawaiian men who reported consuming tofu (non-fermented soy product) at least twice weekly during midlife were more likely to have poor cognitive test scores 20 to 25 years later than those who reported consuming tofu less than twice a week [(111)](#reference111). In an Indonesian study of elderly men and women, consumption of tofu was associated with worse memory, while consumption of tempeh (fermented soy) was associated with improved memory [(112)](#reference112). In the multicenter, [prospective](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), SWAN [phytoestrogen](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) ancillary study, the highest versus lowest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of isoflavone intakes was found to be associated with better scores in the processing speed test but worse scores in the verbal memory test in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal Asian women [(79)](#reference79). The results of several [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have been mixed. In a review of 12 trials, only half reported an improvement in cognitive function with soy isoflavone supplementation [(110)](#reference110). Postmenopausal women given soy extracts, providing 60 mg/day of soy isoflavones for 6 to 12 weeks, performed better on cognitive tests of picture recall (short-term memory), learning rule reversals (mental flexibility), and a planning task compared to women given a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(113, 114)](#reference113). In a longer trial, postmenopausal women given [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) that provided 110 mg/day of soy isoflavones for six months performed better on a test of verbal fluency than women given placebos [(115)](#reference115). In a [cross-over trial](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) lasting six months, women receiving 60 mg/day of soy isoflavones experienced significant improvements in cognitive performance and overall mood compared to when the women were given a placebo [(116)](#reference116). However, in larger placebo-controlled trials, 80 mg/day of isoflavones for six months [(117)](#reference117) or 99 mg/day of isoflavones for one year [(118)](#reference118) did not affect performance on a battery of cognitive function tests, including tests for memory, attention, verbal fluency, motor control, and [dementia](../../glossary#dementia) in postmenopausal women. In addition, in the 30-month Women's Isoflavone Soy Health trial in 313 postmenopausal women, daily supplementation with 91 mg of soy isoflavones significantly improved visual memory but failed to improve other aspects of cognition or global cognition [(119)](#reference119). Nevertheless, a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 randomized controlled trials found a significant improvement in the pooled summary of cognitive function tests in healthy postmenopausal women supplemented with 60 to 160 mg/day of soy isoflavones for 6 to 30 months [(120)](#reference120). There has been little investigation regarding the potential effects of soy isoflavones in individuals with cognitive impairments [(121)](#reference121). Menopause-related vasomotor symptoms, including hot flashes (flushes) and sweats, affect over 75% of middle-aged US women [(122)](#reference122). Concern over potential adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy [(123, 124)](#reference123) has led to an increased interest in the use of [phytoestrogen](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in the management of menopausal symptoms [(125)](#reference125). To date, the effects of increasing soy isoflavone intake on the frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms have been examined in over 60 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of small sample size [(126)](#reference126). The results of these trials have been mixed, as reflected by the conclusions of several [systematic reviews](../../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analyses](../../glossary#meta-analysis) published in the last decade [(125](#reference125), [127-134)](#reference127). However, a systematic Cochrane review published in 2013 concluded that supplements containing primarily genistein (four studies; 30 to 60 mg/day for 12 weeks to one year) \u2014 but not dietary soy (13 studies), soy isoflavone extracts (12 studies), or red clover extracts (nine studies) \u2014 significantly reduced the frequency of hot flashes [(131)](#reference131). This result was consistent with previous analyses reporting alleviation of hot flashes in higher- rather than lower-genistein supplementation trials [(126](#reference126), [133, 134)](#reference133). Nevertheless, in Taku et al. [(133)](#reference133), supplemental soy isoflavone extract (30 to 80 mg/day for six weeks to one year) was found to result in a net 17.4% reduction in hot flash frequency in 13 [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials (1,196 women). In addition, the meta-analysis of nine trials (988 women) showed a 30.5% reduction in hot flash severity with soy isoflavone extracts (30 to 135 mg/day for 12 weeks to one year) [(133)](#reference133). Moreover, the observation that longer trials showed a greater efficacy of soy isoflavones was confirmed in a recent model-based meta-analysis by Li et al. [(135)](#reference135). In this analysis of 16 studies, the authors estimated that supplementation with soy isoflavones required 48 weeks of treatment, compared to only 12 weeks for estradiol, in order to achieve close to 80% of its maximum effect [(135)](#reference135). Besides, the maximum effect of soy isoflavones was found to account for only 57% of the maximum effect of estradiol [(135)](#reference135). Evidence from [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggested that one's ability to produce equol might contribute to reducing the occurrence or severity of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(136, 137)](#reference136). Several relatively small [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the potential of equol to relieve these symptoms (reviewed in [138)](#reference138). A recent study in Chinese postmenopausal and equol-producing women showed no benefits of daily supplementation with soy flour (40 g) or daidzein (63 mg) for six months on the frequency or severity of menopausal symptoms [(139)](#reference139). Yet, an earlier randomized controlled study found that, compared to equol non-producing women, those able to produce equol experienced improvements in menopausal symptoms like hot flashes following soy isoflavone supplementation (135 mg/day) for six months [(140)](#reference140). In addition, the 12-week administration of 10 mg/day of equol to equol non-producing Japanese women experiencing three or more daily hot flashes significantly reduced the frequency and severity of hot flashes and neck and shoulder muscle stiffness compared to a placebo [(141)](#reference141). In another study, daily supplementation with soy isoflavone (containing 24 mg of daidzein and 22 mg of genistein) or equol (10, 20, or 40 mg) supplements over an eight-week period resulted in equivalent reductions of the frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women with five or more daily hot flashes; however, 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day of equol supplements proved to be more effective than soy isoflavone supplements in the subgroup of women experiencing eight or more hot flashes per day [(142)](#reference142). Nevertheless, because this study lacked an inert placebo control group, the results should be viewed with caution. At present, supplements containing sufficient amounts of genistein may help alleviate vasomotor symptoms in women transitioning through menopause [(126,](#reference126) [143)](#reference143). Isoflavones are found in small amounts in a number of [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), grains, and vegetables, but soybeans are by far the most concentrated source of isoflavones in the human diet [(144, 145)](#reference144). Average dietary isoflavone intakes in Japan, China, and other Asian countries range from 25 to 50 mg/day [(20)](#reference20). Dietary isoflavone intakes are considerably lower in Western countries. Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data collected from 36,037 individuals in 10 countries (participating in the EPIC study) showed average isoflavone intakes to be lower than 1 mg/day [(146)](#reference146). Compared to other European countries, the isoflavone intake was slightly higher in the British general population (2.3 mg/day) and health-conscious cohort (19.4 mg/day) [(146)](#reference146). Traditional Asian foods from soybeans include tofu, tempeh, miso, and natto. Edamame refers to varieties of soybeans that are harvested and eaten in their green phase. Soy products that are gaining popularity in Western countries include soy-based meat substitutes, soy milk, soy cheese, and soy yogurt. The isoflavone content of a soy protein isolate depends on the method used to isolate it. Soy protein isolates prepared by an ethanol wash process generally lose most of their associated isoflavones, while those prepared by aqueous wash processes tend to retain them [(147)](#reference147). Some foods that are rich in soy isoflavones are listed in Table 1, along with their isoflavone content. Because the isoflavone content of soy foods can vary considerably among brands and among different lots of the same brand [(147)](#reference147), these values should be viewed only as a guide. Given the potential health implications of diets rich in soy isoflavones, accurate and consistent labeling of the soy isoflavone content of soy foods is needed. Of note, foods of animal origin also contain low levels of isoflavones (and other [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen)), derived from animal feeds and pastures [(148)](#reference148). More information on the isoflavone content of foods is available from the [USDA Food Composition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/) website and the USDA Database for the Isoflavone Content of Selected content of soy foods can vary considerably between brands and between different lots of the same brand (147); therefore, these values should be viewed only as a guide.| Soy isoflavone extracts and [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) are available as dietary supplements without a prescription in the US. These products are not standardized, and the amounts of soy isoflavones they provide may vary considerably. Moreover, quality control may be an issue with some of these products [(150)](#reference150). When isoflavone supplements available in the US were tested for their isoflavone content by an independent laboratory, the isoflavone content in the product differed by more than 10% from the amount claimed on the label in approximately 50% of the products tested [(151)](#reference151). Soy protein-based infant formulas are made from soy protein isolate and contain significant amounts of soy isoflavones (Table 2). In 1997, the total isoflavone content of soy-based infant formulas that were commercially available in the US ranged from 32 to 47 mg/liter feed (formerly Wyeth-Ayerst)||8 fl oz.||6.4||1.8||3.9||0.7| Soy isoflavones have been consumed by humans as part of soy-based diets for many years without any evidence of adverse effects [(145)](#reference145). The 75th percentile of dietary isoflavone intake has been reported to be as high as 65 mg/day in some Asian populations [(153)](#reference153). Although diets rich in soy or soy-containing products appear safe and potentially beneficial, the long-term safety of very high [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) doses of soy isoflavones is not yet known. One study in older men and women found that 100 mg/day of soy isoflavones for six months was well tolerated [(154)](#reference154). Yet, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the safety of isoflavones. The safety of high intakes of soy isoflavones and other [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) for breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) survivors is an area of concern among scientists and clinicians. The results of cell culture and animal studies have been conflicting; some preclinical studies showed that soy isoflavones might stimulate the growth of [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptor](../../glossary#receptor)-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells [(155, 156)](#reference155), while others that they might either potentiate [(157, 158)](#reference157) or abrogate the anticancer effects of tamoxifen tissue [(159, 160)](#reference159). Very limited data from [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) suggested that increased consumption of soy isoflavones (38 to 45 mg/day) may show weak estrogenic effects in human breast tissue [(161, 162)](#reference161). However, a study in women with biopsy-confirmed breast cancer found that supplementation with 200 mg/day of soy isoflavones did not increase breast cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) \u2014 a marker of breast cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) \u2014 over the two to six weeks before surgery when compared to a control group that did not take soy isoflavones [(163)](#reference163). A few large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined the association between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer recurrence and survival. In the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study that followed 5,042 female breast cancer survivors for a median of 3.9 years, consumption of isoflavone-rich soy foods was significantly associated with a 29% lower risk of death and a 32% lower risk of cancer recurrence [(164)](#reference164). In this study, soy isoflavone intake was associated with a significant 23% reduced risk of cancer recurrence and a nonsignificant 21% reduced risk of death [(164)](#reference164). A pooled analysis of data from 9,514 breast cancer survivors from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study [(164)](#reference164), the Life After Cancer Epidemiology study [(165)](#reference165), and the Women's Healthy Eating and Living study [(166)](#reference166) found a 25% reduced risk of recurrence with soy isoflavone intakes 10 mg/day (compared to intakes of <4 A subgroup analysis showed that the [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between soy isoflavone intake and recurrence was significant only among women taking the anticancer drug, tamoxifen. No inverse association was reported between soy isoflavone intake and the risks of all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality [(167)](#reference167). Given the available data, some experts think that women with a history of breast cancer, particularly ER+ breast cancer, should not increase their consumption of phytoestrogens, including soy isoflavones [(168)](#reference168). Nevertheless, there is not enough evidence to discourage breast cancer survivors from consuming soy foods in moderation [(143](#reference143), [169)](#reference169). Infant formula made from soy protein isolate has been commercially available since the mid-1960s [(170)](#reference170). As much as 25% of the infant formula sold in the US is soy protein-based formula [(171)](#reference171). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports the use of soy protein isolate-based formula for normal growth and development of term infants whose needs are not being met by human milk or cow's milk-based formulas [(171)](#reference171). Soy protein-based formulas are especially indicated for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency, but they have no proven value in the prevention or management of infantile colic and fussiness [(171)](#reference171). Since infants fed soy-based formulas are exposed to relatively high levels of isoflavones [(152)](#reference152), which they can absorb and [metabolize](../../glossary#metabolism), concern has been raised regarding potential long-term effects on anthropometric growth, bone health, as well as reproductive, [endocrine](../../glossary#endocrine-system), and immune functions [(152](#reference152), [172)](#reference172). In addition to the AAP review [(171)](#reference171), a recent [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of data published between 1909 and 2013 found no clinical concerns regarding nutritional adequacy, sexual development, thyroid disease, immune function, and neurodevelopment in infants fed soy protein-fed formulas [(173)](#reference173). Specifically, this review identified 14 [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) comparing infants fed soy-based formula with infants fed human milk or cow's milk-based formula and found that soy-based formula adequately supported growth and development in the first year of life [(173)](#reference173). In addition, the results of three [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggested no adverse effects of soy protein-based formula on the neurodevelopment of children [(174-176)](#reference174). Two of these observational studies of low-to-moderate quality also reported associations between soy protein-based formula intake and marginal adverse events, including early [menarche](../../glossary#menarche) [(176, 177)](#reference176) and increased duration of menstrual bleeding [(176)](#reference176). A recent [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (the Beginnings study) examining the effects of early infant feeding on reproductive organ development during childhood found no differences in the volume and structure of the reproductive organs of 101 five-year-old boys and girls who were either breastfed or fed soy protein- or cow's milk-based formula as infants [(178)](#reference178). Finally, no adverse health effects have been associated with the presence of phytates and aluminum in soy protein-based formulas fed to full-term infants (reviewed in [173](#reference173)). At present, there is no convincing evidence that infants fed soy protein-based formula are at greater [risk](../../glossary#risk) for adverse effects than infants fed cow's milk-based formula. Nonetheless, if current evidence shows a safety profile for use of soy protein-based formulas in term infants, they are not designed or recommended for preterm infants [(171)](#reference171). Also, recent preliminary findings suggesting potential links between consumption of soy protein-based formulas and adverse effects in autistic children deserve further investigation [(179, 180)](#reference179). Claims that soy food/isoflavone consumption can have adverse effects on male reproductive function, including feminization, erectile dysfunction, and infertility, are primarily based on animal studies and [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) [(181)](#reference181). Exposure to isoflavones (including at levels above typical Asian dietary intakes) has not been shown to affect either the concentrations of [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) and testosterone, or the quality of sperm and semen [(181, 182)](#reference181). Thorough reviews of the literature found no basis for concern but emphasized the need for long-term, large scale comprehensive human studies [(181, 183)](#reference181). In cell culture and animal studies, soy isoflavones have been found to inhibit the activity of [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) peroxidase, an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) required for thyroid However, high intakes of soy isoflavones do not appear to increase the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hypothyroidism as long as dietary iodine consumption is adequate [(186)](#reference186). Since the addition of iodine to soy-based formulas in the 1960s, there have been no further reports of hypothyroidism in soy formula-fed infants [(187)](#reference187). Several [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial), mostly in women with sufficient iodine intakes, have not found increased consumption of soy isoflavones to result in clinically significant changes in circulating thyroid hormone concentrations [(188-192)](#reference188). To date, studies have not examined the effect of an isoflavone-rich diet on fetal development or pregnancy outcomes in humans, and the safety of isoflavone [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy has not been established. [Fermented](../../glossary#fermentation) soy foods contain highly variable amounts of the biologically active amine, tyramine, which is [catabolized](../../glossary#catabolism) in the body by monoamine oxidase [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) (MAO) and [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in the urine. The ingestion of very high amount of tyramine may saturate the detoxification system and lead to clinical symptoms of intoxication. Because individuals taking MAO inhibitors (MAOIs; phenelzine, tranylcypromine) are at greater [risk](../../glossary#risk) of adverse effects, they should avoid consuming fermented soy products [(193, 194)](#reference193). Because [colonic](../../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) play an important role in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of soy isoflavones, antibiotic therapy could decrease their biological activity [(193)](#reference193). Some evidence from animal studies suggested that high intakes of soy isoflavones, particularly genistein, could interfere with the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (Nolvadex) [(159)](#reference159). Yet, a recent pooled analysis of three [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that the risk of recurrence in breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) survivors was reduced to a greater extent with soy isoflavone intake in tamoxifen users than in nonusers (see [Safety for breast cancer survivors](#adverse-effects)) [(167)](#reference167). Nonetheless, until more is known about potential interactions in humans, those taking tamoxifen or other selective [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) modulators (SERMs) to treat or prevent breast cancer should be cautious and seek medical advice regarding the use of soy protein [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) or isoflavone extracts [(193)](#reference193). High intakes of soy protein may interfere with the efficacy of the [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) medication warfarin. There is one [case report](../../glossary#case-report) of an who developed subtherapeutic normalized ratio](../../glossary#international-normalized-ratio) (INR; prothrombin time) values upon consuming ~16 ounces of soy milk daily for four weeks [(195)](#reference195). INR values returned to therapeutic levels two weeks after discontinuing soy milk. The amount of levothyroxine required for adequate [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../../glossary#hormone) replacement has been found to increase in infants with [congenital hypothyroidism](../../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) fed soy formula [(187](#reference187), [196)](#reference196). Taking levothyroxine at the same time as a soy protein supplement also increased the levothyroxine dose required for adequate thyroid hormone replacement in an adult with hypothyroidism [(197)](#reference197). Regular consumption of a diet high in soy \u2014 rather than supplementation with isoflavone extracts or isoflavone containing isolated soy protein \u2014 may help lower fasting [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) concentrations [(198)](#reference198). It is unknown whether individuals taking antidiabetic agents might be at risk of hypoglycemia if they follow a soy-based meal replacement plan rather than a diet plan recommended by the American Diabetes Association [(199)](#reference199).

Plants use chlorophyll to trap light needed for photosynthesis [(1)](#references). The basic structure of chlorophyll is a porphyrin ring similar to that of [heme](../../glossary#heme) in [hemoglobin](../../glossary#hemoglobin), although the central atom in chlorophyll is [magnesium](../../minerals/magnesium) instead of [iron](../../minerals/iron). The long hydrocarbon (phytol) tail attached to the porphyrin ring makes chlorophyll fat-soluble and insoluble in water. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b represent about 99% of the chlorophyll species found in edible plants (Figure 1; [2](#reference2)), while some algae and microalgae contain minor quantities chlorophyll c pigments (e.g., Laminaria ochroleuca, Undaria pinnatifida) [(3)](#reference3). Chlorophyll a and b only have a small difference in one of the side chains but an intact phytol tail, while the common characteristic of chlorophyll c isoforms is the absence of a phytol tail. These structural differences cause each type of chlorophyll to absorb light at slightly different wavelengths. Metallo-chlorophyll derivatives, including chlorophyllins, can be chemically synthesized or produced in industrial food processing; these compounds contain [zinc](../../minerals/zinc), iron, or [copper](../../minerals/copper) in place of the central magnesium atom [(2)](#reference2). The most studied chlorophyllin, sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), is a semi-synthetic mixture of sodium copper salts derived from chlorophyll [(4, 5)](#reference4). SCC is often simply called 'chlorophyllin' in the older scientific literature, with newer publications specifying whether iron, zinc, copper, or magnesium chlorophyllin were studied. During its synthesis, the magnesium atom at the center of the ring is replaced with copper (or other metals), and the phytol tail is lost. Unlike natural chlorophyll, chlorophyllins (regardless of the metal used) are water-soluble. Although the content of different SCC mixtures may vary, two compounds commonly found in commercial SCC are trisodium copper chlorin e6 and disodium copper chlorin e4 (Figure 2). Little is known about the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of chlorophyll in humans, although it is known that chlorophyll undergoes extensive metabolism once consumed. Animal model studies show only about 1%-3% of chlorophyll is absorbed, while the rest is [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in the feces, primarily as pheopytin and pyropheophytin metabolites, indicating that significant transformation and microbial metabolism occur in the gastrointestinal tract (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). A recent study in eight healthy adults found pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives in the blood of most subjects following consumption of 1.2 kg boiled spinach, a concentrated source of chlorophyll [(6)](#reference6). Sodium copper chlorophyllin was originally thought to be poorly absorbed because of its lack of apparent toxicity. However, a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that significant amounts of copper chlorin e4 in the [serum](../../glossary#serum) of people taking chlorophyllin tablets (300 mg/day) [(7)](#reference7), indicating that it is indeed absorbed. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies have found chlorin e4 to have a higher stability than chlorin e6 [(2)](#reference2). More research, however, is needed to understand the bioavailability and metabolism of natural chlorophylls and chlorin compounds in synthetic chlorophyllin. Chlorophyll and sodium copper chlorophyllin are able to form tight molecular complexes with certain chemicals known or suspected to cause [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), including polyaromatic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke [(8)](#reference8), some amines found in cooked meat [(9)](#reference9), and aflatoxin-B1 [(10)](#reference10). The binding of chlorophyll or SCC to these potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) may interfere with [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption of potential carcinogens, reducing the amount that reaches susceptible tissues [(11)](#reference11). This has been demonstrated in humans: a [cross-over study](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) in three volunteers that used accelerator mass spectrometry to study the [pharmacokinetics](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) of an ultra-low dose of aflatoxin-B1 found a 150-mg dose of either SCC or chlorophyll could decrease absorption of aflatoxin-B1 [(12)](#reference12). SCC can neutralize several physically relevant [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidant) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(13-16)](#reference13), and limited data from animal studies suggest that SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) may decrease [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) induced by chemical [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) and radiation [(17, 18)](#reference17). While chlorophyll and its derivatives have demonstrated [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity in in vitro assays [(15](#reference15), [19)](#reference19), the relevance of these findings to humans is not clear. To initiate the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), some chemicals ( [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen)) must first be metabolized to active [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) that are capable of damaging [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) or other critical molecules in susceptible tissues. Since [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) in the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) family are required for the activation of some procarcinogens, inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes may decrease the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of some types of chemically induced cancers. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies indicate that SCC may decrease the activity cytochrome P450 enzymes [(8](#reference8), [20, 21)](#reference20). Phase II biotransformation enzymes promote the elimination of potentially harmful toxins and carcinogens from the body. Limited data from animal studies indicate that SCC may increase the activity of the phase II enzyme quinone reductase [(22)](#reference22). One [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) study showed that human [colon](../../glossary#colon) cancer cells undergo cell cycle arrest after treatment with SCC [(23)](#reference23). The mechanism involved inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity. Ribonucleotide reductase plays a pivotal role in [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) synthesis and repair and is a target of currently used cancer therapeutic agents, such as hydroxyurea [(23)](#reference23). While this may provide a potential avenue for SCC in the clinical setting, sensitizing cancer cells to DNA damaging agents, [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) studies are needed. The porphyrin structure of chlorophyll is analogous to the [heme](../../glossary#heme) structure found in blood and muscle tissue. Because heme-bound iron has higher [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) than nonheme iron (the most common form of iron in plant-based sources, e.g., [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), spinach), iron uptake from iron chlorophyll is of interest. Toxicity studies in rats suggest iron chlorophyllin is generally safe for mammalian consumption [(24)](#reference24). [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies demonstrate that iron chlorophyllin is as good as heme in delivering iron to intestinal cells, and significantly better than the most common supplemental form of iron (i.e., ferrous sulfate) when incorporated into most food matrices [(25)](#reference25). However, work in this area is nascent and has not yet been validated in humans. It is also not known if metallo-chlorophyll derivatives of copper or zinc increase absorption of these essential divalent metals. Aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1), a liver [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen) produced by certain species of fungus, is found in moldy grains and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), including corn, peanuts, and soybeans [(4](#reference4), [11)](#reference11). In hot, humid regions of Africa and Asia with improper grain storage facilities, high levels of dietary AFB1 are associated with increased [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [hepatocellular carcinoma](../../glossary#hepatocellular-carcinoma). Moreover, the combination of [hepatitis](../../glossary#hepatitis) B infection and high dietary AFB1 exposure increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma still further. In the liver, AFB1 is metabolized to a carcinogen capable of binding [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and causing [mutations](../../glossary#mutation). In animal models of AFB1-induced liver [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), administration of SCC at the same time as dietary AFB1 exposure significantly reduces AFB1-induced DNA damage in the livers of rainbow trout and rats [(26-28)](#reference26) and dose-dependently inhibits the development of liver cancer in trout [(29)](#reference29). Likewise, natural chlorophyll has also been found to inhibit AFB1-induced liver cancer in the rat [(28)](#reference28). Collectively, this evidence supports a role for SCC and/or chlorophyll itself in limiting cancer initiation. In contrast, data suggest a limited role for SCC in influencing cancer progression. For example, one rat study found that SCC did not protect against aflatoxin-induced liver damage when given after tumor initiation [(30)](#reference30). Because of the long time period between AFB1 exposure and the development of cancer in humans, an [intervention trial](../../glossary#intervention-trial) might require as long as 20 years to determine whether SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) can reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people exposed to high levels of dietary AFB1. However, a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of AFB1-induced DNA damage (AFB1-N7-guanine) can be measured in the urine, and high urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine have been associated with significantly increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma [(31)](#reference31). In order to determine whether chlorophyllin could decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage in humans, a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled intervention trial was conducted in 180 adults residing in a region in China where the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is very high due to unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure and a high [prevalence](../../glossary#prevalence) of chronic hepatitis B infection [(32)](#reference32). Participants took either 100 mg of SCC or a placebo before meals three times daily. After 16 weeks of treatment, urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine were 55% lower in those taking SCC than in those taking the placebo, suggesting that SCC supplementation before meals can substantially decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage. Although a reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma has not yet been demonstrated in humans taking SCC, scientists are hopeful that supplementation will provide some protection to high-risk populations with unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure [(11)](#reference11). It is not known whether SCC will be useful in the prevention of cancers in people who are not exposed to significant levels of dietary AFB1, as is the case for most people living in the US. Many questions remain to be answered regarding the exact mechanisms of cancer prevention by SCC, the implications for the prevention of other types of cancer, and the potential for natural chlorophylls in the diet to provide cancer protection. Observations in the 1940s and 1950s that [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC had deodorizing effects on foul-smelling wounds led clinicians to administer SCC orally to patients with [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy) in order to control fecal odor [(33)](#reference33). While early [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) indicated that SCC doses of 100 to 200 mg/day were effective in reducing fecal odor in ostomy patients [(34, 35)](#reference34), a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial found that 75 mg of oral SCC three times daily was no more effective than placebo in decreasing fecal odor assessed by colostomy patients [(36)](#reference36). Several case reports have been published indicating that oral SCC (100-300 mg/day) decreased subjective assessments of urinary and fecal odor in incontinent patients [(33](#reference33), [37)](#reference37). [Trimethylaminuria](../../glossary#trimethylaminuria) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of trimethylamine, a compound with a \"fishy\" or foul odor. One study in a small number of Japanese patients with trimethylaminuria found that oral SCC (60 mg three times daily) for three weeks significantly decreased urinary trimethylamine concentrations [(38)](#reference38). Research in the 1940s indicated that chlorophyllin slowed the growth of certain [anaerobic](../../glossary#anaerobic) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) in the test tube and accelerated the healing of experimental wounds in animals. These findings led to the use of [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC solutions and ointments in the treatment of persistent open wounds in humans [(39)](#reference39). During the late 1940s and 1950s, a series of largely uncontrolled studies in patients with slow-healing wounds, such as vascular ulcers and pressure (decubitus) ulcers, reported that the application of topical SCC promoted healing more effectively than other commonly used treatments [(40, 41)](#reference40). In the late 1950s, SCC was added to papain and urea-containing ointments used for the chemical debridement of wounds in order to reduce local [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), promote healing, and control odor [(33)](#reference33). SCC-containing papain/urea ointments are still available in the US by prescription [(42)](#reference42). Several studies have reported that such ointments are effective in wound healing [(43)](#reference43). A spray formulation of the papain/urea/SCC therapy is also available [(44)](#reference44). A few small studies have investigated SCC as a topical treatment for various skin conditions. In a [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study) of 10 adults (ages 18-30 years) who had mild-to-moderate [acne vulgaris](../../glossary#acne-vulgaris) and enlarged facial pores, twice daily application of a 0.1% liposomal SCC gel for three weeks improved a number of clinical parameters of the Global Acne Assessment Scale (i.e., facial oiliness, facial blotchiness, presence and size of facial pores, and number of acne lesions) compared to baseline [(45)](#reference45). Additionally, a pilot study in 10 women (ages 40 years or older) with noticeable photodamage and solar lentigines found that twice daily topical application of a gel containing 0.66% SCC complex salts for eight weeks improved various clinical measures, including tactile and visual roughness of facial skin, skin radiance, fine lines, pore size, and overall photodamage [(46)](#reference46). A few [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) have also observed some improvement in facial redness and rosacea with application of topical SCC [(47)](#reference47). While the reports from these studies are interesting, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether SCC may have utility in treating various skin conditions. Chlorophylls are the most abundant pigments in plants, with chlorophyll a being two to four times as prevalent as chlorophyll b [(6](#reference6), [48)](#reference48). Dark-green leafy vegetables like spinach are rich sources of natural chlorophylls. The chlorophyll content of selected vegetables are presented in are often marketed as [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) sources of chlorophyll. Because natural chlorophyll is not as stable as SCC and is much more expensive, most over-the-counter chlorophyll supplements actually contain sodium copper chlorophyllin. Oral preparations of sodium copper chlorophyllin (also called chlorophyllin copper complex) are available as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) and as an over-the-counter drug (Derifil) used to reduce odor from [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy), or to reduce fecal odor due to incontinence [(50)](#reference50). Oral doses of 100 to 300 mg/day in three divided doses have been used to control fecal and urinary odor (see [Therapeutic Uses of Chlorophyllin](#therapeutic-uses)). In the US, SCC is found in minor quantities in some types of green table olives [(51)](#reference51). It is also approved for use as a green color additive in a limited number of foods like chewing gum [(52)](#reference52), as well as in drugs and cosmetics, as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations 21 [(53)](#reference53). In US supermarkets, canned green beans thermally processed in a zinc chloride solution to produce zinc chlorophyll derivatives within the green beans themselves are sold under the trademarked name \"veri-green\" [(54)](#reference54). Because zinc chlorophyll derivatives are more robust to heat and acid treatment, they better retain a bright green color as compared to native magnesium-bound chlorophyll [(48)](#reference48). Natural chlorophylls are not known to be toxic, and no toxic effects have been attributed to chlorophyllin despite more than 50 years of clinical use in humans [(11](#reference11), [33](#reference33), [39)](#reference39). When taken orally, [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) chlorophyll or sodium copper chlorophyllin may cause green discoloration of urine or feces, or yellow or black discoloration of the tongue [(55)](#reference55). There have also been occasional reports of diarrhea related to oral SCC use. When applied [topically](../../glossary#topical) to wounds, SCC has been reported to cause mild burning or itching in some cases [(56)](#reference56). Oral chlorophyllin may result in false positive results on guaiac card tests for occult blood [(57)](#reference57). Since the safety of chlorophyll or chlorophyllin supplements has not been tested in pregnant or lactating women, they should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation.

In addition to providing energy and essential micronutrients, plant-based foods contribute thousands of biologically active phytochemicals (plant chemicals that may affect health) to the human diet. While there is ample evidence to support the health benefits of diets rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts, evidence that these effects are due to specific nutrients or phytochemicals is limited. Although scientists are very interested in the potential for specific phytochemicals to prevent or treat disease, current scientific evidence suggests that plant-based foods are the healthiest phytochemical delivery system. Contents Despite disagreements regarding the optimal components of a healthy diet, the importance of fruit and vegetables is rather undisputed. The results of numerous [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) provide consistent evidence suggesting associations between diets rich in fruit and vegetables and lower [risks](../glossary#risk) of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). On the other hand, evidence that very high doses of individual [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) or [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) found in fruit and vegetables can provide similar health benefits is inconsistent and relatively weak. In addition to essential micronutrients, fruit and vegetables contain thousands of biologically active phytochemicals that are likely to interact in a number of ways to prevent disease and promote health [(1)](#references). Fruit and vegetables are rich in [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), which help protect the body from [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) induced by [pro-oxidants](../glossary#pro-oxidant). The best way to take advantage of these complex interactions is to eat a variety of fruit and vegetables. [Prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have consistently reported [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between high intakes of fruit and vegetables of [cardiovascular 2017 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of prospective cohort studies found a 16% lower risk of CVD with high versus low fruit and vegetable intake and an 8% lower risk with every 200 grams (g)/day increment in daily fruit and vegetable intake in a dose-response analysis [(2)](#reference2). Similar risk reductions were reported for daily 200-g increments in fruit and/or vegetable intake and risks of CHD and stroke [(2)](#reference2). However, regarding primary CVD prevention in high-risk subjects, evidence that increasing intakes of fruit and vegetable can improve cardiovascular risk factors is scarce because of a lack of long-term [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) [(5)](#reference5). In a small 12-week intervention study in 109 overweight adults at high risk for CVD, no differences in blood pressure and [serum](../glossary#serum) lipoprotein](../glossary#LDL) a [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation)) were found between participants consuming two (~160 g), four (~320 g), or seven (~560 g) daily servings of fruit and vegetables [(6)](#reference6). Nonetheless, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which emphasizes fruit, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts, and low-fat dairy, was found to substantially lower [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure)/ [diastolic](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) blood pressures by 11.4/5.5 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) in [hypertensive](../glossary#hypertension) and 3.5/2.1 mm Hg in [normotensive](../glossary#normotensive) people compared to a typical US diet (for additional information on the DASH diet, see the [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash/) website) [(7)](#reference7). Blood pressure lowering effectively reduces CVD risk [(8)](#reference8). Adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern, also characterized by high fruit and vegetable intake, might further contribute to preventing cardiovascular events in healthy and high-risk subjects through normalizing total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in the circulation [(9)](#reference9). A number of compounds may play a part in the cardioprotective effects of fruit and vegetables, including individual micronutrients or phytochemicals has not generally resulted in significantly decreased incidence of cardiovascular events in [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial). Thus, in the case of fruit and vegetables, the benefit of the whole may be greater than the sum of its parts. Of note, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the daily consumption of >400 g of fruit and vegetables as part of a healthy diet low in fat, sugar, and salt (sodium chloride), in order to minimize the risk of certain non-communicable diseases like CVD and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(12)](#reference12). Nearly 10% of the US population is affected by type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and another 34% has [impaired glucose control](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) (prediabetes) that places them at high [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes [(13)](#reference13). Adherence to a Mediterranean-style or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet \u2014 both rich in vegetables, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), fruit, and [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) \u2014 has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes [(14)](#reference14). Yet, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) failed to find any association between intakes of vegetables, legumes, fruit, or nuts and the risk of type 2 diabetes [(15)](#reference15). In contrast, high intakes of whole-grain and dairy foods were linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, while consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat were associated with an increased risk of diabetes [(15)](#reference15). Whether evidence for a potential protective effect of fruit and vegetables regarding type 2 diabetes is more easily detectable when they are combined with other food groups within a diet rather than when their effect is singled out is unclear. A recent meta-analysis of 12 [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and two prospective cohort studies found a 27% lower risk of type 2 diabetes with the consumption of a vegetarian diet [(16)](#reference16). Yet, it is unclear whether the potential benefit of such a diet is linked to the fact that it does not include foods that are associated with a higher diabetes risk (i.e., red and processed meat) and/or because of the inclusion of foods like fruit and vegetables that may be protective. Nevertheless, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk, a prospective study that followed 3,704 participants for nearly 11 years, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes was linked to higher intakes of vegetables (but not fruit), as well as with a greater diversity of consumed fruit and vegetables [(17)](#reference17). A dose-response analysis found an 8% lower risk of diabetes with every increase of two items added to the variety of fruit or vegetables consumed each week [(17)](#reference17). A follow-up study also showed that a composite score reflecting fruit and vegetable consumption, derived from circulating concentrations of vitamin C, -carotene, and lutein, was also [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of type 2 diabetes in this cohort [(18)](#reference18). Without changes in lifestyle behavior, especially regarding dietary habits and physical activity, individuals with prediabetes will eventually progress to develop overt type 2 diabetes. Strategies promoting healthier eating habits to improve glucose control usually encourage the consumption of more fruit and vegetables and the concomitant reduction of sugar and fat intake. The American Diabetes Association does not specifically emphasize an increase in fruit and vegetable intake for diabetes prevention yet recommends dietary strategies that include reducing caloric and fat intake, as well as increasing intake of whole-grain foods and dietary fiber that can be sourced in fruit and vegetables [(19)](#reference19). A plethora of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) has investigated the relationship between intakes of fruit and vegetables and [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing site-specific [cancers](../glossary#cancer). A 2014 report summarized the findings of 27 studies that examined fruit and vegetable consumption in relation to incidental cancer in participants of the ongoing, multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study [(20)](#reference20). This report found the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of fruit intake (356 g/day vs. 89 g/day) to be associated with a 40% lower risk of oropharyngeal, [laryngeal](../glossary#larynx), and [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) cancers and a 20% lower risk of lung cancer. No associations were observed between fruit intake and cancers of the lymphatic system, stomach, [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), breast, cervix, [prostate](../glossary#prostate), or bladder. There were also no inverse associations between intakes of vegetables and risk of cancer. More recently published EPIC data analyses also failed to find significant inverse associations between fruit and/or vegetable intakes and risk of thyroid carcinoma [(24)](#reference24). Further, mixed results from recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies are reported in Table 1, with significant associations noted in bold. Some of the discrepancies might be attributed to study design. Compared to prospective cohort studies, which collect dietary information from participants before they are diagnosed with cancer, retrospective [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) are more susceptible to [bias](../glossary#bias) in the selection of participants (cases and controls) and with dietary recall [(25)](#reference25). For example, this might explain why fruit intake is associated with the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the meta-analysis of six case-control studies but not in that of three cohort studies in the meta-analysis by Li et al. [(26)](#reference26). Inaccurate measurements (introducing measurement bias) and changes in the diet during follow-up in [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) may also contribute to reporting associations that are proven spurious or to missing true associations. A 2012 meta-analysis of prospective studies suggested that, when compared to direct measurements of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) carotenoids, the use of a [food-frequency questionnaire](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) to assess carotenoid intake introduced measurements errors that led to underestimating the strength of the association between carotenoid intake and reduced breast cancer risk [(27)](#reference27). |Type of Cancer||References||Highest versus Lowest Quantile of Intake||Type cancer types|| Aune et al. (2017) | Additional evidence from observational studies, discussed in MIC articles focusing specifically on [cruciferous vegetables](../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables), [garlic](../food-beverages/garlic), [carotenoid](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids)-rich vegetables, and [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes) suggests that high intakes of certain classes of vegetables are associated with reduced risk of individual cancers. The 2007 report from the World Cancer Research Fund International (WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) concluded that fruit and non-starchy vegetables were probably protective against some cancers, recommending a daily consumption of five portions (400 g; based on an average portion weighing 80 g) of a variety of vegetables and fruit [(40)](#reference40). AICR continuously collates evidence from cohort and [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) through its Continuous Update Project (CUP), and updated CUP-derived Cancer Prevention Recommendations are expected to be published in late 2017 [(41)](#reference41). Fruit and vegetables are rich in [precursors](../glossary#precursor) of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), which serve to buffer [acids](../glossary#acidic) in the body. When the quantity of bicarbonate ions is insufficient to maintain normal [pH](../glossary#pH), the body is capable of mobilizing [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline) calcium salts from bone in order to neutralize acids consumed in the diet and generated by [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(42)](#reference42). It has been [hypothesized](../glossary#hypothesis) that higher consumption of fruit and vegetables could help reduce the net acid content of the diet and preserve [calcium](../minerals/calcium) in bones, which might otherwise be mobilized to maintain normal pH to the detriment of bone health. Results from the ancillary DASH-Sodium study, which emphasizes the intake of fruit, vegetables, whole-grain foods, and low-fat dairy, supported a beneficial link between bone health and fruit and vegetable intake. Compared to a control diet, one month-administration of the DASH diet to (pre)hypertensive middle-aged adults significantly lowered the rate of bone turnover, as shown by reduced [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of osteocalcin (OC), a marker of bone formation released by [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) into circulation during the mineralization of newly [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) [collagen](../glossary#collagen). C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) \u2014 a marker of bone resorption released from bone collagen into circulation following bone degradation by osteoclasts \u2014 was also decreased [(43)](#reference43). However, more recent [randomized controlled interventions](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no effect of increasing fruit and vegetable intake on markers of bone turnover [(44-46)](#reference44). The results of a [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 276 healthy postmenopausal women suggested that supplementing the diet with alkali, either through [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) potassium citrate or an additional 300 g/day of fruit and vegetables, did not reduce bone turnover, increase [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD), or blunt the age-associated bone loss over a two-year period [(45)](#reference45). The effect of five portions of fruit and vegetables on measures of dietary acid/base balance and bone turnover markers was also reported as a secondary outcome in the Ageing and Dietary Intervention Trial that included 83 healthy older participants (ages, 65-85 years) [(46)](#reference46). Compared to habitual fruit and vegetable intakes of 2 portions/day, the consumption of five portions per day for 16 weeks increased the alkalinity of the diet but failed to reduce markers of bone turnover [(46)](#reference46). There were also no significant reductions in circulating bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women with [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia) supplemented with six extra servings of fruit and vegetables per day (~400 g/day) for 12 weeks [(44)](#reference44). Several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined intakes of fruit and vegetables in relation to [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) in men and women, providing mixed results (reviewed in [47](#reference47)). In an early [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of the longitudinal Framingham Osteoporosis Study in elderly adults (mean age, 75 years), baseline intakes of fruit and vegetables were positively associated with BMD at various sites, including trochanter, femoral neck, and radius [(48)](#reference48). Baseline fruit and vegetable intakes were also positively associated with longitudinal changes of trochanter BMD over four years in elderly men but not elderly women [(48, 49)](#reference48). Two recent cross-sectional studies in Chinese cohorts reported positive relationships between BMD and intakes of fruit rather than vegetables [(50, 51)](#reference50). In the cross-sectional analysis of two Hong-Kong-based cohorts of 3,995 older participants (65 years), higher daily intakes of fruit \u2014 but not vegetables \u2014 were associated with significantly higher whole-body and femoral neck BMD in men and women [(50)](#reference50). The cross-sectional study of 3,089 Chinese adults (ages, 40-75 years) reported positive associations between whole-body, total hip, and femoral neck BMD and higher intakes of apples, pears, peaches, pineapples, plums, and to a lesser extent, citrus fruit [(51)](#reference51). However, the two-year supplementation of 300 g/day of fruit and vegetables failed to reduce BMD loss in healthy postmenopausal women [(45)](#reference45). A pooled analysis of data from several [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including the EPIC-Elderly Greece (9,534 participants), EPIC-Elderly Sweden (3,276 participants), Cohort of Men (COSM; 20,150 men), Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC; 17,506 women), Study (NHS; women), a 39% higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) with intakes of fruit and vegetables 1 serving/day compared to 4-5 daily servings [(52)](#reference52). Further subgroup analysis linked higher hip fracture risk specifically with low intakes of vegetables rather than fruit. Finally, compared to 4-5 daily servings of fruit and vegetables, there was no reduction in hip fracture risk with intakes greater than 5 servings/day [(52)](#reference52). The consumption of fruit and vegetables has been recently examined in relation to 415 fracture-related hospitalizations identified during a 14.5-year follow-up of 1,468 elderly participants (70 years) of the Perth Longitudinal Study of Aging in Women (PLSAW) [(53)](#reference53). Whereas no association was found between fruit intakes and fracture risk, high versus low intake of total vegetables (3 servings/day versus <2 servings/day) was associated with a 27% reduced risk of all fractures and a 39% reduced risk of hip fractures. Further analyses suggested an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between consumption of allium vegetables (onion, leek, and garlic) and risk of fracture [(53)](#reference53). Although observational studies suggest a positive relationship between diets rich in fruit and vegetables and bone health during aging, [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to examine the nature of this association. [Cataracts](../glossary#cataract) are thought to be caused by [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) of [proteins](../glossary#protein) in the eye's [lens](../glossary#lens) induced by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light [(54)](#reference54). The resulting cloudiness and discoloration of the lens leads to vision loss that becomes more severe with age. A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found a 28% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of age-related cataracts with the highest versus lowest intakes of vegetables [(55)](#reference55). In a large Swedish [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 30,607 middle-aged and elderly women for a mean 7.7 years, the risk of age-related cataracts has been examined in relation to the estimated total [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity of the diet [(56)](#reference56). Higher versus lower estimates of total dietary antioxidant capacity were associated with a 13% lower risk of cataracts. Subgroup analyses showed that this [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) was statistically significant in women younger than 65 years and in [corticosteroid](../glossary#corticosteroid) users [(56)](#reference56). Pooled analyses of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that investigated the relationships between individual nutrients with antioxidant properties and the risk of cataracts have also suggested a lower risk of cataracts with higher intakes or higher blood concentrations of [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C), [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A), or -carotene, although the results vary according to study design (i.e., [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) versus [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) versus longitudinal) [(57, 58)](#reference57). However, a 2012 review of nine [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) found no substantial effect of -carotene, vitamin C, and [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E), administered individually or in combination over 2.1 to 12 years, on the risk of cataracts or cataract surgery [(59)](#reference59). In addition, a large [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 5,802 subjects at high risk for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) recently reported no difference in cataract surgery incidence over a seven-year follow-up period between participants assigned to a Mediterranean diet that included the whole range of antioxidant nutrients and those assigned to a control diet [(60)](#reference60). A secondary analysis reported a 29% lower cataract surgery risk in participants in the highest versus lowest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of [vitamin K1](../vitamins/vitamin-K) intake [(61)](#reference61). In industrialized countries, degeneration of the [macula](../glossary#macula), located in the center of the [retina](../glossary#retina), is the leading cause of blindness in older adults [(62)](#reference62). Long-term light exposure and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) in the outer segments of photoreceptors may lead to [drusen](../glossary#drusen) and/or pigment abnormalities in the macula, increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and central blindness. Several recent [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined AMD [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence), incidence, progression, or severity in relation to dietary patterns. Most of them used constructed scoring systems reflecting the level of adherence to specific dietary patterns by individuals. The European Eye (EUREYE) study examined associations between the prevalence of AMD and dietary patterns among 4,753 individuals from seven European countries. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using a Mediterranean Diet Score system that captured high intakes of key food items, such as olive oil, wine, fruit, vegetables or salad, fish, and [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), and low intakes of meat. High adherence to the Mediterranean Diet was associated with a reduced risk of developing large drusen, but there was no association with the risk of early or advanced AMD [(63)](#reference63). In the Carotenoids in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (CAREDS) that included 1,313 US women (ages, 50-79 years), high adherence to a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables, [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains), legumes, [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), and fish, and moderate intakes of red meat and [alcohol](../food-beverages/alcoholic-beverages), were found to be associated with a 66% lower risk of early AMD [(64)](#reference64). This Mediterranean-like dietary pattern, which is closer to dietary patterns occurring in the US, was also associated with a 26% lower risk of progression to advanced AMD in 2,525 subjects followed for a mean 8.7 years in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) [(65)](#reference65). Of note, this association was no longer valid when the analysis was restricted to individuals with a genetically determined susceptibility to AMD, i.e., those [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) for the risk [allele](../glossary#allele) of the complement factor H [CFH] [gene](../glossary#gene) (rs1410996) [(65)](#reference65). [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) that from 4,088 AREDS participants, among whom 2,739 had no AMD, 4,599 had early AMD, and 765 had advanced AMD, identified two main dietary patterns: so-called \"Oriental\" and \"Western\" patterns [(66)](#reference66). High adherence to the \"Oriental\" dietary pattern characterized by consumption of vegetables, legumes, fruit, fish, whole grains, poultry, and low-fat dairy products was associated with lower risks of early and advanced AMD. In contrast, higher risks of early and advanced AMD were found in individuals with high adherence to a \"Western\" diet that included red and processed meat, potatoes, French fries, butter, high-fat dairy products, eggs, refined grains, and sweets and desserts [(66)](#reference66). Among observational studies that focused on individual food groups or nutrients, some have suggested that high intakes of fruit, vegetables, or [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients, such as [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C), [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E), and [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids), might be protective against In two early [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), high intakes of dark-green leafy vegetables especially rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, two carotenoids present in the retina, were associated with a significantly lower risk of developing AMD [(67, 68)](#reference67). In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of more than 118,000 men and women, those who consumed 3 servings/day of fruit had a 36% lower risk of developing AMD over the next 12 to 18 years than those who consumed <1.5 servings/day [(69)](#reference69). Interestingly, vegetable intake was not associated with the risk of AMD in this cohort. Another study combining lutein and zeaxanthin intake was not associated with the prevalence of intermediate AMD in a cohort of women aged 50-79 years [(70)](#reference70). However, further analysis of the data revealed that women younger than 75 years with stable intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin had a 43% lower risk of developing intermediate AMD [(70)](#reference70). In the AREDS trial, oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with -carotene (15 mg/day), vitamin C (500 mg/day), vitamin E (400 IU/day), [zinc](../minerals/zinc) (80 mg/day as zinc oxide), and [copper](../minerals/copper) (2 mg/day as cupric oxide) for five years was shown to reduce the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% [(71)](#reference71). In a follow-up study \u2014 the AREDS2 trial \u2014 supplemental lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day) in combination with the 'AREDS formulation' only reduced the risk of progression to late AMD in the subset of participants with the lowest dietary intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin [(72)](#reference72). A more detailed account of the [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) evidence regarding the relationship between dietary and supplemental carotenoids and AMD risk can be found in the article on [ Carotenoids](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids#eye-diseases-prevention). [Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](../glossary#chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease) (COPD) is a condition that combines [emphysema](../glossary#emphysema) and [chronic bronchitis](../glossary#bronchitis), two chronic lung conditions that are characterized by airway obstruction. Smoking and indoor/outdoor pollution are considered to be primary contributors to COPD development, but dietary patterns low in fruit and vegetables and providing inadequate [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) intakes may also affect lung function and [risk](../glossary#risk) for COPD (reviewed in [73, 74](#reference73)). Early [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in Europe indicated that higher fruit intakes, especially apple intakes, were associated with higher spirometric values (including forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]), indicative of better lung function [(75-77)](#reference75). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 2,500 middle-aged Welsh men, slower declines in lung function were associated with the consumption of at least five apples weekly compared to no consumption [(76)](#reference76). Another study of 2,917 European men followed over 20 years found that each 100 g (3.5 oz) increase in daily fruit consumption was associated with a 24% lower risk of COPD-related mortality [(78)](#reference78). Additionally, when compared to a Western dietary pattern of refined grains, cured and red meats, French fries, and desserts, a prudent diet emphasizing fruit, vegetables, fish, and [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains) was associated with a 25%-50% lower risk of COPD in two large cohorts of men [(79)](#reference79) and women [(80)](#reference80). In a large [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 44,335 Swedish men (mean age, 60.2 years) for a mean 13.2 years, the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) (5.3 servings/day versus <2 servings/day) of fruit and vegetable intakes was associated with a 35% lower risk of developing COPD [(81)](#reference81). Subgroup analyses showed that fruit and vegetable intakes were [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with COPD risk in current and former smokers, but not in men who never smoked. Because [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) play key roles in the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of chronic obstructive lung disease, it has been suggested that fruit and vegetables high in [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), such as [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C), -carotene, or [flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids), could play protective role against COPD. A three-year [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 120 patients with COPD (mean age, 68.1 years) assigned to a diet rich in antioxidants, such as fresh fruit, fruit juice, and vegetables, or a control diet has provided support for the antioxidant [hypothesis](../glossary#hypothesis) [(82)](#reference82). Shifting to a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables prevented the decline of lung function observed in subjects who consumed the control diet [(82)](#reference82). Environment and lifestyle changes, including shifts toward unhealthy diets, are thought to contribute to the increasing [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of [asthma](../glossary#asthma) and allergic diseases in industrialized countries. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that examined asthma and allergic symptoms in relation to fruit and vegetable intakes have provided mixed results [(83)](#reference83). A [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of a population-based study in 32,644 Portuguese adults identified five dietary patterns, of which one included fish, fruit, and vegetables \u2014 three essential components of the Mediterranean diet. This dietary pattern was found to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with self-reported asthma symptoms and self-reported use of asthma drugs \u2014 yet not with self-reported medical diagnosis of asthma [(84)](#reference84). In contrast, the most recent cross-sectional study of 3,202 participants in the European Global Allergy and Asthma Network of Excellence (GA2LEN) showed no association between fruit and vegetable intake and [risk](../glossary#risk) of asthma and chronic rhino-sinusitis [(85)](#reference85). A 2017 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified 58 studies (in addition to the two above-cited studies) reporting fruit and vegetable intake in relation to lung function, wheeze, or asthma, of which 30 were cross-sectional studies and 41 conducted in children and/or adolescents [(83)](#reference83). A majority of studies (8 in adults and 22 in children) reported inverse associations between diets high in fruit and vegetables and risk of asthma and/or wheeze: 20 studies (8 in adults and 12 in children) showed that intakes of either fruit or vegetables were inversely associated with asthma and/or wheeze, and eight studies (one in adults and seven in children) found no associations. Pooled data analyses showed an inverse association between vegetable intake and risk of asthma, as well as fruit intake and asthma severity and risk of wheeze [(83)](#reference83). A previous [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies reported lower risks of wheeze and asthma with higher intakes of fruit and vegetables in adults and children in cross-sectional studies, but not all [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have supported these findings [(86)](#reference86). Subgroup analyses also suggested inverse associations between intakes of apples, citrus fruit, and tomatoes and risks of wheeze and asthma. Finally, pooled analyses of prospective cohort studies have revealed no association between fruit or vegetable intake during pregnancy and risk of wheeze or asthma in the offspring [(86)](#reference86). Results from most [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and longitudinal studies suggest that diets rich in fruit and vegetables might help prevent age-related [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) deterioration and reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of 11 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [(88)](#reference88), of which four examined fruit and vegetable intakes in relation to incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. All four prospective studies reported [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of developing mild cognitive impairments or [dementia](../glossary#dementia), including AD [(89-92)](#reference89). Among the seven prospective cohort studies positively linking fruit and vegetable intakes to better cognitive performance (reviewed in [88](#reference88)), a two-year follow-up of 13,388 women (mean age, 74 years) in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) found less cognitive decline in those in the highest versus lowest intakes of green leafy vegetables, [cruciferous vegetables](../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables), and [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes) [(93)](#reference93). Fruit consumption was not associated with changes in cognitive performance in this study [(93)](#reference93). However, a more recently published NHS study in 16,010 women analyzed intakes of major [flavonoid](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids)-containing foods in relation to cognitive test scores and reported less cognitive decline with higher long-term intakes of strawberries and blueberries [(94)](#reference94). Finally, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 prospective cohort studies showed better global [cognition](../glossary#cognition) in healthy older adults consuming the Mediterranean diet compared to control diets. In contrast, there were no differences in measures of episodic, semantic, and working memory between diets [(95)](#reference95). To date, only a few [interventions](../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the overall effect of fruit- and vegetable-rich diets on [cognition](../glossary#cognition) in cognitively healthy older adults. One trial assessed cognitive changes in 334 older adults (mean age, 66.9 years) at high risk for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) randomly assigned to either a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), or a control diet [(96)](#reference96). Following a median of 4.1 years, both Mediterranean diets prevented the deterioration of cognitive function that was observed in those ascribed the control diet. Compared to participants in the control diet group, those who followed the Mediterranean diet plus nuts had improved composite cognitive test scores for memory, while those in the Mediterranean diet plus olive oil group had better composite scores for frontal function and global cognition [(96)](#reference96). However, in a six-month trial in 137 CVD-free Australian adults (mean age, 72 years), consumption of a Mediterranean diet rich in fruit, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), dairy, nuts, olive oil, and seafood did not result in improved cognitive function \u2014 measured by a battery of 13 neuropsychological tests \u2014 compared to the habitual diet [(97, 98)](#reference97). Because regular consumption of fruit and vegetables may reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of some [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease), it may also improve overall health and longevity. A 2017 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 95 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that daily consumption of fruit and vegetables was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with cause-specific and all-cause mortality [(2)](#reference2). The risk of all-cause mortality was found to be 24% lower with five daily serving of fruit and vegetables combined (~400 mg/day) compared to little or no daily intake of fruit and vegetables. Five daily servings of fruit and vegetables were also associated with lower risks of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular)-related (-19%) and [cancer](../glossary#cancer)-related (-12%) mortality. In addition, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower with higher intakes of specific types of fruit and vegetables. There was evidence of lower risk of all-cause mortality with the highest versus lowest intake level of apples (-20%), berries (-8%), citrus fruit (-10%), cruciferous vegetables (-12%), and green leafy vegetables (-8%). This meta-analysis further reported a reduced risk of all-cause mortality with both cooked (-13%) and raw vegetable (-12%) intakes [(2)](#reference2). Although the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend fresh, frozen, and canned fruit equally, the consumption of the latter has been associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality in a pooled analysis of three UK-based prospective studies found with consumption of tinned fruit [(99)](#reference99). While added sugar content in tinned fruit or exposure to bisphenol A (a chemical component of tin cans) may explain these results, further studies are needed to clarify whether fresh fruit and canned fruit can provide similar health benefits when included as part of a healthy diet. Finally, although increasing daily intakes of fruit and vegetables would very likely reduce the number of premature deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and cancer in the US population, it is estimated that about 8 in 10 Americans do not meet the current intake recommendations [(100)](#reference100). The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans \u2014 issued jointly by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture \u2014 recommend to consume a healthy diet which includes, among other things, a variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups and fruit, especially whole fruit [(101)](#reference101). In the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the unit of measure of a fruit or vegetable serving size is the cup-equivalent (c-eq). In general, one cup-equivalent of fruit corresponds to (1) one cup of cut-up, raw, or canned fruit; (2) one cup (eight fluid ounces) of 100% fruit juice; or (3) one-half cup of dried fruit. Table 2 provides examples of the size of specific fruit counting as one cup-equivalent. |Fruit||Examples fruit (e.g., raisins, apricots)||\u00bd cup| One cup-equivalent of vegetables generally corresponds to one cup of raw or cooked vegetables or vegetable juice. One exception is leafy greens (e.g., spinach, romaine, watercress, dark-green leafy lettuce, endive, escarole) for which one cup-equivalent corresponds to one cup of cooked or two cups of raw vegetables. Table 3 provides specific examples of what counts as one cup-equivalent of vegetables. |Vegetables||Examples of cups, raw| |Spinach|| 1 cup, cooked | 2 cups, raw |Red and orange vegetables| |Carrots|| 1 cup, chopped, raw or cooked | 2 medium 1 cup of baby carrots |Red peppers||1 large pepper| |Tomatoes|| 1 large, raw | 1 cup, chopped, raw, canned, or cooked |Sweet potatoes||1 large, baked| |Legumes| |Dry |Celery|| 1 cup, diced or sliced, raw or cooked | 2 large stalks |Green peppers||1 large pepper| |Lettuce||2 cups, raw, shredded or chopped| |Onions||1 cup, chopped, raw or cooked| The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans provides dietary recommendations, including amounts of fruit and vegetables, designed to meet nutrient needs and Dietary Guidelines standards, for those who choose to follow either a healthy US-style eating pattern, a healthy Mediterranean-style eating pattern, or a healthy vegetarian eating pattern [(101)](#reference101). The recommendations are based on estimated energy needs that vary with age, gender, and level of physical activity. Recommended daily intakes of fruit and vegetables at all calorie requirement levels can be found in the '2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans' report (see [Appendices 3-5](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-3/)) [(101)](#reference101). Table 4 provides the amounts of fruit and vegetables (expressed in cup-equivalents) that are recommended at the 2,000-calorie per day level. Regardless of the chosen eating pattern, consumption of a variety of different vegetables and fruit is recommended, including all fresh, frozen, and canned dark-green, red, and orange vegetables, starchy vegetables, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes) (peas and beans), and all fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruit and 100% fruit juice. fruit and vegetable intakes at the 2,000-calorie per day level. Estimates of daily calorie needs according to age, gender, and physical activity can be found in the Appendix 2 of the '2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans' report | c-eq, cup-equivalents The nonprofit organization, Produce for Better Health Foundation (PBH), has partnered with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop the [Fruits & Veggies \u2014 More Matters\u00aehealth initiative](https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/resources/fruits-and-veggies-more-mattersr), which aims to help Americans increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables for better health [(104)](#reference104). Other initiatives like the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s [ChooseMyPlate.gov](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/) have been developed to help everyone make healthier dietary choices, particularly by adding more fruit and vegetables to daily meals. Finally, vegetables and fruit not only are a great source of [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient), [dietary fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber), and [unsaturated fat](../glossary#unsaturated-fatty-acid), they also supply a wide range of biologically active [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) (Figure 1) that contribute to the health benefits of plant foods. Information regarding the functions and health benefits of specific micronutrients and phytochemicals can be found in articles on [vitamins](../vitamins), [minerals](../minerals), and dietary [phytochemicals](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals).

Contents Cruciferous or Brassica vegetables come from plants in the family known to botanists and biologists as Cruciferae or alternately, Brassicaceae. The Brassicaceae family, which includes the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, comprises approximately 375 genera and over 3,000 species [(1)](#references). Many, but not all, commonly consumed cruciferous vegetables come from the Brassica genus; examples include broccoli, turnips, bok choy, and Chinese cabbage vegetables are unique in that they are a rich source of sulfur-containing compounds called glucosinolates (-thioglucoside N-hydroxysulfates) that impart a pungent aroma and spicy (some say bitter) taste (Figure 1). Glucosinolates can be classified into three categories based on the chemical structure of their [amino gluconasturtiin) (Figure 1) [(1)](#references). Around 130 glucosinolate structures have been described to date [(3)](#reference3), but only a subset can be found in the human diet. In a cohort of 2,121 German participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC study), glucobrassicin, sinigrin, glucoraphasatin (dehydroerucin), glucoraphanin, and glucoiberin were most to total glucosinolate intake [(4)](#reference4). Glucosinolates and their breakdown derivatives ( [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite)), especially [isothiocyanates](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/isothiocyanates) and [indole-3-carbinol](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol), exert a variety of biological activities that may be relevant to health promotion and disease prevention in humans (see the MIC articles on [Indole-3-Carbinol](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol) and [Isothiocyanates](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/isothiocyanates)). The [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) of glucosinolates, which is [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by a class of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) called myrosinases (-thioglucosidases), leads to the formation of breakdown such thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, indoles, oxazolidine-2-thiones (e.g., goitrin), epithionitrile, and nitrile (Figure 2). In intact plant cells, myrosinase is physically separated from glucosinolates. Yet, when plant cells are damaged, myrosinase is released and comes in contact with glucosinolates, catalyzing their conversion into highly reactive [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite). In plants, isothiocyanates, epithionitrile, and against [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen), insects, and herbivores [(1)](#references). When raw cruciferous vegetables are chopped during the cooking process, glucosinolates are rapidly hydrolyzed by myrosinase, generating metabolites that are then absorbed in the proximal intestine. In contrast, boiling cruciferous vegetables before consumption inactivates myrosinase, thus preventing the breakdown of glucosinolates. A small fraction of intact glucosinolates may be absorbed in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine), but a large proportion reaches the [colon](../glossary#colon) [(5)](#reference5). Of note, boiling cruciferous vegetables has also been found to reduce their glucosinolate content to a much greater extent than steam cooking, microwaving, and stir-frying do [(5)](#reference5). Nonetheless, when cruciferous vegetables are cooked, [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) myrosinase-like activity in the colon is mainly responsible for glucosinolate degradation, generating a wide range of metabolites [(5, 6)](#reference5). A neutral [pH](../glossary#pH) may favor the formation of isothiocyanates from glucosinolates (Figure 2). Once absorbed, isothiocyanates, such as glucoraphanin-derived sulforaphane, are [conjugated](../glossary#conjugation) to [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione) in the liver, and then sequentially metabolized in the mercapturic acid pathway (Figure \u2014 sulforaphane-glutathione, sulforaphane-cysteine-glycine, sulforaphane-cysteine, and sulforaphane N-acetylcysteine \u2014 collectively known as dithiocarbamates, are ultimately [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine [(5)](#reference5). The composition and content of glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables are relatively stable, yet depend on the genus and species and can vary with plant growing and post-harvest storage conditions and culinary processing [(7, 8)](#reference7). Since most cruciferous vegetables are cooked prior to eating, [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) myrosinase-like activity in the gut rather than plant myrosinase is responsible for the initial step in glucosinolate degradation (Figure 2). In a feeding study involving 45 healthy subjects, the mean conversion rate of glucosinolates (of which 85% was glucoraphanin) to dithiocarbamates over a 24-hour period was estimated to be around 12% with wide variations among participants (range, 1.1 to 40.7%) [(7)](#reference7). In contrast, 70%-75% of ingested isothiocyanates were found to be [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) to dithiocarbamates. Therefore, following the ingestion of cooked cruciferous vegetables, the conversion of glucosinolates into isothiocyanates by gut bacteria appears to be a limiting step in the generation of dithiocarbamates [(7)](#reference7). However, differences in individuals' capacity to metabolize glucosinolates have not been linked to differences in gut [microbiota](../glossary#intenstinal-microbiota) composition [(9)](#reference9). Like most other vegetables, cruciferous vegetables are good sources of a variety of nutrients and [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) that synergistically contribute to health promotion (see [Bioactive compounds in cruciferous vegetables](#bioactive-compounds)) [(10)](#reference10). One challenge in studying the relationships between cruciferous vegetable intake and disease [risk](../glossary#risk) in humans is dissociating the benefits of whole diets that are generally rich in vegetables from those that are specifically rich in cruciferous vegetables [(11)](#reference11). One characteristic that sets cruciferous vegetables apart from other vegetables is their high glucosinolate content (see [Introduction](#introduction)). Glucosinolate [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) products may play important roles in disease prevention by triggering [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory response and contributing to the maintenance of cell [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) (see the MIC articles on [Isothiocyanates](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/isothiocyanates) and [Indole-3-Carbinol](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol)). Once absorbed, glucosinolate-derived isothiocyanates (like sulforaphane) are promptly [conjugated](../glossary#conjugation) to [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione) by a class of phase II detoxification [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) known as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) (Figure 3). This mechanism is meant to increase the solubility of [isothiocyanates](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/isothiocyanates), thereby promoting a rapid [excretion](../glossary#excretion) in the urine. Isothiocyanates are thought to play a prominent role in the potential anticancer and [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits associated with cruciferous vegetable consumption [(12, 13)](#reference12). Genetic variations in the sequence of [genes](../glossary#gene) coding for GSTs may affect the activity of these enzymes. Such variations have been identified in humans. Specifically, null variants of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 [alleles](../glossary#allele) contain large deletions, and individuals who inherit two copies of the GSTM1-null or GSTT1-null alleles cannot produce the corresponding GST enzymes [(14)](#reference14). It has been proposed that a reduced GST activity in these individuals would slow the rate of excretion of isothiocyanates, thereby increasing tissue exposure to isothiocyanates after cruciferous vegetable consumption [(15)](#reference15). However, human interventional studies with watercress report there is no difference in the isothiocyanate excretion rate between positive (+/+) and null (-/-) genotypes [(16)](#reference16). Similar studies with broccoli have shown that GSTM1-/- individuals excreted a greater proportion of ingested sulforaphane via mercapturic acid metabolism than GSTM1+/+ individuals [(17, 18)](#reference17). In addition, GSTs are involved in \"detoxifying\" potentially harmful substances like [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen), suggesting that individuals with reduced GST activity might also be more susceptible to [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(19-21)](#reference19). Finally, induction of the expression and activity of GSTs and other phase II detoxification/antioxidant enzymes by isothiocyanates is an important defense mechanism against [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) associated with the development of diseases like cancer and [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(22)](#reference22). The ability of sulforaphane (glucoraphanin-derived isothiocyanate) to reduce oxidative stress in different settings is linked to activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway. Yet, whether potential protection conferred by isothiocyanates via the Nrf2-dependent pathway is diminished in individuals carrying GST-/- variants is currently unknown. Some, but not all, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found that GST [genotypes](../glossary#genotype) could influence the associations between isothiocyanate intake from cruciferous vegetables and [risk](../glossary#risk) of disease [(23)](#reference23). High intakes of [fruit and vegetables](fruit-vegetables) have been consistently reduced disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) [(24, 25)](#reference24). Yet, few have specifically examined the potential benefits of cruciferous vegetable consumption. In the Shanghai Women's Health Study (mean follow-up, 10.2 years) and the Shanghai Men's Health Study (mean follow-up, 4.6 years), which included a total of 134,796 Chinese adults, participants in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of cruciferous vegetable intakes had a 22% reduced risk of all cause-mortality and a 31% reduced risk of CVD-related mortality [(26)](#reference26). In contrast, a pooled analysis of two large US [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), the Nurses' Health Study (70,870 women) and the Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study (38,918 men), found no significant association between cruciferous vegetable intake and combined risk of [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (MI) [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) in 2,042 subjects <75 years) who survived a first acute myocardial infarction (MI), and matched healthy controls with no CVD history found that the individuals in the highest versus lowest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of cruciferous vegetable intakes (6 times/week versus <1 time/week) had 27% lower odds of MI [(28)](#reference28). However, further analyses showed that the association between cruciferous vegetable intake and MI events was significant in individuals with two functional GSTT1 alleles but not in carriers of two alleles of the GSTT1 null variant (-/-) [(28)](#reference28). Analysis of data from two 12-week [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 130 participants with mild or moderate CVD risk found that the consumption of 400 g/week of high-glucosinolate broccoli (containing 3 to 6 times more glucoraphanin and glucoiberin than standard broccoli) resulted in a significant reduction in [low-density lipoprotein](../glossary#LDL) (LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentration in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) compared with standard [(29)](#reference29). Whether the effect of glucosinolates on cholesterol [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) might be beneficial in the prevention of CVD needs further investigation. A recent [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) demonstrated that cruciferous vegetables could increase the detoxification of [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen) and other [xenobiotics](../glossary#xenobiotic) in humans. In this 12-week [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 391 healthy Chinese adults exposed to high levels of air pollution, daily consumption of a broccoli sprout-rich beverage (providing 600 \u00b5mol/day of glucoraphanin and 40 \u00b5mol/day of sulforaphane) significantly increased the urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of a known [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen), benzene, and a toxicant, acrolein, compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(20)](#reference20). The biological activities of isothiocyanates and which include modulation but also [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory properties, induction of cell cycle arrest and [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis), and inhibition of [angiogenesis](../glossary#angiogenesis), likely contribute to the potential benefits of cruciferous vegetables in the prevention of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) (see the MIC articles on [Isothiocyanates](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/isothiocyanates) and [Indole-3-Carbinol](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol)) [(23)](#reference23). Numerous [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined the relationship between cruciferous vegetable intake and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk). Results from recent published [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies are reported in Table 1 (adapted from [23](#reference23)). |Type of Cancer||Type of Observational Studies||Relative Risk Ratio [OR] (95% Confidence Interval)||Relative Risk [RR] in Subgroup Analyses (e.g., by food group or study type)||References| |Bladder cancer||5 0.86 (0.61-1.11) with cohort studies only | Liu et al. (2013) | Most meta-analyses found [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between cruciferous vegetable intake and [endometrial](../glossary#endometrium), [gastric](../glossary#gastric), lung, ovarian, [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas), [prostate](../glossary#prostate), and [renal](../glossary#renal) cancer. Subgroup analyses showed that inverse associations remained significant in pooled analyses of [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) but not in pooled analyses of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (see [Table 1](#table-1)). [Retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) case-control studies are susceptible to [bias](../glossary#bias) in the selection of participants (cases and controls) and prone to dietary recall bias compared to prospective cohort studies, which collect dietary information from participants before they are diagnosed with cancer [(47)](#reference47). The method of cooking cruciferous vegetables, which strongly affects the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) and potential anticancer benefits of isothiocyanates (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability of Glucosinolates](#metabolism-bioavailability-glucosinolates)) may be a source of bias and explain variation in the results of the studies ( [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among studies). The lack of information regarding cooking methods prevented data adjustment to reduce bias. In the past decades, some observational studies have examined the effect of individuals' genetic variations on the relationship between cruciferous vegetable intake and the risk of different cancer types. For example, a pooled analysis of two prospective cohort studies and six case-control studies found an inverse association between cruciferous vegetable consumption and risk of colorectal neoplasm in carriers of the GSTT1 null variant but not in individuals with the GSTM1 null variant or those with both the GSTT1and GSTM1 null variants (-/-) [(36)](#reference36). The results of a pooled analysis of five case-control studies also suggested a stronger association between cruciferous vegetable intake and lung cancer in carriers of both the GSTT1-/- and GSTM1-/- variants compared to carriers of wild-type [alleles](../glossary#allele) (+/+); however, it was not reported whether results from these two groups of individuals were significantly different [(39)](#reference39). There is also a significant body of evidence suggesting that GSTM1+/+ individuals gain greater cancer protection from consumption total cruciferous vegetables or broccoli compared to GSTM1-/- variant carriers [(25](#reference25), [48, 49)](#reference48). Current evidence is scarce, and adequately powered, well-designed studies are required to assess and explain potential interactions between cruciferous vegetable intake and GST [genotypes](../glossary#genotype). A few observational studies have looked at whether cruciferous vegetable intake could be associated with reduced risks of disease progression and mortality. The highest versus lowest intake of cruciferous vegetables (assessed before diagnosis) was associated with a better survival rate over 72 months after diagnosis in 547 women with lung cancer [(50)](#reference50). A prospective study in 29,361 men who underwent a [prostate-specific antigen](../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) test found that intake of cruciferous vegetables was inversely associated with risk of [metastatic](../glossary#metastasis) prostate cancer \u2014 cancer that has spread beyond the prostate (i.e., late-stage prostate cancer) \u2014 during a mean follow-up of 4.2 years [(51)](#reference51). Another prospective study in 1,560 men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer reported that higher post-diagnosis intake of cruciferous vegetables was associated with a 59% lower risk of prostate cancer progression during a two-year period after completion of the dietary assessment [(52)](#reference52). In contrast, cruciferous vegetable consumption in a cohort of 11,390 women with stage I-III invasive breast cancer (from four US and Chinese prospective studies), assessed about two years after diagnosis, was not found to be associated with risk of cancer recurrence or total mortality [(53)](#reference53). Very high intakes of cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage and turnips, have been found to cause [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) (insufficient production of [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormones](../glossary#hormone)) in animals [(54)](#reference54). Two mechanisms can potentially explain this effect. The [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) of progoitrin, found in cruciferous vegetables (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)), may yield a compound known as goitrin, which may interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis. The hydrolysis of another class of glucosinolates, known as indole glucosinolates, results in the release of thiocyanate [ions](../glossary#ion) (see [Figure 2](#figure-2)) that can compete with iodine for uptake by the thyroid gland [(55)](#reference55). However, increased exposure to thiocyanate ions from cruciferous vegetable consumption or, more commonly, from cigarette smoking, does not appear to increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypothyroidism unless accompanied by [iodine](../minerals/iodine) deficiency. One study in humans found that the consumption of 150 g/day (5 oz/day) of cooked Brussels sprouts for four weeks had no adverse effects on thyroid function [(56)](#reference56). Similarly, consumption of high amounts of cruciferous vegetables has been associated with increased thyroid [cancer](../glossary#cancer) risk only in iodine-deficient areas [(57)](#reference57). The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating a variety of vegetables daily (2\u00bd cup-equivalents/day for a 2,000 calorie diet) from all of the five vegetable subgroups (dark green, red and orange, legumes, starchy, and other; see [58](#reference58)). No separate recommendations have been established for cruciferous vegetables, yet the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults consume 1\u00bd-2\u00bd cup-equivalents of dark-green vegetables (which include cruciferous vegetables) per week [(58)](#reference58). Cruciferous vegetables are important sources of some [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) and [minerals](../glossary#mineral), fiber, and various phytochemicals other than glucosinolates (Table 2). Many of these compounds likely contribute to the potential health-promoting benefits of cruciferous vegetables. |Vitamins||Minerals||Phytochemicals| | | Originally written in 2005 by: Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in December 2008 by: Victoria J.

Garlic is a particularly rich source of organosulfur compounds, which are thought to be responsible for its flavor and aroma, as well as its potential health benefits [(2)](#reference2). Consumer interest in the health benefits of garlic is strong enough to place it among the best-selling herbal [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in the United States [(3)](#reference3). Scientists are interested in the potential for organosulfur compounds derived from garlic to prevent and treat [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease), such as [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(4)](#reference4). Two classes of organosulfur compounds found cloves: L-cysteine sulfoxides -glutamyl-L-cysteine of cysteine sulfoxides in garlic (Figure 1) [(5)](#reference5). When raw garlic cloves are crushed, chopped, or chewed, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) known as alliinase is released. Alliinase [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the formation of sulfenic acids from L-cysteine sulfoxides (Figure 2). Sulfenic acids spontaneously react with each other to form unstable compounds called thiosulfinates. In the case of alliin, the resulting sulfenic acids react with each other to form a thiosulfinate known as allicin (half-life in crushed garlic at 23\u00b0C is 2.5 days). The formation of thiosulfinates is very rapid and has been found to be complete within 10 to 60 seconds of crushing garlic. Allicin breaks down [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) to form a variety of (DADS), and diallyl sulfide (DAS), or in the presence of oil or organic solvents, ajoene and vinyldithiins [(6)](#reference6). [In vivo](../glossary#in-vivo), (SAMG) and S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), respectively (Figure 2) [(4)](#reference4). Crushing garlic does not change its -glutamyl-L-cysteine [peptide](../glossary#peptide) content. -Glutamyl-L-cysteine peptides include an array S-allylcysteine and SAMC (Figure 3), are formed from -glutamyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine during long-term incubation of crushed garlic in [aqueous](../glossary#aqueous) solutions, as in the manufacture of aged garlic extracts (see [Sources](#sources)). Although little is known about their [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) and biological activities, non-sulfur garlic phytochemicals, including [flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids), steroid saponins, organoselenium compounds, and allixin, likely work in synergy with organosulfur compounds [(6)](#reference6). In studies conducted in rodents, orally administrated alliin was found to be absorbed intact and to reach [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and liver without being converted to allicin. There are no thiosulfinates (like allicin) in intact garlic cloves, and none can be generated in the stomach because alliinase would be irreversibly inhibited under [acidic](../glossary#acidic) conditions [(6)](#reference6). The absorption and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of allicin and allicin-derived compounds (see [Figure 2](#figure-2)) are only partially understood [(7)](#reference7). In humans, no allicin has been detected in the [serum](../glossary#serum) or urine up to 24 hours after the ingestion of 25 g of raw garlic containing a significant amount of allicin [(8)](#reference8). Before ingestion in garlic preparations and after ingestion in the stomach, allicin likely breaks down to release a number of volatile compounds, including DAS and DADS. These organosulfur compounds are metabolized to allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl sulfide, and allyl methyl disulfide, which have been detected in human breath after garlic consumption [(9-11)](#reference9). Although a number of biological activities have been attributed to various allicin-derived compounds, it is not yet clear which of these compounds or [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) actually reaches target tissues [(5)](#reference5). Allyl methyl sulfide \u2014 but not allyl mercaptan \u2014 has been detected in the urine within four hours of garlic ingestion, suggesting that this compound is absorbed into the circulation and rapidly [excreted](../glossary#excretion) [(11)](#reference11). Other allicin-derived compounds, including diallyl sulfides, ajoenes, and vinyldithiins, have not been detected in human blood, urine, or stool, even after the consumption of up to 25 g of fresh garlic or 60 mg of pure allicin [(5)](#reference5). These findings suggest that, if they are absorbed, allicin and allicin-derived compounds are rapidly metabolized. -Glutamyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine is thought to be absorbed intact and [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) to S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) and trans-S-1-propenyl-L-cysteine (see [Figure 3](#figure-3)), since [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) of these compounds have been measured in human urine after garlic consumption [(12, 13)](#reference12). The consumption of aged garlic extract, a commercial garlic preparation that contains SAC, has been found to increase [plasma](../glossary#plasma) SAC concentrations in humans [(14-16)](#reference14). SAC has been detected in plasma, liver, and kidney of SAC-fed animals [(17)](#reference17). Water-soluble organosulfur compounds like SAC and its metabolite, N-acetyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine, may be used as reliable markers of compliance in [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) involving garlic intake [(6](#reference6), [18)](#reference18). Low cellular concentrations of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione), a major intracellular [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), and/or overproduction of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) can lead to [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress)-induced damage to biological macromolecules and contribute to the development and progression of [pathological](../glossary#pathology) conditions. In endothelial cells (that line the inner wall of blood vessels), garlic-derived allicin lowered ROS production and increased the concentration of glutathione [(19)](#reference19). Oral administration of allicin to mice lowered ROS production and prevented ROS-induced cardiac [hypertrophy](../glossary#hypertrophy) by inhibiting with glutathione and prolong the antioxidant activity of allicin [(19)](#reference19). Allicin was Phase II detoxifying/ [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) enzymes, likely via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway [(19)](#reference19). Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol). Keap1 responds stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and [scavengers](../glossary#scavenge). Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code to stimulate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway [(4)](#reference4). For example, antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of DADS against acute ethanol-induced liver damage in mice were associated with the ability to trigger Nrf2-dependent HO-1 activation [(22)](#reference22). DATS protected cardiac cells [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) and in experimental diabetic rats from high [glucose](../glossary#glucose)-induced and [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) by inducing PI3K/Akt-dependent Nrf2 antioxidant [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) [(23)](#reference23). Aged garlic extract have also been shown to increase expression of antioxidant enzymes via the Nrf2/ARE pathway [(24)](#reference24). SAC, a major organosulfur compound in aged garlic extract, prevented [renal](../glossary#renal) damage caused by ROS in cisplatin-treated rats, by limiting cisplatin-induced reduction of glutathione level, Nrf2 expression, and activity antioxidant enzymes glutathione and apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in mice without a functional Nrf2 signaling pathway [(26)](#reference26). The generation of [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays a critical role in protecting the vascular endothelium from [oxidative](../glossary#oxidation) and [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) insults [(27)](#reference27). [ROS](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species)-induced NO can impair [(27, 28)](#reference27). Interestingly, ingestion of 2 g of fresh garlic was found to increase NO [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations within two to four hours in healthy volunteers [(29)](#reference29). DADS and DATS protected eNOS activity and NO [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) in cultured endothelial cells challenged with oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../glossary#LDL)) [(30)](#reference30). In a model of injury in rats, allicin attenuated brain [edema](../glossary#edema), [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) deficits, and [apoptotic](../glossary#apoptosis) [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) death, exhibited [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory effects, partly by increasing Akt-mediated eNOS activation [(31)](#reference31). Aged garlic extract and SAC were also found to stimulate NO production in different experimental settings [(32)](#reference32). In a model of erectile dysfunction in [diabetic](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) rats, SAC restored electrically-induced penile erection by stimulating eNOS activity and inhibiting the expression of NADPH oxidase (Nox) responsible for ROS overproduction [(33)](#reference33). Garlic-derived organosulfur compounds have been found to inhibit mediators of the [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) response, including [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), [DNA](../glossary#DNA) induces the [transcription](../glossary#transcription) of the COX-2 [gene](../glossary#gene), other pro-inflammatory genes, as well as genes involved in cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), adhesion, survival, and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation). The anti-inflammatory effects of organosulfur compounds result from their ability to counteract the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways \u2014 like NF-B-, MAPK-, [macrophage](../glossary#macrophage) limiting LPS binding to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and blocking the upregulation of TLR4 interleukin-1 (IL-1) [(37)](#reference37). In a mouse model of inflammation, the decrease of LPS-induced paw [edema](../glossary#edema) by DATS was associated with reduced organosulfur compounds have been found to decrease the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) by [hepatocytes](../glossary#hepatocyte) [(38)](#reference38). Several garlic-derived organosulfur compounds, S-allylcysteine found inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), a biosynthesis pathway [(39, 40)](#reference39). Garlic-derived compounds may also inhibit other enzymes in this pathway, including sterol 4-methyl oxidase [(41)](#reference41). An increase in the ability of [platelets](../glossary#platelet) to aggregate has been linked to the narrowing of blood vessels and the occurrence of acute thrombotic events. A variety of garlic-derived organosulfur compounds have been found to inhibit platelet aggregation in the test tube [(42-44)](#reference42). Aged garlic extract was found to inhibit chemically stimulated platelet aggregation by downregulating the fibrinogen binding intraplatelet [calcium](../minerals/calcium) mobilization [(42)](#reference42). The [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and migration of normally quiescent VSMCs are central features of vascular diseases, including [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) and [coronary](../glossary#coronary-arteries) [restenosis](../glossary#restenosis) (when treated arteries become blocked again) [(47)](#reference47). Although the significance of these findings for human [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) is not yet clear, limited cell culture research suggested that organosulfur compounds from garlic could inhibit the proliferation and migration of VSMCs [(39](#reference39), [plasma](../glossary#plasma) has been involved in the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis). Oxidized LDL may stimulate the recruitment of [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) white blood cells from the blood to the arterial wall by inducing the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules. DADS and DATS inhibited the expression adhesion E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 by reversing oxidized LDL-induced inhibition of PI3K/Akt and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways [(50)](#reference50). The preservation of normal arterial function plays an important role in [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) prevention. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous signaling molecule produced by some cells within the body, acts as a [vasodilator](../glossary#vasodilation) (relaxes blood vessels) and thus may have cardioprotective properties [(51, 52)](#reference51). H2S production may be involved in vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation through regulating the opening/closing of [potassium](../minerals/potassium) channels and/or enhancing NO-dependent [signaling pathway](../glossary#cell-signaling) (reviewed in [53](#reference53)). A study found that garlic-derived compounds are converted to hydrogen sulfide by red blood cells [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(54)](#reference54). However, human consumption of a high dose of raw garlic does not increase breath hydrogen sulfide levels, suggesting that significant [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of garlic compounds to hydrogen sulfide does not occur [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) [(11)](#reference11). Note that the potential benefits of garlic consumption/ [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) health may also be attributed to [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory activities described above. Inhibition of metabolic activation of carcinogens: Some chemical [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen) do not become active carcinogens until they have been [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) by Phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), such as those belonging to the [cytochrome P450](../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family. Inhibition of specific CYP [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in carcinogen activation inhibits the development of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) in some animal models [(55)](#reference55). In particular, DAS and its [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) have been found to inhibit CYP2E1 activity [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(56, 57)](#reference56) and when administered orally at high doses to animals [(58, 59)](#reference58). Oral administration of garlic oil and DAS to humans has also resulted in evidence of decreased CYP2E1 activity [(60-62)](#reference60). Induction of Phase II detoxifying enzymes: Reactions [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by phase II detoxifying enzymes generally promote the elimination of drugs, toxins, and [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen) from the body. Consequently, increasing the activity of phase II enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and NQO-1, may help prevent cancer by enhancing the elimination of potential carcinogens (see the [Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway](#Nrf-2-dependent-antioxidant-pathway)) [(63)](#reference63). In animal studies, oral administration of garlic preparations and organosulfur compounds was found to increase the expression and activity of phase II enzymes in a variety of tissues [(64-66)](#reference64). For example, DADS protected rodent liver against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4; an environmental 68)](#reference67). In normal cells, the cell cycle is tightly regulated to ensure faithful [DNA](../glossary#DNA) replication and [chromosomal](../glossary#chromosome) segregation prior to cell division. When defects occur during DNA replication or chromosomal segregation and in case of DNA damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested at check points to allow for repair. [Apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) is triggered when repair fails. Defective check points and evasion of apoptosis allow the unregulated division of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) cells [(69)](#reference69). Organosulfur compounds, including allicin, DAS, DADS, DATS, ajoene, and SAMC, have been found to induce cell cycle arrest when added to cancer cells in cell culture experiments (reviewed in [4](#reference4), [70](#reference70)). DATS reduced the incidence of poorly [differentiated](../glossary#differentiation) [prostate](../glossary#prostate) tumors and limited the number of [metastatic](../glossary#metastasize) lesions in the lungs of mice genetically modified to develop prostate adenocarcinomas [(71)](#reference71). DATS was shown to inhibit cancer cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), as well as neuroendocrine differentiation \u2014 a hallmark of prostate cancer malignancy \u2014 but had no effect on apoptosis and markers of invasion [(71)](#reference71). In a rat model of chemically induced [colon](../glossary#colon) cancer, inhibition of cell proliferation by aged garlic extract was associated with a reduction in the incidence of precancerous lesions and dysplastic adenomas, but not of adenocarcinomas [(72)](#reference72). [Apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) is a physiological process of programmed death of cells that are genetically damaged or no longer necessary. Precancerous and cancerous cells are resistant to signals that induce apoptosis [(73)](#reference73). Garlic-derived organosulfur compounds, including allicin, ajoene, DAS, and SAMC, have been found to induce apoptosis when added to various cancer cell lines grown in culture (reviewed in [4](#reference4), [70](#reference70)). Oral administration of [aqueous](../glossary#aqueous) garlic extract and S-allylcysteine has been reported to enhance apoptosis in an animal model of oral [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(74, 75)](#reference74). Garlic oil reduced the incidence of N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced nodules by preventing [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to [lipids](../glossary#lipid) and by promoting apoptosis Garlic oil upregulated the of effectors like -arrestin-2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X [(76)](#reference76). To fuel their rapid growth, invasive tumors must develop new blood vessels by a process known as [angiogenesis](../glossary#angiogenesis). Anti-angiogenic properties of several organosulfur compounds, including alliin, DATS, and ajoene, have been observed in [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) or ex vivo experiments [(70)](#reference70). In human breast cancer cells, DADS inhibited TNF--induced release of MCP-1, a chemokine that promotes tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and metastasis [(77)](#reference77). Aged garlic extract was also found to suppress in vitro angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial cell [proliferation](../glossary#cell-proliferation), loss of adhesion, motility, and tube formation [(78)](#reference78). Garlic extracts have been found to have antibacterial and antifungal properties [(79, 80)](#reference79). Thiosulfinates, particularly allicin, are thought to play an important role in the [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) activity of garlic [(80-82)](#reference80). Allicin-derived compounds, including DATS also [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(5)](#reference5). To date, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) using oral garlic preparations have not provided strong evidence for such activity in humans [(83-85)](#reference83). A small randomized controlled trial found that application of 1% ajoene cream to the skin twice daily was as effective in treating tinea pedis (fungal skin infection known as athlete's foot) terbinafine (Lamisil) cream [(86)](#reference86). In another preliminary randomized controlled trial, circulating immune innate cells (T- [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) and [natural killer (NK) cells](../glossary#natural-killer-cells)), isolated from healthy adults supplemented with aged garlic extract, [proliferated](../glossary#proliferation) better in ex vivo culture than those from volunteers who consumed a [placebo](../glossary#placebo), suggesting a greater [pathogen](../glossary#pathogen)-fighting ability. The number of self-reported illnesses was similar between groups after 90 days of aged garlic extract or placebo supplementation, but aged garlic extract significantly reduced the severity of self-reported cold or flu symptoms [(87)](#reference87). Interest in garlic and its potential to prevent [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) began with observations that people living near the Mediterranean basin had lower mortality from cardiovascular disease [(88)](#reference88). Garlic is a common ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine, but a number of characteristics of the \"Mediterranean diet\" have been proposed to explain its cardioprotective effects [(89)](#reference89). Although few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined associations between garlic consumption and cardiovascular disease [risk](../glossary#risk), numerous [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) have explored the effects of garlic supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk factors. [Platelet](../glossary#platelet) aggregation is one of the first steps in the formation of blood clots that can occlude [coronary](../glossary#coronary-arteries) or [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) arteries, leading to [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke), respectively. Evidence that garlic inhibits platelet aggregation is based mainly on [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) experiments and a small number of ex vivo assays. Of 10 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that tested the antithrombotic effect of garlic preparation, four reported a modest but significant decrease in ex vivo platelet aggregation with garlic supplementation compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) (reviewed in [90](#reference90)). Because garlic oil extract in particular may have antithrombotic activity, a small randomized controlled trial in 12 healthy adults was conducted to test the acute effect of one large dose of garlic oil (extracted from 9.9 g of fresh garlic) on ex vivo platelet aggregation [(91)](#reference91). The garlic oil extract had a mild effect on adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation (12% reduction) but (ADP)- or [collagen](../glossary#collagen)-induced aggregation measured four hours post-consumption. Another study in 14 healthy volunteers showed that aged garlic extract dose-dependently inhibited ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examining the effect of [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with various garlic preparations on [serum](../glossary#serum) [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles in individuals with elevated and normal serum [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) levels reported mixed results [(92)](#reference92). The most recent and comprehensive [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) compared the results from 39 randomized controlled trials published between 1955 and 2011 that tested the effect of garlic preparations on serum lipid concentrations [(93)](#reference93). These 39 trials studied 2,298 adult participants (mean age, 49.5 years), administered garlic-only preparations, used a true [placebo](../glossary#placebo), and lasted for at least two weeks. The majority of included trials recruited subjects with elevated total cholesterol at baseline (>200 mg/dL [>5.2 mmol/L], 29 trials) and lasted more than eight weeks (30 trials). The authors found that garlic preparations significantly lowered total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../glossary#LDL))-cholesterol compared to placebo. concentrations were mildly increased and [triglyceride](../glossary#triglycerides) concentrations were not affected by garlic supplementation. All administered garlic preparations (garlic powder, aged garlic extract, garlic oil, and fresh garlic) were well tolerated and associated with only minor side effects (garlic odor and mild [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) discomfort) [(93)](#reference93). Although garlic supplementation for a minimum of two months may lower total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in individuals with elevated total cholesterol, the benefits may not last beyond the short term [(90, 92)](#reference90). Whether garlic possesses long-lasting lipid-lowering effects remain questionable and future investigations may focus on ways to maximize potential benefits of garlic preparations on serum lipids. Very few studies have attempted to assess the effect of garlic [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on the progression of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) in humans. One early study in Germany used [ultrasound](../glossary#ultrasonography) imaging to assess the effect of 900 mg/day of dehydrated garlic on the progression of atherosclerotic plaque in the [carotid](../glossary#carotid-arteries) and femoral arteries [(94)](#reference94). After four years, the increase in plaque volume was significantly greater in women taking the [placebo](../glossary#placebo) (+53.1%) than in women taking the garlic supplement (-4.6%), while no significant difference in plaque volume was found between garlic (+1.1%) and placebo (+5.5%) in men [(94, 95)](#reference94). to assess the effect of supplementation with aged garlic extract on the progression of atherosclerosis in 19 adults already taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lipid-lowering drugs also known as statins) [(18)](#reference18). After one year, increases in coronary artery calcium score were significantly lower in those taking aged garlic extract than in those taking a placebo. Nevertheless, although coronary calcium scores may have a predictive value regarding future cardiac events in asymptomatic subjects, it may not be a reliable marker of plaque burden in symptomatic patients [(96, 97)](#reference96). In a recent [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled study, the extent of coronary atherosclerosis was assessed with cardiac computed tomography [angiography](../glossary#angiography) in 72 individuals (55 at study completion) at high risk of [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) randomized to receive either 2,400 mg of aged garlic extract or placebo for 52 weeks [(98)](#reference98). The result suggested a significant decrease in the extent of coronary plaques with low-attenuation area (a type of vulnerable plaques prone to rupture) [(99, 100)](#reference99) with aged garlic extract compared to placebo, but no differences in total plaque volume and proportions of non-calcified plaques and dense calcium were found between treatment and placebo groups [(98)](#reference98). Most [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) and/or [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) to date have provided mixed results regarding the potential blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic, possibly because most of these trials enrolled both [normotensive](../glossary#normotensive) and [hypertensive](../glossary#hypertension) subjects [(90](#reference90), [101-105)](#reference101). A systematic review and meta-analysis by Xiong et al. [(106)](#reference106) included seven [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials that exclusively enrolled individuals with high blood pressure, i.e., with [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) (SBP) 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 mm Hg. Five out of seven trials identified in this systematic review reported statistically significant reductions in SBP and DBP with several garlic preparations (dried garlic homogenate, garlic powder, and aged garlic extract) [(106)](#reference106). Another recent meta-analysis included nine randomized controlled trials in 482 hypertensive individuals who were given garlic powder (six studies), garlic homogenate (one study), aged garlic extract (two studies), or placebo for 8 to 26 weeks [(107)](#reference107). Garlic preparations were found to significantly reduce SBP by a mean of 9.1 mm Hg and DBP by a mean of 3.8 mm Hg compared to placebo. The most recent meta-analysis found that garlic preparations reduced SBP by a mean 8.7 mm Hg (10 trials, 440 subjects) and DBP by 6.1 mm Hg (8 trials, 257 subjects) [(102)](#reference102). Such reductions in blood pressure seem comparable to those reported with currently used classes of blood pressure-lowering medications (average reduction, -9.1 mm Hg for SBP and -5.5 mm Hg for DBP) [(108)](#reference108). The effect of blood pressure reduction from such medications at standard dose has been estimated to lower the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) events by about one-quarter and the risk of [stroke](../glossary#stroke) by about one-third [(108)](#reference108). Nonetheless, evidence showing that garlic [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is still lacking [(109)](#reference109). In a recent 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in untreated hypertensive subjects, daily intake of aged garlic extract (1.2 g of which contained 1.2 mg of S-allyl-L-cysteine [SAC]) was shown to significantly lower SBP by 11 mm Hg and DBP by 6 mm Hg on average in 50%-60% of participants, but reductions in blood pressure were not reported in 40%-50% of participants compared to placebo [(110)](#reference110). Whether interindividual differences in nutritional status and genetic [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) can explain differences in blood pressure response to garlic treatment need to be explored in future studies [(53](#reference53), [110)](#reference110). Overall, short-term garlic supplementation appears to effectively reduce blood pressure with minimal side effects in hypertensive patients. The results of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have suggested that garlic [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) modestly improves [serum](../glossary#serum) [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles in individuals with elevated serum [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and reduces blood pressure in [hypertensive](../glossary#hypertension) subjects. It is not yet clear whether garlic supplementation can reduce [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) or prevent [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, such as [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) or [stroke](../glossary#stroke). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 studies (mostly [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study)) reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between high versus low garlic consumption and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [gastric](../glossary#gastric) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(111)](#reference111). Nevertheless, this conclusion is hindered by a number of limitations, especially related to the [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) design of most studies included in the analysis, as well as great variations in the amount and duration of garlic intakes. In a 2009 review of the literature, Kim et al. [(112)](#reference112) identified 20 human studies that examined garlic intake in relation to gastric cancer risk: three [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial), one case-cohort study, 13 case-control studies, and three [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study)/ [ecologic](../glossary#ecologic-study) studies. Using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s evidence-based criteria for the scientific evaluation of health claims [(113)](#reference113), the authors excluded 16 studies for methodological flaws; only four studies (two case-control [(114, and one intervention [(85)](#reference85)) received moderate-to-high quality ratings [(112)](#reference112). Among these four studies, garlic intake during adolescence or 20 years prior to the interview was not found to be associated with the risk of gastric cancer in one of the case-control studies in Sweden (338 gastric cancer patients and 669 control subjects) [(114)](#reference114). Another case-control study in Korea failed to show an association between past garlic consumption and gastric cancer in 136 people diagnosed with gastric cancer and 136 cancer-free subjects [(115)](#reference115). In addition, a [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) case-cohort study in the Netherlands found no association between the use of garlic supplements (unknown composition) and gastric cancer risk [(116)](#reference116). Finally, a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled intervention study in 3,365 subjects from the Shandong province of China found that supplementation with aged garlic extract and steam-distilled garlic oil for 7.3 years did not reduce the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of precancerous gastric lesions or the incidence of gastric cancer [(85)](#reference85). An updated analysis of the data collected 7.3 years after garlic supplementation ended provided further confirmation for a lack of significant reduction in gastric cancer incidence or mortality with supplemental garlic [(117)](#reference117). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and gastric cancer: Infection with some strains of H. pylori [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) markedly increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [gastric](../glossary#gastric) [cancer](../glossary#cancer). Although garlic preparations and organosulfur compounds could inhibit the growth of H. pylori in the laboratory [(118, 119)](#reference118), there is little evidence to suggest that high garlic intakes or garlic [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may help prevent or eradicate H. pylori infection in humans [(120)](#reference120). Higher intakes of garlic were not associated with a significantly lower [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of H. pylori infection in China or Turkey [(121, 122)](#reference121). Moreover, [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) using garlic cloves garlic oil [(84](#reference84), [124)](#reference124), garlic oil macerate [(125)](#reference125), or garlic powder [(126)](#reference126) have not found garlic supplementation to be effective in eradicating H. pylori infection in humans. A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [prospective in 335,923 subjects (including 4,610 [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) [CRC] cases) found no association of consuming raw or cooked garlic (three studies, four cohorts) or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) garlic (four studies, five cohorts) with CRC [(127)](#reference127). Another recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analysis that combined data from seven cohort and seven case-control studies also failed to find a statistically significant reduction in CRC [risk](../glossary#risk) with garlic intake [(128)](#reference128). Yet, these results are in contrast with previous pooled analyses of data from case-control studies [(129)](#reference129) or from both [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) and prospective studies [(130)](#reference130) that reported an approximate 30% lower CRC risk in individuals with the highest garlic intakes compared to those with the lowest intakes. Inclusion of case-control studies, which are more susceptible to bias, may explain these discrepancies among meta-analyses [(128)](#reference128). For information regarding different types of [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study), see the [Spring/Summer 2016 LPI Research Newsletter](../../sites/lpi.oregonstate.edu/files/pdf/newsletters/ss16.pdf). A preliminary [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 37 patients with [colorectal adenomas](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) examined whether supplementation with aged garlic extract for 12 months affected adenoma size and recurrence. Both the number and size of adenomas were significantly reduced in patients given a high dose of aged garlic extract compared to those given a much lower dose (0.16 mL/day) [(131, 132)](#reference131). Larger [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether garlic or garlic extracts can substantially reduce adenoma progression to advanced cancer and recurrence. In a small, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 50 patients with [cancer](../glossary#cancer) (42 with liver cancer, seven with [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cancer, and one with [colon](../glossary#colon) cancer), supplementation with 500 mg/day of aged garlic extract for six months failed to prevent quality of life deterioration caused by disease progression and [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy)-associated adverse effects [(133)](#reference133). Yet, the active treatment limited the decline in [natural killer cell](../glossary#natural-killer-cells) count and activity that accompanies digestive cancer progression and reduces patient survival [(133)](#reference133). At present, evidence from trials is limited and results from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) do not suggest a role of high intakes of garlic in the prevention of cancer in humans [(112)](#reference112). Allium vegetables, including garlic and onions, are the richest sources of organosulfur compounds in the human diet [(134)](#reference134). To date, the majority of scientific research relating to the health effects of organosulfur compounds has focused on those derived from garlic. Fresh garlic cloves contain about 2 to 6 mg/g of -glutamyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine (0.2%-0.6% fresh weight) and 6 to 14 mg/g of alliin (0.6%-1.4% fresh weight). Garlic cloves yield about 2.5 to 4.5 mg of allicin per gram of fresh weight when crushed. One fresh garlic clove weighs 2 to 4 g [(5)](#reference5). The [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) alliinase can be inactivated by heat. In one study, microwave cooking of unpeeled, uncrushed garlic totally destroyed alliinase enzyme activity [(135)](#reference135). An [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) study found that prolonged oven heating or boiling (i.e., six minutes or longer) suppressed the inhibitory effect of uncrushed and crushed garlic on [platelet](../glossary#platelet) aggregation, but crushed garlic retained more anti-aggregatory activity compared to uncrushed garlic [(136)](#reference136). Administering raw garlic to rats significantly decreased the amount of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage caused by a chemical [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen), but heating uncrushed garlic cloves for 60 seconds in a microwave oven or 45 minutes in a convection oven prior to administration blocked the protective effect of garlic [(137)](#reference137). The protective effect of garlic against DNA damage can be partially conserved by crushing garlic and allowing it to stand for 10 minutes prior to microwave heating for 60 seconds or by cutting the tops off garlic cloves and allowing them to stand for 10 minutes before heating in a convection oven. Because organosulfur compounds derived from alliinase- [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) reactions may play a role in some of the biological effects of garlic, some scientists recommend that crushed or chopped garlic be allowed to \"stand\" for at least 10 minutes prior to cooking [(135)](#reference135). Several different types of garlic preparations are available commercially, and each type provides a different profile of organosulfur compounds depending on how it was processed (see [Table 1](#table-1)). Not all garlic preparations are standardized, and even standardized brands may vary with respect to the amount and the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the organosulfur compounds they provide [(5)](#reference5). Powdered or dehydrated garlic is made from garlic cloves that are usually sliced and dried at a low temperature to prevent alliinase inactivation [(138)](#reference138). The dried garlic is pulverized and often made into tablets. To meet United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) standards, powdered garlic [supplements](../glossary#supplement) must contain no less than 0.1% -glutamyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine and no less than 0.3% alliin (dry weight) [(139)](#reference139). Although powdered garlic supplements do not actually contain allicin, the manufacturer may provide a value for the \"allicin potential\" or \"allicin yield\" of a supplement on the label. These values represent the maximum achievable allicin yield of a supplement [(140)](#reference140). It is determined by dissolving powdered garlic in water at room temperature and measuring the allicin content after 30 minutes [(139)](#reference139). Because alliinase is inactivated by the [acidic](../glossary#acidic) [pH](../glossary#pH) of the stomach, most powdered garlic tablets are enteric-coated to keep them from dissolving before they reach the neutral pH of the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine). It has been argued that it is more appropriate to measure \"allicin release\" using a USP method for assessing drug release from enteric-coated tablets under conditions that mimic those of the stomach and intestine [(139)](#reference139). Allicin release by this method has been shown to parallel true [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(140)](#reference140). Most tablet brands have been found to produce little allicin under these conditions, due mainly to low alliinase activity and prolonged disintegration times [(140, 141)](#reference140). Many manufacturers provide information on the \"allicin potential\" of their powdered garlic supplements, but few provide information on the \"allicin release.\" A number of controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of powdered or dehydrated garlic supplements on [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) [risk](../glossary#risk) factors (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)). The most commonly used doses ranged from of 600 to 900 mg/day and provided 3.6 to 5.4 mg/day of potential allicin [(90)](#reference90). When garlic cloves are incubated in a solution of ethanol and water for up to 20 months, allicin is mainly converted to allyl sulfides, which are lost by evaporation or converted to other compounds [(138)](#reference138). The resulting extract contains primarily water-soluble organosulfur compounds, such as SAC and SAMC (see [Figure 3](#figure-3)) [(142)](#reference142). Garlic fluid extracts, including aged garlic extracts, are standardized to their S-allyl-L-cysteine content. In controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial), daily intakes of aged garlic extract at doses between 1.2 g-2.4 g (containing 1.2 to 2.4 mg of S-allyl-L-cysteine) consistently resulted in reductions in SBP by 9 mm Hg-10 mm Hg and reductions in DBP by 4 mm Hg-8 mm Hg in a majority of patients with uncontrolled [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) [(110](#reference110), [143)](#reference143). Additionally, aged garlic extract at doses of 2.4 to 7.2 g/day resulted in short-term reductions in ex vivo [platelet](../glossary#platelet) aggregation [(144)](#reference144) and reductions in [serum](../glossary#serum) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations up to 12 weeks [(16)](#reference16). Steam distillation of crushed garlic cloves results in a product that contains mainly allyl sulfides, including DATS, DADS, and DAS (see [Figure 2](#figure-2)) [(138)](#reference138). These fat-soluble steam distillation products are usually dissolved in vegetable oil. Incubation of crushed garlic cloves in oil at room temperature results in the formation of vinyldithiins and ajoene from allicin, in addition to allyl and DATS (see [Figure 2](#figure-2)) [(5)](#reference5). Ether extracts are similar in composition to more | Yes, when chopped, crushed, or chewed raw. | Minimal, when garlic cloves are cooked before crushing or chopping. |Garlic powder (tablets)|| Cysteine sulfoxides (Alliin) | -Glutamyl-L-cysteine peptides | Varies greatly among commercial products. | Enteric-coated tablets that pass the USP allicin release test are likely to provide the most. |Steam-distilled garlic oil (capsules)|| oil-soluble sulfur 99% Aged garlic extract | (tablets capsules) | S-Allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) | S-Allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) trans-S-1-Propenyl-L-cysteine |Minimal| The most commonly reported adverse effects of oral ingestion of garlic and garlic [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are breath and body odor [(90](#reference90), [146)](#reference146). [Gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms have also been reported, including heartburn, abdominal pain, belching, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, constipation, and diarrhea [(106)](#reference106). The most serious adverse effects associated with oral garlic supplementation are related to uncontrolled bleeding. Several cases of serious postoperative or spontaneous bleeding associated with garlic supplementation have been reported in the medical literature [(147-150)](#reference147). Garlic may also trigger allergic responses in some individuals, including [asthma](../glossary#asthma) in people with occupational exposure to garlic powder or dust [(151)](#reference151). Exposure of the skin to garlic has been reported to cause contact [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis) in some individuals [(146](#reference146), [152)](#reference152). More serious skin lesions, including blisters and burns, have also been reported with [topical](../glossary#topical) exposure to garlic for six or more hours. The safety characteristics of the various garlic preparations likely depend on their specific chemical composition (see [Table 1](#table-1)). Aged garlic extract \u2014 the only water-based garlic supplement \u2014 showed a safe profile in toxicity studies and exhibited no undesirable side effects when combined with [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant) (warfarin), antiplatelets methotrexate) in clinical settings (reviewed in [6](#reference6)). Safety and toxicity data are lacking for lipophilic ( [hydrophobic](../glossary#hydrophobic)) garlic preparations, but some of their constituents have been shown to interfere with drug-metabolizing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and transporters (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). No adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes have been reported when garlic is consumed in the diet. Although no adverse pregnancy outcomes were reported in a study of Iranian women who took dehydrated garlic tablets (800 mg/day) for two months during the third trimester of pregnancy [(153)](#reference153), the safety of garlic [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in pregnancy has not been established. There is some evidence that garlic consumption alters the odor and possibly the flavor of breast milk. In a controlled [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial), oral consumption of 1.5 g of garlic extract by lactating women increased the perceived intensity of breast milk odor [(154)](#reference154). Infants spent more time breast-feeding after their mothers consumed the garlic extract compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo), but the amount of milk consumed and number of feedings were not significantly different. Additionally, it is not known if [topical](../glossary#topical) use of garlic is safe during pregnancy or lactation. Garlic may enhance the [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) effects of warfarin (Coumadin). There have been two [case reports](../glossary#case-report) in which prothrombin time ( [INR](../glossary#international-normalized-ratio)) increased in patients who started taking garlic tablets or garlic oil without changing their warfarin dose or other habits [(155)](#reference155). However, a more recent study in closely monitored patients on warfarin therapy found that garlic fluid extracts (aged garlic extract) did not increase [hemorrhagic](../glossary#hemorrhage) [risk](../glossary#risk) [(156)](#reference156). Since garlic [supplements](../glossary#supplement) have been found to inhibit [platelet](../glossary#platelet) aggregation [(90)](#reference90), there is a potential for additive effects when garlic supplements are taken together with other medications or supplements that inhibit platelet aggregation, such as high-dose fish oil or vitamin E [(157)](#reference157). More research is needed to determine whether garlic supplements are safe for people on anticoagulatory therapy. [Supplementation](../glossary#supplement) of healthy volunteers with garlic caplets twice daily (allicin yield, 7.2 mg/day) for three weeks resulted in a 50% decrease in the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the protease inhibitor, CYP3A4, supplementation with garlic extract for two weeks did not significantly alter a measure of CYP3A4 activity in healthy volunteers [(159)](#reference159). Garlic extract supplementation (10 mg/day) for four days did not significantly alter single-dose [pharmacokinetics](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir (Norvir), but further research is needed to determine steady-state interactions between well-characterized garlic supplements and ritonavir hepatic models suggested that [flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) and sulfur-containing compounds in garlic supplements might interfere with the activity of efflux drug transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and breast cancer-resistance protein (BCRP), which function as [ATP](../glossary#ATP)-dependent efflux pumps that actively regulate the [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of a number of drugs limiting their systemic [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability).

The mechanisms responsible for garlic - drug interactions and their in vivo relevance. Curr Drug Contents Legumes are plants of the Leguminosae family with seed pods that split into two halves. Edible seeds from plants of this family include beans, peas, lentils, soybeans, and peanuts. The most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans do not include green peas or green (string) beans as legumes due to a dissimilar nutritional profile when compared to the other legume family members [(1)](#references). Peanuts are nutritionally similar to tree nuts; therefore, information on their health effects is presented in a separate article on [Nuts](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/nuts) and not discussed below. Many studies have examined how the consumption of pulses is related to health; pulses are legumes harvested as dry grain and thus exclude green peas, green beans, as well as crops used for oil extraction (soybeans, peanuts) [(2)](#reference2). Although legumes are an important part of traditional diets around the world, they are often neglected in typical Western diets. Legumes are inexpensive, nutrient-dense sources of protein that can be substituted for dietary animal protein [(3)](#reference3). While sources of animal protein are often rich in [saturated fats](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid), the small quantities of fats in legumes are mostly [unsaturated fats](../glossary#unsaturated-fatty-acid). Legumes are also good sources of several essential [minerals](../glossary#mineral), rich in dietary [fiber](../glossary#fiber) (both soluble fiber and resistant starch), and considered to be low- [glycemic index](../food-beverages/glycemic-index-glycemic-load) foods [(4, 5)](#reference4). Moreover, legumes contain numerous [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) that may affect health. Soybeans have attracted the most scientific interest, mainly because they are a unique source of [phytoestrogens](../glossary#phytoestrogen) known as [isoflavones](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones) [(6)](#reference6). Overall, legumes represent unique packages of nutrients and phytochemicals that may work synergistically to reduce risk of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease), as other edible seeds do [(7)](#reference7). Note: Research on the health effects of diets rich in legumes, including peas and soy foods, is summarized below. For a discussion of the potential health benefits and risks of soy isoflavones, see the separate article on [Soy Isoflavones](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones#disease-prevention). Consumption of legumes, which are rich in dietary [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber), other nutrients, and bioactive compounds, might help improve [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitivity) and regulate blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations, thereby influencing [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The glycemic index is a measure of the potential for [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) in different foods to raise blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations. In general, consuming foods with high-glycemic index values causes blood glucose concentrations to rise more rapidly, which results in greater [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion by the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), than after consuming foods with low-glycemic index values. Chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations and excessive insulin secretion are thought to play important roles in the development of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(8)](#reference8). Low-glycemic load diets have been associated with reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes in some, but not all, [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (see the article on [Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/glycemic-index-glycemic-load)). High- [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) diets have also been associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (see the article on [Fiber](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber)). Together, the high-fiber content and low-glycemic index nature of legumes may contribute to help lower risk of type 2 diabetes in those who incorporate them into their daily diets. However, a 2017 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 prospective cohort studies found that higher legume intakes were not associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to lower intakes (range, 0-190 g/day; ~0-2 servings/day) [(9)](#reference9), although a more recent prospective study not included in this pooled analysis found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) [(10)](#reference10). Results of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) of legume or pulse consumption have been more promising. A meta-analysis of 41 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (some in individuals with normoglycemia and some in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes) found that pulse consumption, either alone or in combination with a low-glycemic index diet or a high-fiber diet, improved some measures of glucose control, including fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations, as well as markers of long-term glycemic control [(11)](#reference11). The effect was stronger in patients with diagnosed diabetes compared to individuals with normoglycemia [(11)](#reference11). In a three-month trial in 114 people with type 2 diabetes, those randomized to a low-glycemic diet that emphasized 1 cup/day of legumes had significant improvements in their [hemoglobin A1C value](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c) \u2014 the main fraction of glycated [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) that reflects glycemic control over the past four months \u2014 compared to those randomized to a high-wheat fiber diet [(12)](#reference12). Small studies in healthy individuals have found that consumption of legumes improved postprandial glucose response at the subsequent meal (called the 'subsequent meal effect' or 'second meal effect') [(13-15)](#reference13), although this has not been extensively studied. In addition to improving glycemic and insulin control, consumption of legumes may increase [satiety](../glossary#satiety) and decrease both food intake and body weight, indirectly improving glycemic control (see [Obesity](#obesity-prevention) below). [Observational studies](../glossary#observationa-study) on the association of soy intake and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) have reported mixed results. A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight observational studies (six [prospective cohort](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and two [cross sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study)) found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between soy intake and risk of type 2 diabetes; however, there was a high degree of [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) in the analysis [(16)](#reference16). Moreover, when a subgroup analysis was done and only prospective cohort studies were examined, the association was no longer significant [(16)](#reference16). A meta-analysis of 19 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including 1,518 participants, found that soy consumption \u2014 as soy foods/whole soy, isolated soy protein, or [soy isoflavone](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) \u2014 had no effect on fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) or [insulin ](../glossary#insulin)concentrations [(17)](#reference17). Yet, subgroup analyses reported the effect on [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) differed by type of soy intervention: adherence to a whole-soy diet lowered fasting glucose concentrations, while soy protein isolate or isoflavone supplementation had no effect on fasting glucose concentrations [(17)](#reference17). Several characteristics of legumes may contribute to protection against [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). They are rich in [soluble](../glossary#soluble) [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) and [phytosterols](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/phytosterols), which are known to have [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering effects, and their high [folate](../vitamins/folate) content may help lower [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations. Additionally, legumes are good sources of [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium) and [potassium](../minerals/potassium), which may decrease cardiovascular disease [risk](../glossary#risk) by helping to lower blood pressure [(18)](#reference18). The low-glycemic index values of beans mean that they are less likely to raise blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentrations (see [Type 2 diabetes mellitus](#type-2-diabetes-prevention) above), and this may also decrease cardiovascular disease risk. Further, the substitution of legumes for foods high in [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) or refined [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) may offer some cardioprotection. Some, but not all, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found regular legume intake to be associated with a lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, and overall, most [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have found legume consumption decreases cardiometabolic risk factors, especially circulating [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations. In a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), legume intake as part of a Mediterranean diet was associated with a 9% lower risk of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), although one of the included studies grouped legume consumption with nuts, which are known to be cardioprotective (see the article on [Nuts](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/nuts#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)) [(19)](#reference19). In a [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analysis of five prospective cohort studies, consuming four 100-g servings of legumes (beans, peas, lentils, tofu) weekly was associated with a 14% lower risk of [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) [(20)](#reference20). This association was driven mainly by a prospective cohort study that followed participants for 19 years, finding those who ate dry beans, peas, or peanuts at least four times weekly had a 21% lower CHD risk compared to those who ate them less than once weekly [(21)](#reference21). Most recently, in a meta-analysis that included both CHD incidence and CHD-related mortality together as outcomes (eight prospective cohort studies in total), the highest versus lowest legume intakes were associated with a 10% decreased risk [(22)](#reference22). In contrast, legume intake has not been linked to risk of [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) in four separate meta-analyses [(20](#reference20), [22-24)](#reference22). Serum lipid profiles: Some, but not all, [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that regular legume consumption results in favorable changes in the [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile. A 2014 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 26 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) reported that pulse intake (beans, lentils, peas; median intake of 130 g/day or ~1.3 servings/day) reduced [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations by 0.17 (6.6 mg/dL) compared to an [isocaloric](../glossary#isocaloric) diet without pulses; however, there was no effect of pulse intake on non- [HDL](../glossary#HDL) cholesterol or apolipoprotein B concentrations [(25)](#reference25). It is important to note that there was significant [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among included trials of this meta-analysis, and the baseline lipid status of participants varied among the trials: eight trials included hyperlipidemic subjects, three trials were done in participants with normal lipid profiles, and 15 trials had a combination of normal and high lipid levels [(25)](#reference25). A previous meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that non-soy legume consumption decreased total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations by 11.76 mg/dL (10 studies) and 7.98 mg/dL (9 studies), respectively, when compared to a matched control (matched for total calories or macronutrients; baseline total cholesterol concentrations of participants ranged from 199 to 295 mg/dL among studies) [(26)](#reference26). A trend for a reduction in [serum](../glossary#serum) [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride) (-18.94 mg/dL, p=0.05) was observed in this meta-analysis, and no effect on HDL cholesterol was found [(26)](#reference26). Hypertension: Adherence to the [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan), which includes dry beans and peas among many other components [(27)](#reference27), has been shown to reduce blood pressure [(28)](#reference28), but it is not known whether legumes contribute to this effect. A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight [isocaloric](../glossary#isocaloric), controlled feeding trials (median of 10 weeks' duration) \u2014 including both [normotensive](../glossary#normotensive) and [hypertensive](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) participants (n=554; median age, 49 years) \u2014 found that pulse consumption (median of 162 g/day or ~1.6 daily servings) decreased [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) by 2.25 mm Hg but had no effect on [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) [(29)](#reference29). It is important to note that there was significant [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among trials included in the meta-analysis [(29)](#reference29). Serum lipid profiles: In 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the following health claim: \"Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease\" [(30)](#reference30). Most of the evidence to support this health claim was included in the Anderson et al. [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 38 controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) that was published in 1995. This meta-analysis found that an average intake of 47 g/day of soy protein decreased [serum](../glossary#serum) total [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations by an average of 9% and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentrations by an average of 13% [(31)](#reference31). Hypocholesterolemic effects were primarily noted in individuals with high baseline cholesterol concentrations [(31)](#reference31). A meta-analysis of 33 studies published since 1995 confirmed the hypocholesterolemic effect of soy protein reported in the Anderson et al. publication [(32)](#reference32). Another meta-analysis of 30 studies in individuals with normal or mildly elevated cholesterol levels concluded that about 25 g/day of soy protein significantly lowers LDL-cholesterol concentrations by about 6% [(33)](#reference33). Yet, a 2006 science advisory from the Nutrition Committee of the American Heart Association concluded that earlier research indicating that soy protein consumption results in clinically important reductions in LDL-cholesterol compared to other proteins has not been confirmed [(34)](#reference34). A 2011 meta-analysis of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), mostly in participants with hypercholesterolemia, found consumption of soy protein decreased LDL-cholesterol by 5.5% in parallel-design studies (20 trials; median soy protein intake of 31.5 g/day for a mean of 9.2 weeks) and 4.2% in [cross-over studies](../glossary#cross-over-trial) (23 trials; median soy protein intake of 26.0 g/day for a mean of 6.0 weeks) \u2014 such decreases may translate to 6%-10% decreases in risk for [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) [(35)](#reference35). Consumption of isolated soy isoflavones (as [supplements](../glossary#supplement) or extracts), however, does not appear to have favorable effects on serum lipid profiles [(35-42)](#reference35). In addition to possibly lowering cholesterol, incorporating soy foods into the diet may benefit overall [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) health due to their relatively high content of [polyunsaturated fat](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid), [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber), and [phytosterols](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/phytosterols) compared to including contain [fermentable](../glossary#fermentation) dietary certain [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) and [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) that may have anticancer effects. Some legumes serine protease inhibitors of the \"Bowman-Birk family\" (called Bowman-Birk inhibitors) that may have potential chemopreventive effects in the large intestine [(44)](#reference44). Moreover, simply replacing red and processed meats, which are linked to a higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) [(45)](#reference45), with legumes in the diet might lower risk. To date, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) of legume intake and colorectal cancer have reported conflicting findings. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that higher legume intake was linked to a 9% lower risk of [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer), although there was significant [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among studies [(46)](#reference46). Subgroup analyses revealed an [inverse 0.73-0.99) (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13) [(46)](#reference46). An earlier meta-analysis of cohort and [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found that higher versus lower legume intake was associated with a 17% lower risk of [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-ademona) [(47)](#reference47). Although beans, peas, and lentils are rich in a number of compounds that could potentially reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of certain [cancers](../glossary#cancer), the results of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) are too inconsistent to draw any firm conclusions regarding bean intake and cancer risk in general [(48, 49)](#reference48). [Prostate cancer: Several ] [prospective cohort non-soy legume intake to be [inversely related](../glossary#inverse-association) to incidence of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../glossary#cancer). In a six-year prospective study of more than 14,000 Seventh Day Adventist men living in the United States, those with the highest intakes of legumes (beans, lentils, or split peas) had a 47% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of prostate cancer [(50)](#reference50). In a prospective study of more than 58,000 men in the Netherlands, those with the highest intakes (median intake, 62 g/day) of legumes (including pulses and dried seeds) had a risk of prostate cancer that was 29% lower than those with the lowest intakes (median intake, 11 g/day) [(51)](#reference51). Moreover, a prospective study in a multiethnic cohort of 82,483 men examined the risk of prostate cancer in men who consumed legumes excluding soy products. In this study, men who consumed the highest amount of non-soy legumes had a 10% lower risk of total prostate cancer and a 28% lower risk of nonlocalized or high-grade prostate cancer compared to those who consumed the least amount of non-soy legumes [(52)](#reference52). However, another study found no association between dry bean intake and prostate cancer [(53)](#reference53). Most recently, in a prospective study in 3,313 French men, non-soy legume consumption was linked to a 44% reduced risk of prostate cancer [(54)](#reference54). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of these five prospective cohort studies found legume consumption was associated with a 15% lower risk of prostate cancer development (95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval), 0.72-0.99) [(55)](#reference55). Moreover, a pooled analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies found a similar association: a 14% lower risk of prostate cancer in men who consumed 100 g/day of mature beans (all beans excluding green beans and soybeans) compared to those who had intakes lower than 15 g/day [(56)](#reference56). Prostate cancer: Incidence rates of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) are much higher in North America, Northern and Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand compared to Asian countries, such as Japan and China, where soy is common in the diet [(57)](#reference57). Soy food consumption has been associated with a reduced [risk](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#risk) of prostate cancer in pooled analyses of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) [(58-62)](#reference58). In the most recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis), total soy intake (16 studies) and unfermented soy intake (11 studies) were associated with a 29% and 35% lower risk of prostate cancer, respectively; no association was found between fermented soy intake and prostate cancer (eight studies) [(62)](#reference62). Subgroup analyses revealed that the protective association of total soy intake was much stronger in [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) (39% lower risk) versus [prospective (10% lower risk) \u2014 unfermented soy intake was only associated with prostate cancer risk in case-control studies (45% lower risk) [(62)](#reference62). Results of case-control studies are more likely to be distorted by [bias](../glossary#bias) (i.e., the selection bias with the selection of cases and controls, as well as dietary [recall bias](../glossary#recall-bias)) than results of prospective cohort studies. For a review of studies on soy isoflavone intake and prostate cancer, see the separate article on [Soy Isoflavones](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones#prostate-cancer-prevention). [Breast cancer: More than 25 ] [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have assessed the relationship between soy food intake and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer). A 2008 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) reported differential effects based on the typical level of soy consumption [(63)](#reference63). In Asian populations, where soy intake is high, the authors found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between soy food intake and breast cancer; however, no association was observed in studies completed in Western populations, where soy food intake is much lower [(63)](#reference63). A 2016 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 prospective cohort studies \u2014 four conducted in Japan, three in the US, two in China, and one in France \u2014 found that higher intake of soy food was associated with an 8% lower incidence of breast cancer compared to lower intake [(64)](#reference64). Age at exposure to soy might affect subsequent risk of developing breast cancer. For instance, a few case-control studies have reported that higher soy intake during childhood or adolescence was associated with a lower risk of developing breast cancer later in life [(65-68)](#reference65). Soy intake later in life may not have as strong as an effect on breast cancer compared to exposure during childhood and adolescence [(63)](#reference63), and lifelong exposure to soy food may be needed to lower risk of breast cancer [(69)](#reference69). Isoflavones are likely responsible for any protection of soy against the development of breast cancer; studies of soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer are reviewed in the separate article on [Soy Isoflavones](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones#breast-cancer-prevention). [Endometrial cancer: Since soy isoflavones have ] [estrogenic](../glossary#estrogen) activity, studies have investigated whether isoflavone intake from soy food or [supplements](../glossary#supplement) might be related to development of [endometrial](../glossary#endometrium) [cancer](../glossary#cancer). There is only limited evidence of an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association), primarily from case-control studies [(70)](#reference70); see the separate [Soy Isoflavones](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones#endometrial-cancer-prevention). [Gastrointestinal cancers: Results of ] [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) [cancers](../glossary#cancer), including [gastric](../glossary#gastric) cancer and [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer), have been mixed. A 2016 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that included 18 [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) and 16 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found soy consumption was associated with a 7% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of gastrointestinal cancer; however, soy intake was not significantly linked to gastrointestinal cancer when the data from only cohort studies were considered ( [OR](../glossary#odds-ratio), 0.97; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval), 0.90-1.03) [(71)](#reference71). A soybean intake was associated with a 15% lower risk of colorectal cancer (95% CI, 0.73-0.99), but only three prospective cohort studies were included in this analysis [(46)](#reference46). High-quality studies that control for potential [confounders](../glossary#confounder) are needed to determine whether soy food intake \u2014 or legume intake in general \u2014 is linked to a lower risk of gastric or colorectal cancer. Numerous [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have shown that consuming low-glycemic index food delays the return of hunger, decreases subsequent food intake, and increases the sensation of fullness compared to consuming high-glycemic index food [(72, 73)](#reference72). Some trials have specifically examined the effect of legume or pulse consumption on food intake amount, [satiety](../glossary#satiety), or body weight. A 2016 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that included 21 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), mostly in overweight or obese subjects, reported an overall weight loss of 0.34 kg (0.75 lb) with diets that contained pulses (median intake 132 g/day for a median of six weeks; one serving ~100 g/day) [(74)](#reference74). This analysis found a greater weight loss in negative-energy balance trials (i.e., energy-restricted diets; weight loss averaging 1.74 kg or 3.8 lb) than in neutral energy-balance trials (i.e., weight-maintenance diets; weight loss averaging 0.29 kg or 0.64 lb), although both effects were statistically significant [(74)](#reference74). Six trials included in this meta-analysis examined the effect of pulse consumption (161 g/day; trial average duration of 10 weeks) on other measures of obesity: no effect was seen on waist circumference, but a trend for reduced body fat percentage was found with pulse consumption (p=0.07) [(74)](#reference74). A meta-analysis of 21 controlled clinical trials (duration ranging from 4 weeks to 2 years) found that soy consumption \u2014 as whole soy or soy protein \u2014 had no effect on body weight, and a subgroup analysis showed that soy consumption actually increased body weight in obese subjects [(75)](#reference75). Additionally, this meta-analysis found no effect of soy intake on fat mass (10 trials) or waist circumference (16 trials) [(75)](#reference75). A meta-analysis of nine acute, feeding trials in mostly normal-weight subjects reported pulse consumption, administered as a single bolus, increased measures of satiety by 31% compared to an isocaloric control; however, no effect on food intake at the subsequent/second meal was seen (seven trials) [(76)](#reference76). Increases in acute satiety, likely due to the high protein and [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) content and the low-glycemic load of legumes, could lead to reduced food intake and the weight loss observed in some studies. Although currently available studies are limited, the effect on satiety appears to be following consumption of pulses and not soy food (reviewed in [77](#reference77)). High-quality trials are needed to determine whether regular pulse or legume consumption results in weight loss in the long term. Some studies have linked adherence to either the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating pattern [(78, 79)](#reference78) or a Mediterranean-style diet [(78](#reference78), [80-82)](#reference80) with better overall [cognitive function](../health-disease/cognitive-function-in-brief) in healthy older adults. Legumes are one of many components included in these dietary patterns that might contribute to this purported association; studies reporting specifically on legume intake and cognitive endpoints are limited and have reported mixed results. In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 2,613 middle-age and older adults (ages 43-70 years) residing in the Netherlands, followed for five years, legume intake was not associated with changes in global cognitive function (memory, speed of information processing, and cognitive flexibility) [(83)](#reference83). In contrast, a prospective, [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) of the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Study found that older adults (65 years) who included legumes in their diets nearly every day had a 22% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of cognitive decline over a three-year period compared to those who had lower intakes \u2014 this study included 5,691 illiterate older adults who had no evidence of cognitive decline at baseline [(84)](#reference84). Most recently, a small study in 214 older, Italian adults (65 years) with normal cognitive function used the method of principal component analysis and identified legumes as one of the food categories linked to better cognitive scores at the end of a one-year period [(85)](#reference85). Large-scale prospective cohort studies are needed to examine whether legume intake is associated with improvements in cognitive health or risk of [dementia](../glossary#dementia) in older adults. A 2017 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found a weak, [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between a large, international prospective cohort study (N=135,335) not included in the 2017 meta-analysis, stronger inverse associations were found with respect to all-cause mortality and non-cardiovascular mortality; however, legume consumption was not associated with cardiovascular-related mortality [(87)](#reference87). In this study, consuming more than one serving of legumes daily was associated with a 42% lower risk of non-cardiovascular mortality and a 41% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to consuming fewer than one legume serving per month [(87)](#reference87). In a smaller prospective study (N=7,212) in Spain, conducted among older individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease, non-soy legume intake was associated with a lower risk of cancer-related mortality but a higher risk of cardiovascular-related mortality [(88)](#reference88). It is important to note that average intakes of legumes in this study were low, with those in the highest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) consuming a mean 28 g/day of legumes \u2014 less than one-third of a serving [(88)](#reference88). Moreover, a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies did not find soy intake to be associated with all-cause (six studies), cardiovascular-related (six studies), or cancer-related (eight studies) mortality [(89)](#reference89). Substituting beans, peas, and lentils for foods that are high in [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) or refined [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) is likely to help lower the [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). Soybeans and foods made from soybeans (soy foods) are excellent sources of protein. In fact, soy protein is complete protein, meaning it provides all of the essential [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) in adequate amounts for human health [(6)](#reference6). Like beans, peas, and lentils, soy foods are also excellent substitutes for protein sources that are high in saturated fat like red meat or cheese. Legumes are not only good sources of protein and dietary [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) but also of [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin), [minerals](../glossary#mineral), as well as [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical) that may benefit health (see Table 1). The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans \u2014 healthy eating recommendations issued jointly by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture \u2014 include legumes (beans, lentils, dried peas, and edamame [green soybeans]) in two different food groups: the protein group and the vegetable group [(1)](#references). Recommended intake of legumes at the 2,000-calorie level translates to 1\u00bd cup-equivalents weekly for those who follow a Healthy US-style or a Healthy Mediterranean-style eating pattern and 3 cup-equivalents weekly for those following a Healthy Vegetarian eating pattern [(1)](#references). Current intakes of legumes among Americans are well below these recommendations (see [Figure 2-4](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-2/a-closer-look-at-current-intakes-and-recommended-shifts/#figure-2-4) in the Dietary Guidelines). The Dietary Guidelines also recommend 8 oz-equivalents/week of soy products for vegetarians consuming 2,000 calories/day and 5 oz-equivalents per week for those following other recommended eating patterns, although nuts and seeds can contribute to meet this recommendation. Moreover, [fortified](../glossary#fortification) soy beverages are emphasized as alternative to dairy in the latest Dietary Guidelines [(1)](#references). |Macronutrients||Vitamins||Minerals||Phytochemicals| | | Originally written in 2004 by: Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in December 2005 by: Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in April 2009 by: Victoria J.

Recent research, however, suggests that regular nut consumption is an important part of a healthful diet. Although the fat content of nuts is relatively high (13-20 grams (g)/ounce), most of the fats in nuts are [monounsaturated](../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid) and [polyunsaturated fats](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) rather than [saturated fats](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) (see [Table The term \"nuts\" refers nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts. Despite their name, peanuts are legumes like peas and beans. However, because they are nutritionally similar to tree nuts, they may share some of the same beneficial properties. Studies mentioned in this article have examined the effects of tree nuts and peanuts either together or separately. In large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), regular nut consumption has been consistently associated with significant reductions in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD). An early study that followed more than 30,000 Seventh Day Adventists over 12 years found that participants who consumed nuts at least five times weekly had a 48% lower risk of death from CHD and a 51% lower risk of nonfatal [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (MI) compared to those who consumed nuts less than once weekly [(1)](#references). In addition, the risk of death from CHD was 39% lower in Seventh Day Adventists older than 83 years who ate nuts at least five times weekly compared to those who consumed nuts less than once weekly [(2)](#reference2). More recently, an analysis of data from the Nurses' Health Study I that followed 84,136 women (ages at enrollment, 30-55 years) for 26 years reported a 32% lower risk of CHD in those who ate an average of 2.8 servings/week compared to those who never ate nuts [(3)](#reference3). A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 prospective cohort studies, including the Seventh Day Adventists and Nurses' Health Studies, found a 34% lower risk of CHD with the highest versus lowest level of nut consumption [(4)](#reference4). A dose-response analysis indicated that every 1 serving/week increment in nut consumption was associated with a 5% reduction in CHD risk [(4)](#reference4). In another meta-analysis that included data from over 200,000 participants enrolled in three large cohort studies, weekly intake of at least five servings of nuts was associated with a 20% lower risk of CHD when compared to no consumption [(5)](#reference5). However, there was no evidence of an association between nut consumption and risk of stroke. In contrast, another recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found a 12% lower risk of stroke (14 studies) and a 19% lower risk of stroke-related death (seven studies) with the highest versus lowest intake of nuts [(6)](#reference6). The PREDIMED (Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea) study that between 2003-2011 was a multicenter, [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of a Mediterranean diet, with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, compared to a control diet, in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in 7,447 adults (55 years) at high risk of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(7)](#reference7). Adherence to a Mediterranean diet, supplemented with olive oil or mixed nuts for nearly five years resulted in a 30% lower risk of cardiovascular events and no weight gain [(7)](#reference7). Finally, a modeling study estimated that an increase in daily nut intake from 5 g to 30 g could have prevented 7,680 incidental cardiovascular events and saved about 65,000 years of life that were lost to stroke or heart attack in a scenario based on data from the Swedish population in 2013 [(8)](#reference8). Blood lipids: In a [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) analysis of a representative sample of the US population \u2014 the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] 2005-2010 \u2014 tree nut consumers (\u00bc ounce/day) were found to have higher blood [HDL](../glossary#HDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations and lower [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI), waist [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) than subjects consuming <\u00bc ounce/day [(9)](#reference9). However, these observations may be due to [reverse causation](../glossary#reverse-causation), in particular because health-conscious people are more likely to consume healthy diets that include nuts. A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) assessed the evidence of the effect of tree nut consumption on blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile using findings from 42 [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in a total of 2,101 participants, among which 45% were at risk of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) and untreated. Results indicated lower concentrations of total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentrations but no effect on concentrations of HDL-cholesterol or [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) [(10)](#reference10). Similar observations were made in meta-analyses of interventions examining the specific effect of walnut [(11, 12)](#reference11), almond [(13)](#reference13), hazelnut [(14)](#reference14), or pistachio [(15)](#reference15) consumption on blood lipid profile of people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol. Interestingly, in a small recent trial in 46 statin-treated participants, the daily consumption of 100 g (~3.5 ounces) of almonds for four weeks led to a 4.9% reduction in non-HDL-cholesterol (i.e., total cholesterol minus HDL-cholesterol) concentration [(16)](#reference16). Blood pressure: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet for nearly four years in the PREDIMED trial led to significant improvements in [diastolic](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) (but not [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure)) blood pressure compared to a control diet. However, there were no differences in blood pressure changes whether the Mediterranean diet was supplemented with nuts or olive oil [(17)](#reference17). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 21 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 1,652 participants found little evidence for an effect of nut supplementation on either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. A blood pressure-lowering effect of nuts was reported when only subjects without type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) were considered. Of note, this meta-analysis included four trials that used either peanuts or soy nuts, which are not tree nuts [(18)](#reference18). Endothelial function: Measures of brachial flow-mediated [endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function, associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with risk of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events. A 2017 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) eight [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) suggested that supplementation with walnuts (four studies), pistachios (three studies), or almonds (one study) for up to 12 weeks may help increase FMD in subjects at risk of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(19)](#reference19). Similar observations were reported in another recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [(20)](#reference20). Chronic low inflammation: A 2016 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 20 small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) conducted primarily in subjects at high risk for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) found no evidence of an effect of nut supplementation for up to 12 weeks (only two studies lasted longer) on markers of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) in blood [(21)](#reference21). Of note, four of the trials included in this meta-analysis exclusively supplemented participants with either peanuts or soy nuts. Nonetheless, a similar conclusion was reached in another meta-analysis of 25 interventions [(19)](#reference19). Of note, a recent systematic review of meta-analysis corroborated the account of the cardiovascular health benefits of nut consumption presented above [(22)](#reference22). Nuts are energy-dense in particular because of their high fat content; yet, most of their fat is in the form contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) in their chemical structure, as opposed to [saturated fatty acids](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) that have none. Tree nuts contain more MUFAs than PUFAs with the exception of walnuts and pine nuts, which have more PUFAs than MUFAs, and Brazil nuts, which contain equivalent amounts of MUFAs and PUFAs (Table 1). Walnuts are especially rich in acid (~0.8 g/ounce), an omega-3 fatty acid Acids](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids)). Other bioactive compounds, including [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient), [phytosterols](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/phytosterols), and [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber), may also contribute to improving the cardiometabolic profile (Table 1 and Figure 1). Some nuts (pecans, pistachios, almonds, and hazelnuts) are a source of [flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) that may contribute to cardiovascular health (see the article on [Flavonoids](..dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)) [(23)](#reference23).

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged the current evidence for a relationship between nut consumption and cardiovascular disease by approving the following qualified health claim for nuts [(24)](#reference24): \"Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as macadamia nuts [(25)](#reference25)) as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease\" [(24)](#reference24). Early results from the Nurses' Health Study I suggested that nut and peanut butter consumption might be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) in women [(26)](#reference26). However, two independent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of more recent prospective cohort reported no evidence of an association between nut consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes [(27, 28)](#reference27). Nonetheless, a meta-analysis of 12 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 450 participants with type 2 diabetes showed that supplementation with tree nuts for a median of eight weeks could reduce fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentration and [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) (HbA1c) concentration, a measure of glycemic control [(29)](#reference29). Although there were no significant effects on fasting [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentration or a measure of [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) (HOMA-IR) [(29)](#reference29), these findings suggest that nuts might be part of a healthful diet for the management of [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Peanuts and tree nuts are among the most common foods to trigger allergic reactions, potentially severe ( [anaphylaxis](../glossary#anaphylaxis)) and fatal [(48)](#reference48). Such reactions can be triggered by a primary [antibody](../glossary#antibody) response against some nut [proteins](../glossary#protein) or by antibodies raised against protein in pollen but cross-reacting with structurally similar proteins in nuts. Mixed method-based estimates of peanut allergy in US children suggest that the condition is increasingly [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) and ranges between 2 and 5% [(49)](#reference49). Estimates based solely on self reports suggest a prevalence of tree nut allergy <1% in US adults and <2% in US children [(50)](#reference50). Individuals with peanut or tree nut allergies need to take special precautions to avoid inadvertently consuming peanuts or tree nuts by checking labels and avoiding unlabeled snacks, candies, and desserts [(50)](#reference50). See the [Food Allergy Research and Education](https://www.foodallergy.org/) [ website](https://www.foodallergy.org/) for additional tips to avoiding unintentional peanut or tree nut exposure. In the 2010 'Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States,' the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases discourages nut avoidance during pregnancy or breastfeeding as a way of preventing food intolerance in the offspring [(51)](#reference51). Results from two birth cohort studies suggested an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between maternal peanut or tree nut consumption during, shortly before, or just after their pregnancy and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of food allergy (including nut allergy) in the offspring [(52, 53)](#reference52), supporting the current recommendations. Yet, prior studies found higher peanut consumption in mothers of children with peanut allergy [(54)](#reference54). Additional studies are needed to clarify the effect of maternal nut intake on food tolerance in the offspring. A 2017 addendum to the 2010 'Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States' included recommendations for the prevention of peanut allergy through the early introduction of peanuts in infants' diet [(55)](#reference55) (Table 2). |Infant Criteria||Earliest allergies||Age-appropriate and in accordance with family preferences|| | Brazil nuts grown in areas of Brazil with [selenium](../minerals/selenium)-rich soil may provide more than 100 \u00b5g of selenium in one nut, while those grown in selenium-poor soil may provide 10 times less [(56)](#reference56). For information regarding toxicity of selenium, see the article on [Selenium](../minerals/selenium#toxicity). Regular nut consumption, equivalent to 1 ounce of nuts five times weekly, has been consistently associated with significant reductions in risk of [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) in [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study). Consuming nuts daily as part of a diet that is low in [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) has been found to lower [serum](../glossary#serum) total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) in a number of controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). Since an ounce of most nuts provides at least 160 calories (kcal), simply adding an ounce of nuts daily to one's habitual diet without eliminating other foods may result in weight gain. Substituting unsalted nuts for less healthy snacks or for meat in main dishes are two ways to make nuts part of a healthful diet. A modeling study that used 2009-2012 NHANES data from 17,444 individuals (1 year old) estimated that substituting tree nuts for between-meal snacks on a calorie-per-calorie basis would improve the nutritional quality of dietary intakes through a shift in [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) intake (less saturated and more unsaturated fatty acids), a reduction in added sugar and [sodium](../minerals/sodium) (salt), and an increase in [potassium](../minerals/potassium), [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium), and [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) [(57)](#reference57). The [2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/) encourage the consumption of nuts, seeds, and soy products as part of a healthy diet. The recommendations are presented in Table 3. |Life Stage||Age||Mediterranean-style | aDietary guidelines apply when no quantitative Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value is available.

Nutr J. 2017;16(1):17. ] [(PubMed)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270158) Contents Grains are seeds of plants belonging to the Poaceae family (also called Gramineae or true grasses). Some examples of edible grains include wheat, rice, maize (corn), barley, oats, rye, triticale (wheat-rye hybrid), millet, bulgur, and sorghum [(1)](#references). Although they are not members of the Poaceae family, whole-grain ingredients also include pseudo-grains like quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat. A whole grain has an outer layer of bran, a [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate)-rich middle layer called the endosperm, and an inner germ layer (Figure 1). Whole-grain foods contain entire grain seeds either intact, cracked, crushed, or flaked, as long as the bran, endosperm, and germ are retained in the same proportions as they exist in the intact kernel [(1)](#references). Whole grains are rich in potentially beneficial compounds, including [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin), [minerals](../glossary#mineral), [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber), and [phytochemicals](../glossary#phytochemical), such as [lignans](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/lignans) and [phytosterols](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/phytosterols) [(2)](#reference2). Most of these compounds are located in the bran or the germ of the grain, both of which are lost during the refining (milling) process, leaving only the starchy endosperm [(1)](#references). Compared to diets high in refined grains, diets rich in whole grains are associated with reduced risks of several [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease). The health benefits of whole grains are not entirely explained by the individual contributions of the nutrients and phytochemicals they contain. Whole grains represent a unique package of energy, [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient), and phytochemicals that work synergistically to promote health and prevent disease [(3)](#reference3). Because there is no globally accepted definition as to what constitutes a whole-grain food, it is difficult to compare studies that examined the effects of whole-grain consumption on markers of health and disease outcomes. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved health claims for whole grains (see [Finding whole grain foods](#increasing-intake)) to foods containing 51% of whole-grain ingredients by weight or 8 g of whole grains per one ounce (~30 g)-serving size [(4)](#reference4). An international multidisciplinary expert group recently proposed to label \"whole grain\" a food with a whole-grain content of 8 g per ounce [(5)](#reference5). Yet, to date, most [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) that examined the health impact of consuming whole-grain foods have included foods containing 25% of whole grains and added brans by weight [(6)](#reference6). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including 385,868 participants, have found that high versus low intakes of total grains and whole grains were associated with a significant reduction in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(7)](#reference7). On the other hand, no relationship was found between refined-grain intake and diabetes in a meta-analysis of six prospective studies of 258,078 subjects [(7)](#reference7). Specifically, the consumption of three daily servings of whole-grain foods was associated with a 32% lower risk of diabetes (see below for [Examples of one serving of whole grains](#serving-examples)). Further analyses showed a significantly lower risk of diabetes with high versus low consumption of whole grains as a single food (i.e., brown rice, wheat bran) or as an ingredient in food (i.e., whole-grain bread, whole-grain breakfast cereal) but not with refined grains like white rice and wheat germ [(7)](#reference7). In addition, a pooled analysis of three large prospective cohorts \u2014 the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [HPFS] and the Nurses' Health Studies [NHS I and II] \u2014 reported a 17% increased risk of type 2 diabetes in participants in the highest (5 servings/week) versus lowest (<1 serving/month) [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of white rice intake, while brown rice consumption (2 servings/week versus <1 serving/month) was associated with an 11% reduction in risk [(8)](#reference8). Interestingly, substituting 50 g/day ( serving/day) of brown rice or other whole grains for the same amount of white rice could be associated with a predicted diabetes risk reduction of 16% or more [(8)](#reference8). Whole grains have been [hypothesized](../glossary#hypothesis) to reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) by improving [postprandial](../glossary#postprandial) glycemia. Immediately after a meal, blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) concentrations are increased, and secretion of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) by the pancreas stimulates glucose and lipid storage into tissues. Prolonged postprandial [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) and [hyperlipidemia](../glossary#hyperlipidemia) have [insulin resistance,](../glossary#insulin-resistance) and [endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction, all contributing to the development of [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) like type 2 diabetes mellitus [(9)](#reference9). The refining process that removes bran and germ facilitates the digestion of the [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate)-rich endosperm such that carbohydrates from refined grains were thought to elicit a higher and more rapid elevation in blood [glucose](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#glucose), as well as a greater demand for insulin, than whole grains [(10)](#reference10). However, compared with foods made from refined grains, whole-grain products do not necessarily have a lower glucose-raising potential, i.e., a lower [glycemic index](../glossary#glycemic-index) (GI) [(11)](#reference11). The GI concept is based on the idea that foods containing carbohydrates that are easily digested, absorbed, and [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) have a high GI (GI 70 on the glucose scale); in contrast, foods containing slowly digestible carbohydrates that elicit a reduced postprandial glucose response are considered to have a low GI (GI 55 on the glucose scale) (see also the article on [Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load](glycemic-index-glycemic-load)) [(12)](#reference12). Bread, breakfast cereal, rice, and snack products have been attributed either a low or high GI, whether or not they include whole grains [(11)](#reference11), suggesting that the type of food rather than its whole-grain content affects postprandial blood glucose concentrations. In some [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), higher whole-grain intakes have been associated with decreased insulin resistance [(13)](#reference13) and increased [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) [(14)](#reference14) in healthy individuals. In a controlled [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in 11 overweight or obese adults, consumption of a diet rich in whole grains for six weeks lowered several clinical measures of insulin resistance compared with a diet high in refined grains [(15)](#reference15). However, in a recent [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of 61 adults with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome), the consumption of a diet based on several whole-grain cereal products for 12 weeks had no effect on fasting [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of glucose, insulin, lipids, or on insulin resistance compared with a refined grain-based diet. Yet, postprandial plasma insulin and [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) \u2014 but not postprandial plasma glucose \u2014 were significantly reduced with the whole grain-based diet [(16)](#reference16). A decreased postprandial insulin response may be associated with an increase in tissue sensitivity to insulin [(3)](#reference3). In another [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 20 healthy volunteers, three-day consumption of whole barley-based bread induced a lower insulin peak value following a standard breakfast than the same course with refined wheat bread. Whole barley-based bread consumption was also associated with an increase in circulating concentrations of gut-related [hormones](../glossary#hormone) (e.g., peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide) and a higher gut [fermentation](../glossary#fermentation) activity. This suggested improvements in hormonal control of digestion and in [colonic](../glossary#colon) fermentation of resistant starch (indigestible fiber) [(17)](#reference17), possibly promoting the feeling of satiety [(18)](#reference18) and increasing insulin sensitivity [(19)](#reference19). Whole-grain consumption might be improving insulin sensitivity rather than blunting postprandial hyperglycemia; however, well-designed, large randomized controlled trials are necessary to provide further insight into how whole-grain consumption may protect against type 2 diabetes. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) published between 1998 and 2010 found that the highest intake of whole grains (about three servings daily) was associated with an overall 21% reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke), when compared to the lowest intake of whole grains and after adjustment for several CVD risk factors [(20)](#reference20). Further, although evidence is currently limited, whole-grain intake may be associated with a reduced risk of [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease [(21, 22)](#reference21). Compared to refined grains, whole grains are rich in nutrients associated with cardiovascular risk reduction. In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) in 42,850 men, the top versus bottom [quintile](../glossary#quintile) (49.6 g/day vs. 3.3 g/day) of whole-grain intake was associated with a 16% reduced risk of CHD after multiple adjustments for age, gender, and CHD risk factors [(23)](#reference23). Further adjustments for whole-grain constituents, association such that it was no longer statistically significant, suggesting that the micronutrient and fiber content may explain the cardiovascular benefits of consuming whole grains. Protective cardiovascular effects associated with higher intakes of whole grains and lower intakes of refined grains have included improvements in blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles and reductions in markers of [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation). A meta-analysis of 21 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) indicated that whole-grain interventions for 4 to 16 weeks could improve an individual's blood concentrations of fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose), [insulin](../glossary#insulin), total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), as well as reduce [diastolic](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) and [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) [(20)](#reference20). Consistent with this, a recently updated [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 23 randomized controlled trials published between 1988 and 2015 indicated that consumption of whole grains (28 g/day-213 g/day for 2 to 16 weeks), especially whole-grain oats in cereal and other products, for a couple of weeks resulted in significant reductions in blood concentrations of [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) and total and LDL-cholesterol when compared to control diets with refined grain [(24)](#reference24). Interventions that included mixed whole-grain products (bread, muesli, ready-to-eat cereal, pasta, rice, crisps, muffins, cookies) also improved blood [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol concentrations [(24)](#reference24). In addition, although wheat fiber has not been found to lower [serum](../glossary#serum) cholesterol concentrations, numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that increasing intakes of oat fiber and soluble fiber from barley resulted in modest reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol [(25-27)](#reference25). In light of such findings, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved claims regarding whole grains and reduction in risk of CHD that apply to diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol providing at least 3 g/day of -glucan soluble fiber from oats (oat bran, rolled oats [oatmeal], whole oat flour) or whole-grain barley [(28)](#reference28). Whole grains are also sources of [phytosterols](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/phytosterols) \u2014 compounds that can decrease serum cholesterol by interfering with its intestinal absorption [(2)](#reference2). Evidence from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggested an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) and metabolic diseases [(29)](#reference29). However, [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have provided mixed results. In a recent [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in healthy low whole-grain consumers, the effect of increased consumption of mixed whole grains (mean intake, 168 g/day) for six weeks was compared to whole-grain consumption of less than 16 g/day. Increasing whole-grain intake had no effect on absolute counts of immune cells in blood ( [leukocytes](../glossary#leukocyte), [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte), [natural killer cells](../glossary#natural-killer-cells)), on ex vivo [phagocytic](../glossary#phagocytosis) activities of these cells, or on markers of inflammation (e.g., IL-10, TNF-, [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) [CRP]) in blood [(30)](#reference30). Previous studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in healthy normal weight, overweight, or [obese](../glossary#obesity) subjects have also failed to demonstrate any benefits of whole-grain intake on markers of inflammation [(31-35)](#reference31). One eight-week dietary intervention study in 80 overweight or obese subjects found that replacement of refined products in the habitual diet by whole-grain wheat products resulted in a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine) TNF-, a transient increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10, and no change in CRP compared to intake of refined wheat [(36)](#reference36). In another randomized cross-over intervention study, overweight/obese children (ages, 8-15 years) were provided with a list of whole-grain products and asked to either obtain half of their grain servings from whole-grain foods every day for six weeks (whole-grain group) or abstain from consuming any of these foods (control group). Mean daily consumption of 98 g of whole-grain products (compared to 11 g/day) resulted in reductions in [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of CRP, sICAM-1 (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1), protein amyloid A), and [leptin](../glossary#leptin) [(37)](#reference37). An increased whole-grain intake to about five daily servings (compared to <1 serving/day) also reduced blood concentrations of CRP but had no effect on IL-10 and TNF- concentrations in obese adults with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) following a hypocaloric diet [(38)](#reference38). Inconsistency among studies may be attributed to differences in the health status of participants, the duration of interventions, and/or the types of whole grains selected. In particular, if foods with a low glycemic index (GI) can lower cardiometabolic and inflammation markers [(39)](#reference39), substituting refined grain products by whole grains with high GI may not demonstrate any benefits regarding the [risk](../glossary#risk) of heart disease. Although the protective effects of whole grains against various types of cancer are not as well established as those against type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and [cardiovascular [risk](../glossary#risk) [(40-42)](#reference40). An early [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 40 case-control studies examining 20 different types of cancer found that people with higher whole-grain intakes had an overall risk of cancer that was 34% lower than those with lesser whole-grain intakes [(40)](#reference40). Higher intakes of whole grains were most consistently associated with decreased risk of [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract cancers, including cancers of the mouth, throat, [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus), stomach, [colon](../glossary#colon), and rectum. A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed more than 61,000 Swedish women for 15 years found that those who consumed more than 4.5 servings of whole grains daily had a 35% lower risk of colon cancer than those who consumed less than 1.5 servings of whole grains daily [(43)](#reference43). In the large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health prospective study in 291,988 men and 197,623 women, mean whole-grain intakes \u2014 much lower than in the above-mentioned Swedish cohort \u2014 were also inversely associated with risk of [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer), especially rectal cancer [(44)](#reference44). Specifically, the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of whole-grain intake (2.6 servings/day vs. 0.4 servings/day) was associated with a 36% lower risk of developing rectal cancer [(44)](#reference44). In a [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study), including participants of the multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), the top versus bottom [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) alkylresorcinol concentrations, used as a surrogate marker of whole-grain wheat and rye intakes, was found to be associated with a 52% lower incidence of distal colon cancer. No correlations were reported with the incidence of rectal cancer, colon cancer, and proximal colon cancer, or with the overall incidence of colorectal cancers [(45)](#reference45). Not all cohort studies have suggested that whole grains might protect against intestinal cancers [(46, 47)](#reference46). However, a dose-response analysis based on the results of six cohort studies found a 17% reduction in colorectal cancer risk with an increment of three servings (three oz-eq or 90 g) of whole grains daily [(48)](#reference48). Of note, a recent analysis of three Scandinavian cohorts that are also part of the EPIC study and include over 110,000 participants showed an inverse correlation between total whole-grain intake and esophageal cancer risk. Each 10 g-increase in whole-grain wheat intake was found to be associated with a 50% lower risk of esophageal cancer. Such an association was not observed with whole-grain rye or with whole-grain oats [(49)](#reference49). In contrast to refined-grain products, whole grains are rich in numerous compounds that may be protective against cancer, particularly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract [(50)](#reference50). Whole grains are a major source of [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber), and high-fiber intakes are thought to speed up the passage of stool through the colon, allowing less time for potentially [carcinogenic](../glossary#carcinogen) compounds to stay in contact with cells that line the inner surface of the colon [(51)](#reference51). Dietary fiber can also exert chemopreventive effects via short-chain [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) that are generated when fiber is fermented by the colonic microbiota [(52)](#reference52). Whole grains also contain acids, [lignans](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/lignans), [phytoestrogens](../glossary#phytoestrogen), [signal transduction pathways](../glossary#signal-transduction-pathway) that promote the development of cancer or bind potentially damaging free metal [ions](../glossary#ion) in the gastrointestinal tract [(53, 54)](#reference53). Recent large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have investigated the relationship between whole-grain consumption and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Higher versus lower intakes of whole grains (1.20 oz-eq/day versus 0.13 oz-eq/day) have been associated with a 17% lower risk of all-cause mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study of 367,442 older adults [(55)](#reference55). Higher whole-grain intakes were significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality from [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (-17%), and infections (-23%). These associations were largely attenuated after adjustments for cereal fiber intakes, suggesting a major role for fiber in the protective effects of whole grains on mortality [(55)](#reference55). Another recent analysis of two US prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) in 74,341 women and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) in 43,744 men, reported a 9% lower risk of all-cause mortality in individuals in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of whole-grain intake [(56)](#reference56). Higher whole-grain consumption was associated with a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease-related mortality, but no correlation was found with cancer-related mortality. Finally, the association of whole-grain intake with mortality was also examined in over 110,000 participants of the Scandinavian HELGA cohort [(57)](#reference57). In this cohort, a doubling of the consumption of whole-grain products or that of specific whole-grain wheat, rye, or oats was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. These results from cohort studies in the US and northern Europe consistently suggested a role of whole-grain consumption in the prevention of early death. Diets rich in whole grains and fiber may help prevent or improve constipation symptoms by softening and adding bulk to stool and by speeding its passage through the [colon](../glossary#colon) [(58, 59)](#reference58). Such diets are also associated with decreased risk of [diverticulosis](../glossary#diverticulosis), a condition characterized by the formation of small pouches (diverticula) in the colon. Although most people with diverticulosis experience no symptoms, about 10%-25% may develop pain or [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), known as [diverticulitis](../glossary#diverticulitis) [(58)](#reference58). Diverticulitis was virtually unheard of before the practice of milling (refining) flour began in industrialized countries, and the role of a low-fiber diet in the development of diverticular disease is well established [(60)](#reference60). If high-fiber diets reduce the risk of diverticular disease [(61, 62)](#reference61), then the source of fiber (e.g., from cereal, fruit, vegetables) may be important. Interestingly, a 5 g-increase in intake of fiber from cereal was found to be associated with a 14% reduced risk of diverticular disease in a UK-based cohort of 690,075 women (mean age, 60 years) followed for up to six years; the risk of diverticular disease was decreased by 15% and 5% with a 5 g-increase in the consumption of fruit fiber and vegetable fiber, respectively [(62)](#reference62). High-fiber diets are also recommended for people with diverticulosis in order to prevent the formation of additional diverticula rather than to resolve formed diverticula [(58)](#reference58). People with diverticulosis are sometimes advised to avoid eating small seeds and husks to prevent them from becoming lodged in diverticula and causing diverticulitis, especially if they do not consume a high-fiber diet [(58)](#reference58). However, it should be noted that no study has ever shown that avoiding seeds or popcorn reduces the risk of diverticulitis in an individual with diverticulosis [(60)](#reference60). [Prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have consistently suggested that whole-grain consumption is associated with lower [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) and lower [risks](../glossary#risk) of weight gain [obesity](../glossary#obesity) [20)](#reference20). However, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) published between 1988 and 2012 reported no significant effects of whole-grain intakes (from 18.2 g/day-150 g/day for 2 to 16 weeks) on body weight (26 trials), body fat (7 studies), and waist circumference (9 studies) in up to 2,060 normal-weight or overweight/obese adults without chronic health conditions [(63)](#reference63). In a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), controlled trial in 60 overweight/obese individuals with metabolic syndrome, the consumption of whole grains (about 6-12 servings/day) was compared to that of refined grains during a 12-week intervention period that included a weight-maintenance diet for the first six weeks followed by six weeks of a hypocaloric diet [(64)](#reference64). Increased whole-grain intake failed to lower body weight, BMI, percentage of body fat, or waist circumference beyond reductions also observed with consumption of refined grains. Of note, individuals who consumed whole grains showed an improved fasting glycemia compared to those fed refined grains, but other cardiometabolic variables remained unchanged [(64)](#reference64). These results contrast with other energy-restricted dietary interventions showing a more favorable effect of whole grains on percentage of body fat compared to refined grains [(38](#reference38), [65)](#reference65). Further investigation is warranted to clarify whether whole-grain consumption could play a role in body weight regulation. Whole-grain intakes approaching three servings daily are associated with significant reductions in [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) [risk](../glossary#risk) in populations with relatively low whole-grain intakes. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans \u2014 issued jointly by the US Department of Health and Human Services and US Department of Agriculture \u2014 recommend that at least half of all grains consumed be whole grains and to increase whole-grain intake by replacing refined grains with whole grains [(66)](#reference66). In the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the unit of measure of a whole-grain serving size is the ounce-equivalent (oz-eq). A whole-grain serving size corresponds to (1) one ounce (~30 g) of a 100% whole-grain food in its ready-to-eat form, (2) two ounces of partly whole-grain products, or (3) the amount of food containing 16 g of whole-grain ingredients [(67)](#reference67). Table 1 summarizes the 2015-2020 | 1Dietary guidelines apply when no quantitative Dietary Reference Intake ( The US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 reported mean whole-grain intakes of 0.57 oz-eq/day adolescents and 0.82 oz-eq/day in adults [(68)](#reference68). Approximately 40% of Americans consume no whole grains, and only 2.9% of children/adolescents and 7.7% of adults consume 3 oz-eq/day of whole grains [(68)](#reference68). In view of the potential health benefits of increasing whole-grain intake, three daily servings of whole-grain foods should be seen as a minimum amount, and whole-grain foods should be substituted for refined carbohydrates whenever possible. Whole-grain foods may contain amaranth, whole-grain barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat (kasha), millet, oats, popcorn, quinoa, whole rye, triticale, whole wheat (wheat berries) with various wheat species (including common wheat, emmer, spelt, and khorasan) [(69)](#reference69). Unfortunately, it is not always clear from the label whether a product is made mostly from whole grains or refined grains. Some strategies to use when shopping for whole-grain foods include: Whole grains are a source of numerous biologically active components; some are listed in Table 2. |Macronutrients||Vitamins||Minerals||Phytochemicals| | | Originally written in 2003 by: Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in December 2005 by: Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in May 2009 by: Victoria J.

New York: Simon & Schuster; 2001.] Contents In the past, [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) were classified as simple or complex based on the number of simple sugars in the molecule. Carbohydrates composed of one or two simple sugars like [fructose](../glossary#fructose) or sucrose (table sugar; a disaccharide composed of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose) were labeled simple, while starchy foods were labeled complex because starch is composed of long chains of the simple sugar, [glucose](../glossary#glucose). Advice to eat less simple and more complex carbohydrates (i.e., polysaccharides) was based on the assumption that consuming starchy foods would lead to smaller increases in blood glucose than sugary foods [(1)](#references). This assumption turned out to be too simplistic since the blood glucose (glycemic) response to complex carbohydrates has been found to vary considerably. The concept of glycemic index (GI) has thus been developed in order to rank dietary carbohydrates based on their overall effect on [postprandial](../glossary#postprandial) blood glucose concentration relative to a referent carbohydrate, generally pure glucose [(2)](#reference2). The GI is meant to represent the relative quality of a carbohydrate-containing food. Foods containing carbohydrates that are easily digested, absorbed, and [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) have a high GI (GI70 on the glucose scale), while low-GI foods (GI55 on the glucose scale) have slowly digestible carbohydrates that elicit a reduced postprandial glucose response. Intermediate-GI foods have a GI between 56 and 69 [(3)](#reference3). The GI of selected carbohydrate-containing foods can be found in [Table 1](#table-1). To determine the [glycemic index](../glossary#glycemic-index) (GI) of a food, healthy volunteers are typically given a test food that provides 50 grams (g) of [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) and a control food (white, wheat bread or pure [glucose](../glossary#glucose)) that provides the same amount of carbohydrate, on different days [(4)](#reference4). Blood samples for the determination of glucose concentrations are taken prior to eating, and at regular intervals for a few hours after eating. The changes in blood glucose concentration over time are plotted as a curve. The GI is calculated as the incremental area under the glucose curve (iAUC) after the test food is eaten, divided by the corresponding iAUC after the control food (pure glucose) is eaten. The value is multiplied by 100 to represent a percentage of the control food [(5)](#reference5): GI = (iAUCtest food/iAUCglucose) x 100 For example, a boiled white potato has an average GI of 82 relative to glucose and 116 relative to white bread, which means that the blood glucose response to the carbohydrate in a baked potato is 82% of the blood glucose response to the same amount of carbohydrate in pure glucose and 116% of the blood glucose response to the same amount of carbohydrate in white bread. In contrast, cooked brown rice has an average GI of 50 relative to glucose and 69 relative to white bread. In the traditional system of classifying carbohydrates, both brown rice and potato would be classified as complex carbohydrates despite the difference in their effects on blood glucose concentrations. While the GI should preferably be expressed relative to glucose, other reference foods (e.g., white bread) can be used for practical reasons as long as their preparation has been standardized and they have been calibrated against glucose [(2)](#reference2). Additional recommendations have been suggested to improve the reliability of GI values for research, public health, and commercial application purposes [(2](#reference2), [6)](#reference6). By definition, the consumption of high-GI foods results in higher and more rapid increases in blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations than the consumption of low-GI foods. Rapid increases in blood glucose (resulting in [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia)) are potent signals to the -cells of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) to increase [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion [(7)](#reference7). Over the next few hours, the increase in blood insulin concentration (hyperinsulinemia) induced by the consumption of high-GI foods may cause a sharp decrease in the concentration of glucose in blood (resulting in [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia)). In contrast, the consumption of low-GI foods results in lower but more sustained increases in blood glucose and lower insulin demands on pancreatic -cells [(8)](#reference8). Many [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have [GI](../glossary#glycemic-index) and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease), relying on published GI values of individual foods and using the following formula to calculate meal (or diet) GI [(9)](#reference9): Meal GI = [(GI x amount of available [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate))Food A + (GI x amount of available carbohydrate)Food B +...]/ total amount of available carbohydrate Yet, the use of published GI values of individual foods to estimate the average GI value of a meal or diet may be inappropriate because factors such as food variety, ripeness, processing, and cooking are known to modify GI values. In a study by Dodd et al., the estimation of meal GIs using published GI values of individual foods was overestimated by 22 to 50% compared to direct measures of meal GIs [(9)](#reference9). Besides the GI of individual foods, various food factors are known to influence the [postprandial](../glossary#postprandial) [glucose](../glossary#glucose) and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) responses to a carbohydrate-containing mixed diet. A recent [cross-over](../glossary#cross-over-trial), [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) trial in 14 subjects with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) examined the acute effects of four types of breakfasts with high- or low-GI and high- or low- [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber) content on postprandial glucose concentrations. [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose was found to be significantly higher following consumption of a high-GI and low-fiber breakfast than following a low-GI and high-fiber breakfast. However, there was no significant difference in postprandial glycemic responses between high-GI and low-GI breakfasts of similar fiber content [(10)](#reference10). In this study, meal GI values (derived from published data) failed to correctly predict postprandial glucose response, which appeared to be essentially influenced by the fiber content of meals. Since the amounts and types of carbohydrate, fat, [protein](../glossary#protein), and other dietary factors in a mixed meal modify the glycemic impact of carbohydrate GI values, the GI of a mixed meal calculated using the above-mentioned formula is unlikely to accurately predict the postprandial glucose response to this meal [(3)](#reference3). Moreover, the GI is a property of a given food carbohydrate such that it does not take into account individuals' characteristics like ethnicity, metabolic status, or eating habits (e.g., the degree to which we masticate) which might, to a limited extent, also influence the glycemic response to a given carbohydrate-containing meal [(11-14)](#reference11). Using direct measures of meal GIs in future trials \u2014 rather than estimates derived from GI tables \u2014 would increase the accuracy and predictive value of the GI method [(2](#reference2), [6)](#reference6). In addition, in a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 28 studies examining the effect of low- versus high-GI diets on [serum](../glossary#serum) [lipids](../glossary#lipid), Goff et al. indicated that the mean GI of low-GI diets varied from 21 to 57 across studies, while the mean GI of high-GI diets ranged from 51 to 75 [(15)](#reference15). Therefore, a stricter use of GI cutoff values may also be warranted to provide more reliable information about carbohydrate-containing foods. The [glycemic index](../glossary#glycemic-index) (GI) compares the potential of foods containing the same amount of [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) to raise blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose). However, the amount of carbohydrate contained in a food serving also affects blood glucose concentrations and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) responses. For example, the mean GI of watermelon is 76, which is as high as the GI of a doughnut (see [Table 1](#table-1)). Yet, one serving of watermelon provides 11 g of available carbohydrate, while a medium doughnut provides 23 g of available carbohydrate. The concept of [glycemic load](../glossary#glycemic-load) (GL) was developed by scientists to simultaneously describe the quality (GI) and quantity of carbohydrate in a food serving, meal, or diet. The GL of a single food is calculated by multiplying the GI by the amount of carbohydrate in grams (g) provided by a food serving and then dividing the total by 100 [(4)](#reference4): GLFood = (GIFood x amount (g) of available carbohydrateFood per serving)/100 For a typical serving of a food, GL would be considered high with GL20, intermediate with GL of 11-19, and low with GL10. Using the above-mentioned example, despite similar GIs, one serving of watermelon has a GL of 8, while a medium-sized doughnut has a GL of 17. Dietary GL is the sum of the GLs for all foods consumed in the diet. It should be noted that while healthy food choices generally include low-GI foods, this is not always the case. For example, intermediate-to-high-GI foods like parsnip, watermelon, banana, and pineapple, have low-to-intermediate GLs (see [Table 1](#table-1)). The consumption of high-GI and -GL diets for several years might result in higher [postprandial](../glossary#postprandial) blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentration and excessive [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion. This might contribute to the loss of the insulin-secreting function of pancreatic -cells and lead to [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(16)](#reference16). A US [ecologic study](../glossary#ecologic-study) of national data from 1909 to 1997 found that the increased consumption of refined [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) in the form of corn syrup, coupled with the declining intake of dietary [fiber](../other-nutrients/fiber), has paralleled the increased [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of type 2 diabetes [(17)](#reference17). In addition, high-GI and -GL diets have been associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 diabetes in several large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study). A recent updated analysis of three large US cohorts indicated consumption of foods with the highest versus lowest GI was associated with a risk of developing type 2 diabetes that was increased by 44% in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I, 20% in the NHS II, and 30% in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). High-GL diets were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (+18%) only in the NHS I and in the pooled analysis of the three studies (+10%) [(18)](#reference18). Additionally, the consumption of high-GI foods that are low in cereal fiber was associated with a 59% increase in diabetes risk compared to low-GI and high-cereal-fiber foods. High-GL and low-cereal-fiber diets were associated with a 47% increase in risk compared to low-GL and high-cereal-fiber diets. Moreover, [obese](../glossary#obesity) participants who consumed foods with high-GI or -GL values had a risk of developing type 2 diabetes that was more than 10-fold greater than lean subjects consuming low-GI or -GL diets [(18)](#reference18). However, a number of prospective cohort studies have reported a lack of association between GI or GL and type 2 diabetes [(19-24)](#reference19). The use of GI food classification tables based predominantly on Australian and American food products might be a source of GI value misassignment and partly explain null associations reported in many prospective studies of European and Asian cohorts. Nevertheless, conclusions from several recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of prospective studies (including the above-mentioned studies) suggest that low-GI and -GL diets might have a modest but significant effect in the prevention of type 2 diabetes [(18](#reference18), [25, 26)](#reference25). Organizations like Diabetes UK [(27)](#reference27) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [(28)](#reference28) have included the use of diets of low GI/GL and high in dietary fiber and whole grains in their recommendations for diabetes prevention in high-risk individuals. The use of GI and GL is currently not implemented in US dietary guidelines [(29)](#reference29). Numerous observational studies have examined the relationship between dietary [GI](../glossary#glycemic-index)/ [GL](../glossary#glycemic-load) and the incidence of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, especially [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) and cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (229,213 participants; follow-up of 11.5 years) and 23% increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) with high versus low dietary GI and GL, respectively [(30)](#reference30). Three independent meta-analyses of prospective studies also reported that higher GI or GL was associated with increased risk of CHD in women but not in men [(31-33)](#reference31). A recent analysis of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study in 20,275 Greek participants, followed for a median of 10.4 years, showed a significant increase in CHD incidence and mortality with high dietary GL specifically in those with high [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index) (28 kg/m2) [(34)](#reference34). This is in line with earlier findings in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) showing that a high dietary GL was associated with a doubling of the risk of CHD over 10 years in women with higher (23 kg/m2) vs. lower BMI [(35)](#reference35). A similar finding was reported in a cohort of middle-aged Dutch women followed for nine years [(36)](#reference36). Additionally, high dietary GL (but not GI) was associated with a 19% increased risk of stroke in pooled analyses of prospective cohort studies [(32](#reference32), [37)](#reference37). A meta-analysis of seven prospective studies (242,132 participants; 3,255 stroke cases) found that dietary GL was associated with an overall 23% increase in risk of stroke and a specific 35% increase in risk of [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke); GL was not found to be related to [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) [(38)](#reference38). Overall, observational studies have found that higher glycemic load diets are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, especially in women and in those with higher BMIs. The GI/GL of carbohydrate foods may modify cardiometabolic markers associated with CVD risk. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 27 randomized controlled trials (published between 1991 and 2008) examining the effect of low-GI diets on [serum](../glossary#serum) [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile reported a significant reduction in total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) independent of weight loss [(15)](#reference15). Yet, further analysis suggested significant reductions in serum lipids only with the consumption of low-GI diets with high fiber content. In a three-month, randomized controlled study, an increase in the values of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, a surrogate marker of vascular health, was observed following the consumption of a low- versus high-GI hypocaloric diet in obese subjects [(39)](#reference39). High dietary GLs have been associated with increased concentrations of markers of systemic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), such as [C-reactive In a small 12-week dietary intervention study, the consumption of a Mediterranean-style, low-GL diet (without caloric restriction) significantly reduced waist circumference, [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure), as well as plasma LDL-cholesterol, and TNF- in women with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome). A reduction in the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), in blood cells further confirmed an effect for the low-GI diet on cholesterol [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) [(42)](#reference42). Well-controlled, long-term [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) are needed to confirm the potential cardiometabolic benefits of low GI/GL diets in people at risk for CVD. Evidence that high-GI or -GL diets are related to [cancer](../glossary#cancer) is inconsistent. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 32 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) and 20 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found modest and nonsignificant increased risks of [hormone](../glossary#hormone)-related cancers (breast, [prostate](../glossary#prostate), ovarian, and cancers) and digestive tract cancers ( [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus), [gastric](../glossary#gastric), [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and liver cancers) with high versus low dietary GI and GL [(43)](#reference43). A significant positive association was found only between a high dietary GI and [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) [(43)](#reference43). Yet, earlier meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies failed to find a link between high-GI or -GL diets and colorectal cancer [(44-46)](#reference44). Another recent meta-analysis of prospective studies suggested a borderline increase in breast cancer risk with high dietary GI and GL. Adjustment for [confounding factors](../glossary#confounder) across studies found no modification of menopausal status or [BMI](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) on the association [(47)](#reference47). Further investigations are needed to verify whether GI and GL are associated with various cancers. Results of two studies indicate [GI](../glossary#glycemic-index) and [GL](../glossary#glycemic-load) may be related to [gallbladder](../glossary#gallbladder) disease: a higher dietary GI and GL were associated with significantly increased [risks](../glossary#risk) of developing [gallstones](../glossary#gallstones) in a cohort of men participating in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [(48)](#reference48) and in a cohort of women participating in the Nurses' Health Study [(49)](#reference49). However, more [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) research is needed to determine an association between dietary glycemic index/load and gallbladder disease. Whether low-GI foods could improve overall blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) control in people with type 1 or type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) has been investigated in a number of [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 19 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that included 840 diabetic patients (191 with type 1 diabetes and 649 with type 2 diabetes) found that consumption of low-GI foods improved short-term and long-term control of blood glucose concentrations, reflected by significant decreases in fructosamine and glycated hemoglobin ( [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c)) levels [(50)](#reference50). However, these results need to be cautiously interpreted because of significant [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among the included studies. The American Diabetes Association has rated poorly the current evidence supporting the substitution of low-GL foods for high-GL foods to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [(51, 52)](#reference51). Well-controlled studies are needed to further assess whether the use of low-GI/GL diets could significantly improve long-term glycemic control and the quality of life of subjects with diabetes. A randomized controlled study in 92 pregnant women (20-32 weeks) diagnosed with [gestational](../glossary#gestation) diabetes found no significant effects of a low-GI diet on maternal metabolic profile (e.g., blood concentrations of glucose, [insulin](../glossary#insulin), fructosamine, HbA1c; [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance)) and pregnancy outcomes (i.e., maternal weight gain and neonatal anthropometric measures) compared to a conventional high-fiber, moderate-GI diet [(53)](#reference53). The low-GI diet consumed during the pregnancy also failed to improve maternal [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance), [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive), and other [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) risk factors, or and infant anthropometric data in a three-month postpartum follow-up study of 55 of the mother-infant pairs [(54)](#reference54). In addition, another trial in 139 pregnant women (12-20 weeks' gestation) at high risk for gestational diabetes showed no statistical differences regarding the diagnosis of gestational diabetes during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, the requirement for insulin therapy, and pregnancy outcomes and neonatal anthropometry whether women followed a low-GI diet or a high-fiber, moderate-GI diet [(55)](#reference55). At present, there is no evidence that a low-GI diet provides benefits beyond those of a healthy, moderate-GI diet in women at high risk or affected by gestational diabetes. [Obesity](../glossary#obesity) is often associated with metabolic disorders, such as [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia), [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia), and [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), which place individuals risk for type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease), and early energy-restricted, with >50% of calories from carbohydrates, 30% from fat, and the remainder from [protein](../glossary#protein). However, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled intervention studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (6 months' duration) has reported that or moderate-carbohydrate diets (4%-45% carbohydrate) and low-fat diets (10%-30% fat) were equally effective at reducing body weight and waist circumference in overweight or obese subjects [(58)](#reference58). Several dietary [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined how low-GI/GL diets compared with conventional low-fat diets to promote weight loss. Lowering the GI of conventional energy-restricted, low-fat diets was proven to be more effective to reduce postpartum body weight and waist and hip circumferences and prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with prior [gestational](../glossary#gestation) diabetes mellitus [(59)](#reference59). In a six-month dietary intervention study in 73 obese adults, no differences in weight loss were reported in subjects following either a low-GL diet (40% carbohydrate and 35% fat) or a low-fat diet (55% carbohydrate and 20% fat). Yet, the consumption of a low-GL diet increased [HDL](../glossary#HDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and decreased [triglyceride](../glossary#triglycerides) concentrations significantly more than the low-fat diet, but [LDL](../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentration was significantly more reduced with the low-fat than low-GI diet [(60)](#reference60). A one-year randomized controlled study of 202 individuals with a [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) 28 and at least another metabolic disorder compared the effect of two dietary counseling-based interventions advocating either for a low-GL diet (30%-35% of calories from low-GI carbohydrates) or a low-fat diet (<30% of calories from fat) [(61)](#reference61). Weight loss with each diet was equivalent (~4 kg). Both interventions similarly reduced triglycerides, [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP), and fasting [insulin](../glossary#insulin), and increased HDL-cholesterol. Yet, the reduction in waist and hip circumferences was greater with the low-fat diet, while blood pressure was significantly more reduced with the low-GL diet [(61)](#reference61). In the GLYNDIET study, a six-month randomized dietary intervention trial, the comparison of two moderate-carbohydrate diets (42% of calories from carbohydrates) with different GIs (GI of 34 or GI of 62) and a low-fat diet (30% of calories from fat; GI of 65) on weight loss indicated that the low-GI diet reduced body weight more effectively than the low-fat diet. Additionally, the low-GI diet improved fasting insulin concentration, -cell function, and insulin resistance better than the low-fat diet. None of the diets modulated hunger or satiety or affected [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of [endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function or [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation). Finally, no significant differences were observed in low- compared to high-GL diets regarding weight loss and insulin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(62)](#reference62). In a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) published between 2005 and 2011, neither high- nor low-GI/GL dietary interventions conducted for 6 to 17 months had any significant effect on body weight and waist circumference in a total of 2,344 overweight and obese subjects [(63)](#reference63). Low-GI/GL diets were found to significantly reduce [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) and fasting [insulin](../glossary#insulin) but had no effect on blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile, fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentration, or [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c) concentration compared to high-GI/GL diets. It has been suggested that the consumption of low-GI foods delayed the return of hunger, decreased subsequent food intake, and increased satiety when compared to high-GI foods [(64)](#reference64). The effect of isocaloric low- and high-GI test meals on the activity of brain regions controlling appetite and eating behavior was evaluated in a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), blinded, [cross-over study](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in 12 overweight or obese men [(65)](#reference65). During the [postprandial](../glossary#postprandial) period, blood glucose and insulin rose higher after the high-GI meal than after the low-GI meal. In addition, in response to the excess insulin secretion, blood glucose dropped below fasting concentrations three to five hours after high-GI meal consumption. [Cerebral](../glossary#cerebrum) blood flow was significantly higher four hours after ingestion of the high-GI meal (compared to a low-GI meal) in a specific region of the striatum (right nucleus accumbens) associated with food intake reward and craving. If the data suggested that consuming low- rather than high-GI foods may help restrain overeating and protect against weight gain, this has not yet been confirmed in long-term randomized controlled trials. In the recent multicenter, randomized controlled Diet, Obesity, and Genes (DiOGenes) study in 256 overweight and obese individuals who lost 8% of body weight following an eight-week calorie-restricted diet, consumption of ad libitum diets with different [protein](../glossary#protein) and GI content for 12 months showed that only high-protein diets \u2014 regardless of their GI \u2014 could mitigate weight regain [(66)](#reference66). However, the dietary interventions only achieved a modest difference in GI (~5 units) between high- and low-GI diets such that the effect of GI in weight maintenance remained unknown. Lifestyle modification programs do not currently include the reduction of calories from carbohydrate as an alternative to standard prescription of low-fat diets, nor do they suggest the use of GI/GL as a guide to healthier dietary choices [(67)](#reference67). Some strategies for lowering dietary [GL](../glossary#glycemic-load) include: Increasing of starchy, moderate- and high-GI foods like potatoes, white rice, and white bread Decreasing the consumption of sugary foods like cookies, cakes, candy, and soft drinks Table 1 includes GI and GL values of selected foods relative to pure [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [(68)](#reference68). Foods are ranked in descending order of their GI values, with high-GI foods (GI70) at the top and foods with low-GI values (55) at the bottom of the table.

Chlorogenic acids are a family of [esters](../glossary#ester) formed between quinic acid and [phenolic compounds](../glossary#phenolic-compound) known as cinnamic acids (mostly caffeic acid and ferulic acid) [(1)](#references). The most abundant chlorogenic acid in coffee is 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, an ester formed between quinic acid and caffeic acid (Figure 1). Coffee represents one of the richest dietary sources of chlorogenic acids. The chlorogenic acid content of a 200 mL (7-oz) cup of coffee has been reported to range from 70 to 350 mg, which would provide about 35 to 175 mg of caffeic acid. Although chlorogenic and caffeic acids have demonstrated [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activities [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(5)](#reference5), it is unclear how much antioxidant activity they contribute [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) because they are extensively [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism), and the [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) often have lower antioxidant activity than the parent compounds [(6, 7)](#reference6). Additionally, the antioxidant capacity of coffee is attenuated by the decaffeination process, which decreases total polyphenol content [(8)](#reference8). Other phenolic compounds in coffee, though less abundant than chlorogenic acids, include tannins, [lignans](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/lignans), and anthocyanine [(1)](#references). Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a purine alkaloid that occurs naturally in coffee beans (Figure 2). At intake levels associated with coffee consumption, caffeine appears to exert most of its biological effects through [antagonism](../glossary#antagonism) of the A1 and A2A subtypes of the [(1)](#references). Adenosine of [neurons](../glossary#neuron) to [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter). Adenosine has mostly inhibitory effects in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), so the effects of adenosine antagonism by caffeine are generally stimulatory. Caffeine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) and then distributed to all tissues, including the brain. Caffeine concentrations in coffee beverages can be quite variable. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine, but an analysis of 14 different specialty coffees purchased at coffee shops in the US found that the amount of caffeine in 8 oz (~240 mL) of brewed coffee ranged from 72 to 130 mg [(9)](#reference9). Caffeine in espresso coffees ranged from 58 to 76 mg in a single shot (~35 to 50 mL). In countries other than the US, coffee is often stronger, but the volume per cup is smaller, making 100 mg of caffeine/cup a reasonable estimate. Cafestol and kahweol are fat-soluble compounds known as diterpenes (Figure 3), which have been found to raise [serum](../glossary#serum) total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations in humans [(10)](#reference10). Some cafestol and kahweol are extracted from ground coffee during brewing, but are largely removed from coffee by paper filters. Scandinavian boiled coffee, Turkish coffee, and French press (cafetiere) coffee contain relatively high levels of cafestol and kahweol (6 to 12 mg/cup), while filtered coffee, percolated coffee, and instant coffee contain low levels of cafestol and kahweol (0.2 to 0.6 mg/cup) [(11)](#reference11). Although diterpene concentrations are relatively high in espresso coffee, the small serving size makes it an intermediate source of cafestol and kahweol (4 mg/cup). Since coffee beans are high in cafestol and kahweol, ingestion of coffee beans or grounds on a regular basis may also raise serum total and LDL-cholesterol. Trigonelline (N-methylnicotinic acid) is a plant alkaloid derived from [niacin](../vitamins/niacin) (vitamin B3) (Figure 4). Trigonelline is largely broken down to nicotinic acid during the roasting process, although some intact molecules remain in roasted beans. Trigonelline has been found to exert [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), [hypoglycemic](../glossary#hypoglycemia), and hypolipidemic activities (reviewed in [1](#references)). The three largest [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in the US to examine the relationship between caffeinated coffee consumption and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) were the Health Professionals Follow-up Study the Nurses' Health 84,276 women), and the NHS II (88,259 women). Men who drank at least six cups of coffee daily had a 54% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes than men who did not drink coffee. In the NHS I cohort, women who drank at least six cups of coffee daily had a 29% lower risk of type 2 diabetes than women who did not drink coffee [(12)](#reference12). In the NHS II cohort, women who consumed 4 cups of coffee daily had a 39% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes; similar results were found in women who drank 2 to 3 cups/day of coffee [(13)](#reference13). In a pooled analysis of all three cohorts, an increase in caffeinated coffee intake by >1 cup/day over a four-year period was associated with a 13% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in the subsequent four years; those who decreased their intake of caffeinated coffee by >1 cup/day had a 20% increased risk of type 2 diabetes over the four-year period [(14)](#reference14). Several other cohort studies have found higher coffee intakes to be associated with significant reductions in the risk of type 2 diabetes. A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 prospective cohort studies (published between 1966 and 2009), including more than 450,000 men and women, found that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes was 24% lower in those consuming 3 to 4 cups/day of coffee compared to those consuming 2 cups/day or none [(15)](#reference15). Two additional meta-analyses that included data from more recent prospective cohort studies were published concomitantly and found similar results [(16, 17)](#reference16). The data analysis of 28 prospective studies in over 1 million participants with 45,335 incident cases of diabetes reported a 30% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes with coffee intake of 5 cups/day versus 0 cups/day [(16)](#reference16). In addition, a 9% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes was estimated for every one cup per day increase in total coffee intake. Likewise, a dose-response analysis of 11 studies found a 6% reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence for every one cup per day increase in decaffeinated coffee intake. Every 140 mg/day (~1 cup/day of coffee) increment in caffeine intake was also associated with an 8% reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes [(16)](#reference16). Although decaffeinated coffee consumption is associated with a more modest decrease in the risk of type 2 diabetes, it is likely that compounds other than caffeine contribute to the reduction in diabetes risk. The mechanisms that might contribute to the association between coffee consumption and lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) in [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) are unclear. Bioactive compounds other than caffeine appear to show temporary [hypoglycemic](../glossary#hypoglycemia) effects. For example, the acute ingestion of chlorogenic acid (1 g) and trigonelline (0.5 g) transiently lowered blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentration shortly after the administration of 75 g of glucose in an oral [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance) test [(18)](#reference18). Conversely, short-term [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that acute administration of caffeine (3 to 6 mg/kg) impaired glucose tolerance and decreased [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) in healthy participants [(19)](#reference19). In addition, incremental doses of decaffeinated coffee (1, 2, and 4 servings) failed to lower [postprandial](../glossary#postprandial) blood glucose in the presence of 100 mg of caffeine [(20)](#reference20). However, despite the deleterious effect of caffeine on glucose [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis), caffeinated coffee consumption may favorably affect other metabolic pathways. In a single-blinded clinical trial, subjects at risk for type 2 diabetes abstained from drinking caffeinated coffee for one month, then consumed 4 cups/day of coffee for another month, and finally consumed 8 cups/day for a third month. Compared to one month of coffee abstinence, the consumption of 8 cups/day of coffee for one month appeared to increase [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity and reduce [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), as indicated by changes in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) markers of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and inflammation [(21)](#reference21). Until the relationship between long-term coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes risk is better understood, it is premature to recommend coffee consumption as a means of preventing type 2 diabetes [(12](#reference12), [22)](#reference22). Studies in animal models of [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) suggest that caffeine may protect dopaminergic [neurons](../glossary#neuron) by acting as an adenosine A2A- [receptor](../glossary#receptor) the brain [(23)](#reference23). Several large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined coffee and/or caffeine intakes in association with Parkinson's disease [risk](../glossary#risk). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine prospective cohort studies found higher caffeine intake to be associated with significant reductions in Parkinson's disease risk in both men (-39%) and women (-29%) [(24)](#reference24). In another meta-analysis of six [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) and seven prospective studies, including 901,764 participants and 3,954 cases, an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between coffee intake and Parkinson's disease risk \u2014 only significant in men \u2014 was found to be nonlinear, with no further risk reduction beyond 3 to 4 cups/day of coffee. This meta-analysis also reported significant reductions in Parkinson's disease risk in men (-43%) and women (-36%) with the highest (700 mg/day) versus lowest (100 mg/day) intake of caffeine [(25)](#reference25). However, while prospective studies have consistently found a lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease with higher coffee and caffeine intakes in men, such an association has not always been observed in women [(26-28)](#reference26). It is hypothesized that [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) replacement therapy may modify the interaction between caffeine and risk of Parkinson's disease in postmenopausal women. Indeed, because estrogen and caffeine are metabolized by hepatic [cytochrome P450](../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) 1A2 in the body, estrogen might compete for CYP1A2 activity and hinder the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of caffeine in estrogen users [(29)](#reference29). An analysis of data from more than 77,000 female nurses, followed for 18 years in NHS I, revealed that coffee consumption was inversely associated with Parkinson's disease risk in women who had never used postmenopausal estrogen [(30)](#reference30). However, drinking 6 cups of coffee was associated with an increased risk or Parkinson's disease in women who had used postmenopausal estrogen [(30)](#reference30). In a prospective cohort study that included more than 238,000 women, a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and Parkinson's disease mortality was also observed in women who had never used postmenopausal estrogen, but not in those who had used postmenopausal estrogen [(31)](#reference31). Yet, in a recent analysis of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study, which included 303,880 participants and 1,100 cases, the highest versus lowest intake of caffeine was associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson's disease in postmenopausal women who ever used hormones but not among never users [(24)](#reference24). At present, it remains unclear whether caffeine consumption can prevent Parkinson's disease, particularly in women taking estrogen. Of note, whether caffeine could help reduce some common symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (e.g., sleepiness, freezing of gait) is under investigation [(32, 33)](#reference32). Results from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) regarding a possible link between coffee consumption and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) disorders are inconclusive. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 34,282 older adults reported an 18% reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of cognitive disorders with 1 to 2 cups/day of coffee compared to <1 cup/day [(34)](#reference34). Yet, there was no difference in risk of cognitive disorders between daily coffee intakes >3 cups and <1 cup [(34)](#reference34). Two other meta-analyses of prospective studies failed to find an association between high versus low intakes of coffee and risk of cognitive disorders [(35, 36)](#reference35). No dose-response relationship was reported between coffee intake and risk of cognitive disorders [(36)](#reference36). Whether moderate coffee intake may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and [dementia](../glossary#dementia) later in life is still not known. Chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation)-inducing liver injury may result in [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis). In cirrhosis, the formation of fibrotic scar tissue leads to the progressive deterioration of liver function and other complications, including liver [cancer](../glossary#cancer) (primarily hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) [(37)](#reference37). The most common causes of cirrhosis in developed countries are alcohol abuse and chronic infections with [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis) B and C [viruses](../glossary#virus). Often associated with metabolic disorders, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver condition that can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in about one-third of NAFLD patients, thereby increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of cirrhosis and HCC [(38)](#reference38). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 177 subjects with chronic liver disease (especially chronic hepatitis B or C and NASH) found an association between daily caffeine intake >308 mg \u2014 equivalent to >2 cups/day of coffee \u2014 and a lower risk of having advanced liver fibrosis [(39)](#reference39). Of note, no association was reported with non-coffee sources of caffeine like caffeinated soda or green and black tea [(39)](#reference39). Recent cross-sectional studies also suggested a protective association of coffee intake against fibrosis development in patients with hepatitis C [(40, 41)](#reference40). Additional studies have suggested that consumption of coffee, but not of caffeine, was [inversely associated ](../glossary#inverse-association)with the risk of advanced liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD or NASH [(42-44)](#reference42). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) and three [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) reported an inverse association between coffee consumption and risk of cirrhosis [(45)](#reference45). In addition, a few large prospective cohort studies found that coffee drinking was associated with reduced mortality from alcoholic cirrhosis [(46-49)](#reference46). A 17-year study of more than 51,000 men and women in Norway found that those who consumed 2 cups/day of coffee had a risk of cirrhosis-related death that was 40% lower than those who never consumed coffee [(49)](#reference49). A 22-year prospective cohort study in 125,580 US adults found that coffee drinking was protective against alcoholic cirrhosis but not nonalcoholic cirrhosis [(48)](#reference48). Specifically, the risk of developing alcoholic cirrhosis was 40% lower in those who drank 1 to 3 cups/day of coffee and 80% lower in those who drank 4 cups/day [(48)](#reference48). Recent data from 63,275 Chinese participants of the Singapore Chinese Health Study showed that consumption of 2 cups/day of coffee was associated with a 66% lower risk of death from non-viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis \u2014 no such association was found with mortality from cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis [(46)](#reference46). Several case-control and prospective cohort studies have found significant inverse associations between coffee consumption and the risk of HCC (reviewed in [50](#reference50)). In a recent 18-year prospective cohort study of 162,022 US adults \u2014 comprising Japanese Americans, Caucasians, Mexican Americans, African Americans, and Native Hawaiians \u2014 consumption of coffee, but not decaffeinated coffee, was inversely associated with risk of developing HCC [(51)](#reference51). Specifically, drinking 2 to 3 cups/day of coffee was associated with a 38% reduced risk of HCC compared to no coffee drinking [(51)](#reference51). In addition, the risk of chronic liver disease-related mortality was 71% lower in individuals consuming 4 cups/day of regular coffee and 46% lower in those consuming 2 cups/day of decaffeinated coffee compared to non-consumers [(51)](#reference51). A pooled analysis of this study with 10 other prospective cohort studies found an overall 46% lower risk of liver cancer with coffee consumption (see also [Cancer](#cancer-prevention)) [(52)](#reference52). Numerous [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined the relationship between coffee consumption and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) [(53, 54)](#reference53). Results from recently published [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies are reported in Table 1. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) by Wang et al. [(54)](#reference54) investigated the relationships between the highest versus lowest categories of coffee intake and the risk of most cancer types. Coffee consumption was found to be associated with reduced risks of oral/pharyngeal cancer (6 studies; -31%), [colon](../glossary#colon) -11%) [(54)](#reference54). Overall, these results are in agreement with those from other pooled analyses of prospective studies presented in Table 1. However, unlike the results reported by Wang et al. [(54)](#reference54), coffee consumption has been [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of colon cancer in [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), but not in prospective cohort studies (see Table 1). Also, in the case of prostate cancer, several meta-analyses suggested a reduced risk with increased coffee intake in prospective but not case-control studies [(54-56)](#reference54). However, whether this association exists only in certain study populations or at specific cancer stages remains unclear [(57, 58)](#reference57). There seems to be little evidence of associations between coffee consumption and breast cancer, [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) cancer, glioma, laryngeal cancer, [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cancer, [rectal](../glossary#rectum) cancer, stomach and [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) cancer (Table 1) [(54)](#reference54). |Type of Cancer||Type of Observational Risk Ratio [OR]# (95% Confidence Interval)||Relative Risk [RR] or Odds Ratio [OR] Subgroup Analyses (e.g., by study types)||References| |Breast cancer||10 and RR: 1.01 (0.93-1.09) | Li et al. 0.94 (0.89-1.00) for case-control (0.53-0.89) among BRCA1 mutation carriers Finally, there is some evidence suggesting a potential increase in the risk of lung cancer with the highest versus lowest levels of coffee intakes. Yet, cigarette smoking has a major [confounding](../glossary#confounder) effect on this association (see [Health risks associated with coffee consumption](#potential-health-risks)) [(54](#reference54), [70)](#reference70). Three large [prospective women), NHS II (93,054 women), and HPFS (40,557 men), examined whether coffee drinking was associated with all-cause, [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease)-related, or [cancer](../glossary#cancer)-related mortality [(80)](#reference80). Compared to no coffee consumption, the consumption of coffee, whether caffeinated or decaffeinated, up to 5 cups/day, was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with all-cause mortality. There was no difference in [risk](../glossary#risk) of death between non-consumers and consumers of >5 cups/day of coffee. Coffee consumption was also found to be inversely associated with mortality related to cardiovascular disease, [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) disease, and suicide [(80)](#reference80). Other large cohort studies have reported habitual consumption of any coffee being inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related mortality, but generally not with cancer-related mortality [(81-86)](#reference81). Moreover, the associations have not always been consistent among women and men, especially regarding cancer-related mortality [(85, 86)](#reference85). A dose-response [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 21 prospective studies found a nonlinear inverse association between coffee consumption and all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related mortality [(87)](#reference87). Consumption of only 1 cup/day of coffee was significantly associated with lower risk of all-cause (-8%) and cardiovascular disease-related mortality (-11%). The largest risk reductions for all-cause (-16%) and cardiovascular disease-related mortality (-21%) were found to be associated with the consumption of 4 cups/day and 3 cups/day of coffee, respectively [(87)](#reference87). Most adverse effects attributed to coffee consumption are related to caffeine. In healthy adults, daily caffeine consumption 400 mg \u2014 corresponding to 6.5 mg/kg body weight/day for a 70-kg person \u2014 is usually not associated with adverse effects [(88)](#reference88). Caffeine intakes of less than 300 mg/day in women of childbearing age (equivalent to 4.3 mg/kg body weight/day for a 70-kg woman) and less than 2.5 mg/kg body weight/day in children are unlikely to cause adverse effects [(88)](#reference88). Adverse reactions to caffeine may include tachycardia (rapid heart rate), palpitations, insomnia, restlessness, nervousness, tremor, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and diuresis (increased urination) [(89)](#reference89). Very high caffeine intakes, not usually coffee, may induce hypokalemia (abnormally low [serum](../glossary#serum) [potassium](../minerals/potassium)) [(90)](#reference90). Sudden cessation of caffeine consumption after long-term use may result in caffeine withdrawal symptoms [(91)](#reference91). Gradual withdrawal from caffeine appears less likely to result in withdrawal symptoms than abrupt withdrawal [(92)](#reference92). Commonly reported caffeine withdrawal symptoms include headache, fatigue, drowsiness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and depressed mood. [Serum lipids: An early ] [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that the consumption of unfiltered, boiled coffee dose-dependently increased [serum](../glossary#serum) total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, while the consumption of filtered coffee resulted in very little change [(93)](#reference93). A more recent meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials reported that the consumption of coffee increased serum total cholesterol by 8.1 mg/dL, LDL-cholesterol by 5.1 mg/dL, and [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) by 12.6 mg/dL [(94)](#reference94). The consumption of filtered coffee raised total cholesterol by only 3.6 mg/dL compared to an increase of 12.9 mg/dL with unfiltered coffee consumption. Unlike filtered coffee, consumption of unfiltered coffee significantly increased LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides by 11.9 mg/dL and 18.8 mg/dL, respectively [(94)](#reference94). The cholesterol-raising factors in unfiltered coffee have been identified as cafestol and kahweol, two diterpenes that are largely removed from coffee by paper filters (see [Diterpenes](#diterpenes)) [(10)](#reference10). [Homocysteine: An elevated ] [plasma](../glossary#plasma) total [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentration has been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease), including coronary heart disease, [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), and [peripheral vascular disease](../glossary#peripheral-arterial-disease), but the relationship may not be causal [(95)](#reference95). Higher coffee intakes have been associated with increased plasma homocysteine concentrations in [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) conducted in Europe, Scandinavia, and the US [(96-100)](#reference96). Controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have confirmed the homocysteine-raising effect of coffee at intakes of about 4 cups/day [(101-103)](#reference101). [Hypertension: of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) showed that high intakes of coffee (3 to 5 cups/day) for <85 days significantly increased [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure)/ Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) [(104)](#reference104) or 2.4/1.2 mm Hg [(105)](#reference105). Although the increases in blood pressure seem modest by individual standards, it has been estimated that an average systolic blood pressure reduction of 2 mm Hg in a population may result in 10% lower mortality from [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) and 7% lower mortality from [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) [(106)](#reference106). However, a more recent pooled analysis excluding the trials that used decaffeinated coffee in control groups \u2014 and thus assessed the effect of caffeine rather than that of coffee \u2014 found no significant changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure with high coffee intakes [(107)](#reference107). Additionally, two meta-analyses combined the data from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that examined prospectively the association between habitual coffee consumption and risk of hypertension [(107, 108)](#reference107). One meta-analysis of six [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) included 172,567 non-hypertensive participants (one study enrolled pre-hypertensive subjects) of which 37,135 cases of incident hypertension were reported over follow-up periods spanning from 6.4 years to 33 years [(108)](#reference108). Compared to coffee intakes of <1 cup/day, intakes of 1 to 3 cups/day were found to be associated with a 9% increased risk of hypertension. However, no such association could be observed for coffee intakes >3 cups/day [(108)](#reference108). Another meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies found no association between coffee consumption and risk of hypertension [(107)](#reference107). Also, a recent analysis of data from 29,985 postmenopausal women followed for nearly four years in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study found no increased risk of hypertension with intakes of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or caffeine [(109)](#reference109). While there is little evidence of an association between long-term coffee consumption and risk of hypertension, the available evidence from trials suggests that consumption of caffeine modestly raises systolic blood pressure. Whether this may result in increased risk of stroke and coronary heart disease in the population, particularly in those with hypertension, is still uncertain. Yet, to date, regular coffee consumption in hypertensive subjects has not been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [(110)](#reference110). [Coronary heart disease: A ] [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 20 including 407,806 participants and 15,599 incident [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) cases, found no significant association between coffee consumption and CHD risk [(111)](#reference111). Yet, a more recent meta-analysis of 22 prospective cohort studies reported a modest reduction in CHD risk with moderate (3-5 cups/day) \u2014 but not high (6 cups/day) \u2014 coffee intakes compared to low intakes (<1 cup/day) [(112)](#reference112). In addition, [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have provided little evidence that the formation of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaques, an early event in the development of CHD, is more prevalent in regular coffee drinkers than in non-drinkers [(113-116)](#reference113). Coffee consumption has not been linked to the development of atherosclerosis in two prospective cohort studies. In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study that followed approximately 4,000 young US adults for 15 to 20 years, there was no evidence of an association between regular coffee intake and progression of [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) [calcification](../glossary#calcification), a measure of [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) atherosclerosis [(117)](#reference117). Moreover, in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) that followed about 6,500 US adults over a median period of 11.1 years, occasional but not regular drinking of coffee was associated with a 28% increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with no drinking [(114)](#reference114). This study found no association between coffee intake and progression of coronary artery calcification [(114)](#reference114). [Cardiac arrhythmias: Early ] [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) found coffee or caffeine intake equivalent to 5 to 6 cups/day did not increas the frequency or severity of cardiac [arrhythmias](../health-disease/arrhythmia) in healthy people or in people with [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) [(118, 119)](#reference118). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 214,316 participants found no association between coffee consumption and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation), the most common type of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of 11 short-term [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) (single dose to two-week trials) found that caffeine consumption did not increase the occurrence of [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) arrhythmias [(120)](#reference120). Finally, two meta-analyses of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found no evidence to suggest that caffeine consumption was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and even reported a modest reduction in risk with moderate intakes [(121, 122)](#reference121). Thus, consumption of coffee or caffeine at usual intakes does not appear to increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The current evidence does not support clinical recommendations that discourage moderate consumption of coffee in patients at risk or with suspicions of cardiac arrhythmia [(120, 123)](#reference120). [Stroke: A 2011 ] [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that included eight [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) \u2014 all following participants who were free of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) at baseline \u2014 found that consumption of 3 to 4 cups/day of coffee was associated with an 18% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of [stroke](../glossary#stroke) compared with no consumption and that higher intakes were not associated with an increased risk [(124)](#reference124). Since this meta-analysis, a few large prospective studies have reported mixed results on the association between coffee consumption and stroke incidence or stroke-related mortality. Results from 42,659 participants in the German cohort of the European Prospective Investigation in Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Germany) reported no association between coffee consumption and stroke incidence over an 8.9 year-period [(125)](#reference125). Compared to no intake, consumption of 3-6 cups/week of coffee was associated with a reduced risk of stroke in a prospective study of 82,369 Japanese participants [(126)](#reference126). Also, the consumption of 4 to 5 cups/day of coffee was associated with a reduced risk of stroke-related mortality among men, but not women, followed in the large prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study [(81)](#reference81). Several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined the relationship between coffee intake and lung [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) in humans. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 [case-control](../glossary#case-control-study) and 5 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including a total of 12,276 cases and 102,516 controls, found an overall 31% increased risk of lung cancer with the highest versus lowest levels of coffee intake (see [Table 1](#table-1)). Subgroup analyses outlined a significant increase in lung cancer risk with coffee intake in hospital-based case-control (+36%) and prospective cohort studies (+59%), in studies conducted in American (+34%) and Asian (+49%) populations, in men (+41%), and in smokers (+24%); conversely, no significant association between coffee intake and lung cancer risk was found in community-based case-control studies, in studies conducted in European populations, in women, and in non-smokers [(70)](#reference70). Another meta-analysis of 13 case-control and 8 prospective cohort studies, including 19,892 cases and 623,645 controls, found a 9% increased risk of lung cancer in coffee drinkers compared to non-drinkers [(127)](#reference127). However, a pooled analysis restricted to the 16 (out of 21) studies that adjusted for smoking found no significant association between coffee intake and risk of lung cancer [ [RR](../glossary#relative-risk): 1.03 (0.95-1.12)]. Cigarette smoking is a major [confounding](../glossary#confounder) factor in the association between coffee consumption and lung cancer risk, and the evidence suggests that coffee intake is unlikely to be a risk factor for lung cancer. Of note, [residual confounding](../glossary#residual-confounding) by smoking remains a concern when a slight increase in lung cancer risk is still observed in studies even after adjustment for tobacco smoking [(127)](#reference127). It has been suggested that in utero exposure to caffeine through maternal coffee consumption might have adverse effects on the embryo/fetus during pregnancy and the offspring. Miscarriage: The results of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that have examined the relationship between maternal coffee or caffeine intake and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) have been conflicting. While some [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have observed significant associations between high caffeine intakes, particularly from coffee, and the risk of spontaneous abortion [(128-132)](#reference128), other studies have not [(133-136)](#reference133). The most recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 prospective cohort studies in 130,456 pregnant women and 3,429 cases of miscarriage found risk of miscarriage increased by 40% and 72% with maternal caffeine intakes of 350 to 699 mg/day and 700 mg/day during pregnancy, respectively [(137)](#reference137). No significant associations were found for daily doses of caffeine less than 350 mg. A dose-response analysis found a 7% increase in the risk of miscarriage per 100 mg/day-increment in caffeine intake during pregnancy [(137)](#reference137). Of note, one prospective cohort study that assessed caffeine intake by measuring [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of paraxanthine, a caffeine [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite), found that the risk of spontaneous abortion was only elevated in women with paraxanthine concentrations that suggested caffeine intakes of 600 mg/day [(138)](#reference138). It has been proposed that an association between caffeine consumption and the risk of spontaneous abortion could be explained by the relationship between nausea and fetal viability [(139)](#reference139). Nausea is more common in women with viable pregnancies than nonviable pregnancies, such that women with viable pregnancies may be more likely avoid or limit caffeine consumption due to nausea [(140)](#reference140). However, at least one study found that the significant increase in risk of spontaneous abortion observed in women with caffeine intakes >300 mg/day was independent of nausea in pregnancy [(141)](#reference141). Additionally, two other studies found that caffeine consumption was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in women who experienced nausea or aversion to coffee during pregnancy [(131](#reference131), [142)](#reference142). Nonetheless, this does not exclude the possibility of reverse causality, when the loss of fetal viability results in reduction of pregnancy symptoms, like nausea and aversion to coffee, and may be followed by an increase in coffee intake [(137)](#reference137). Of note, consumption of <400 mg/day of caffeine or <4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee by women prior to pregnancy has not been linked to the risk of miscarriage in an analysis of a large prospective study (NHS I) that followed 11,072 women and a total of 15,590 pregnancies [(143)](#reference143). Although the topic remains unsettled, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women limit their daily caffeine intake to <200 mg during pregnancy [(144)](#reference144). Intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight: [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) examining the effects of maternal caffeine and coffee consumption on fetal growth have assessed intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR; also known as small-for-gestational age; defined as fetal weight <10th percentile for gestational age), and/or incidence of low birth weight (defined as weight at birth <2,500 g [5.5 pounds]). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) reported a 38% increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of low birth weight with the highest versus lowest intakes of caffeine during pregnancy [(145)](#reference145). This risk appeared to increase linearly with incremental doses of caffeine [(145, 146)](#reference145). A dose-response meta-analysis of six prospective cohort and five case-control studies found a 7% increased risk of low-birth-weight infants per 100 mg of caffeine consumed daily during pregnancy [(146)](#reference146). Likewise, a 100 mg-increment in maternal caffeine intakes has been associated with a 10% increased risk of small-for-gestational age infants in the dose-response analysis of 10 prospective cohort and 5 case-control studies [(146)](#reference146). At present, only one study has examined the impact of limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy on birth weight. In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) that [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) 1,197 regular coffee drinkers (3 cups/day of coffee) to drink decaffeinated (median caffeine intake of 117 mg/day) or caffeinated coffee (median caffeine intake of 317 mg/day) throughout the second half of their pregnancy, no differences in length of [gestation](../glossary#gestation) or infant birth weight were found between the two groups [(147)](#reference147). Although the relationship between maternal caffeine consumption and fetal growth requires further clarification, it appears that even moderate caffeine intakes might adversely affect fetal growth in non-smoking women [(145, 146, 148)](#reference145). Limiting caffeine intake to 100 mg/day (1 cup/day of coffee) during pregnancy may be recommended to avoid any adverse effect, assuming that the associations of caffeine intake with the risk of IUGR and low birth weight are causal [(145, 146)](#reference145). Birth defects: Potential relationships between coffee consumption during pregnancy and [congenital birth defects](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) have been investigated in the US population-based National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), an ongoing multi-site [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study). In an analysis that included mothers of 1,531 infants with cleft lips (with or without cleft palates), 813 infants with cleft palates only, and 5,711 control infants, no association was found between the highest versus lowest intakes of coffee and caffeine and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of orofacial clefts [(149)](#reference149). Another analysis, including mothers of 3,346 cases and 6,642 control infants, suggested an increased risk of [anotia](../glossary#anotia)/ [microtia](../glossary#microtia) and [craniosynostosis](../glossary#craniosynostosis) with the consumption of coffee or caffeine. However, no dose-response could be detected [(150)](#reference150). Further, an analysis of the NBDPS in mothers of 844 infants with limb deficiencies and 8,069 control infants found no increased risk associated with coffee and/or caffeine intake during pregnancy [(151)](#reference151). There was no association between maternal coffee or caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of congenital talipes equinovarus (known as \"clubfoot\") in another US population-based case-control study of mothers of 646 infants with isolated clubfoot and 2,037 control infants [(152)](#reference152). Finally, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that combined data from one [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and six case-control studies found no association between maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and risk of [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) [(153)](#reference153). At present, there is no convincing evidence that maternal consumption of 3 cups/day of coffee or 300 mg/day of caffeine during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations in humans. Childhood acute leukemia: The [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of acute lymphoblastic [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia) (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), which primarily affect children, is unclear. It has been suggested that exposure to caffeine during pregnancy might have long-lasting adverse effects on the health of the offspring. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) that examined maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy in relation to the incidence of childhood acute leukemia found coffee consumption was associated with increased risks of overall acute leukemia (+72%), ALL (+65%), and AML (+58%) [(154)](#reference154). Another meta-analysis of eight case-control studies found an increased risk of ALL (+43%), but not AML, with the highest versus lowest intakes of coffee during pregnancy [(155)](#reference155). High versus low consumption of other sources of caffeine during pregnancy (tea, cola beverages) and childhood (cola beverages) were not found to be associated with childhood acute leukemia [(155)](#reference155). The evidence of a positive association between maternal coffee intake and childhood acute leukemia is currently limited to case-control studies. Case-control studies usually include more [cancer](../glossary#cancer) cases than prospective cohort studies, but they are subject to [recall bias](../glossary#recall-bias) with respect to coffee consumption and selection [bias](../glossary#bias) with respect to the control group [(156)](#reference156). Further studies with a prospective design are needed to confirm the possible link between coffee intake during pregnancy and childhood acute leukemia. The American Academy of Pediatrics categorizes caffeine as a maternal medication that is usually compatible with breast-feeding [(157)](#reference157). Although high maternal caffeine intakes have been reported to cause irritability and poor sleeping patterns in infants, no adverse effects have been reported with moderate maternal intake of caffeinated beverages equivalent to 2 to 3 cups of coffee daily. [Osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) is a multifactorial bone disorder that compromises bone mass and strength and increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture). The results of early controlled studies in humans indicated that coffee and caffeine consumption decreased the efficiency of calcium absorption resulting in a loss of about 4 to 6 mg of calcium per cup of coffee [(158, 159)](#reference158). However, there is little evidence to suggest detrimental effects of coffee on bone health in populations with adequate calcium intakes [(160)](#reference160). To date, results from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that examined associations between coffee intakes and measures of [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) loss \u2014 generally used to diagnose osteoporosis \u2014 have been mixed [(161-164)](#reference161). Further, two [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies reported no significant associations between coffee intake and risk of hip fracture [(165, 166)](#reference165). A third meta-analysis of six case-control and nine prospective cohort studies found no overall association between coffee intake and total fracture [(167)](#reference167). Yet, a gender subgroup analysis of eight studies showed a 14% increased risk of fracture in women \u2014 but not in men \u2014 with the highest versus lowest intakes of coffee. Another subgroup analysis of six studies found a 35% increased risk of osteoporotic fracture in participants with the highest versus lowest intakes of coffee [(167)](#reference167). Current evidence is scarce to suggest that coffee consumption could increase the risk of bone loss and fracture. Limiting coffee consumption to 3 cups/day while ensuring adequate [calcium](../minerals/calcium) and [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) intakes should prevent any potential adverse effects on calcium absorption and bone health. [Phenolic compounds](../glossary#phenolic-compound) in coffee can bind [nonheme iron](../minerals/iron#non-heme-iron) and inhibit its [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) absorption [(168)](#reference168). Drinking 150 to 250 mL of coffee with a test meal has been found to inhibit iron absorption by 24%-73% [(169, 170)](#reference169). To maximize iron absorption from a meal or supplements, people with poor iron status should not consume coffee at the same time. Habitual caffeine consumption increases hepatic [cytochrome P450](../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) 1A2 activity, which has implications for the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) for a number of medications [(171)](#reference171). Conversely, drugs that inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 interfere with the metabolism and elimination of caffeine, thereby increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of adverse effects [(172)](#reference172). The following medications may impair the [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of caffeine, delaying its [excretion](../glossary#excretion) and potentially ephedrine and caffeine can lead to life-threatening adverse effects, including heart attack, [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), [seizures](../glossary#seizure), and death [(173)](#reference173). Use of the drug phenytoin (Dilantin) or cigarette smoking increases the hepatic metabolism of caffeine, resulting in increased elimination and decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) caffeine concentrations [(89)](#reference89). Caffeine and other methylxanthines may enhance the effects and side effects of -adrenergic stimulating agents, such as epinephrine and albuterol [(89](#reference89), [171)](#reference171). Caffeine doses of 400 to 1,000 mg may inhibit the [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of the antipsychotic medication, clozapine clozapine concentration and increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of toxicity. Those taking levothyroxine are advised to avoid drinking coffee at the same time they take their medication because coffee may reduce the absorption of levothyroxine in some patients. Caffeine consumption can decrease the elimination of theophylline, potentially increasing serum theophylline levels. Caffeine has been also found to decrease the systemic elimination of acetaminophen (i.e., paracetamol) and to increase the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of aspirin, which may partially explain its efficacy in enhancing their analgesic effects. This is important because many pain-relievers on the market today combine caffeine with aspirin and/or acetaminophen. Further, caffeine may decrease the bioavailability of lithium and alendronate (Fosamax) by enhancing their elimination [(173)](#reference173).

In 2014, Americans consumed 3.6 billion gallons of tea, of which 84% was black tea, 15% was green tea, and the remaining was white, oolong, and dark tea [(2)](#reference2). Herbal teas are infusions of herbs or plants other than Camellia sinensis and will not be discussed in this article. Although tea contains a number of bioactive chemicals, including caffeine and [fluoride](../minerals/fluoride), most research has focused on the potential health benefits of a class of compounds in tea known as [flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids). In many cultures, tea is an important source of dietary flavonoids. All teas are derived from the leaves of the tea plant Camellia sinensis, but different processing methods produce different types of tea. Fresh tea leaves are rich in polyphenolic compounds known as flavonoids (see the article on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids)). contain a polyphenol oxidase (PPO) [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) in separate compartments from flavan-3-ol [monomers](../glossary#monomer) or catechins (Figure 2) [(3)](#reference3). When tea leaves are intentionally broken or rolled during processing, cell compartmentalization is disrupted and PPO comes into contact with catechins. This causes catechins to condense (join together) forming [dimers](../glossary#dimer) and [polymers](../glossary#polymer) known as theaflavins (Figure 3) and thearubigins, respectively [(4)](#reference4). This [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) process is often described as \"fermentation\" in the tea industry. Steaming, firing, or baking tea leaves inactivates PPO and stops the oxidation process [(5)](#reference5). The two prominent varieties of Camellia sinensis used in tea cultivation are Camellia sinensis var. sinensis and Camellia sinensis var. assamica. The former is native of China and usually used to make white and green tea. The latter originates from the Assam region of India, as well as regions of Southeast Asia, and is often used to make black teas, including pu-erh tea in the Yunnan province of China. Although there are thousands of tea cultivars derived from the principal Camellia sinensis tea varieties, teas are usually divided into five types based on the extent of oxidation they undergo during processing. The withering method (the process of allowing the fresh leaves to dry) and the process of deactivating PPO may also differ among tea preparations [(1)](#references). White tea is made from unopened buds and immature leaves, which are steamed or fired to inactivate polyphenol oxidase, and then dried. Thus, due to minimal oxidation, white tea retains the high concentrations of catechins present in fresh tea leaves (see [Flavonoids](#flavonoids) below). Green tea is made from more mature tea leaves than white tea, and tea leaves may be withered prior to steaming or firing, and then rolled and dried. Like white teas, green teas are high in catechins, but the total content and composition of catechins may vary depending on the cultivar and the commercial source [(6)](#reference6). Of note, green teas and white teas may sometimes contain similar amounts of catechins but still exhibit different [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacities; this is due to the presence of other non-catechin antioxidants in teas [(6)](#reference6). Tea leaves destined to become oolong teas are \"bruised\" to allow the release of some of the polyphenol oxidase present in the leaves. Oolong teas are allowed to [oxidize](../glossary#oxidation) to a greater extent than for white or green teas, but for less time than black teas, before they are heated and dried. Consequently, the catechin, theaflavin, and thearubigin levels in oolong teas are generally between those of unfermented green and white teas and completely oxidized black teas [(1)](#references). Tea leaves destined to become black tea are fully rolled or broken to maximize the interaction between catechins and polyphenol oxidase. Because they are allowed to [oxidize](../glossary#oxidation) completely before drying, most black teas are relatively low in [monomeric](../glossary#monomer) flavan-3-ols, like (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), [Table 1](#table-1) shown greater [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activities than EGCG [(7)](#reference7). Most pu-erh tea is produced in the Yunnan province of China from the larger leaves of the assamica variety of Camellia sinensis. The making process may include both [enzymatic](../glossary#enzyme) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) and fungus-led [fermentation](../glossary#fermentation). In the case of \"raw (aged) pu-erh tea,\" the initial preparation resembles that used to make green tea. The leaves are heated, dried, and then dampened before being pan-fired and compressed; the preparation is then carefully stored in a controlled environment and left to age for decades. A faster aging process, combining oxidation and fermentation by the fungus Aspergillus niger for several months, can also be used to produce \"ripened pu-erh tea.\" The definition of a cup of tea varies in different countries or regions. In Japan, a typical cup of green tea may contain only 100 mL (3.5 ounces). A traditional European teacup holds approximately 125 to 150 mL (5 ounces), while a mug of tea may contain about 240 mL (8 ounces). Tea contains over 2,000 components, including polyphenols [elements](../glossary#element) [(8)](#reference8). Only some of them are described below. Dietary flavonoids are divided in six subclasses: flavan-3-ols, anthocyanidins, on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids)). Total flavonoid content in green tea and black tea is of about 138 mg and 118 mg per 100 mL, respectively [(9)](#reference9). A major subclass of flavonoids in tea is that of flavan-3-ols. Flavan-3-ol monomers, also known as catechins, constitute 30%-42% of the solid weight of brewed green tea. The principal catechins found in tea are (-)-epicatechin polyphenol oxidase during the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) process that yields black tea, they form low molecular weight [dimers](../glossary#dimer) known as theaflavins (see [Figure 3](#figure-3)) and complex [polymers](../glossary#polymer) (of mostly unknown structures) called thearubigins. Non-oxidized teas are rich in catechins, while fully oxidized teas are rich in theaflavins and thearubigins (Table 1) black, brewed||2.1||5.9||8.0||9.4||81.3| | 11 g of tea leaves infused in 100 mL of boiling water (1% weight/volume) | 2The lack of a value for a particular flavonoid in a food in the database does not imply a zero value, but only that data were unavailable. Tea is also a good source of another class of flavonoids called flavonols. Flavonols found in tea include kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin. The flavonol content of tea is minimally affected by processing, and flavonols are present in comparable quantities in oxidized and non-oxidized teas. Unlike flavan-3-ols, flavonols are usually present in tea as [glycosides](../glossary#glycoside), i.e., bound to a sugar molecule (Figure 4). Despite their poor bioavailability, flavonoids are thought to contribute substantially to the health benefits associated with daily tea consumption [(10)](#reference10). For more detailed information, see the article on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids). All teas contain caffeine, unless they are deliberately decaffeinated during processing. The caffeine content of different varieties of tea may vary considerably and is influenced by factors like brewing time, the amount of tea and water used for brewing, and whether the tea is loose or in teabags. In general, a mug of tea contains about half as much caffeine as a mug of coffee [(11)](#reference11). The caffeine contents of more than 20 green and black teas prepared according to package directions are presented in Table 2 [(12)](#reference12). The caffeine content of oolong teas is comparable to green teas [(13)](#reference13). There is little information on the caffeine content of white teas, since they are often grouped together with green teas [(14)](#reference14). Buds and young tea leaves have been found to contain higher levels of caffeine than older leaves [(15)](#reference15), suggesting that the caffeine content of some white teas may be slightly higher than that of green teas the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), thought to protect adenosine has mostly inhibitory effects in the central nervous system, the effects of adenosine antagonism by caffeine are generally stimulatory. Tea plants accumulate [fluoride](../minerals/fluoride) in their leaves. In general, the oldest tea leaves contain the most fluoride [(19)](#reference19). Most high-quality teas are made from the bud or the first two to four leaves \u2014 the youngest leaves on the plant. Fluoride levels in green, oolong, and black teas are generally comparable to those recommended for the prevention of [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries) (cavities). Thus, daily consumption of up to one liter of green, oolong, black, or pu-erh tea would be unlikely to result in fluoride intakes higher than those recommended for dental health [(20, 21)](#reference20). The fluoride content of white tea is likely to be less than other teas, since white teas are made from the buds and youngest leaves of the tea plant. A comparative study of green, oolong, and black teas from six provinces of China found that fluoride content was [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the quality level of tea sensory attributes (i.e., appearance, taste, flavor) [(22)](#reference22). The fluoride content of 17 brands of green, oolong, and black teas is presented in Table 3 [(20)](#reference20). These values do not include the fluoride content of the water used to make the tea. For more information, see the article on continuous infusion from 5 minutes (number before hyphen) to 360 minutes (number [(23)](#reference23). L-theanine is absorbed in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) and has a [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) close to 100% [(24)](#reference24). L-theanine can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert neuroprotective effects [(25)](#reference25). Because its chemical structure resembles that of [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate), a [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) critically involved in memory, theanine may compete with glutamate for binding to glutamate [receptors](../glossary#receptor) (Figure 6). This glutamate [antagonism](../glossary#antagonist) has been associated with the prevention of [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) death by theanine after brain [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) (reviewed in [25](#reference25)). Many [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) have considered the relationship between tea consumption and manifestations of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD), including [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) and [stroke](../glossary#stroke) (reviewed in [26](#reference26)). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) by Zhang et al. included the results of prospective [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) ( [cohort](../glossary#cohort) or [nested case-control studies](../glossary#nested-case-control-study)) that examined the association between tea consumption and [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) morbidity and mortality [(27)](#reference27). The results showed that a three-cup (125 mL/cup) increase in daily tea intake was associated with a 27% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of CHD (seven studies), an 18% lower risk of total stroke (eight studies), a 16% lower risk of [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) (four studies), a 21% lower risk of intracerebral [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (a type of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke)), a 26% lower risk of cardiac deaths (12 studies), and a 24% lower risk of total deaths (seven studies). No associations were found between tea consumption and stroke mortality (five studies) or risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (a subtype of stroke; two studies). Further subgroup analyses indicated that green tea consumption was specifically linked to a reduced risk of stroke, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality, while a lower CHD risk was associated with black tea consumption [(27)](#reference27). Another recent meta-analysis of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that the highest versus lowest level of green tea consumption was associated with a 33% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (five studies) and a 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (five studies) [(28)](#reference28). Black tea consumption was linked to a 10% reduced risk of all-cause mortality, but not specifically to cardiovascular-related mortality [(28)](#reference28). Tea is a major source of flavonoids in US and European diets [(29, 30)](#reference29). The results of several epidemiological studies suggest that dietary flavonoids might influence cardiovascular health. A recent meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies reported that highest versus lowest quantiles of flavonol, flavan-3-ol, flavanone, flavone, anthocyanidin, and proanthocyanidin intake associated modest reductions (~10%) in cardiovascular risk [(31)](#reference31). A dose-response analysis based on the results of 13 studies in nearly 350,000 individuals and 12,445 CVD cases found a 5% risk reduction with an average 10 mg-incremental increase in daily flavonol intakes [(31)](#reference31). It is not clear whether the [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), anti-inflammatory, and/or [vasodilatory](../glossary#vasodilation) properties of flavonoids are responsible for some of the cardiovascular benefits associated with tea consumption (see also the article on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids)). A number of [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) have investigated the effects of tea consumption on markers of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) health, including biological parameters related to [lipid](../glossary#lipid) and [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), blood [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation), [endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) health, markers of cardiovascular disease: ] [Clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) examining the effects of green and/or black tea beverages or extracts have been relatively [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity), especially regarding concentrations of active substances, duration of interventions, and included populations. Pooled analyses of mostly short-term interventions (<3 months) have suggested a reduction in total and [LDL](../glossary#LDL) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations with green tea catechin consumption, but the data regarding a potential [lipid](../glossary#lipid)-lowering effect of black tea are inconsistent [(32-34)](#reference32).The studies mentioned below investigated the effect of tea/tea extracts given for at least three months. Black tea: The Tea's Effect on Atherosclerosis (TEA) [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 28 older adults at increased risk for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) did not find any effect of a six-month black tea consumption intervention (three glasses per day equivalent to 318 mg/day of black tea catechins) on specific [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker), including circulating [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein), [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) markers, [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentration, adhesion [hemostatic](../glossary#hemostasis) factors [(35)](#reference35). Yet, in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 47 individuals with borderline-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia, the daily consumption of 1 g of pu-erh tea (Chinese black tea) extract for three months reduced the blood concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) [(36)](#reference36). A three-month, placebo-controlled trial in 77 healthy subjects who drank 9 g of black tea infused in 600 mL of boiling water per day (about 740 mg/day of black tea polyphenols) had improvements in lipoprotein and triglyceride profiles, fasting [serum](../glossary#serum) [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations, and measures of [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activities in the [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [(37)](#reference37). The same protocol was found to also reduce markers of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and inflammation in the plasma of individuals at risk for CVD [(38)](#reference38). In contrast, a recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial in 77 regular tea drinkers (35 to 75 years old) found that the daily consumption of 429 mg of black tea polyphenols for six months had no effect on fasting blood glucose and serum lipids [(39)](#reference39). Green tea: Daily supplementation with a capsule containing 150 mg of green tea catechins, 75 mg of black tea theaflavins, and 150 mg of other polyphenols, for six months significantly lowered plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations and the ratio total cholesterol: [HDL](../glossary#HDL) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 220 individuals with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia [(40)](#reference40). In a pilot study in 74 overweight/ [obese](../glossary#obesity) breast cancer survivors, the daily consumption of green tea (containing 26.7 mg of caffeine and 235.6 mg of catechins with 128.8 mg as EGCG) for six months increased HDL concentration compared to a citrus-based herbal placebo but had no effect on LDL concentration and markers of glycemic control [(41)](#reference41). Another placebo-controlled study conducted in obese subjects with controlled [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) found that the daily ingestion of one capsule of green tea extract (379 mg/capsule containing 208 mg of EGCG) for three months significantly lowered [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) blood pressure and improved blood lipid profile, antioxidant status, and measures of glycemic control and inflammation [(42)](#reference42). [Endothelial dysfunction: The ] [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells that line the inner surface of all blood vessels [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which plays a critical role in maintaining [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) health. Specifically, eNOS utilizes L-arginine to produce [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO), a compound that regulates vascular tone and blood flow by promoting the relaxation ( [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation)) of all types of blood vessels, including arteries [(26)](#reference26). NO also regulates vascular [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) and protects the integrity muscle cells [(43)](#reference43). In the presence of cardiovascular [risk](../glossary#risk) factors (e.g., [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), hypercholesterolemia, [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia)), early alterations in the structure and function of the vascular endothelium are associated with the loss of normal NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Endothelial dysfunction results in widespread [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction) and [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities and is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis). The measurement of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is often used as a of endothelial function; FMD values are [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of future cardiovascular events [(44)](#reference44). Black tea: Two small controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) found that daily consumption of 900 to 1,250 mL of black tea for four weeks significantly improved endothelium-dependent FMD in patients with [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) [(45)](#reference45) and in patients with mildly elevated [serum](../glossary#serum) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations [(46)](#reference46). Improvements were noted in comparison to an equivalent amount of hot water. Incremental doses of black tea flavonoids (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/day; each dose being given for one week) have been associated with dose-dependent increases in brachial FMD in 19 healthy volunteers. Specifically, FMD values went from 7.8% at baseline (no flavonoids) to 10.3% with 800 mg/day of flavonoids [(47)](#reference47). Of note, in this study, the ingestion of black tea flavonoids significantly lowered [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) in a non dose-dependent manner, while other variables, including markers of arterial stiffness, [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), inflammation, endothelial activation, and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile, remain largely unchanged [(47)](#reference47). In a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) trial, seven days of black tea consumption (450 mL/day) followed by the ingestion of two cups (300 mL) 20 minutes before an experimental ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury procedure on healthy participants failed to prevent IR injury-associated FMD reduction. Even if tea flavonoids were able to limit the impact of IR injury on FMD \u2014 for example by counteracting the production of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) \u2014 the presence of caffeine in black tea (and the lack of control for it) could have [confounded](../glossary#confounder) this effect [(48)](#reference48). Green tea: In a small study conducted in 14 healthy young adults (50% smokers), a significant increase in brachial FMD was reported 30 to 120 minutes after the consumption of 450 mL of green tea (6 g of green tea, including 125 mg of caffeine) compared to caffeine alone or hot water [(49)](#reference49). Another study that compared the acute effect of black and green tea on brachial FMD in 21 postmenopausal women found a similar increase in FMD two hours after the ingestion of either tea preparation [(50)](#reference50). Both black and green teas have been found to be equally able to increase eNOS activity and NO production in cultured endothelial cells [(50, 51)](#reference50). Specifically, the prominent green tea catechin, EGCG, and black tea polyphenols, theaflavins and thearubigins, are thought to contribute to the protective effect of drinking tea by promoting [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activity and endothelium-dependent vasodilation [(51)](#reference51). Other flavonoids, like (-)-epicatechin and quercetin glucoside have recently failed to show an effect on FMD (and blood pressure) in [hypertensive](../glossary#hypertension) adults [(52)](#reference52). For more information, see the article on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine human [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) estimated that the acute and/or short-term (up to four weeks), daily ingestion of 500 mL of tea \u2014 containing about 248 mg of flavonoids in green tea and 415 mg in black tea \u2014 significantly increased brachial FMD [(53)](#reference53). Yet, the clinical relevance of these FMD improvements is unclear. It is also not clear whether the chronic consumption of tea might benefit vascular endothelial function and eventually lower the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). [Hypertension: ] [Hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) (high blood pressure) is a [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for CVD morbidity and mortality. Black tea: A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 11 small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in either healthy or at-risk individuals found a significant reduction of 2 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) in [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and 1 mm Hg in [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) with the daily consumption of at least 400 mL (13 oz) of black tea for one week to six months, providing a minimum of 240 mg/day of flavonoids [(54)](#reference54). Two recent trials also reported that black tea lowered the rate of circadian variations in blood pressure at nighttime and variations after a dietary fat challenge. A six-month intervention in 76 participants from the general population (most with moderate hypertension) showed that the consumption of three cups per day of black tea, supplying a daily total of 1.29 g of polyphenols and 288 mg of caffeine, lowered the rate of nighttime blood pressure variations compared to a polyphenol-free caffeine-matched placebo [(55)](#reference55). Two cups of black tea per day, equivalent to 300 mg of polyphenols, also limited blood pressure variations after a fat-rich meal in 19 patients with primary (idiopathic) hypertension [(56)](#reference56). Mechanisms underlying the blood pressure-lowering properties of black tea may involve the inhibition of angiotensin-II [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by flavonoids (see below). Green tea: Several recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicated that the consumption of green tea or green tea extracts could significantly lower blood pressure [(57-60)](#reference57). In one of them, the pooled analysis of 13 trials in 1,367 subjects found a 2.0 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 1.9 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure with green tea polyphenols (208 mg/day-1,207 mg/day) for a median period of 12 weeks [(60)](#reference60). Subgroup analyses suggested greater blood pressure lowering effect with polyphenol intake levels lower than 582.8 mg/day and with adjustment for the [confounding](../glossary#confounder) effect of caffeine. Another meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials that specifically explored the effect of green tea or green tea extracts on blood pressure in overweight or [obese](../glossary#obesity) subjects. The pooled analysis of 14 trials showed significant reductions of 1.4 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 1.3 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure [(58)](#reference58). The anti-hypertensive effect of green tea may be mediated by a number of mechanisms. For example, pharmacological concentrations of several catechins have been shown to inhibit the activity of a key regulator of arterial blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), [in into angiotensin-II, a potent inducer of [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction). In addition, studies in rats showed that chronic treatment with epicatechin prevented salt-induced hypertension, partly through inhibition of endothelin-1 expression and NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity [(62)](#reference62). Other potential benefits of green tea consumption, including improvements in blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile, [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive), and endothelial function, may also contribute to its blood pressure-lowering effects. [Impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) in patients with prediabetes is often associated loss [insulin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), low-grade [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and endothelial dysfunction [(63)](#reference63). Without changes in lifestyle behavior (especially regarding dietary habits and physical activity), individuals with prediabetes will eventually progress to develop overt type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(64)](#reference64). In this context, the association between tea consumption and [risk](../glossary#risk) of type 2 diabetes has been examined in a recent European, multicenter, [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) \u2014 the \"EPIC-InterAct\" project \u2014 that 16,835 diabetes-free participants and 12,043 individuals with diabetes [(65)](#reference65). The results showed that tea consumption was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with diabetes incidence. The consumption of four cups per day rather than none was found to be associated with a 16% lower risk of diabetes [(65)](#reference65). Of note, in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 15 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including the EPIC-InterAct study, an incremental increase of two cups per day in tea consumption was found to be associated with an estimated 4.6% risk reduction [(66)](#reference66). The EPIC-InterAct study also found that participants in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) (>608.1 mg/day) of total flavonoid intake had a 10% lower risk of diabetes than those in the lowest quintile (<178.2 mg/day) [(67)](#reference67). Specifically, the risk of diabetes was inversely correlated with the consumption of flavan-3-ols other flavonoid abundant in tea, namely anthocyanidins, flavanones, flavones, and isoflavones, were not associated with a reduced risk of diabetes [(67)](#reference67). Recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the possible health benefits of green tea catechins on [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) have provided conflicting results. A meta-analysis of seven trials in prediabetic and diabetic patients found no effect of green tea or green tea extracts on fasting [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose, fasting [serum](../glossary#serum) [insulin](../glossary#insulin), or measures of glycemic control [HbA1c](../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c)) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) [(69)](#reference69). Conversely, another meta-analysis of 17 trials in prediabetic, diabetic, or overweight/obese subjects found that administration of green tea extracts for 4 to 16 weeks improved fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels [(70)](#reference70). The effect on fasting glucose was observed only with high doses of catechins (457 mg/day) and when the [confounding](../glossary#confounder) effect of caffeine was removed. However, a third meta-analysis of 25 trials found that ingestion of green tea extracts for at least two weeks could lower fasting blood glucose in both the presence or absence of caffeine [(71)](#reference71). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of five small, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (<100 participants per study) found that regular consumption of green or pu-erh tea extracts reduced body weight and [body mass in overweight/ [obese](../glossary#obesity) participants with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) [(72)](#reference72). The influence of green tea on body composition may be attributed to the regulation of appetite, fat absorption, [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation), and thermogenesis by catechins and caffeine [(73)](#reference73). Yet, studies in overweight/obese people who are otherwise healthy have provided mixed results (reviewed in [74](#reference74)). [Intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) in Caucasian populations have shown a less favorable effect of green tea catechins on body weight and energy expenditure compared to those conducted in Asian subjects. These discrepancies suggested that differences in genetic background, body composition, and dietary habits (including caffeine consumption) might interfere with the possible anti-obesity effect of green tea consumption. Large-scale, intervention trials that control for energy intake and physical activity are needed to determine if tea or tea extracts promote weight loss or improve weight maintenance in different populations with obesity and/or metabolic syndrome [(74)](#reference74). Tea and tea constituents have been found to have [cancer](../glossary#cancer) preventive activities in a variety of animal models of cancer, such as cancer of lung, mouth, [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus), stomach, [colon](../glossary#colon), and [prostate](../glossary#prostate) [(75)](#reference75). However, the results of [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) in humans have been mostly inconclusive. An early [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) had reported that black tea intake (five cohorts) \u2014 but not green tea (three cohorts) \u2014 was associated with a 15% higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(76)](#reference76). The relationship between tea consumption and breast cancer has been recently examined in the Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health prospective cohort Study (WLHS), which followed 42,099 women for 20 years and documented 1,395 breast cancer cases [(77)](#reference77). The results indicated a 14% higher risk of breast cancer with each cup (200 mL) of tea consumed daily. The risk was specifically increased in postmenopausal women rather than in premenopausal women. Similarly, in a recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) in Chinese women in Hong Kong, regular tea consumption was [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women but associated with an increased risk in postmenopausal women [(78)](#reference78). The risk associated with consuming tea was also significantly higher for [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen)- and progesterone-receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) breast cancer type in the Swedish cohort, while the highest risk was found in women with ER-negative tumors in the Chinese study [(77, 78)](#reference77). Yet, in the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer Study (EPIC) in 335,060 women followed for 11 years (10,198 incidental breast cancer cases), tea intake was not associated with breast cancer overall or when the data were analyzed for menopausal status or breast cancer type [(79)](#reference79). The most recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found no association between consumption of green or black tea and breast cancer [(80)](#reference80). Thus, current [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) evidence does not suggest a benefit of tea in breast cancer prevention despite promising data from cultured cells and rodent models [(81)](#reference81). However, some [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found that consumption of certain subclasses of flavonoids might have the potential to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women [(82)](#reference82). Recently, the effects of decaffeinated green tea extracts on [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of breast cancer risk were examined in the Minnesota Green Tea Trial (MGTT) in 1,075 high-risk postmenopausal women [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive the equivalent of four 8-ounce mugs/day (960 mL/day) in green tea extracts (1,315\u00b1116 mg/day of catechins) or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for one year [(83)](#reference83). The results have yet to be published. In the large, prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health study (1995-2006) in 481,563 US adults, 1,305 cases of oral (392), pharyngeal (178), [laryngeal](../glossary#larynx) (307), and [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) (428) [cancers](../glossary#cancer) have been identified during the follow-up period [(84)](#reference84). The highest versus lowest level of tea intake (1 cup/day vs. non-consumption) was correlated with a 63% lower risk of pharyngeal cancer but with no other above-cited cancer types [(84)](#reference84). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) do not currently provide clear evidence for an association between tea consumption and laryngeal [(85)](#reference85) or esophageal [(86)](#reference86) cancers. In the case of esophageal cancer, the consumption of high-temperature beverages (including very hot tea) might even damage the epithelium and increase the risk of cancer [(87)](#reference87). High temperature may act as a [confounding](../glossary#confounder) factor that complicates the interaction between tea consumption and esophageal cancer [(88)](#reference88). In 2009, a [phase II](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial), [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) trial was conducted in 41 patients with high-risk oral premalignant lesions (OPLs). Participants were randomly assigned to orally receive 0.5, 0.75, or 1 g of green tea extract per m2 (body surface area) or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo), thrice a day for three months. While the results suggested that OPLs might be clinically responsive to green tea extract treatment, larger trial populations are needed to confirm these preliminary data [(89)](#reference89). Several [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) reported no association between tea consumption and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [gastric](../glossary#gastric) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(90-92)](#reference90), including the US NIH-AARP Diet and Health study [(84)](#reference84). Tea consumption also failed to predict gastric cancer cases in the EPIC study, which followed 477,312 participants and identified 683 cases during a median 11.6 years of follow-up [(93)](#reference93). Yet, a decreased risk of intestinal type gastric cancer was observed in women in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of tea consumption (475 mL/day vs. 21 mL/day). Interestingly, women (but not men) in the highest versus lowest quartile of flavonol, flavanol, theaflavin, or total flavonoid intakes had a significantly reduced risk of developing gastric cancer [(94)](#reference94). A pooled analysis of six Japanese cohort studies, including 219,080 total participants and 3,577 cases, found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between green tea consumption and gastric cancer in women but not in men: daily consumption of at least five cups of tea was associated with a 21% lower risk of gastric cancer in women compared to low intakes (<1 cup/day) [(95)](#reference95). [Meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 34% reduction in [risk](../glossary#risk) of ovarian [cancer](../glossary#cancer) for highest versus lowest intake of green tea (four studies) [(96)](#reference96), but no association was observed for black tea (six studies) [(97)](#reference97). Yet, a meta-analysis of six [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) showed an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between black tea consumption and ovarian cancer [(98)](#reference98). A recent analysis of the Nurses' Health Studies (NHS I and II) showed a 31% lower risk of ovarian cancer in women consuming at least 1 cup/day compared to rare/non-black tea drinkers [(99)](#reference99). In a prospective study in 244 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and followed for over three years, green tea consumption was associated with a mean survival time greater for consumers (5.39 years) than for non-consumers (4.19 years) [(100)](#reference100). However, in a single-arm, [phase II trial](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) in 16 women in complete remission from advanced stage ovarian cancer, the daily intake of 500 mL of green tea (containing 319.8 mg of EGCG) failed to effectively prevent cancer recurrence within the 18-month follow-up period [(101)](#reference101). Further, a recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggested a possible benefit of green tea \u2014 but not black tea \u2014 for [endometrial](../glossary#endometrium) cancer [(102)](#reference102). Additional studies have examined the association between tea consumption and risk of lung, prostate, liver, or [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) in humans, providing mixed results (reviewed in [103](#reference103)). The [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) is complex, involving factors such as aging, decreased sex [hormones](../glossary#hormone), inadequate nutrition, physical inactivity, genetic predisposition, as well as socioeconomic determinants. Tea bioactive components, including flavonoids, caffeine, and [fluoride](../minerals/fluoride), have the potential to influence health and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of osteoporosis and [fracture](../glossary#fracture) [(104, 105)](#reference104). A small [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 164 elderly women found that consumption of tea limited the age-related loss in total hip [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) over [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 171 postmenopausal women with [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia), the daily consumption of green tea catechins (500 mg) alone or combined with Tai Chi exercise (3 hours/week) improved bone turnover by stimulating bone formation [(107)](#reference107). Hip fracture is one of the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. A recent prospective study in 1,188 elderly women (mean age, 80 years) followed for 10 years found that participants in the highest versus lowest tertile of tea consumption (3 cups/day vs. 1 cup/week) had a 30% lower risk of any osteoporotic fracture. However, no interaction was found when the analysis was conducted on major fractures (hip, spine, humerus, and wrist) or hip fractures only [(108)](#reference108). Yet, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) based on 147,488 individuals from 11 [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) published between 1990 and 2010 suggested that the consumption of 1-4 cups/day was associated with a significantly lower risk of hip fracture [(109)](#reference109). The results of another recent meta-analysis of mostly [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) did not suggest any interaction between tea consumption and risk of any fracture or hip fracture [(110)](#reference110). Additional studies are required to determine whether tea consumption affects the development of osteoporosis or the risk of osteoporotic fracture in a meaningful way. The [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of the Ohsaki [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that included data from 25,078 Japanese participants found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between the daily consumption of at least one cup of tea and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of tooth loss [(111)](#reference111). Specifically, the risk of tooth loss was 11% lower in women and 23% lower in men who consumed at least five cups per day of tea compared to those drinking less than one cup per day. An earlier cross-sectional study of more than 6,000 14-year old children in the UK found that those who drank tea had significantly fewer [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries) than coffee drinkers; results were independent of the amount of beverage consumed or whether sugar was added [(112)](#reference112). Although tea is a good source of fluoride \u2014 a recognized anticaries agent \u2014 both flavonoids and tannins in tea have been shown to have [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) properties (reviewed in [113](#reference113)). Oral [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) like Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with plaque formation, dental caries, and periodontal (gum) diseases. Untreated caries and gum [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) can lead to severe pain, local infection, tooth loss or extraction, nutritional problems, and serious systemic infections in susceptible individuals. A [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 25 adults suggested that mouthwash with a 2% green tea solution could lower acidity level and Streptococcus mutans count in saliva and plaque and improve measures of gum bleeding after exposure to sugar [(114)](#reference114). A small, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) study in 66 young volunteers (12-18 years old) also reported a significant antibacterial effect of a mouth rinse made with pulverized tea leaves compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) solution [(115)](#reference115). Recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled studies demonstrated further that tea extract-containing mouthwashes could benefit dental health and offer a possible alternative to current chlorhexidine- and fluoride-containing rinsing solutions [(116-118)](#reference116). Finally, the incorporation of tea extract in toothpastes was found to be as effective \u2014 if not better \u2014 than regular pastes (containing fluoride and triclosan) to reduce dental plaque and gum inflammation in patients with mild to moderate periodontitis [(119)](#reference119). For more information on dental caries, see the article on [Fluoride](../minerals/fluoride). The formation of [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones), usually composed of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate, is a common condition that affects 7% of US women and 11% of US men during their lifetime [(120)](#reference120). A pooled analysis of three ongoing [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) \u2014 the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses' Health Studies I and II, including a total of 194,095 participants \u2014 found that the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing symptomatic kidney stones was 11% lower in individuals consuming at least one 8-ounce mug of tea per day compared to those consuming less than one cup per week [(121)](#reference121). High fluid intake, including tea intake, is generally considered the most effective and economical means of preventing kidney stones [(122)](#reference122). However, the finding that black tea may contain high amounts of oxalate (48 to 92 mg/100 mL) suggested that black tea consumption may increase urinary oxalate concentrations, a risk factor for calcium oxalate stone formation [(123)](#reference123). The [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](http://www.eatright.org/) recommends that kidney stone patients restrict oxalate intake to 40 mg/day-50 mg/day, and some experts advise those with a history of calcium oxalate stones to limit the consumption of oxalate-rich food, including black (but not green) tea [(123, 124)](#reference123). Yet, recent studies have reported amounts of oxalate in different samples of green teas (0.8 to 14 mg/100 mL) [(125)](#reference125) and black teas (1 to 2.6 mg/100 mL) [(126, 127)](#reference126) much lower than previously published, suggesting that tea consumption would not increase kidney stone incidence or recurrence. The term \"mood\" refers to an emotional state of mind that includes aspects like contentedness, relaxation, alertness, energy, and relief from depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt and failure [(128)](#reference128). Clinical depression is described as a mood disorder. An analysis of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (1995-2006) in 263,923 participants \u2014 of which 11,311 self-reported depression \u2014 found that consumption of decaffeinated (but not caffeinated) hot tea was associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for depression [(129)](#reference129). However, smaller cohort studies had previously recorded significantly less depressive symptoms in participants with higher versus lower intakes of tea [(130, 131)](#reference130). Tea consumption may have short-term effects on mood. In a recent [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 95 university staff members, consumption of tea recorded during 10 working days was associated with self reports of feeling less tired and performing better at work [(132)](#reference132). Tea was also found to increase the positive valence of mood immediately after consumption in a small [randomized controlled study](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 150 participants [(133)](#reference133). Cognitive function includes the domains of attention, memory, processing speed, and [executive function](../glossary#executive-function), which decline gradually with increasing age. A few studies investigated whether tea consumption was associated with cognitive benefits, especially in the domain of attention (reviewed in [134](#reference134)). Two [cross-over](../glossary#cross-over-trial), [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies evaluated the effects of two servings of black tea over the course of 60 min (study 1; 26 volunteers) or three servings of black tea over the course of 90 min (study 2; 32 volunteers) on measures of attention and alertness [(135)](#reference135). Both studies reported improved performance on objective attention tests and self-reported alertness with black tea compared to placebo. In a small [open-label study](../glossary#open-label-trial), 19 participants were asked to consume either black tea (with/without caffeine), coffee (with caffeine), or water (with/without caffeine) before undergoing a battery of psychometric tests [(136)](#reference136). Most of the improvements in cognitive function (measured with the Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold [CFFT] task) and subjective alertness were attributed to caffeine in the beverages. In addition, CFFT task scores were greater after consumption of caffeinated tea compared to caffeinated water [(136)](#reference136). In a follow-up study, caffeinated tea outperformed caffeinated coffee in the CFFT test, suggesting that tea ingredients other than caffeine might have acute effects on cognitive function [(137)](#reference137). A recent meta-analysis of small, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (<50 participants/trial) that measured the acute effect of L-theanine (36 mg-250 mg) with or without caffeine (40 mg-250 mg) suggested an increase in alertness and attention-switching accuracy but no change regarding other parameters, such as calmness, contentedness, or anxiety [(138)](#reference138). The [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data analysis of 2,501 participants (55 years old) in the Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Study (SLAS) indicated that higher intakes of tea correlated with better global [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function, as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores [(139)](#reference139). Conversely, lower levels of tea consumption were associated with a higher prevalence of cognitive impairments, defined as MMSE scores 23. Similar observations have been reported in several other cross-sectional studies [(140-143)](#reference140). In the SLAS study, the follow-up of 1,438 cognitively healthy people for one to two years showed that the [risk](../glossary#risk) of cognitive decline (defined as a drop of 1 point in the MMSE score) was up to 43% lower in tea drinkers compared to non-drinkers [(139)](#reference139). Further research in 716 SLAS participants (mean age, 64.5 years) with normal cognitive function confirmed that those consuming tea scored higher in the MMSE global cognition test than non-consumers. Tea consumption was also correlated with higher cognitive test scores regarding memory, [executive function](../glossary#executive-function), and information-processing speed [(144)](#reference144). Tea consumption was also modestly associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline in 2,722 women (but not in men) followed for a median 7.9 years in the US population-based Cardiovascular Health Study, despite a much lower frequency of tea consumption (up to 5 cups/week) than that observed in the SLAS (over 10 cups/day) [(145)](#reference145). In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in Japanese older people (>60 years old) followed for nearly five years, daily green tea consumers were shown to have lower risks of mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and [dementia](../glossary#dementia) compared to non-consumers [(146)](#reference146). In a recent [pilot trial](../glossary#pilot-study), the consumption of green tea extracts (2 g/day, of which 227 mg of catechins and 42 mg of theanine) for three months resulted in higher MMSE scores (compared to baseline) due to improved short-term memory scores in 12 elderly nursing home residents (ages, 70 to 98 years) with symptoms from MCI to severe dementia [(147)](#reference147). Long-term, large [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to establish whether tea or its bioactive components could limit cognitive decline and/or improve cognitive dysfunction in older individuals. [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) (PD) is a [neurodegenerative disease](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by the selective death of dopaminergic brain cells in the substantia nigra. PD is estimated to affect 0.5%-4% of older people (65 years old) worldwide [(148)](#reference148). A [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) in 279 subjects with PD suggested that the onset of motor symptoms in those drinking more than 3 cups/day of tea was delayed by several years compared to nondrinkers [(149)](#reference149); yet, after disease onset, a similar rate of disease progression was observed among tea drinkers and non-drinkers [(150)](#reference150). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), and 1,418 PD cases, found a 15% reduced risk of PD with higher versus lower intake of tea [(151)](#reference151). Another meta-analysis of four case-control studies and four [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) published between 1999 and 2012 indicated that individuals in the highest category of tea consumption had a 37% lower risk of PD compared to those in the lowest category [(152)](#reference152). The authors estimated that each 2 cups/day-increase in tea consumption was associated with a 26% lower risk of developing PD [(152)](#reference152). If a protective effect of tea consumption can be further demonstrated, several bioactive compounds, especially caffeine [(153)](#reference153) and [flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) [(154)](#reference154), could be responsible for the tea benefits in PD prevention. Tea is generally considered to be safe, even in large amounts. However, two cases of hypokalemia (abnormally low [serum](../glossary#serum) [potassium](../minerals/potassium) concentrations) in the elderly have been attributed to excessive consumption of black and oolong tea (3 L/day-14 L/day) [(155, 156)](#reference155). Hypokalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition been associated with caffeine toxicity [(157, [Case reports](../glossary#case-report) skeletal fluorosis [(161-163)](#reference161) due to excessive tea consumption have also been published. In [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) employing caffeinated green tea extracts, [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients who took 6 g/day, in three to six divided doses, experienced mild-to-moderate [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [(164, 165)](#reference164). [Central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) symptoms, including agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tremors, dizziness, and confusion, have also been reported. In one case, confusion was severe enough to require hospitalization [(164)](#reference164). In a [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) published in 2008, the US Pharmacopeia (USP) Dietary Supplement Information Expert Committee identified 34 adverse event reports implicating the use of green tea extract products (containing 25%-97% of polyphenols) as the likely cause of liver damage (hepatotoxicity) in humans [(166)](#reference166). Nineteen additional cases of hepatotoxicity associated with the consumption of herbal products containing green tea have been reported for the period 2008-2015 [(167)](#reference167). In a four-week clinical trial that assessed the safety of decaffeinated green tea extracts (800 mg/day of EGCG) in healthy individuals, a few of the participants reported mild nausea, stomach upset, dizziness, or muscle pain [(168)](#reference168). In the Minnesota Green Tea Trial (MGTT), 1,075 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive green tea extracts (1,315\u00b1116 mg/day of catechins; the equivalent of four 8-ounce mugs of brewed decaffeinated green tea) or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for one year. The total number of adverse events and the number of serious adverse events were not different between the treatment and placebo groups [(169)](#reference169). However, the use of green tea extracts was directly associated with abnormally high liver [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) levels in 7 out of the 12 women who experienced serious adverse events. Also, the incidence of nausea was twice as high in the green tea arm as in the placebo group [(169)](#reference169). The safety of tea extracts or [supplements](../glossary#supplement) for pregnant or breast-feeding women has not been established. Some organizations, like the [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists](http://www.acog.org/), suggest to limit caffeine consumption during pregnancy to less than 200 mg/day [(170)](#reference170), because higher caffeine intakes have been associated with increased risk of miscarriage and low birth weight in some [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) [(171, 172)](#reference171). Excessive green tea consumption may decrease the therapeutic effects of the [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven). Such an effect was documented in only one patient who began drinking one-half gallon to one gallon of green tea daily [(173)](#reference173). It is probably not necessary for people on warfarin therapy to avoid green tea entirely; however, large quantities of green tea may increase the risk of bleeding in warfarin-treated patients [(174)](#reference174). Green tea extracts may also reduce the efficacy or increase the toxicity of at least two other [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) drugs, namely simvastatin (Zocor) and nadolol (Corgard) [(175)](#reference175). Preclinical studies suggested that green tea extracts may interfere with drug [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) by affecting the activity of [cytochrome P450](../glossary#cytochrome-P450) 3A4 (CYP3A4), which [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the metabolism of about one-half of all marketed drugs in the US and Canada [(176)](#reference176). Additional information on drug interactions is available in the article on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids#drug-interactions). A number of drugs can impair the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of caffeine, increasing the potential for adverse effects from caffeine [(177)](#reference177). Such drugs include may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of albuterol theophylline. High caffeine intakes may also reduce the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) and/or the efficacy of like carbamazepine, valproate, dipyridamole (Persantine), pentobarbital (Nembutal), and phenobarbital (Luminal). Abrupt caffeine withdrawal has been found to increase [serum](../glossary#serum) lithium levels in people taking lithium, potentially increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) in tea can bind [nonheme iron](../minerals/iron#nonheme-iron), inhibiting its intestinal absorption [(178, 179)](#reference178). Nonheme iron is the principal form of iron in plant foods, dairy products, and iron [supplements](../glossary#supplement). The consumption of one cup of tea with a meal has been found to decrease the absorption of nonheme iron in that meal by about 70% [(180, 181)](#reference180). Flavonoids can also inhibit intestinal [(182)](#reference182). Interestingly, ascorbic acid ( [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C)) greatly enhances the absorption of iron and is able to counteract the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on nonheme and heme iron absorption [(179](#reference179), [182, 183)](#reference182). To maximize iron absorption from a meal or iron supplements, subjects with poor iron status should not consumed tea at the same time [(184)](#reference184). In addition, healthy individuals at no risk of iron deficiency do not need to restrict their consumption of tea [(184, 185)](#reference184).

The relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality is often described as J-shaped, meaning that when graphed from alcohol abstinence on the left to heavy drinking on the right, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption (2 drinks/day) is associated with lower rates of mortality \u2014 mostly from [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) \u2014 than abstention, while heavy alcohol consumption (>3-4 drinks/day) is associated with higher rates of mortality from a number of causes [(3-5)](#reference3). Because the consumption of alcohol can be viewed as a \"double-edged sword,\" individual decisions regarding alcohol use should take into consideration scientific evidence regarding potential health benefits and [risks](../glossary#risk), as well as personal and family histories of health problems and addictions. It is important to note the data on alcohol-disease relationships come from only observational studies, not [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), and observational data cannot establish causation. In observational research, potential [confounding](../glossary#confounder) variables should be adequately adjusted for using statistical techniques. For instance, nondrinkers have been shown to differ from those who consume alcohol in ways that might affect the disease outcome of interest [(6)](#reference6). Even when controlling for many potential confounders, [residual confounding](../glossary#residual-confounding) may still occur. A standard alcoholic drink contains approximately 14 grams of alcohol, which is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer (~5% alcohol), 8.5 ounces of malt liquor (~9% alcohol), 5 ounces of wine (~12% alcohol), 3.5 ounces of fortified wine (e.g., sherry or port), or 1.5 ounces of liquor (distilled spirits; ~40% alcohol). *In addition to weighing less, on average, women absorb and metabolize alcohol differently than men. In general, women have less body water than men of similar body weight, so women achieve higher blood alcohol concentrations after drinking equivalent amounts of alcohol [(10)](#reference10). Women also appear to be more vulnerable to adverse health effects of heavy drinking than men. Thus, most definitions of \"moderate\" or \"heavy\" drinking offer a lower threshold for women. Data from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have shown that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption (1 drink/day for women and 2 drinks/day for men) is protective against all-cause mortality [(4](#reference4), [11-15)](#reference11). As mentioned above, a J-shaped relationship is apparent when all-cause mortality is plotted against alcohol consumption (alcohol abstinence on the left and heavy drinking on the right of the x-axis) [(4](#reference4), [16)](#reference16). In other words, those who drink moderately have the lowest [risk](../glossary#risk) of total mortality when compared to nondrinkers and heavy drinkers, and heavy drinkers have the highest risk of mortality. The association of reduced mortality with moderate alcohol consumption is largely attributed to a decrease in cardiovascular mortality [(14](#reference14), [16-18)](#reference16), especially from coronary heart disease (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-potential-benefits-moderate-consumption) below). However, concern has been raised that some earlier observational studies have misclassified former drinkers in the lifetime abstention group (i.e., the referent group), but most recent studies have not supported such a 'misclassification hypothesis' [(15, 16](#reference15), [19)](#reference19). Over the past four decades, the most consistent evidence of a health benefit associated with moderate alcohol consumption has been a significant reduction in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) \u2014 a finding confirmed by a large number of [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study). When the results of 28 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) were combined in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis), adults who consumed an average of 25 grams/day of alcohol (the amount in two standard alcoholic drinks) had a risk of CHD that was 20% lower than adults who did not consume alcohol [(20)](#reference20). More recent data from two large prospective cohort studies conducted in the US suggest that the magnitude of CHD risk reduction associated with moderate alcohol consumption may be closer to 30%. In a 12-year study of more than 38,000 male health professionals, those who consumed alcohol at least 3-4 times weekly had a risk of [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (heart attack) that was 32% lower than men who drank alcohol less than once weekly [(21)](#reference21). Similarly, in a 20-year study of more than 120,000 men and women, those who reported consuming 1-2 alcoholic drinks daily had a risk of death from CHD that was 30% lower than those who did not drink alcohol [(22)](#reference22). A 2011 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analysis of 29 studies found that alcohol consumption was associated with a 29% reduced risk of CHD compared to abstention; intakes of 2.5 to 60.0 grams/day of alcohol were associated with a lower risk of CHD [(16)](#reference16). [How does alcohol consumption reduce CHD risk? The development of ] [CHD](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) is characterized by the formation of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-laden plaque in the arteries ( [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis)), vascular [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and clot formation [(23)](#reference23). Numerous small, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) trials have examined the effect of daily alcohol consumption on markers of CHD [risk](../glossary#risk), consistently finding that moderate alcohol consumption significantly increases concentrations of [high-density lipoprotein](../glossary#HDL) (HDL)-cholesterol \u2014 the 'good cholesterol from tissues, including arterial walls, back to the liver for elimination or recycling. In addition to increasing HDL levels, moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to increase apolipoprotein A1, a major component of circulating HDL [(25)](#reference25). Higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol have been associated with reductions in CHD risk [(26)](#reference26). Alcohol may also have anti-thrombotic properties. Clot formation is the result of complex interactions between factors that promote [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) and factors that inhibit coagulation or promote the dissolution of clots. Several randomized trials have found that moderate alcohol consumption decreases [serum](../glossary#serum) levels of fibrinogen, a [protein](../glossary#protein) that promotes clot formation [(25)](#reference25) and increases serum levels of an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that helps dissolve clots (tissue type plasminogen activator) [(24)](#reference24). Further, moderate alcohol consumption may have an anti-inflammatory effect since serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation and sensitive predictor of CHD risk, are lower in people who drink moderately than those who abstain from alcohol [(27-32)](#reference27). Moderate alcohol consumption has also been associated with improvements in adiponectin levels [(25)](#reference25), [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) (see [(33)](#reference33), and [endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function [(34)](#reference34). Does the type of alcohol consumed (wine, beer, or liquor) affect CHD risk? Significant reductions in [CHD](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) [risk](../glossary#risk) have been associated with moderate consumption of wine, beer, and liquor. However, the \"French Paradox\" \u2014 the observation that mortality from CHD is relatively low in France despite relatively high levels of dietary [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and cigarette smoking \u2014 led to the idea that regular consumption of red wine might provide additional protection from CHD [(35, 36)](#reference35). Red wine contains the phenolic compound resveratrol \u2014 although usually at variable and low concentrations (see the article on [Resveratrol](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/resveratrol#food-sources)) \u2014 as well as [flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) like procyanidins; these compounds could provide additional [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits beyond those associated with ethanol. Beer also contains polyphenolic compounds that might confer some cardioprotection [(37)](#reference37). Some large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have found wine drinkers to be at lower risk of CHD than beer or liquor drinkers [(22](#reference22), [38-40)](#reference38), but others have found no difference [(21](#reference21), [41, 42)](#reference41). Moreover, some studies have observed a decreased risk of [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) or CHD in predominantly beer-drinking populations in the Czech Republic [(43)](#reference43), in Germany [(44)](#reference44), and in Japanese men residing in Hawaii [(45)](#reference45). A 2011 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of prospective cohort and [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found that moderate consumption of wine or beer was associated with a decreased risk of non-fatal vascular events [(46)](#reference46). This analysis did not associate drinking liquor with cardiovascular benefit, although the authors noted that binge drinking \u2014 which is known to increase CHD risk \u2014 was apparent in several of the included studies [(46)](#reference46). Socioeconomic status and lifestyle characteristics (e.g., tobacco use, exercise habits) may differ among people who prefer wine, beer, or liquor, and this may in part explain any additional benefit of one beverage type observed in some studies. For example, several early studies found that people who prefer wine tend to have higher incomes, have more formal education, smoke less, and eat more [fruit and vegetables](fruit-vegetables) and less [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) than people who prefer other alcoholic beverages [(47-49)](#reference47). These potential [confounders](../glossary#confounder) should be controlled or adjusted for in the analysis of [observational](../glossary#observational-study) data. Thus, although moderate alcohol consumption has been consistently associated with 20%-30% reductions in CHD risk, it is not yet clear whether drinking a specific type of alcoholic beverage might confer additional cardiovascular benefit. [Ischemic strokes](../glossary#ischemic-stroke), which represent 87% of all strokes, are the result of insufficient blood flow to an area of the brain, which may occur when an artery supplying the brain becomes blocked by a blood clot [(50)](#reference50). [Hemorrhagic strokes](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) occur when a blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into the brain. Although they are less [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) than ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes are generally more severe and contribute disproportionately to overall stroke mortality [(51)](#reference51). Light or moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of ischemic stroke, but not hemorrhagic stroke, in a number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) [(52-58)](#reference52). When results of 19 [prospective cohort](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and 16 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) of alcohol consumption and the risk of stroke were combined in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis), moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke [(59)](#reference59). Overall, those who consumed one or two drinks daily had a 28% lower risk of ischemic stroke than those who did not consume alcohol. Another meta-analysis of more recent studies (1980-2009) confirmed that moderate alcohol consumption was protective against only ischemic stroke in both men and women [(60)](#reference60). A more recent meta-analysis of 27 prospective cohort studies found that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption (<15 grams/day) in women was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic ( [RR](../glossary#relative-risk), 0.72) but not hemorrhagic stroke; moderate alcohol consumption (15-30 grams/day) was not linked to either type of stroke in men in this analysis [(61)](#reference61). Thus, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption appears to decrease risk of ischemic stroke, but not hemorrhagic stroke, likely due to the anti-thrombotic effect of alcohol. Just as [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) of the arteries supplying the heart muscle leads to [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease), atherosclerosis of the arteries of the extremities leads to [peripheral arterial disease](../glossary#peripheral-arterial-disease) (PAD). When atherosclerosis is severe enough to diminish blood flow to the legs, even walking may result in leg or hip pain known as [intermittent claudication](../glossary#intermittent-claudication) [(62)](#reference62). Impaired vascular endothelial function is also characteristic of the disease and may contribute to the clinical symptoms [(63)](#reference63). Although much less consistent than the evidence for heart disease and [stroke](../glossary#stroke), there is limited evidence that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with decreased risk of PAD. Four [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have found moderate alcohol consumption to be associated with significant decreases in several different indicators of PAD [(64-67)](#reference64). One of these studies found that the inverse association between alcohol intake and PAD risk was significant in nonsmokers but not smokers, suggesting that the adverse effects of cigarette smoking on PAD risk may outweigh any protective effects of alcohol consumption [(64)](#reference64). [Coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) is a major cause of heart failure. A prospective study in a cohort of 21,601 men and another in a cohort of 126,236 men and women found that moderate alcohol intake was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with heart failure, especially heart disease related to CHD [(68, 69)](#reference68). More recently, in a cohort of 4,490 older adults (65 years or older at baseline) followed for more than 20 years (1,380 cases of heart failure), drinking one or more alcoholic drink per week was associated with a 26% lower risk of heart failure compared to abstainers [(70)](#reference70). While several studies have found that heavy alcohol consumption increases [risk](../glossary#risk) of sudden cardiac death (SCD; see [below](#arrhythmias-sudden-cardiac-death)), the association of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption and SCD is less clear. Studies on this association have reported mixed results, but the two largest prospective cohort studies to date have found a lower risk of SCD with light-to-moderate alcohol consumption [(71, 72)](#reference71). Three [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) have found a U-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and incidence of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), with greater protection being observed for women [(73-75)](#reference73). The most recent meta-analysis included 20 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and associated moderate alcohol consumption (22-25 grams of alcohol daily or 1.6-1.8 drinks/day) with a 40% [risk](../glossary#risk) reduction for women and a 13% risk reduction for men compared to lifetime alcohol abstainers [(74)](#reference74). Heavy alcohol consumption (62 grams/day or 4.4. drinks/day for men and 51 grams/day or 3.6 drinks/day for women) was associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes [(74)](#reference74). Increased [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion by the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) and decreased [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) are important factors leading to the development of type 2 diabetes. Research suggests that moderate alcohol intake may decrease [serum](../glossary#serum) insulin levels, increase adiponectin (an adipocyte hormone [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with type 2 diabetes) levels [(25)](#reference25), and improve insulin sensitivity [(76-79)](#reference76). On the other hand, heavy alcohol consumption may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by contributing to obesity, especially abdominal obesity, disturbing [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), and/or impairing pancreatic or liver function [(80)](#reference80). [Osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis), a condition common among the elderly, results from progressive loss of [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD). Several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have associated light or moderate alcohol consumption with higher BMD in older adults compared to abstainers [(81-91)](#reference81). Some studies have found stronger protective relationships among wine [(89)](#reference89) or beer drinkers [(89, 90)](#reference89) in comparison to those who consume liquor, suggesting that non-alcohol components (e.g., silicon in beer) might help explain the association. The effects of alcohol on bone health may also be dependent on age, gender, and hormonal status (reviewed in [92](#reference92)). It is important to note that the available data come from observational studies, and the observed associations may be [confounded](../glossary#confounder), e.g., individuals who consume alcohol in moderation may have an overall healthier lifestyle than those who drink heavily or abstain. However, a recent study in perimenopausal women found that moderate alcohol intake was associated with improved BMD independent of various lifestyle factors, including smoking status, [fruit and vegetable](fruit-vegetables) intake, and physical activity level [(90)](#reference90). Although alcoholism and heavy alcohol consumption (>3-4 drinks/day) is known to increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment and [dementia](../glossary#dementia) [(93-95)](#reference93), recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) and reviews have reported that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption in older adults is associated with a decreased risk of dementia and [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) when compared to abstention [(93](#reference93), [96, 97)](#reference96). Some meta-analyses have not found a significant reduced risk for vascular type dementia [(96, 98)](#reference96) or for cognitive decline [(93](#reference93), [96](#reference96), [98, 99)](#reference98). A few studies have suggested that consumption of wine may be especially protective against dementia, although inconsistent findings have been observed, and many studies have not distinguished among the various types of alcohol. At least three [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) have used [magnetic resonance imaging](../glossary#magnetic-resonance-imaging) (MRI) to examine relationships between alcohol intake and [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) abnormalities in the brains of healthy middle-aged or older adults. Two studies found that infarctions (areas of dead tissue) were less frequent in the brains of those reporting light or moderate alcohol intake compared to those who abstained from alcohol [(100, 101)](#reference100). However, another study found no relationship between alcohol intake and the presence of infarction [(102)](#reference102). Two of the studies measuring brain [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy), a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and alcoholic dementia, found brain atrophy to be lower in those who abstained from alcohol compared to alcohol consumers [(100, 102)](#reference100). The other study found less brain atrophy with light-to-moderate alcohol consumption but only in carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele, who are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease [(101)](#reference101). Because of the complex nature of alcohol's effects on the brain, further research is needed to determine the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption with respect to cognitive function and dementia. The majority of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [(103-107)](#reference103) and [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) [(108, 109)](#reference108) have found that men and women with moderate alcohol intakes have lower [risks](../glossary#risk) of [gallstones](../glossary#gallstones) or [gallbladder](../glossary#gallbladder) surgery (cholecystectomy) than those who do not consume alcohol. Although the reasons for the consistent [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between moderate alcohol consumption and gallstone incidence are not entirely clear, regular alcohol intake may result in [bile](../glossary#bile) that is less likely to crystallize into gallstones or stimulate gallbladder emptying [(106)](#reference106). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a continuum of developmental abnormalities resulting from [gestational](../glossary#gestation) alcohol exposure; FASD may affect as many as 1%-2% of US children [(110, 111)](#reference110). Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) \u2014 a severe FASD \u2014 is a cluster of physical and mental birth defects associated with heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Some characteristics of FAS include facial abnormalities, mental retardation, and growth impairment. More moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy (7-14 drinks/week) has been associated with more subtle effects on [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) and behavioral development [(112, 113)](#reference112). Children of mothers who drank moderately during pregnancy have been found to have problems with memory, attention and learning, and behavior [(114)](#reference114). Overall, studies on the association of low-to-moderate drinking during pregnancy and mental health of offspring have reported mixed results (reviewed in [115](#reference115)). However, it is important to note that these studies are [observational](../glossary#observational-study) in nature and may have not adequately controlled for potential [confounding](../glossary#confounder) factors (e.g., lifestyle differences [in women who drank alcohol during pregnancy versus those who abstained] that influence mental development) [(115)](#reference115). Since no safe level of alcohol consumption has been established at any stage of pregnancy, pregnant women and women who are planning a pregnancy should abstain from alcohol [(116, 117)](#reference116). More than 100 [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have been completed on the association between alcohol consumption and female breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer), with most finding an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) [(118-121)](#reference118). Even though the available data come from observational studies, many consider the association to be causal. Regular alcohol consumption as low as one or two drinks per day has been associated with modest but significant increases in breast cancer risk. A threshold for harm, however, is difficult to define due to potential underreporting of alcohol intake by heavy drinkers, which could result in heavy drinkers being misclassified as 'moderate alcohol consumers' [(122)](#reference122). A linear dose-dependent relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk has been observed for premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer regardless of the type of alcoholic beverage consumed. Pooled and [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) have found that each 10-gram increase in daily alcohol consumption (slightly less than one drink) is associated with a 7%-10% increased risk of breast cancer in women [(123-125)](#reference123). Studies of alcohol consumption and breast cancer-specific mortality have reported mixed results, with a recent meta-analysis of 25 prospective cohort studies finding an increased risk only with alcohol consumption in excess of 20 grams (1.4 drinks)/day [(126)](#reference126). Moderate alcohol consumption has been consistently associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (see [Mortality](#mortality) above). Although the mechanisms for the consistent association between alcohol intake and breast cancer incidence have not been clearly identified, proposed mechanisms include acetaldehyde formation, induction of CYP2E1 metabolism and increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), increased circulating [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) or androgen levels, and enhanced invasiveness of breast cancer cells [(119](#reference119), [127)](#reference127). Current estimates are that about one in eight women (12.4%) in the US will develop breast cancer at some point in her lifetime [(128)](#reference128). Although there are many risk factors for breast cancer, alcohol consumption is one of only a few modifiable risk factors. Alcohol interferes with the absorption, transport, and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of folate, which is required for [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [methylation](../glossary#methylation) and DNA repair (see the article on [Folate](../vitamins/folate)). Alterations in these processes may result in [mutations](../glossary#mutation) or altered [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), which increase the risk of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(118)](#reference118). Several [(129-134)](#reference129), but not all [(135-139)](#reference135), studies have found that sufficient folate intake may modify the association between alcohol intake and breast cancer risk. Although the interactions between folate, alcohol, and breast cancer risk remain to be clarified, it makes sense for women who drink alcohol to take a daily multivitamin containing 400 g of folic acid. Some people, such as recovering alcoholics and those with family histories of alcohol abuse or alcoholism, may not be able to maintain moderate drinking habits. Susceptibility to alcoholism is affected by genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors. Children of an alcoholic parent have been found to be at significantly higher risk of developing alcoholism than those without an alcoholic parent [(140)](#reference140). This increase in risk is likely related to interactions between genetic factors and factors related to the family environment. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends that people with a family history of alcoholism, especially in a parent, approach moderate drinking carefully [(141)](#reference141). In the liver, alcohol is metabolized by the same [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) as many medications. Therefore, alcohol consumption can affect the activation or breakdown of a number of medications. The consumption of alcohol may also increase sedation, drowsiness, and hypotensive effects caused by numerous prescription and over-the-counter medications. Although serious interactions between alcohol and medications are more common in the presence of heavy alcohol consumption, even moderate alcohol consumption may hypothetically increase the risk of some adverse reactions in susceptible people [(142)](#reference142). Women and older adults are particularly at [risk](../glossary#risk) for interactions between alcohol and medications [(143, 144)](#reference143). Many different classes of prescription medication may interact adversely with alcohol, including antibiotics, [anticonvulsants](../glossary#anticonvulsant), [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant) (e.g., Coumadin), antidepressants, antidiabetic pain relievers. Over-the-counter medications and herbal preparations may also interact with alcohol, including pain medications like aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and medications like cimetidine and herbal preparations like chamomile, valerian, and kava. To help avoid potentially serious interactions between alcohol and medications, make sure your health care provider is aware of your alcohol intake. Before taking prescription or over-the-counter medications, read the product warning labels or consult a pharmacist or health care provider to determine whether alcohol consumption increases the risk of adverse effects. It may, in general, be advisable to separate taking any medication and drinking alcohol by two to three hours. For more information on potentially serious interactions between alcohol and medications, see the [National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism website](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa27.htm). None Heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). See [above](#pregnancy). Heavy alcohol consumption has been consistently associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of high blood pressure ( [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension)) review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 prospective cohort studies found consuming 50 grams (3.6 drinks)/day of alcohol was associated with a 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold higher risk of hypertension in men and women, respectively; alcohol intake at twice that level (100 grams (~7 drinks)/day) was associated with a [relative risk](../glossary#relative-risk) of 2.5 for men and 2.8 for women [(148)](#reference148). The results of numerous [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) indicate that reducing alcohol intake lowers blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive individuals. A meta-analysis that combined the results of 15 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that reducing alcohol consumption resulted in significant decreases in both [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) [(149)](#reference149). [Ischemic strokes](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) are the result of insufficient blood flow to an area of the brain, which may occur when an artery supplying the brain becomes blocked by a blood clot. [Hemorrhagic strokes](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) occur when a blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into the brain. Although regular, moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of ischemic stroke in some studies, heavy alcohol consumption has been associated with increased risk of both ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that combined the results of 19 [prospective cohort](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and 16 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found that heavy drinking more than doubled the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and increased the risk of ischemic stroke by 70% [(59)](#reference59). A meta-analysis of recent studies (1980-2009) confirmed that heavy drinking is associated with increased risks of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in both men and women [(60)](#reference60). Heavy alcohol consumption may increase the risk of stroke by contributing to [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) (heart muscle damage), cardiac rhythm disturbances, and [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) (clotting) disorders and impaired [hemostasis](../glossary#hemostasis). The long-recognized association between bouts of heavy alcohol consumption and cardiac rhythm disturbances ( [arrhythmias](../glossary#arrhythmia)) was called \"holiday heart syndrome\" because it was first described in people who were admitted to hospitals after holidays or weekends [(150)](#reference150). [Atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) is the cardiac arrhythmia most commonly associated with heavy alcohol use [(151, 152)](#reference151). A 2010 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) found a dose-dependent association between daily alcohol consumption and [risk](../glossary#risk) of this type of cardiac arrhythmia, with an increased risk being found with consumption greater than 24 grams/day (1.7 drinks/day) for women and 36 grams/day (2.6 drinks/day) for men [(153)](#reference153). A 2014 meta-analysis of seven [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that consumption of more than two drinks per day was associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation in men and women, and the risk increased by 8% with each additional daily drink [(154, 155)](#reference154). Additionally, several studies have found that heavy alcohol consumption (>5 drinks per day) increases risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) [(156, 157)](#reference156). The ways by which alcohol may trigger arrhythmias and SCD are not fully known. Alcohol may interfere with the contractility of heart muscle cells, change the shape and structure of heart muscle cells, contribute to [electrolyte](../glossary#electrolytes) imbalance, and/or induce [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) [(158)](#reference158). Alcoholic [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) is a heart muscle disease caused by long-term, heavy alcohol consumption [(159)](#reference159); this disease likely occurs in only a small proportion (<10%) of heavy drinkers [(160)](#reference160). Alcoholic cardiomyopathy occurs in two stages: (1) an early asymptomatic stage, when the damage to the heart muscle has no obvious symptoms; and (2) a symptomatic stage, when the heart muscle is too weak to pump effectively. Although the level of alcohol consumption resulting in alcoholic cardiomyopathy has not been clearly established, people consuming at least seven alcoholic drinks daily for more than five years are thought to be at risk of developing asymptomatic alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Those who continue to drink heavily ultimately develop heart failure. Research suggests that women may be more susceptible to alcohol's toxic effects on the heart muscle than men [(161, 162)](#reference161). Chronic excessive alcohol use is a major cause of illness and death from liver disease [(163)](#reference163). Alcoholic liver disease is characterized by a spectrum of liver injury, including [steatosis](../glossary#steatosis) (fatty liver), [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis) (a potentially fatal [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the liver), fibrosis, and [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) \u2014 the most advanced form of alcoholic liver disease. In cirrhosis, the formation of fibrotic scar tissue results in progressive deterioration of liver function. Complications of advanced liver disease include severe bleeding from distended veins in the [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus) (esophageal varices), brain damage (hepatic encephalopathy), fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites), and kidney failure. A 2004 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine studies found a dose-responsive increase in risk for liver cirrhosis with increasing amounts of alcohol consumed: [relative risks](../glossary#relative-risk) (RR) of 2.9 for 25 grams (1.8 drinks)/day, 7.1 for 50 grams (3.6 drinks)/day, 26.5 for 100 grams (7.1 drinks)/day [(164)](#reference164). Another meta-analysis found a higher RR for liver cirrhosis with increasing doses but also suggested a threshold response for morbidity from liver cirrhosis (higher risk in women with consumption >24 g (1.7 drinks)/day of alcohol, and higher risk in men with consumption >36 g (2.6 drinks)/day of alcohol) [(165)](#reference165). Risk of mortality from liver cirrhosis was increased with any alcohol consumption in women and with consumption of >12 g (0.9 drinks)/day in men; a stronger relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality from liver cirrhosis versus morbidity might be expected because alcohol consumption is known to exacerbate any existing liver disease [(165)](#reference165). Serious liver disease has been found to develop in approximately 10% of those who consume more than 60 grams per day of alcohol (4.3 drinks/day). Women are more susceptible to serious alcoholic liver disease than men [(165, 166)](#reference165), and individuals with hepatitis C infection have an increased risk of alcoholic liver disease [(167)](#reference167). Heavy alcohol consumption has been found to increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) at a number of sites [(168)](#reference168). Heavy alcohol consumption is consistently and dose-dependently associated with increases in risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, [larynx](../glossary#larynx), [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus), liver, [colon](../glossary#colon), [rectum](../glossary#rectum), and breast [(165)](#reference165). Moreover, the combination of smoking and alcohol results in even more dramatic increases in cancer risks [(169)](#reference169). Increased risk of liver cancer with long-term heavy alcohol consumption may be related to alcoholic [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) of the liver or increased susceptibility to cancer caused by [viral](../glossary#virus) [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis). Chronic heavy alcohol use and alcohol dependence are associated with detrimental effects on the brain and its function, especially memory and [executive functions](../glossary#executive-function) [(170)](#reference170). Alcoholics have been observed to suffer from [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) (shrinkage of brain tissue), which likely contributes to alcohol-associated [dementia](../glossary#dementia) and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment [(94)](#reference94). In contrast to the cerebral atrophy observed in [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease), alcohol-related cerebral atrophy may decrease after a period of abstinence. Alcohol-related brain disorders may be associated with nutritional deficiencies like [thiamin](../vitamins/thiamin) [(171)](#reference171) or [niacin](../vitamins/niacin) [(172)](#reference172). Pancreatitis is a painful [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas). Acute pancreatitis is characterized by the sudden onset of severe upper abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting [(173)](#reference173). Although most attacks of acute pancreatitis require only supportive care, a small percentage of people may experience serious or life-threatening complications. Studies estimate that 19%-32% of acute pancreatitis cases have an alcoholic [etiology](../glossary#etiology) (reviewed in [174](#reference174)). Chronic pancreatitis results in progressive destruction of the pancreas, leading to loss of pancreatic function [(175)](#reference175). An estimated 60%-72% of chronic pancreatitis cases have an alcoholic etiology. The risk of developing chronic pancreatitis increases with the quantity and duration of alcohol consumed: an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis is observed with long-term consumption of five or more alcoholic drinks per day [(174)](#reference174). Only a small percentage (<10%) of alcoholics develop clinical pancreatitis; thus, hereditary and environmental factors are also thought to play a role. The disease is more common in men than in women, in Blacks compared to Whites, and in smokers versus nonsmokers [(176, 177)](#reference176). Chronic alcoholism has deleterious effects on [bone health](../micronutrients-health/bone-health), including decreased [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) and increased risk of [fracture](../glossary#fracture). Consumption of large quantities of alcohol (100-200 grams/day) directly impairs activity of [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) \u2014 the bone-forming cells. Negative effects on bone health are also indirectly caused by the malnutrition experienced by alcoholics [(92)](#reference92). Alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of injury in a number of circumstances, including motor vehicle accidents, falls, and fires [(178)](#reference178). Data from hospital emergency departments indicate that consuming as little as one or two alcoholic drinks in the previous six hours significantly increases the risk of injury [(179)](#reference179). Thirty-one percent of all traffic fatalities in the US are alcohol-related [(180)](#reference180). Although the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers is 0.08 (grams of alcohol/deciliter of blood) in the US, most scientific studies have found significant impairment of driving-related skills at a BAC of 0.05 [(181)](#reference181). For reference, a BAC of 0.05 might be achieved by a 175-pound male consuming three standard alcoholic drinks in one hour or a 120-pound female consuming two drinks in one hour [(182)](#reference182). Excessive alcohol use is associated with all forms of violence, including suicide, homicide, domestic violence, sexual assault, and gang violence. Although the reasons for alcohol-associated violence are complex, alcohol use appears to increase the risk of violent behavior in some populations [(183)](#reference183). Heavy alcohol consumption increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality [(4](#reference4), [16)](#reference16). As mentioned [above](#mortality), the relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality is often described as J-shaped, meaning those with high intakes of alcohol have a higher risk of mortality than nondrinkers. A 2011 meta-analysis of eight [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that consumption of >60 grams/day of alcohol was associated with a 30% increase in mortality from all causes [(16)](#reference16).

Growth and development during infancy, childhood, and adolescence require special intakes of many micronutrients. Nutritional needs also change throughout the stages of adulthood. For example, micronutrient requirements during pregnancy and lactation are increased, and micronutrient needs of older adults reflect age-related changes in nutrient absorption and metabolism. This section of the site is under development; new articles will be added in the future. Contents The period of childhood between ages 4 and 13 years is characterized by continued physical growth and rapid [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive), emotional, and social development [(1, 2)](#references). Many children, especially girls, undergo their pubertal growth spurt between ages 4 and 13. This period of childhood precedes adolescence \u2014 the transitional stage of development between childhood and adulthood. Due to increased growth and metabolism, the nutritional requirements of children are higher in proportion to body weight compared with adults [(1, 3)](#references). Good nutrition throughout childhood is important not only to support normal growth and cognitive development but also to establish healthy eating patterns that are associated with decreased risk of chronic conditions and diseases in adulthood, including [obesity](../glossary#obesity), type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease), [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome), and [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis). Inadequate intake of nutrients can impair growth and development in children. This article discusses [micronutrient](../glossary#micronutrient) ( [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) and nutritionally essential [minerals](../glossary#mineral)) requirements of children ages 4 to 13 years. The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine establishes dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for each micronutrient; these reference values should be used to plan and assess dietary intakes in healthy people [(4, 5)](#reference4). The DRIs include the estimated average requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)), the recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)), the adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)), and the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)). The RDA, which is the average daily dietary intake level of a nutrient sufficient to meet the requirements of almost all (97.5%) healthy individuals in a specific life stage and gender group, should be used in the planning of diets for individuals [(6)](#reference6). An AI recommendation is set when an RDA cannot be determined. In children, these intake recommendations are based on data regarding average micronutrient intakes of children and also on certain criteria for micronutrient adequacy. However, because of limited data, many of the micronutrient intake recommendations for children are extrapolated from recommendations for adults using a formula that accounts for metabolic body weight and growth [(3)](#reference3). Metabolic body weight is determined by calculating the 0.75 power of body mass (body mass^0.75) [(7)](#reference7). To account for growth, the equation used to derive an RDA or AI involves an age group-specific growth factor [(3)](#reference3). The FNB establishes separate dietary intake recommendations for children between the ages of 4 to 8 years and those between the ages of 9 and 13 years (see [Ages 4 to 8 Years](#ages-4-to-8-years) and [Ages 9 to 13 Years](#ages-9-to-13-years)). For each [micronutrient](../glossary#micronutrient), the FNB sets an [RDA](../glossary#RDA) or [AI](../glossary#AI) for children ages 4 to 8 years; these micronutrient intake recommendations do not differ with gender for this age group. Table 1 lists the RDA for each micronutrient. As mentioned above, the RDA should be used in the planning of diets for individuals. A few select micronutrient requirements for children are discussed [below](#vitamins). |Micronutrient||Males and Females| 12 g/day the FNB sets an [RDA](../glossary#RDA) or [AI](../glossary#AI) for children ages 9 to 13 years; these recommendations are gender specific to account for the unique nutritional needs of boys and girls as they undergo puberty. Table 2 lists the RDA for each micronutrient by gender. The RDA should be used in the planning of diets for individuals. A more detailed discussion of the requirements of certain micronutrients for children can be found [below](#vitamins). [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that is essential for growth and development, normal vision, the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of selected [genes](../glossary#gene), and [immunity](../micronutrients-health/immunity) (see the article on [Vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A#function)). Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem worldwide. It is the leading preventable cause of blindness among children in developing nations [(8)](#reference8). The earliest evidence of vitamin A deficiency is impaired dark adaptation or night blindness. Mild vitamin A deficiency may result in Bitot's spots, which are changes in the conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that lines the eyelids and the outer surface of the eye). Severe or prolonged vitamin A deficiency causes a condition called xerophthalmia (dry eye), characterized by changes in the cells of the [cornea](../glossary#cornea) (clear covering of the eye) that ultimately result in corneal ulcers, scarring, and blindness [(9, 10)](#reference9). Vitamin A deficiency also places children at a heightened risk for infectious disease; in fact, vitamin A deficiency can be considered a nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency disorder [(11)](#reference11). Even children who are only mildly deficient in vitamin A have a higher incidence of respiratory disease and diarrhea, as well as a higher rate of mortality from infectious disease, compared to children who consume sufficient vitamin A [(12)](#reference12). Vitamin A supplementation in children has been found to decrease both the severity and incidence of deaths related to diarrhea and measles in developing countries, where vitamin A deficiency is common [(13)](#reference13). The onset of infection reduces blood retinol (preformed vitamin A) levels very rapidly. This phenomenon is generally believed to be related to decreased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of retinol binding protein (RBP) by the liver. In this manner, infection stimulates a vicious cycle, because inadequate vitamin A nutritional status is related to increased severity and likelihood of death from infectious disease [(14)](#reference14). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A is based on the amount needed to ensure adequate stores (four months) of vitamin A in the body to support normal reproductive function, immune function, vitamin A-dependent [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), and vision [(15)](#reference15). Vitamin A intake recommendations for children were derived by extrapolating the recommendation for adults using metabolic body weight, accounting for growth. The RDA for children ages 4 to 8 years is 400 g/day of [Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE)](../vitamins/vitamin-A#RAE), which is 1,333 international units (IU); the RDA for both boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 600 g/day of RAE, which is equivalent to 2,000 IU. For information on vitamin A content in foods, see the article on [Vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A#food-sources). Vitamin B12 is needed for two sorts of reactions in the human body. One is transmethylation (methyl transfer between two molecules) that leads to the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine). Methionine, in turn, is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor used in many biological [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, such as the methylation of sites within [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [RNA](../glossary#RNA) [(16)](#reference16). The second sort of reaction is [isomerization](../glossary#isomer) (rearrangement of a molecule). Vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an important step for the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [lipids](../glossary#lipid). Both transmethylation and isomerization reactions are essential for the metabolism of components of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath of nerve cells and for the metabolism of [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter). Accordingly, vitamin B12 deficiency damages the myelin sheath covering cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves, resulting in [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) damage [(17, 18)](#reference17). The myelin sheath is the insulating layer of tissue made up of lipids and proteins that surrounds nerve fibers. This sheath acts as a conduit in an electrical system, allowing rapid and efficient transmission of [nerve impulses](../glossary#nerve-impulse) [(19)](#reference19). In some cases, neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency can be reversed by vitamin treatment [(18)](#reference18), but reversibility seems to be dependent upon the duration of the associated neurologic complications [(20)](#reference20). Although myelination primarily occurs during fetal development and early infancy, it continues through childhood, adolescence, and stages of early adulthood [(21, 22)](#reference21). Because of the role of vitamin B12 in myelination and other metabolic processes, it is important for children to meet dietary intake recommendations. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of vitamin B12 for children ages 4 to 8 years is 1.2 g/day, and the RDA for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 1.8 g/day. This vitamin is naturally present only in animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish (including shellfish), and to a lesser extent in milk, but it is not generally present in plant products or yeast [(9)](#reference9). Thus, children who have vegan diets need supplemental vitamin B12 or need adequate intake from fortified foods. [Vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) has a number of important roles during growth and development, including being required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [collagen](../glossary#collagen), [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), and [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) [(23)](#reference23). Vitamin C is also a highly effective antioxidant and is important for immunity (see the article on [Immunity](../micronutrients-health/immunity#vitamin-C)). Further, vitamin C strongly enhances the absorption of non [heme](../glossary#heme) iron by reducing dietary ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+) and forming an absorbable, iron-ascorbic acid complex. Specifically, iron absorption is 2- to 3-fold higher with co-ingestion of 25 to 75 mg of vitamin C [(24)](#reference24). This has special relevance to child health, considering the fact that iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in the world (see [Iron](children#iron) below). Vitamin C intake recommendations for children are extrapolated from recommendations for adults based on relative body weight. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for children ages 4 to 8 years is 25 mg/day, and the RDA for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 45 mg/day [(25)](#reference25). For information on food sources, see the article on [Vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C#food-sources). [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) is a fat-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that is essential for maintaining normal [calcium](../minerals/calcium) metabolism and is thus necessary for bone health. Severe vitamin D deficiency in infants and children results in the failure of bone to mineralize, leading to a condition known as [rickets](../glossary#rickets). Rapidly growing bones are most severely affected by rickets. The growth plates of bones continue to enlarge, but in the absence of adequate mineralization, weight-bearing limbs (arms and legs) become bowed. In severe cases of vitamin D deficiency, low [serum](../glossary#serum) calcium levels (hypocalcemia) may induce seizures. Although [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of foods has led to complacency regarding vitamin D deficiency, nutritional rickets is still being reported in the United States and other nations [(26-33)](#reference26). In the US, fortified foods are a major contributor to dietary vitamin D intake, especially in children, because only a few foods naturally contain vitamin D (see the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D#food-sources)). In the US, milk is voluntarily fortified with 400 IU (10 g) of vitamin D per quart (946 mL) [(34)](#reference34), and other foods may be fortified with varying concentrations of vitamin D. According to a recent report regarding the American food supply, nearly all milk, about 75% of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, around 50% of milk substitutes, about 25% of yogurts, and 8-14% of juices, cheeses, and spreads are fortified with vitamin D [(35)](#reference35). Although not required by the US FDA to be listed on the Nutrition Facts food label, some packaged foods, particularly cereals, include the amount of vitamin D in one serving as the percentage of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)). The DV is 400 IU, but the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for children ages 4 to 8 years and for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 600 IU/day. In Canada, vitamin D fortification of milk and margarine is mandatory, with milk containing 35-45 IU per 100 mL (331-426 IU per quart) and margarine containing 530 IU per 100 grams [(34)](#reference34), but vitamin D fortification of foods is less common in European nations [(36)](#reference36). In addition to diet, vitamin D can be [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) synthesized in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation from sunlight; however, sunscreens effectively block synthesis of vitamin D in skin (see the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D#food-sources)). When setting the RDA for vitamin D, the FNB assumed minimal sun exposure, even though sun exposure could provide most people with their entire vitamin D requirement. For US children to meet the RDA of 600 IU/day (15 g/day), about 6 cups of milk would need to be consumed each day. Analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 found that average total vitamin D intakes (from diet and supplements combined) in US children of ages 4 to 8 were 9.3 g/day (372 IU/day) for boys and 7.9 g/day (316 IU/day) for girls [(37)](#reference37). Even though the analysis found that 43% of boys and 34% of girls in this age group took supplements containing vitamin D [(37)](#reference37), their average total daily intakes were well below the current RDA of 600 IU/day (15 g/day). Total daily vitamin D intakes were even lower for chilren aged 9 to 13 years (boys, 7.5 g or 300 IU/day; girls, 7.7 g or 308 IU/day). Sun exposure can substantially affect body vitamin D levels, and measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D \u2014 the major circulating form of vitamin D \u2014 is a useful indicator of vitamin D status. It is assumed that a dietary intake of 600 IU/day results in a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL), which the FNB considers as the cut-point for vitamin D adequacy [(38)](#reference38). However, higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels may benefit health; thus, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that children ages 4 to 13 years should have a daily intake of 600 to 1,000 IU (15 to 25 g) of vitamin D, consistent with the recommendations of the Endocrine Society [(39)](#reference39). Given the average vitamin D content of the diets of children, supplementation may be necessary to meet these recommendations. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently suggests that all children receive 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily [(26)](#reference26) \u2014 an amount that is typically found in multivitamin supplements. The tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) \u2014 the highest level of daily intake of a specific nutrient likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects in almost all individuals \u2014 for children ages 4 to 8 years is 3,000 IU/day (75 g/day) of vitamin D; the UL for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 4,000 IU (100 g/day). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) in children, expressed as an amount of the -tocopherol form of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), was based on extrapolations from intake recommendations for adults, accounting for differences in lean body mass and increased needs of growth during childhood. The RDA is 7 mg/day (10.5 IU/day) for children ages 4 to 8 years and 11 mg/day (16.5 IU/day) for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years [(40)](#reference40). A US national survey, NHANES 1999-2000, found that children ages 4 to 8 years had an average intake of 5.2 mg/day of -tocopherol; this survey found that average -tocopherol intakes for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years were 6.0 mg/day and 5.3 mg/day, respectively [(41)](#reference41). These intakes are below the current RDA. Surveys in The Republic of Korea and Germany have also reported low intakes of vitamin E in children [(42, 43)](#reference42). However, true vitamin E deficiency is rare and has been observed only in cases of severe malnutrition, genetic defects affecting the -tocopherol protein, and fat [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome); see the article on [Vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E#deficiency). About 99% of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) in the body is found in bones and teeth [(44)](#reference44). Adequate intake of calcium throughout childhood and adolescence is important for proper mineralization of growing bones, attainment of peak bone mass, and reduction of risk for [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) in adulthood [(38)](#reference38). Thus, dietary intake recommendations for calcium in children are established based on the calcium intake needed to support bone accretion and overall calcium retention (i.e., the dietary intake needed to achieve positive calcium balance) [(38)](#reference38). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) is 1,000 mg/day for children ages 4 to 8 years and 1,300 mg/day for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years. Calcium intake recommendations are higher in children ages 9 to 13 to account for increased needs of the [mineral](../glossary#mineral) during puberty [(38)](#reference38). Many American children have dietary calcium intakes below current recommendations, with girls having lower intakes than boys. A recent study reported daily calcium intake in children using data from NHANES 2003-2006, a US national survey [(37)](#reference37). An estimated 17% of boys and 33% of girls between the ages of 4 and 8 have total calcium intakes (dietary plus supplemental intakes) of 800 mg/day or less. For children in this age group, average intake from supplements in those who took supplemental calcium (29% of boys; 26% of girls) was 99 mg/day and 87 mg/day for boys and girls, respectively. In children 9 to 13 years old, only 23% of boys and 15% of girls met the RDA for calcium, even though 20% of boys and 24% of girls took supplemental calcium (average supplemental calcium intake of 104 mg/day for boys and 80 mg/day for girls) [(37)](#reference37). Dairy products, which provide about 72% of the calcium in the American diet [(44)](#reference44), represent rich and absorbable sources of calcium. Milk contains 300 mg of calcium per cup; therefore, children ages 4 to 8 and children ages 9 to 13 could meet the RDA for calcium by drinking 3.3 or 4.3 cups of milk daily, respectively. Certain vegetables and grains also provide calcium, but their bioavailability is lower compared with dairy. For more information on dietary sources of calcium and calcium bioavailability, see the article on [Calcium](../minerals/calcium#food-sources). If children do not meet the RDA through diet alone, LPI recommends supplemental calcium. Children's multivitamin/mineral supplements generally provide no more than 150 mg of calcium. The Nutrition Facts label of packaged foods lists calcium content in one serving as a percent of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)), with the DV being 1,000 mg. Since the RDA for children ages 4 to 8 is 1,000 mg/day, the listed amount of calcium on the food label directly provides a percentage of the RDA. However, because the RDA for children ages 9 to 13 years is higher, the percentage of the DV listed would be an overestimation of the percentage of the RDA. The [mineral](../glossary#mineral) [fluoride](../minerals/fluoride) is important for the prevention of [dental caries](../glossary#dental-caries) (tooth decay). Specific cariogenic (cavity-causing) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) found in dental plaque are capable of [metabolizing](../glossary#metabolism) certain [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) (sugars) and converting them to organic acids that can dissolve tooth enamel. If unchecked, the bacteria may penetrate deeper layers of the tooth and progress into the soft pulp tissue at the center. Untreated caries can lead to severe pain, local infection, tooth loss or extraction, nutritional problems, and serious systemic infections in susceptible individuals [(45)](#reference45). Increased fluoride exposure, most commonly through water fluoridation, has been found to decrease dental caries [(46)](#reference46). Fluoride consumed in water appears to have a systemic effect in children before teeth erupt, as well as a topical (surface) effect in children and adults after teeth have erupted. The FNB set an adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) recommendation based on estimated intakes (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) that have been shown to reduce the occurrence of dental caries most effectively without causing the unwanted side effect of tooth enamel mottling, a white speckling or mottling of the permanent teeth known as dental fluorosis [(47)](#reference47). The AI of fluoride for children ages 4 to 8 years is 1 mg/day, and the AI for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 2 mg/day. For information about sources of fluoride, see the article on [Fluoride](../minerals/fluoride). Additionally, fluoridated toothpastes are very effective in preventing dental caries but add considerably to fluoride intake of children, especially young children who are more likely to swallow toothpaste. Researchers estimate that children under 6 years of age ingest an average of 0.3 mg of fluoride from toothpaste with each brushing, and swallowing fluoride-containing toothpaste is a major source of excess fluoride intake in this age group. Children who ingest more than two or three times the recommended fluoride intake are at increased risk of dental fluorosis. To prevent dental fluorosis while providing optimum protection from tooth decay, it is recommended that parents supervise children under 6 years of age while brushing with fluoridated toothpaste. In addition to discouraging the swallowing of toothpaste, children should be encouraged to use no more than a pea-size application of toothpaste and to rinse their mouths with water after brushing [(47, 48)](#reference47). Fluoride supplements, available only by prescription, are intended for children living in areas with low water fluoride concentrations for the purpose of bringing their intake to approximately 1 mg/day [(47)](#reference47). For more information about dental fluorosis, see the article on [Fluoride](../minerals/fluoride#safety). [Iodine](../minerals/iodine) is required for (T3) and thyroxine (T4). To meet the body's demand for thyroid hormones, the thyroid gland traps iodine from the blood and incorporates it into thyroid hormones that are stored and released into the circulation when needed. In target tissues, such as the liver and the brain, T3, the physiologically active thyroid hormone, can bind to thyroid [receptors](../glossary#receptor) in the nuclei of cells and regulate [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression). In target tissues, T4, the most abundant circulating thyroid hormone, can be converted to T3 by [selenium](../minerals/selenium)-containing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) known as deiodinases. In this manner, thyroid hormones regulate a number of physiologic processes, including growth, development, [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), and reproductive function [(49, 50)](#reference49). Iodine deficiency is now accepted as the most common cause of preventable brain damage in the world. The spectrum of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) includes mental retardation, [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism), [goiter](../glossary#goiter), and varying degrees of other growth and developmental abnormalities [(49, 51)](#reference49). Iodine deficiency is associated with goiter; the incidence of goiter is higher in girls than boys. Children in iodine-deficient areas show poorer school performance, lower IQs, and a higher incidence of learning disabilities than matched groups from iodine-sufficient areas. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 studies concluded that iodine deficiency alone lowered mean IQ scores in children by 13.5 points [(52, 53)](#reference52). Global estimates indicate that 31.5% of children between the ages of 6 and 12 years (266 million total children) has insufficient iodine intake [(54)](#reference54). Major international efforts have produced dramatic improvements in the correction of iodine deficiency in the 1990s, mainly through the use of iodized salt in iodine-deficient countries [(55)](#reference55). Today, 70% of households in the world use iodized salt [(57)](#reference57), but iodine deficiency in children is still a major public health concern worldwide [(57-59)](#reference57). For more information on the international effort to eradicate iodine deficiency, visit the websites of the [International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD)](http://ign.org/index.cfm) or the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/idd/en/). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of iodine for children aged 4 to 8 years is 90 g/day, and the RDA for boys and girls aged 9 to 13 years is 120 g/day. The intake recommendation for children in this younger age group was based on results of a [balance study](../glossary#balance-study) in eight-year-old children who did not have goiters [(60)](#reference60). Results of a balance study in children ages 9 to 13 years indicated that a minimum of 55 g/day of iodine is needed [(60)](#reference60), but the RDA for this older age group was set by extrapolating from the adult recommendation based on metabolic body weight [(55)](#reference55). The amount of iodine in iodized salt and the contribution of iodized salt to total iodine intake vary by nation. In the US, iodized salt contains an average of 45 mg of iodine per kilogram and 20% of the salt consumed by Americans is iodized. Salt used in processed foods and the fast food industry is generally not iodized [(61)](#reference61). However, the US is currently considered to be iodine-sufficient [(62)](#reference62). Seafood is rich in iodine because marine animals can concentrate the iodine from seawater, and certain types of seaweed (e.g., wakame) are also very rich in iodine (see [Table 3](../minerals/iodine#food-sources) in the article on Iodine). Dairy products are also relatively good sources of iodine. However, iodine content of plant foods depends on the iodine content of the soil [(63)](#reference63). [Iron](../minerals/iron) is an essential component of hundreds of [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in various aspects of [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), including oxygen transport and storage, [electron transport](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) and energy metabolism, [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and beneficial [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant) functions, oxygen sensing, and [DNA](../glossary#DNA) synthesis [(9](#reference9), [64-68)](#reference64); see the article on [Iron](..minerals/iron#function)). Iron is stored in the body as ferritin, and serum level of ferritin is a good clinical indicator of iron status in children [(69)](#reference69). Iron deficiency, which is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, is a major public health problem, especially in developing nations, but it is also prevalent in industrialized nations. Severe iron deficiency leads to iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia), which affects more than 30% of the global population (2 billion people) [(70)](#reference70). Iron-deficiency anemia results when there is inadequate iron to support normal red blood cell formation. The anemia of iron deficiency is characterized as microcytic and hypochromic, meaning red blood cells are measurably smaller than normal and their [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) content is decreased. At this most severe stage of iron deficiency, symptoms may be a result of inadequate oxygen delivery due to anemia and/or sub-optimal function of iron-dependent enzymes. Low red cell count, low [hematocrit](../glossary#hematocrit), and low hemoglobin concentrations are all used in the clinical diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia [(71)](#reference71). For details regarding the clinical diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia, see Chapter 4 in the book, Nutritional Anemia, which is available through the [Sight and Life](http://www.sightandlife.org/fileadmin/data/Books/Nutritional_anemia_book.pdf) website. Most [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found relationships between iron-deficiency anemia in children and poor [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) development, poor school achievement, and behavior problems. However, it is difficult to separate the effects of iron-deficiency anemia from other types of deprivation in such studies, and confounding factors may contribute to the association between iron deficiency and cognitive deficits [(72)](#reference72). Yet, several possible mechanisms link iron-deficiency anemia to altered [cognition](../glossary#cognition). For example, any cognitive benefit associated with iron supplementation could be possibly due to changes in nerve [myelination](../glossary#myelination), which have been observed in iron-deficient animals [(73)](#reference73). Iron has an important role in the development of the cells that produce [myelin](../glossary#myelin) [(74)](#reference74); as noted above, the myelin sheath is the insulating layer of tissue comprised of lipids and proteins that surrounds nerve fibers. This sheath acts as a conduit in an electrical system, allowing for rapid and efficient transmission of [nerve impulses](../glossary#nerve-impulse) [(19)](#reference19). Iron is also important for enzymes involved in the synthesis of certain neurotransmitters and for DNA synthesis [(75)](#reference75). Children between the ages of 4 and 13 years are at lower risk of iron deficiency compared to younger or older children because infants, toddlers, and adolescents generally have higher growth rates [(9)](#reference9). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of iron for children ages 4 to 8 years is 10 mg/day, and the RDA for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 8 mg/day. Girls in this latter age group who start to menstruate need an additional 2.5 mg/day of iron. These intake recommendations were based on a factorial modeling approach that accounts for the amount of iron needed to replace basal losses (losses in urine, feces, and sweat) and the iron requirements associated with growth (increases in hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying pigment in red blood cells mass; increases in iron content of tissues; and for the younger age group, increases in iron storage). The intake recommendations also account for average [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) (the fraction of iron retained and used by the body) of dietary iron in these age groups [(76)](#reference76). The amount of bioavailable iron in food (or supplements) is influenced by the iron nutritional status of the individual and also by the form of iron ( [heme](../glossary#heme) or nonheme). Individuals who are anemic or iron deficient absorb a larger percentage of the iron they consume (especially nonheme iron) than individuals who are not anemic and have sufficient iron stores [(77, 78)](#reference77). In addition, heme iron, found in meat, poultry, and fish, is more readily absorbed and its absorption is less affected by other dietary factors than nonheme iron \u2014 the form found in plants, dairy products, fortified foods, and supplements. Although heme iron generally accounts for only 10-15% of the iron found in the diet, it may provide up to one third of total absorbed dietary iron [(67](#reference67), [77)](#reference77). The absorption of nonheme iron is strongly influenced by enhancers and inhibitors present in the same meal [(77, 78)](#reference77). For instance, [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) strongly enhances the absorption of nonheme iron by reducing dietary ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+) and forming an absorbable, iron-ascorbic acid complex. Organic acids, such as citric, malic, tartaric, and lactic acids, also enhance nonheme iron absorption. Further, consumption of meat, poultry, and fish enhance nonheme iron absorption, but the mechanism for this increase in absorption is not clear [(76, 77)](#reference76). Inhibitors of nonheme iron absorption include phytic acid, which is present in [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), grains, and rice. In fact, small amounts of phytic acid (5 to 10 mg) can reduce nonheme iron absorption by 50%. The absorption of iron from legumes, such as soybeans, black beans, lentils, mung beans, and split peas, has been shown to be as low as 2% <a href=\">(64, [76)](#reference76). Additionally, polyphenols found in some fruit, vegetables, coffee, tea, wines, and spices can markedly inhibit the absorption of nonheme iron, but this effect is reduced by the presence of vitamin C [(64](#reference64), [76)](#reference76). Soy protein, such as that found in tofu, has an inhibitory effect on iron absorption that is independent of its phytic acid content [(76)](#reference76). The [mineral](../glossary#mineral) [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium) is involved in more than 300 essential metabolic reactions that are generally involved in energy production and the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of in bone, [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), and [chromosomes](../glossary#chromosome) and is also required for various cellular processes, including [ion](../glossary#ion) transport across cell membranes, [cell signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling), and cell migration [(80)](#reference80). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of magnesium for children ages 4 to 8 years, which is 130 mg/day, was derived by extrapolating data from magnesium [balance studies](../glossary#balance-study) in older children [(79)](#reference79). The RDA for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 240 mg/day. This recommendation was based on data from magnesium balance studies in children of this age [(81, 82)](#reference81). Good dietary sources of magnesium include [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) and green leafy vegetables because magnesium is part of chlorophyll \u2014 the green pigment in plants. Meats and milk have an intermediate magnesium content, with milk providing 24-39 mg per cup [(79](#reference79), [83)](#reference83). Refined foods generally have the lowest magnesium content. Analysis of data from the NHANES study found that US children ages 2 to 12 years who consumed three or more daily servings of whole grains had significantly increased magnesium intakes [(84)](#reference84). The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that children should limit their [sodium](../minerals/sodium) intake to 1,500 mg/day to lower blood pressure and thus reduce their risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases in adulthood [(85)](#reference85). In 2004, the FNB set the [AI](../glossary#AI) for children by extrapolating from the adult AI using relative energy intakes. The AI for children 4 to 8 years is 1,000 mg/day, which translates to 2.5 grams of salt per day, and the AI for boys and girls 9 to 13 years is 1,200 mg/day, which translates to 3 grams of salt per day [(86)](#reference86). The [mineral](../glossary#mineral) [zinc](../minerals/zinc) is essential for growth and development, [immune function](../micronutrients-health/immunity#zinc), [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) function, and reproduction. Zinc plays a number of catalytic, structural, and regulatory roles in cellular [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (see the article on [Zinc](../minerals/zinc#function)). Zinc deficiency is a major public health concern and has been estimated to affect more than 2 billion people in less developed nations [(87)](#reference87). Children are at increased risk for zinc deficiency, which can lead to delayed physical growth, impaired immunity, and possibly to delayed mental development. Mild forms of this mineral deficiency, which are common in both developing and developed nations, appear to have negative effects on growth and development [(23](#reference23), [88)](#reference88). However, the lack of a sensitive indicator of mild zinc deficiency hinders the scientific study of its health implications. Mild zinc deficiency contributes to impaired physical growth in children [(88, 89)](#reference88). Significant delays in linear growth and weight gain, known as growth retardation or failure to thrive, are common features of mild zinc deficiency in children. In the 1970s and 1980s, several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies of zinc supplementation in young children with significant growth delays were conducted in Denver, Colorado. Modest zinc supplementation (5.7 mg/day) resulted in increased growth rates compared to placebo [(89)](#reference89). More recently, a number of larger studies in developing countries observed similar results with modest zinc supplementation. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of growth data from zinc intervention trials recently confirmed the widespread occurrence of growth-limiting zinc deficiency in young children, especially in developing countries [(90)](#reference90). Although the exact mechanism for the growth-limiting effects of zinc deficiency are not known, recent research indicates that zinc availability affects [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) systems that coordinate the response to the growth-regulating [hormone](../glossary#hormone), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [(91, 92)](#reference91). Adequate zinc intake in children is essential in maintaining the integrity of the immune system [(23](#reference23), [93)](#reference93), and zinc deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to a variety of infectious agents [(94)](#reference94). The adverse effects of zinc deficiency on immune system function are likely to increase the susceptibility of children to infectious diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea contributes to zinc deficiency and malnutrition. It has been estimated that diarrheal diseases result in the deaths of about 3 million children each year [(95)](#reference95). Zinc supplementation in combination with oral rehydration therapy has been shown to significantly reduce the duration and severity of acute and persistent childhood diarrhea and to increase survival in a number of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(96, 97)](#reference96). Recently, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that zinc supplementation reduces the frequency, severity, and duration of diarrheal episodes in children under five years of age [(98)](#reference98). The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund currently recommend zinc supplementation as part of the treatment for diarrheal diseases in young children [(99)](#reference99). Zinc supplementation may also reduce the incidence of lower respiratory infections, such as [pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia). A pooled analysis of a number of studies in developing countries demonstrated a substantial reduction in the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of pneumonia in children supplemented with zinc [(100)](#reference100). A recent meta-analysis found that zinc supplementation reduced the incidence but not duration of pneumonia or respiratory tract illnesses in children under five years of age [(98)](#reference98). Due to conflicting reports [(101-104)](#reference101), it is not yet clear whether zinc supplementation has utility in treating childhood malaria. Because a sensitive indicator of zinc nutritional status is not readily available, the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for zinc was based on a number of different indicators of zinc nutritional status and represents the daily intake likely to prevent deficiency in nearly all individuals in a specific age and gender group. The RDA for children ages 4 to 8 years is 5 mg/day, and the RDA for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 8 mg/day [(105)](#reference105). Shellfish, beef, and other red meats are rich sources of zinc. [Nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) and [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes) are relatively good plant sources of zinc. Zinc [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) (the fraction of zinc retained and used by the body) is relatively high in meat, eggs, and seafood because of the relative absence of compounds that inhibit zinc absorption and the presence of certain [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) (cysteine and [methionine](../glossary#methionine)) that enhance zinc absorption. The zinc in whole-grain products and plant proteins is less bioavailable due to their relatively high content of phytic acid, a compound that inhibits zinc absorption [(106)](#reference106). The enzymatic action of yeast reduces the level of phytic acid in foods. Therefore, leavened whole-grain breads have more bioavailable zinc than unleavened whole-grain breads [(105)](#reference105). [Choline](../other-nutrients/choline) can be [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by the body in small amounts, but dietary intake is needed to maintain health [(107)](#reference107). Choline and its [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) have a number of essential biological functions. Choline is used in the synthesis of specific [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) (i.e., phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) that are structural components of [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) and also precursors for certain [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules. Choline is needed for [myelination](../glossary#myelination) of nerves and is a precursor for acetylcholine, a [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) involved in muscle action, memory, and other functions [(108-110)](#reference108). For more information about the role of choline in the body, see the article on [Choline](../other-nutrients/choline#function). Due to the lack of data in children, intake recommendations for choline in children were extrapolated from adult recommendations using metabolic body weight, accounting for growth. The [AI](../glossary#AI) for children aged 4 to 8 years is 250 mg/day, and the AI for boys and girls aged 9 to 13 years is 375 mg/day [(108)](#reference108). A number of foods contain choline, but eggs, meats, and milk are the primary sources in the American diet [(111)](#reference111). -Linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid), and considered [essential fatty acids](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids) because [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by humans. The long-chain omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid (AA), can be synthesized from LA, and two long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), can be synthesized from ALA [(112)](#reference112). These [polyunsaturated fatty acids](../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) have a number of biological activities that are generally important for the structure and function of [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), vision, [eicosanoid](../glossary#eicosanoid) synthesis, regulation of [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), and nervous system function (see the article on [Essential Fatty Acids](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#biological-activities)). Dietary intake recommendations for ALA and LA in children were based on median intakes of American children, a population where omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid deficiencies are not observed. The [AI](../glossary#AI) of ALA for children ages 4 to 8 years is 0.9 g/day, while the AI of ALA for children ages 9 to 13 years is 1.2 and 1.0 g/day for boys and girls, respectively. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, can contribute to these intake recommendations. Flaxseeds, walnuts, and their oils are among the richest dietary sources of ALA, but canola oil is also an excellent source of ALA. Oily fish, such as salmon, tuna, trout, and sardines, are the major dietary source of EPA and DHA [(113)](#reference113). The AI of LA for children ages 4 to 8 years is 10 g/day, while the AI of LA for boys and girls ages 9 to 13 years is 12 and 10 g/day, respectively. Sources of LA include vegetable oils, such as soybean, safflower, and corn oil, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables (see the article on [Essential Fatty Acids](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#food-sources)). The FNB sets a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for most micronutrients. The UL is the highest level of daily nutrient intake likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects in almost all individuals of a specified age group. This level applies to total daily intake from food, water, and supplements. Due to the potential for adverse effects, it is recommended that individuals not exceed the UL. Thus, individuals should use the UL as a guide to limit daily [micronutrient](../glossary#micronutrient) intake, not as a recommended level of intake [(114)](#reference114). Table 3 lists the UL for children ages 4 to 8 years, and Table 4 lists the UL for children ages 9 to 13 | bApplies to the synthetic form in fortified foods and supplements cApplies only to preformed retinol dApplies to any form of supplemental -tocopherol eApplies only to the supplemental form fConsidered an essential nutrient, although not | bApplies to the synthetic form in fortified foods and supplements cApplies only to preformed retinol dApplies to any form of supplemental -tocopherol eApplies only to the supplemental form fConsidered an essential nutrient, although not strictly a micronutrient Note that many children's multivitamin/mineral supplements on the market contain more than the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for several micronutrients when taken at the suggested dosage by age. Some even contain micronutrients (e.g., vitamin A, folic acid, copper, and zinc) at levels equivalent to the [UL](../glossary#UL); this concern is for children younger than 9 years old. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine recommends that daily nutrient intake from food and supplements not exceed the UL for each micronutrient. There is no evidence that consumption of micronutrients at or above the UL results in any health benefits in children, and the UL should not be exceeded except under medical supervision. Children often consume vitamin and mineral-fortified foods like cereal, and their total intake of certain micronutrients like vitamin A, folic acid, copper, and zinc from fortified foods, other dietary intake, and from supplements should be determined to ensure that the UL is not exceeded. It is also important to note that the daily values ( [DVs](../glossary#DV)) listed on supplement labels in the US do not reflect the current intake recommendations ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA) or [AI](../glossary#AI)). Another caution is that many children's supplements look like candy but should never be labeled as such and, because of safety concerns, should be kept out of reach of children. A healthy diet in children is important to provide nutrients that support optimum physical growth and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) development and to also establish healthy eating behaviors that lower risk of chronic diseases in adulthood. Although it is generally advised that [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) should be obtained from food, many children do not reach daily intake recommendations for select micronutrients, including vitamins A, C, D, and E, and some minerals, such as calcium and magnesium [(37](#reference37), [115)](#reference115). Therefore, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that children ages 4 to 13 years take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement with 100% of the daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for most vitamins and essential minerals, keeping the following suggestions in mind: Written in August 2011 by: Victoria J.

Physical changes begin in early adolescence during puberty, when sexual maturity is reached and reproduction is possible [(1)](#references). Girls generally begin their adolescent growth spurt at an earlier age (9 years of age) than boys (11 years of age); the pubertal growth spurt lasts between two to four years, with the average rate of linear growth being 5-6 cm/year (2-2.4 in/year). Boys experience greater gains in height compared to girls because of a higher rate of growth and a longer growth spurt [(2)](#reference2). Gains in linear growth are accompanied by increases in body weight and changes in body composition. Weight gain in girls typically happens six months following the greatest gains in linear growth, whereas weight gain in boys is usually coincident with increases in height. Throughout adolescence, boys gain more lean (fat-free) mass than girls, and girls experience greater increases in [adiposity](../glossary#adipose), which is required for normal [menstruation](../glossary#menstruation) [(3)](#reference3). Moreover, approximately half of adult bone mass is obtained during adolescence [(4)](#reference4), with boys experiencing greater gains in bone size and bone mass compared to girls [(5)](#reference5). In addition to physical growth, reproductive maturation occurs during adolescence. Maturation of the reproductive organs and development of secondary sexual characteristics, including facial hair in males and breast development in females, take place during puberty. Girls also experience [menarche](../glossary#menarche) \u2014 the first occurrence of menstruation \u2014 during this developmental stage, typically following the peak period of gains in height and weight [(6)](#reference6). Adolescence is further characterized by cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial development [(2)](#reference2). Good nutrition is needed to support the growth and developmental changes of adolescence. Undernutrition, in general, has been shown to delay the adolescent growth spurt [(7)](#reference7). [Overnutrition](../glossary#overnutrition), a form of malnutrition where [macronutrients](../glossary#macronutrient) (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) are supplied in excess of the body's needs, can lead to [obesity](../glossary#obesity) and is a concern in industrialized nations. In the developed world, adolescents are increasingly consuming energy-rich, nutrient poor diets comprised of fast food, processed foods, and sugar-sweetened beverages [(8-10)](#reference8). Studies have also shown that many adolescents do not come close to meeting intake recommendations for nutrient-rich foods, such as fruit, vegetables, and milk [(11, 12)](#reference11). Together, these dietary behaviors place adolescents at increased risk for [micronutrient](../glossary#micronutrient) deficiencies. This article discusses micronutrient requirements of adolescents aged 14 to 18 years, an age range that is used by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine to establish dietary reference intakes. Due to limited data, many of the micronutrient intake recommendations for adolescents are extrapolated from recommendations for adults using a formula that accounts for metabolic body weight and growth [(13)](#reference13), not unique physiological changes during adolescence. Metabolic body weight is determined by calculating the 0.75 power of body mass (body mass^0.75) [(14)](#reference14). To account for growth, the equation used to derive a Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) or Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) involves an age group-specific growth factor [(13)](#reference13). The FNB set different micronutrient intake recommendations for children 9 to 13 years, an age range that encompasses puberty and early stages of adolescence [(15)](#reference15); discussion of the micronutrient requirements of younger children is included in a separate article (see [Micronutrient Needs of Children Ages 9 to 13 Years](children#ages-9-to-13-years)). For each [micronutrient](../glossary#micronutrient), the FNB sets an [RDA](../glossary#RDA) or [AI](../glossary#AI) for adolescents aged 14 to 18 years. These recommendations are gender specific to account for the unique nutritional needs of males and females as they undergo the physiological changes of adolescence. Table 1 lists the RDA for each micronutrient by gender. The RDA should be used in the planning of diets for individuals. A more detailed discussion of the requirements of certain micronutrients for adolescents can be found [below](#vitamins). |Micronutrient||Males||Females| ( |[Vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) is a fat-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that is essential for growth and development, normal vision, the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of selected [genes](../glossary#gene), [immunity](../micronutrients-health/immunity#vitamin-A), and reproduction [(16)](#reference16). Vitamin A deficiency in children and adolescents is a major public health problem worldwide, especially in less developed countries [(17, 18)](#reference17). Even marginal or subclinical deficiencies in vitamin A may have adverse effects on bone growth and sexual maturation of adolescents [(19)](#reference19). Because of its role in immunity, inadequate intake of this vitamin also increases risk for infectious diseases [(20)](#reference20). Studies in industrialized countries have reported inadequate intakes of vitamin A among adolescents [(21-23)](#reference21). Serum retinol binding protein (RBP) concentrations have been shown to increase throughout the stages of puberty, indicating that vitamin A is needed for adolescent development [(24)](#reference24). However, few vitamin A supplementation studies have been done in adolescents; most supplementation studies have included younger children who are more susceptible to vitamin A deficiency. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A is based on the amount needed to ensure adequate stores (four months) of vitamin A in the body to support normal reproductive function, immune function, vitamin A-dependent [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), and vision [(16)](#reference16). Vitamin A intake recommendations for adolescents were derived by extrapolating the recommendation for adults using metabolic body weight, accounting for growth. The RDA for adolescent boys aged 14 to 18 years is 900 g per day of [Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE)](../vitamins/vitamin-A#RAE), which is 3,000 international units (IU); the RDA for adolescent girls aged 14 to 18 years is 700 g of RAE, which is equivalent to 2,333 IU. For information on vitamin A content in foods, see the article on [Vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A#food-sources). [Vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6) is required for [heme](../glossary#heme) the synthesis and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) \u2014 the building blocks of [proteins](../glossary#protein). Thus, the vitamin has obvious relevance to adolescent growth and health. Dietary intake recommendations of vitamin B6 for adolescents were established by extrapolating data from adults, using metabolic body weight and accounting for growth. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for boys aged 14 to 18 years is 1.3 mg/day, and the RDA for girls aged 14 to 18 years is 1.2 mg/day [(25)](#reference25). Only a few studies have evaluated vitamin B6 status specifically in adolescents. In an analysis of American adolescent girls (aged 12-16 years), mean dietary intake of vitamin B6 was 1.2 mg/day; however, one-third of the girls not taking vitamin B6-containing supplements had either marginal or deficient vitamin B6 status [(26)](#reference26). The same investigators found more than 40% vitamin B6 inadequacy when a group of 112 adolescent girls (12- and 14-year-old) were followed for two years [(27)](#reference27). Results of more recent studies have suggested that most American and European adolescents are meeting current intake recommendations for vitamin B6 [(28, 29)](#reference28), although a study in Canada found that more than half of adolescent males aged 14 to 18 years did not meet the Estimated Average Requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) of 1.1 mg/day for vitamin B6 [(22)](#reference22). For information on dietary sources of the vitamin, see the article on [Vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6#food-sources). The B vitamin, [folate](../vitamins/folate), is required as a [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) to mediate the transfer of [one-carbon units](../glossary#one-carbon-unit). Folate coenzymes act as acceptors and donors of one-carbon units in a variety of reactions critical to the [endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and folate has obvious importance in growth and development. Moreover, higher intakes of folate in adolescents have been linked to better academic achievement [(32)](#reference32). Like other B vitamins, adolescent intake recommendations for folate were extrapolated from adult recommendations, using metabolic body weight and accounting for growth. The RDA for adolescents aged 14 to 18 years is 400 g/day of dietary folate equivalents [(33)](#reference33). When considering naturally occurring folate in foods, results of a national survey indicate that almost 80% of individuals aged 2-18 years in the US have intakes below the [EAR](../glossary#EAR), which is 330 g/day of dietary folate equivalents for adolescents aged 14-18 years. However, when accounting for intake from fortified foods, less than 5% of individuals in that age group have intakes below the EAR [(34)](#reference34). The US Food and Drug Administration implemented legislation in 1998 requiring the fortification of all enriched grain products with folic acid [(35)](#reference35). Globally, more than 50 countries have mandatory programs of wheat-flour fortification with folic acid, but flour fortification is not common in Europe [(36)](#reference36). Dietary folate inadequacy is common among adolescents in European nations, especially girls [(29)](#reference29). [Vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) is needed for two types of reactions in the human body. One is transmethylation (methyl transfer between two molecules) that leads to the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine). Methionine, in turn, is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor used in many biological [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, such as the methylation of sites within [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [RNA](../glossary#RNA) [(37)](#reference37). The second sort of reaction is [isomerization](../glossary#isomer) (rearrangement of a molecule). Vitamin B12 acts as a [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an important step for the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [lipids](../glossary#lipid). Both transmethylation and isomerization reactions are essential for the metabolism of components of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath of nerve cells and for the metabolism of [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter). Accordingly, vitamin B12 deficiency damages the myelin sheath covering cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves, resulting in [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) damage [(38, 39)](#reference38). The myelin sheath is the insulating layer of tissue made up of lipids and proteins that surrounds nerve fibers. This sheath acts as a conduit in an electrical system, allowing rapid and efficient transmission of [nerve impulses](../glossary#nerve-impulse) [(40)](#reference40). In some cases, neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency can be reversed by vitamin treatment [(38)](#reference38), but reversibility seems to be dependent upon the duration of the associated neurologic complications [(41)](#reference41). Although myelination primarily occurs during fetal development and early infancy, it continues through childhood, adolescence, and stages of early adulthood [(42, 43)](#reference42). Because of the role of vitamin B12 in myelination and other metabolic processes, it is important for adolescents to meet dietary intake recommendations. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of vitamin B12 for adolescent boys and girls aged 14 to 18 years is 2.4 g/day [(41)](#reference41), extrapolated from the recommendation for adults. Vitamin B12 is naturally present only in animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish (including shellfish), and to a lesser extent in milk, but it is not generally present in plant products or yeast [(44)](#reference44). Vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported in adolescents on very restricted or strict vegetarian diets [(45, 46)](#reference45). Because vitamin B12 is stored in the liver, it may take three to six years for clinical symptoms to manifest [(45)](#reference45). Thus, adolescents who have vegan diets need adequate intake from fortified foods or supplemental vitamin B12. [Vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) has a number of important roles during growth and development, including being required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [collagen](../glossary#collagen), [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), and [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) [(47)](#reference47). Vitamin C is also a highly effective antioxidant and is important for immunity (see the article on [Immunity](../micronutrients-health/immunity#vitamin-C)). Further, vitamin C strongly enhances the absorption of non [heme](../glossary#heme) iron by reducing dietary ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+). Specifically, iron absorption is two- to three-fold higher with co-ingestion of 25 to 75 mg of vitamin C [(48)](#reference48). This has special relevance to adolescent health, considering the fact that iron deficiency is prevalent among adolescents, especially girls (see the section on [Iron](#iron)). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for adolescents aged 14 to 18 years, which was extrapolated from recommendations for adults based on relative body weight, is 75 mg/day and 65 mg/day of vitamin C for boys and girls, respectively [(49)](#reference49). Data on vitamin C intake among adolescents are limited, but a recent US national survey, the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), found that serum vitamin C concentrations of adolescents (aged 12-19 years) were lower in adolescents compared to younger children (6-11 years), and adolescent girls had higher levels than adolescent boys [(50)](#reference50). In this analysis, 2.7% of adolescent boys and 3.9% of adolescent girls had overt vitamin C deficiency that could result in clinical symptoms of [scurvy](../glossary#scurvy). A [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of European adolescents (aged 12.5-17.5 years) also noted higher vitamin C status among adolescent girls compared to boys, and compared to the US survey, the prevalence of overt vitamin C deficiency was lower in European adolescents [(51)](#reference51). For information on food sources, see the article on [Vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C#food-sources). [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) is a fat-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that is essential for maintaining normal [calcium](../minerals/calcium) metabolism and is therefore necessary for bone health. Severe vitamin D deficiency in infants and children results in the failure of bone to mineralize, leading to a condition known as [rickets](../glossary#rickets), but cases of rickets have also been reported during stages of puberty and adolescence [(52-53)](#reference52). Rapidly growing bones are most severely affected by rickets. The growth plates of bones continue to enlarge, but in the absence of adequate mineralization, weight-bearing limbs (arms and legs) become bowed. Inadequate vitamin D during puberty and adolescence might prevent the attainment of peak bone mass and final height [(54-56)](#reference54) and could possibly increase the risk of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) or other diseases in adulthood, but more studies on these associations are needed. In 2010, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine set an [RDA](../glossary#RDA) based on the amount of vitamin D needed for bone health and assuming minimal sun exposure; the RDA is 600 IU/day (15 g/day) for adolescents aged 14 to 18 years. In the US, milk is voluntarily fortified with 400 IU (10 g) of vitamin D per quart (946 mL); thus, adolescents would need to consume about 6 cups of milk daily to meet the RDA. Although fish is the best source of vitamin D in the diet, fortified foods and beverages are likely the major dietary source of vitamin D for US adolescents. In Canada, fortification of milk and margarine is mandatory, with milk containing 35-45 IU per 100 mL (331-426 IU per quart) and margarine containing 530 IU per 100 grams [(57)](#reference57), but vitamin D fortification of foods is less common in European nations [(58)](#reference58). In addition to diet, vitamin D can be [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation from sunlight; however, sunscreens effectively block skin synthesis of vitamin D and vitamin D synthesis is diminished in northern latitudes during winter (see the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D)). Analysis of data from NHANES 2005-2006 found that average total vitamin D intakes (from diet and supplements combined) in US adolescents (aged 14 to 18 years) were 6.9 g/day (276 IU/day) for boys and 5.0 g/day (200 IU/day) for girls \u2014 well below the current RDA. This analysis also found that 16% of adolescent boys and 27% of adolescent girls took vitamin D-containing supplements [(59)](#reference59). Because sun exposure can substantially affect body vitamin D levels, measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D \u2014 the major circulating form of vitamin D \u2014 is a more useful indicator of vitamin D status. However, studies assessing vitamin D status in adolescents have used various cutoffs to define vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency and there is no consensus of what level constitutes adequacy. It is assumed that a dietary intake of 600 IU (15 g)/day results in a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), which the FNB considers as the cut-off point for vitamin D adequacy [(60)](#reference60). However, many researchers believe that higher levels may benefit health. NHANES found that more than 25% of US adolescents (12-19 years) had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and about 75% of adolescents had levels lower than 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L) [(61)](#reference61). Some studies have found a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European adolescents [(19](#reference19), [62)](#reference62). Ethnic and seasonal differences have also been reported, with higher levels in whites compared to blacks [(61, 63)](#reference61) and in summertime compared to wintertime [(62, 64, 65)](#reference62). Moreover, several studies have reported low vitamin D status among adolescents living in sunny climates [(63](#reference63), [66-68)](#reference66). Oral vitamin D supplementation has been shown to improve vitamin D status among adolescents [(69, 70)](#reference69), and one [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial found that improvements in vitamin D status were accompanied by some musculoskeletal benefits in adolescent girls [(70)](#reference70). Although more supplementation studies are needed, ensuring vitamin D adequacy throughout childhood and adolescence seems prudent. The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adolescents aged 14 to 18 years should have a daily intake of 600 to 1,000 IU (15 to 25 g) of vitamin D, consistent with the recommendations of the Endocrine Society [(71)](#reference71). According to the Endocrine Society, at least 600 IU/day may be required to maximize bone health, and 1,000 IU/day may be needed to increase serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) [(71)](#reference71). Given the average vitamin D content of the diets of adolescents, supplementation may be necessary to meet this recommendation. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently suggests that all adolescents who do not get 400 IU/day of vitamin D through dietary sources should take 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily [(72)](#reference72) \u2014 an amount that is typically found in multivitamin supplements. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) for adolescents, expressed as an amount of the -tocopherol form of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), was based on extrapolations from intake recommendations for adults, accounting for differences in lean body mass and increased needs of growth during adolescence. The RDA is 15 mg/day (22.5 IU/day) for boys and girls ages 14 to 18 years [(73)](#reference73). A US national survey, NHANES 1999-2000, found that adolescent boys and girls aged 14 to 18 years had average intakes of 7.5 mg/day and 5.7 mg/day of -tocopherol, respectively. Moreover, 92% of adolescent boys and more than 99% of adolescent girls of this age group had daily intakes below the EAR of 12 mg/day [(74)](#reference74). Vitamin E intake has been reported to be similarly low in adolescents in Spain [(21)](#reference21), Switzerland [(23)](#reference23), Brazil [(75)](#reference75), France [(76)](#reference76), and Germany [(77)](#reference77). However, true vitamin E deficiency is rare and has been observed only in cases of severe malnutrition, genetic defects affecting the -tocopherol protein, and fat [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome); see the article on [Vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E#deficiency). About 99% of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) in the body is found in bones and teeth [(78)](#reference78). Adequate intake of calcium throughout childhood and adolescence is important for proper mineralization of growing bones, attainment of peak bone mass, and reduction of risk of bone fracture and [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) in adulthood. Dietary intake recommendations for calcium in adolescents were established using a factorial method that summed average calcium accretion and calcium losses to urine, feces, and sweat and also adjusted for calcium absorption [(60)](#reference60). Specifically, data used by the FNB to determine calcium accretion came from a recent longitudinal study in 642 Caucasian adolescents aged 14 to 18 years [(79)](#reference79). The authors of this study estimated that the daily calcium requirement is higher in boys than girls; however, the FNB concluded that the differences were relatively small and it would be more practical to establish a single recommendation for all adolescents. Thus, the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) was set at 1,300 mg/day; this level of calcium intake is expected to cover the needs of 97.5% of adolescents. Many US adolescents have dietary calcium intakes below the RDA, with girls having lower intakes than boys. A recent analysis of data from NHANES 2003-2006, a US national survey, found that 42% of adolescent boys and only 10% of adolescent girls (14-18 years) had dietary calcium intakes above 1,300 mg/day. When accounting for use of calcium-containing supplements (19% and 24% of boys and girls, respectively; average supplemental intake of 142 and 182 mg/day of calcium in boys and girls, respectively), 42% of adolescent boys and only 13% of adolescent girls had total daily intakes above the current RDA [(59)](#reference59). A recent publication that reviewed average calcium intake among adolescents in 23 nations found that boys generally have intakes of ~100-200 mg/day higher than girls and that many adolescents do not meet intake recommendations [(80)](#reference80). Dairy products, which provide about 72% of the calcium in the American diet [(78)](#reference78), represent rich and absorbable sources of calcium. Milk contains 300 mg of calcium per cup; therefore, adolescents could meet the RDA for calcium by drinking 4.3 cups of low-fat milk daily. However, NHANES data show that US adolescents (12-19 years) on average consume only about 1 cup of milk daily [(81)](#reference81). Lactose intolerance may prevent some adolescents from consuming milk, and consumption of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages might displace milk consumption in adolescents [(82)](#reference82). Certain vegetables and grains also provide calcium, but their bioavailability is lower compared with dairy. For more information on dietary sources of calcium and calcium bioavailability, see the article on [Calcium](../minerals/calcium#food-sources). The Nutrition Facts label of packaged foods lists calcium content in one serving as a percent of the Daily Value (DV), with the DV being 1,000 mg. Since the RDA for adolescents is 1,300 mg/day, the percentage of the [DV](../glossary#DV) listed on the food label would be an overestimation of the percentage of the RDA. If adolescents do not meet the RDA through diet alone, LPI recommends supplemental calcium. Multivitamin/mineral supplements generally provide no more than 200 mg of calcium. Iron is an essential component of hundreds of [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in various aspects of [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), including oxygen transport and storage, [electron transport](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) and energy metabolism, [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and beneficial pro-oxidant functions, oxygen sensing, and [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) [(44](#reference44), [83-85)](#reference83); see the article on [Iron](../minerals/iron#function). Iron deficiency, which is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, is a major public health problem, especially in developing nations, but it is also prevalent in industrialized nations, notably in women of childbearing age. Severe iron deficiency leads to iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia); anemia affects more than 30% of the global population (2 billion people) [(81)](#reference81). Adolescents have increased requirements for iron due to rapid growth. In particular, adolescent girls are at a heightened risk of iron deficiency due to inadequate intake of dietary iron, especially [heme](../glossary#heme) iron; increased demands of growth; and iron loss that occurs with [menstruation](../glossary#menstruation). Following puberty, adolescent girls have lower iron stores compared to adolescent boys [(87)](#reference87). In addition to the negative effects of iron deficiency on physical growth, iron deficiency during adolescence may impair immunity (see the article on [Nutrition and Immunity](../micronutrients-health/immunity#iron)) as well as cognition. Iron is needed for proper development of oligodendrocytes (the brain cells that produce [myelin](../glossary#myelin)) [(88)](#reference88), and the [mineral](../glossary#mineral) is also a required [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for several enzymes that synthesize [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) [(89)](#reference89). Iron deficiency \u2014 even levels not associated with anemia \u2014 during important stages of brain development, such as adolescence, may have detrimental consequences. A [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 73 adolescent girls (aged 13-18 years) with non-anemic iron deficiency found that high-dose iron supplementation (260 mg/day of elemental iron) for eight weeks resulted in greater improvement in verbal learning but not in other cognitive domains [(90)](#reference90). Another study reported that one-month iron supplementation beyond that included in a prenatal vitamin improved some measures of attention and short-term memory in young pregnant women (aged 14-24 years) without severe iron deficiency [(91)](#reference91). Clinical trials of iron supplementation to date have been mostly done in other age groups; large, well-designed trials in adolescents are needed to determine the effects of iron supplementation on cognition. Dietary intake recommendations for adolescents were based on a factorial modeling approach that accounts for the amount of iron needed to replace basal losses (losses in urine, feces, and sweat), iron requirements associated with growth (increases in [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) and iron content of tissues), and iron losses associated with menstruation in girls. The intake recommendations also account for average [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) (the fraction of iron retained and used by the body) of dietary iron for this age group [(92)](#reference92). The RDA of iron is 11 mg/day for adolescent boys and 15 mg/day for adolescent girls. A US national survey, NHANES 2001-2002, found that average dietary intake of iron was 19.1 mg/day in adolescent boys and 13.3 mg/day in adolescent girls; however, 16% of adolescent girls had intakes below the EAR of 7.9 mg/day. Because several different criteria have been used to identify iron deficiency, it is difficult to report the prevalence of iron deficiency among adolescents. The amount of bioavailable iron in food (or supplements) is influenced by the iron nutritional status of the individual and also by the form of iron ( [heme](../glossary#heme) or nonheme). Individuals who are anemic or iron deficient absorb a larger percentage of the iron they consume (especially nonheme iron) than individuals who are not anemic and have sufficient iron stores [(94, 95)](#reference94). Heme iron, found in meat, poultry, and fish, is more readily absorbed, and its absorption is less affected by other dietary factors than nonheme iron \u2014 the form found in plants, dairy products, fortified foods, and supplements. Although heme iron generally accounts for only 10-15% of the iron found in the diet, it may provide up to one third of total absorbed dietary iron [(83](#reference83), [95)](#reference95). The absorption of nonheme iron is strongly influenced by enhancers and inhibitors present in the same meal. For instance, [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) strongly enhances the absorption of nonheme iron by reducing dietary ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+) and forming an absorbable, iron-ascorbic acid complex. Organic acids, such as citric, malic, tartaric, and lactic acids, also enhance nonheme iron absorption. Further, consumption of meat, poultry, and fish enhance nonheme iron absorption, but the mechanism for this increase in absorption is not clear [(92, 94)](#reference92). Inhibitors of nonheme iron absorption include phytic acid, which is present in [legumes](../glossary#legumes), grains, and rice. Polyphenols found in some fruit, vegetables, coffee, tea, wines, and spices can also markedly inhibit the absorption of nonheme iron, but this effect is reduced by the presence of vitamin C [(92, 96)](#reference92). Soy protein, such as that found in tofu, has an inhibitory effect on iron absorption that is independent of its phytic acid content [(92)](#reference92). The [mineral](../glossary#mineral) [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium) is involved in more than 300 essential metabolic reactions that are generally involved in energy production and the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of in bone, [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), and [chromosomes](../glossary#chromosome) and is also required for various cellular processes, including [ion](../glossary#ion) transport across cell membranes, [cell signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling), and cell migration [(98)](#reference98). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of magnesium for those aged 14 to 18 years, 410 mg/day for boys and 360 mg/day for girls, was derived from results of [balance studies](../glossary#balance-study) in adolescents. Good dietary sources of magnesium include [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), and green leafy vegetables because magnesium is part of chlorophyll \u2014 the green pigment in plants. Meats and milk have an intermediate magnesium content, with milk providing 24-39 mg per cup [(97)](#reference97). Refined foods generally have the lowest magnesium content. Although data are limited, some studies have found that a large percentage of adolescents have magnesium intakes below recommended levels [(100-102)](#reference100). Data on magnesium intake among adolescents are lacking. In an analysis of NHANES data, US adolescents who consumed milk (plain or flavored) had higher daily magnesium intakes than adolescents who did not drink milk [(103)](#reference103). However, NHANES data show that US adolescents (12-19 years) on average only consume about 1 cup of milk daily [(81)](#reference81). Low-fat milk, nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables are important sources of magnesium for adolescents. If adolescents do not meet the RDA through dietary sources, LPI recommends a combined magnesium-calcium supplement. [Potassium](../minerals/potassium) is required for maintenance of cellular [membrane potential](../glossary#membrane-potential) and thus for [nerve impulse](../glossary#nerve-impulse) transmission, muscle contraction, and heart function. In general, adolescents have low intakes of fruit, vegetables, and dairy products [(104-106)](#reference104) \u2014 foods that are rich in potassium. Low intakes of potassium, coupled with high intakes of sodium (see section on [Sodium](#sodium)), have been linked to elevations in blood pressure and a heightened risk of [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) and [stroke](../glossary#stroke) later in life (see the article on [Potassium](../minerals/potassium#disease-prevention)). In a study that followed 2,368 adolescent girls for nine years, lower intakes of potassium were associated with a higher incidence of hypertension [(107)](#reference107). Fruit, vegetables, low-fat milk, and nuts are all good sources of potassium, and increasing intake of these foods during adolescence should help regulate blood pressure and may decrease risk of chronic disease during adulthood. In 2019, the FNB set the [AI](../glossary#AI) for adolescents by extrapolating from the adult AI using relative energy intakes; however, since energy intakes of adolescents are similar to that of adults, the recommendations are identical: 1,500 mg/day of [sodium](../minerals/sodium) [(108)](#reference108). The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to 1,500 mg/day to lower blood pressure and thus reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and kidney diseases in adulthood. However, daily sodium intake in US adolescents (aged 12-19 years) is 3,000 mg in girls and 4,000 mg/day in boys [(109)](#reference109). Low-sodium interventions in adolescents have shown some improvement in blood pressure, but compliance to such a diet is problematic [(110, 111)](#reference110). The [mineral](../glossary#mineral) [zinc](../minerals/zinc) is essential for growth and development, [immune function](../micronutrients-health/immunity#zinc), [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) function, and reproduction. Zinc plays a number of [catalytic](../glossary#catalyze), structural, and regulatory roles in cellular [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (see the article on [Zinc](../minerals/zinc#function)). Zinc deficiency, which is estimated to affect more than 2 billion people in less developed nations [(112)](#reference112), can retard normal growth, impair cognitive development, and delay sexual maturation [(113, 114)](#reference113). Adolescents are at increased risk of zinc deficiency due to the demands of growth [(115)](#reference115). Mild zinc deficiency, which is common in both the developing and developed world, may also have negative effects on growth and development [(47](#reference47), [116)](#reference116); however, the lack of a sensitive indicator of mild zinc deficiency hinders the scientific study of its health implications. Because a sensitive indicator of zinc nutritional status is not readily available, the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for zinc was based on a number of different indicators of zinc nutritional status and represents the daily intake likely to prevent deficiency in nearly all individuals in a specific age and gender group. The RDA for adolescent boys and girls, aged 14 to 18 years, is 11 mg/day and 9 mg/day, respectively [(113)](#reference113). A US national survey, NHANES 2001-2002, found that average dietary intake of zinc was 15.1 mg/day in adolescent boys and 9.5 mg/day in adolescent girls; only 4% of adolescent boys had intakes less than the EAR (8.5 mg/day), but 26% of adolescent girls had intakes less than the EAR (7.3 mg/day). Shellfish, beef, and other red meats are rich sources of zinc; [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) and [legumes](../glossary#legumes) are relatively good plant sources of zinc. Zinc [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) (the fraction of zinc retained and used by the body) is relatively high in meat, eggs, and seafood because of the relative absence of compounds that inhibit zinc absorption and the presence of certain [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) (cysteine and [methionine](../glossary#methionine)) that enhance zinc absorption. However, the zinc in whole-grain products and plant proteins is less bioavailable due to their relatively high content of phytic acid, a compound that inhibits zinc absorption [(117)](#reference117). The enzymatic action of yeast reduces the level of phytic acid in foods. Therefore, leavened whole-grain breads have more bioavailable zinc than unleavened whole-grain breads [(113)](#reference113). Pregnancy during adolescence \u2014 a time when the girl is still growing herself \u2014 has been associated with increased risk of miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight infants (<2,500 grams), and increased maternal and neonatal mortality [(2](#reference2), [118-119)](#reference118). Pregnant adolescents are also at a heightened risk for pregnancy-related complications, including pregnancy-induced hypertension and anemia [(119)](#reference119). Because they are growing themselves, it is extremely important for pregnant adolescents to meet dietary intake recommendations. Recommendations for some key micronutrients needed for adolescent growth, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc, are higher than those for older pregnant women; see the discussion of [Micronutrient Requirements During Pregnancy](../life-stages/pregnancy-lactation#micronutrient-requirements-pregnancy) in a separate article. Pregnant adolescents are at increased risk for select micronutrient inadequacies, especially iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin D, and vitamin E [(2](#reference2), [120-121)](#reference120). Adequate nutrition is important not only for a healthy pregnancy outcome but also for the overall and skeletal health of the adolescent. A recent [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 719 postmenopausal women associated their pregnancy during adolescence with lower bone mineral density at several sites and a two-fold higher risk of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) compared to women without a history of adolescent pregnancy [(122)](#reference122). However, it is not known whether adequate calcium intake during adolescent pregnancy might prevent age-related declines in [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) or osteoporosis. The FNB establishes a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for most micronutrients. The UL is the highest level of daily nutrient intake likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects in almost all individuals of a specified age group. This level applies to total daily intake from food, water, and supplements. Due to the potential for adverse effects, it is recommended that individuals not exceed the UL. Thus, individuals should use the UL as a guide to limit daily [micronutrient](../glossary#micronutrient) intake, not as a recommended level of intake [(123)](#reference123). There is no evidence that consumption of micronutrients at or above the UL results in any health benefits for adolescents, and the UL should not be exceeded except under medical supervision. Table 2 lists the UL for | bApplies to the synthetic form in fortified foods and supplements cApplies only to preformed retinol dApplies to any form of supplemental -tocopherol eApplies only to the supplemental form A healthy diet throughout puberty and adolescence is important to provide nutrients that support optimal physical growth and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) development. Although it is generally advised that [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) should be obtained from food, many adolescents do not reach daily intake recommendations for select micronutrients from diet alone. Therefore, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adolescents aged 14 to 18 years take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement with 100% of the daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for most vitamins and essential minerals, keeping the following suggestions in mind: Written in July 2012 by: Victoria J.

Mathematical models predict that energy requirements increase by an estimated 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and by 500 kcal/day during lactation [(1)](#references). In practice, most women will require only approximately 200 additional kcal/day due to reduced levels of physical activity during pregnancy and to increased [lipolysis](../glossary#lipolysis) of fat stores during breast-feeding [personal communication with Dr. Berthold Koletzko]. Relative to the increased energy requirement, the requirements for many [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient) ( [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) and nutritionally essential [minerals](../glossary#mineral)) are even higher during pregnancy and lactation; this article discusses micronutrient needs during these life stages. Pregnancy is associated with increased nutritional needs due to physiologic changes of the woman and the metabolic demands of the embryo/fetus. Proper maternal nutrition during pregnancy is thus imperative for the health of both the woman and the offspring. Maternal malnutrition during pregnancy has been associated with adverse outcomes, including increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of maternal and infant mortality, as well as low-birth-weight newborns (<2,500 grams) \u2014 a measure that accounts for preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction of the fetus [(2, 3)](#reference2). Select nutrient deficiencies have also been linked to [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) and birth defects. In addition, [gestational](../glossary#gestation) undernutrition has been implicated in increasing the offspring's susceptibility to [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) (i.e., type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke)) in adulthood, a phenomenon sometimes called Barker's hypothesis, the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, or the fetal origin of adult disease hypothesis [(4, 5)](#reference4). Maternal undernutrition often refers to malnutrition caused by insufficient caloric (energy) intake from [macronutrients](../glossary#macronutrient) ( [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), [proteins](../glossary#protein), and [lipids](../glossary#lipid)) during pregnancy, but are also a form of undernutrition. Multiple micronutrient deficiencies commonly co-exist in pregnant women [(6)](#reference6). Daily requirements for many micronutrients during pregnancy are higher to meet the physiologic changes and increased nutritional needs of pregnancy. Good nutritional status prior to conception is also important for a healthy pregnancy. For instance, [folic acid](#folate) supplementation during the periconceptional period (about one month before conception until the end of the first trimester) dramatically reduces the incidence of devastating birth defects called [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (see [Folate](#folate) below). Thus, folic acid supplementation (at least 400 g/day) is recommended for all women capable of becoming pregnant [(7-9)](#reference7). A well-balanced diet throughout pregnancy is necessary to supply the developing embryo/fetus with micronutrients. In addition to folic acid supplementation, iron supplementation is generally needed to meet the increased demands for this [mineral](../glossary#mineral) during pregnancy (see the section on [Iron](#iron) below). The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine establishes life-stage specific dietary reference intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for each micronutrient; these reference values should be used to plan and assess dietary intakes in healthy people [(10, 11)](#reference10). The DRIs include the estimated average requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)), the recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)), the adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)), and the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)). The RDA, which is the average daily dietary intake level of a nutrient sufficient to meet the requirements of almost all (97.5%) healthy individuals in a specific life stage and gender group, should be used in the planning of diets for individuals [(12)](#reference12). The FNB establishes an AI when an RDA cannot be determined. The below recommendations are specific to the life stages of pregnancy and lactation. For most micronutrients, the RDA or AI for pregnant women is increased compared to nonpregnant women of the same age (Table 1). The discussion below largely focuses on these recommendations for select micronutrients during pregnancy but also notes major concerns for micronutrient toxicity or [teratogenicity](../glossary#teratogen). The UL is the highest level of daily intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects in almost all individuals of a specified life stage. For the UL for each micronutrient during for carboxylase [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and for the attachment of biotin to molecules, such as [proteins](../glossary#protein), in a process known as \"biotinylation\" [(13)](#reference13). Rapidly dividing cells of the developing fetus require the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) for [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of essential carboxylase enzymes and for [histone](../glossary#histone) biotinylation. Although maternal biotin deficiency in certain strains of mice causes malformations in the offspring, namely cleft palate and limb shortening [(14, 15)](#reference14), a link between biotin deficiency and birth defects in humans has not been observed. Experimentally induced, marginal biotin deficiency results in the increased urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIA) of are the most extensively [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of low biotin status [(18)](#reference18). Two [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have reported that there is an increased urinary excretion of 3-HIA during pregnancy, though other indices of biotin status were not consistently altered [(19, 20)](#reference19). Similarly, a 2014 feeding study in which all subjects consumed a mixed diet with a known amount of biotin (average daily intake, 57 g biotin/day), urinary 3-HIA excretion was higher in pregnant women, while urinary biotin and BNB excretion did not between the groups [(21)](#reference21). Supplementation with biotin (300 g/day for 3-HIA and increased urinary biotin excretion in pregnant women with elevated 3-HIA; however, this intervention did the same for nonpregnant controls considered to have normal biotin status [(22)](#reference22). Elevated urinary excretion of 3-HIA during pregnancy could be due to several possibilities. Some suggest that it reflects marginal biotin deficiency and the need for more biotin during pregnancy [(23, 24)](#reference23). Alternatively, increased 3-HIA in isolation could reflect altered leucine [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) or [renal](../glossary#renal) handling of organic acids during pregnancy [(18)](#reference18). At this time, the AI for biotin (30 g/day) is the same for pregnant and nonpregnant women. Biotin is widespread in food, though its concentration varies substantially (see the article on [Biotin](../vitamins/biotin#food-sources)). Based on dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II [(18](#reference18), [25)](#reference25) and the above-mentioned feeding study [(21)](#reference21), a typical mixed diet provides approximately 40 to 60 g of biotin/day. The terms [folate](../vitamins/folate) and folic acid are often used interchangeably, but folic acid is the synthetic form of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that is only found in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Folic acid is more [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) than folate from food (see the article on [Folate](../vitamins/folate#bioavailability)); folic acid is converted to biologically active forms of folate in the body. Folate critical to embryonic and fetal growth \u2014 developmental stages characterized by accelerated cell division. In particular, folate is needed for closure of the neural tube early in pregnancy, and periconceptional supplementation with folic acid has been shown to dramatically reduce the incidence of [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTDs) (reviewed in [26](#reference26) and [27](#reference27)). NTDs devastating that can occur as either [anencephaly](../glossary#anencephaly) or [spina bifida](../glossary#spina-bifida). Because these birth defects occur between 21 to 27 days after conception [(28)](#reference28), often before many women recognize their pregnancy, it is recommended in the US that all women capable of becoming pregnant take supplemental folic acid [(7)](#reference7). A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of five trials, including 7,391 women, found that periconceptional folic acid supplementation, alone or with other micronutrients, was associated with a 69% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of NTDs (risk ratio (RR), 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17 to 0.58) [(29)](#reference29). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for pregnant women is 600 g/day of dietary folate equivalents ( [DFE](../vitamins/folate#DFEs)), which is equivalent to 300 g/day of synthetic folic acid on an empty stomach or 353 g/day of synthetic folic acid with a meal (see the article on [Folate](../vitamins/folate#RDA)). The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends a daily supplement of 400-800 g of folic acid, in addition to consuming food folate from a varied diet, for all women planning or capable of pregnancy [(9)](#reference9). Supplemental folic acid use at the higher end of this suggested range has been recommended by some [(27, 30)](#reference27), and 800 g/day from supplements plus dietary intake is safe for women of childbearing age. Multivitamin/mineral supplements marketed in the US commonly contain 400 g of folic acid, and many prenatal supplements marketed in the US contain 800 g of folic acid. Folic acid may also be present in the food supply: several countries have programs of mandatory folic acid fortification to help reduce the incidence of NTDs; for example, the US FDA implemented legislation in 1998 requiring the fortification of all enriched grain products with folic acid at a level of 140 g folic acid/100 g of product [(31)](#reference31). Mandatory fortification in the US has resulted in a 28 percent reduction (an estimated 1,326 births/year) in the prevalence of NTDs [(32)](#reference32). Doses greater than 1 mg/day of folic acid are used pharmacologically to treat [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) and to prevent reoccurrence of NTDs [(33)](#reference33). Women who have had a previous NTD-affected pregnancy may be advised to consume up to 4 to 5 mg/day (4,000 to 5,000 g/day) of folic acid if they are planning a pregnancy, but this level of supplementation should be prescribed by their medical provider (see the [CDC recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/recommendations.html) and the [World Health Organization [WHO] guidelines](http://www.who.int/elena/titles/folate_periconceptional/en/)). A new form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), has been proposed as an alternative to folic acid. 5-MTHF is less likely to mask a severe vitamin B12 deficiency, exhibits lower interaction potential with antimalarial drugs, and may be preferable for women with an MTHFR polymorphism [(26](#reference26), [34)](#reference34). While the effect of 5-MTHF supplementation on NTDs has not yet been evaluated, it is at least as effective as folic acid at raising red blood cell folate status and reducing [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations in nonpregnant healthy young women [(35-38)](#reference35) and lactating women [(39)](#reference39). Inadequate folate status may also be linked to other birth defects, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and limb malformations, but there are insufficient data to evaluate the effect of folic acid supplementation on these outcomes [(26)](#reference26). However, results of some [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) [(40-44)](#reference40) and controlled trials [(45, 46)](#reference45) periconceptional supplementation with a acid may protect [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) malformations, especially conotruncal (outflow tract) and ventricular septal defects. A 2006 systematic review and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) concluded that such supplementation was associated with a 22% lower risk of cardiovascular defects in case-control studies and a 39% lower risk in [cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(47)](#reference47). Impaired folate status during pregnancy may also be associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Elevated blood homocysteine concentrations, considered an indicator of functional folate deficiency, have been associated with increased risk of [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), premature delivery, low placental weight, low birth weight, very low birth weight (<1,500 grams), small for [gestational](../glossary#gestation) age, neural tube defects (NTDs), and stillbirth [(48-50)](#reference48). Thus, it is reasonable to maintain folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy, even after closure of the neural tube, in order to decrease the risk of other potential problems during pregnancy. [Riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin) is a component of flavocoenzymes involved in energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), as well as [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) functions. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine recommends that all pregnant women consume 1.4 mg of riboflavin daily. Riboflavin deficiency has been implicated in [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) \u2014 a pregnancy-associated complication characterized by elevated blood pressure, [protein](../glossary#protein) in the urine, and [edema](../glossary#edema) (significant swelling). Preeclampsia is estimated to affect 2%-8% of all pregnancies [(51)](#reference51), and about 5% of women with preeclampsia progress to [eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia), a significant cause of maternal death [(52)](#reference52). Eclampsia is characterized by seizures, in addition to high blood pressure and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (severe bleeding) [(52)](#reference52). Although the specific causes of preeclampsia are not known, decreased intracellular concentrations of flavocoenzymes could cause [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction, increase [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and interfere with [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) release and thus blood vessel dilation. All of these changes have been associated with preeclampsia, but there have been few studies on the association of riboflavin nutritional status and the condition. A study in 154 pregnant women at high risk for preeclampsia found that those who were riboflavin deficient were 4.7 times more likely to develop preeclampsia than those who had adequate riboflavin nutritional status [(53)](#reference53). However, a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 450 pregnant women at high risk for preeclampsia found that supplementation with 15 mg of riboflavin daily did not prevent the condition [(54)](#reference54). Adequate maternal status of [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) is critical for a healthy pregnancy. Forms of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), known as retinoids, are involved in the regulation of [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), cellular [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), growth and development, vision, and [immunity](../health-disease/immunity) (see the article on [Vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A#function)). The retinoids, retinol and retinoic acid, are essential for embryonic and fetal development [(55)](#reference55); for example, retinoic acid functions in forming the heart, eyes, ears, and limbs [(56)](#reference56). Animal studies demonstrate that severe vitamin A deficiency or excess during critical periods of development results in a spectrum of malformations, especially affecting craniofacial structures, limbs, and visceral organs [(57)](#reference57). Forms of vitamin A are also necessary for maternal health. Vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy has been linked to impaired immunity, increased susceptibility to infection, increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of maternal morbidity and mortality [(58-61)](#reference58), and night blindness [(62)](#reference62). Vitamin A deficiency may exacerbate iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) (see section on [Iron](#iron) below); co- [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with vitamin A and iron seems to ameliorate anemia more effectively than either micronutrient supplement alone [(63)](#reference63). Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem in developing nations, where availability of foods containing preformed vitamin A (retinol) and provitamin A carotenoids is limited (for information on food sources of vitamin A, see the article on [Vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A#food-sources)). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) during pregnancy is 750 to 770 g/day (2,500 to 2,567 IU/day) of preformed vitamin A (see [Table 1](#table-1) above). Although normal embryonic and fetal development require sufficient maternal vitamin A intake, consumption of excess preformed vitamin A during pregnancy causes birth defects. An increased risk of vitamin A-associated birth defects has not been observed at supplemental doses below 3,000 g (10,000 IU)/day of preformed vitamin [(64)](#reference64). However, because a number of foods in the US are [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with preformed vitamin A, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that pregnant women avoid multivitamin or prenatal supplements that contain more than 750 g (2,500 IU) of preformed vitamin A. Vitamin A from -carotene is not known to increase the risk of birth defects [(58)](#reference58), although the safety of high-dose -carotene supplements in pregnancy has not been well studied. Moreover, pharmacological use of retinoids by pregnant women causes serious birth defects; thus, tretinate, isotretinoin (Accutane), and other retinoids should not be used during pregnancy or if there is a possibility of becoming pregnant [(65)](#reference65). Use of tretinoin (Retin-A), a [topically](../glossary#topical) applied retinoid, exhibits very low systemic absorption, but is not recommended during pregnancy due to possible risks [(66)](#reference66). It is important to note that retinoids tend to be very long acting; birth defects have been reported to occur months after discontinuing retinoid therapy [(57)](#reference57). Retinoids are used therapeutically to treat retinitis pigmentosa, acute promyelocytic leukemia, various skin diseases, and other conditions. [Vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6) has diverse roles in the body, including nervous system function, red blood cell formation and function, [steroid](../glossary#steroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) function, [nucleic acid](../glossary#nucleic-acid) synthesis, and [niacin](../vitamins/niacin) formation. pyridoxamine are three forms of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin B6 during pregnancy is 1.9 mg/day. Vitamin B6 has been used since the 1940s to treat nausea during pregnancy. The results of two [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials that used 25 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for three days [(67)](#reference67) or 10 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for five days [(68)](#reference68) suggest that vitamin B6 may be beneficial in alleviating morning sickness. Each study found a slight but significant reduction in nausea or vomiting in pregnant women. A third [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) trial compared high-dose (10 mg/day) and low-dose (1.28 mg/day) vitamin B6 in 60 pregnant women experiencing nausea and/or vomiting prior to the twelfth week of [gestation](../glossary#gestation) [(69)](#reference69). After two weeks, nausea and vomiting scores decreased to an equal extent in both supplementation groups. A 2014 pooled analysis indicates that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 alone may be effective in alleviating nausea, but not vomiting, during pregnancy [(70)](#reference70). Vitamin B6 at the above-mentioned dosages is considered safe during pregnancy, and the vitamin has been used in pregnant women without any evidence of fetal harm [(68, 71)](#reference68). Vitamin B6 was included in the medication Bendectin (a delayed-release formulation of 10 mg doxylamine succinate [an antihistamine] and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride [vitamin B6]), which was prescribed for the treatment of morning sickness and later withdrawn from the market in 1983 due to unproven concerns that it increased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of birth defects [(72)](#reference72). Since that time, several investigations have shown the combination of doxylamine/pyridoxine to be both effective and safe, and in 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration approved this same formulation for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (reviewed in [73](#reference73) and [74](#reference74)). The American and Canadian Colleges of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics recommend the combination of doxylamine/pyridoxine as first-line therapy for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (reviewed in [75](#reference75)). The tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for vitamin B6 during pregnancy is 80 to 100 mg/day; see [Table 2](#table-2). In humans, [vitamin B](../vitamins/vitamin-B12)12 is needed as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for two converts [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) to the [amino [methionine](../glossary#methionine). Methionine is required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor used in many biological [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions [(76)](#reference76). [DNA](../glossary#DNA) methylation that occurs development modulates [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), and the formation of organs [(77)](#reference77). Thus, adequate vitamin B12 status during pregnancy is critical. Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B12 causes elevated homocysteine concentrations, which have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), premature delivery, low placental weight, low birth weight, very low birth weight (<1,500 grams), small for [gestational](../glossary#gestation) age, [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTDs), stillbirth [(48-50)](#reference48). Moreover, low [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of vitamin B12 during pregnancy have been linked to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for NTDs [(78)](#reference78), and there is concern that folic acid supplementation during pregnancy may mask the clinical diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. For these reasons, adequate vitamin B12 intake during pregnancy ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)=2.6 g/day) is important. To ensure a daily intake of 6 to 30 g of vitamin B12 in a form that is easily absorbed, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that women who are planning a pregnancy take a daily multivitamin supplement or eat a breakfast cereal [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with vitamin B12 (for more information, see the article on [Vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12#LPI-recommendation)). Because [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) [(79)](#reference79), nutritional status of the two [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) vitamins, [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) and [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E), may be important in preventing the condition. These vitamins have other biological functions; for more information, see the separate articles on [Vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C#function) and [Vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E#function). Several trials have investigated whether [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with vitamins C and E improves pregnancy-associated [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) or preeclampsia, but evidence supporting such an effect is largely lacking. An early [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial found that supplementation with 1,000 mg/day of vitamin C and 400 mg of vitamin E (RRR--tocopherol) was associated with a 61% reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia in women at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for the condition [(80)](#reference80). However, more recent [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have not found supplementation at these dosages to be effective in preventing preeclampsia in high- or low-risk women [(81-84)](#reference81). Nevertheless, adequate intake of antioxidant vitamins is important throughout pregnancy. According to data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 42%-46% and 85%-94% of US adults do not meet the estimated average requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) for vitamin C and vitamin E, respectively [(85)](#reference85). The Linus Pauling Institute's recommends that adults, including pregnant women, reach daily intakes of at least 400 mg of vitamin C and 15 mg (22.5 IU) of vitamin E. In 2010, the FNB of the Institute of Medicine set the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) at 15 g (600 IU)/day for all pregnant women [(86)](#reference86). The FNB based this recommendation on a limited number of studies using bone health as the only indicator, assuming minimal sun exposure. Vitamin D, however, has a number of other roles in disease prevention and health (see the article on [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D#disease-prevention)), and several vitamin D researchers believe that vitamin D requirements for adults, including pregnant women, are higher than the current RDA [(87-91)](#reference87). Moreover, a number of studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are quite common among pregnant women [(92-101)](#reference92). Low vitamin D status in pregnancy has been associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. For pregnant women, vitamin D deficiency ( [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D less than 50 nmol/L [20 ng/mL]) has been associated with an increased risk of [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) and [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(102, 103)](#reference102). For infants, low maternal vitamin D status has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight (a newborn weighing less than 2,500 grams) [(104-106)](#reference104). A pooled analysis of 15 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) concluded that vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) raises serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D during pregnancy and may reduce the risk of preeclampsia, low birth weight, and preterm birth; notably, combined supplementation of vitamin D and calcium may increase the risk of preterm birth [(107)](#reference107). Vitamin D is found in very few foods, and prenatal supplements often contain only 10 g (400 IU) of vitamin D. Sunlight exposure is the main source of the vitamin: vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in skin cells following exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation. However, the contribution of sun exposure to vitamin D status depends on many factors, including latitude, skin color, amount of skin exposed, duration of exposure, and the use of sunscreens, which effectively block skin production of vitamin D. Thus, vitamin D supplementation throughout pregnancy is likely needed to achieve body concentrations thought to benefit fetal and maternal health. The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that generally healthy adults, including pregnant women, take 2,000 IU (50 g) of supplemental vitamin D daily. Because sun exposure, diet, skin color, and [obesity](../glossary#obesity) have variable, substantial impact on body vitamin D concentrations, measuring serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D \u2014 the clinical indicator of vitamin D status \u2014 is important. The Linus Pauling Institute recommends aiming for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). The adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) for [vitamin K](../vitamins/vitamin-K) (90 g/day for women aged 19-50 years and 75 g/day for those aged 14-18 years) is not increased during pregnancy, and a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) has not been set for vitamin K. However, if taken during pregnancy, a number of drugs, including warfarin, rifampin, isoniazid, and anticonvulsants, may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of neonatal vitamin K deficiency and [hemorrhagic](../glossary#hemorrhage) disease of the newborn [(108)](#reference108). [Placental](../glossary#placenta) transfer of vitamin K is low, thus all infants are born with low concentrations of vitamin K. A small proportion of newborns (0.25 to 1.1%) does not have enough vitamin K to make their blood clot and may develop vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) [(109)](#reference109). There are three categories of VKDB depending on the age of onset: early (0-24 hours), classic (one to seven days), and late (two to 12 weeks) [(110-112)](#reference110). Early VKDB is seen mainly in infants of mothers taking drugs that inhibit vitamin K, as listed above. Classic VKDB is more common and presents as bruising, [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) blood loss, or bleeding from the umbilicus, skin, or site of circumcision. Late VKDB is particularly concerning as it can lead to life-threatening intracranial bleeding. [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have demonstrated that prophylactic intramuscular (IM) vitamin K injection of the newborn raises [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin K concentration, reduces PIVKA II (a marker of vitamin K deficiency), improves prothrombin time, and decreases the risk of classic VKDB compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) (reviewed in [111](#reference111)). Administration of multiple oral doses of vitamin K can reduce PIVKA II concentrations and raise plasma vitamin K concentration but is associated with an increased incidence of late VKDB [(109](#reference109), [111, 113)](#reference111). The American Academy of Pediatrics and several international professional organizations recommend that all babies receive 0.5 to 1.0 mg intramuscular vitamin K1 injection shortly after birth to prevent VKDB [(109, 110](#reference109), [114)](#reference114). Although 200 to 250 mg/day of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) is transferred to the fetus, primarily in the last trimester, dietary intake requirements of calcium are not increased due to maternal physiological adaptations. In particular, the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption doubles during pregnancy, and the [mineral](../glossary#mineral) can also be transiently mobilized from maternal stores (i.e., the skeleton) to support fetal needs for calcium. Permanent demineralization of bone during pregnancy has not been observed [(86](#reference86), [115)](#reference115). Moreover, there is no evidence from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that calcium supplementation during pregnancy confers any benefit to maternal or fetal bone health [(116, 117)](#reference116). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) is 1,300 mg/day for women aged 14-18 years and 1,000 mg/day for women aged 19-50 years. Calcium intake during pregnancy, however, may influence the [risk](../glossary#risk) for pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). PIH, which occurs in 10% of pregnancies and is a major health risk for pregnant women and the fetus, is a term that includes [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), and [eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia). Gestational hypertension is defined as an abnormally high blood pressure that usually develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. In addition to gestational hypertension, preeclampsia includes the development of [edema](../glossary#edema) (severe swelling) and proteinuria ( [protein](../glossary#protein) in the urine). Preeclampsia may progress to eclampsia in which life-threatening convulsions and coma may occur [(118)](#reference118). Risk factors for PIH include first pregnancies, multiple gestations (e.g., twins or triplets), chronic high blood pressure, [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and some [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease). Although the cause of PIH is not entirely understood, calcium [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) appears to play a role. Low calcium intake during pregnancy may: (1) stimulate [parathyroid](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) release, thereby increasing intracellular calcium and vascular smooth muscle contractility; and/or (2) stimulate renin release, leading to [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction) and retention of [sodium](../minerals/sodium) and fluid [(119)](#reference119). Data from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggest an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between dietary calcium intake and the incidence of PIH [(120)](#reference120). Additionally, a recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled (RCTs) reported that calcium supplementation during pregnancy (1,000 mg/day) was associated with a 35% lower risk of high blood pressure and a 55% lower risk of preeclampsia; the risk reduction for preeclampsia was even stronger for women considered to be at high risk for the condition (78% lower risk compared to placebo) and women with low dietary intake of calcium (64% lower risk compared to placebo) [(121)](#reference121). This analysis also found that calcium supplementation lowered the risk of preterm birth by 24%, but no significant effect of calcium supplementation was found regarding the risk of stillbirth, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, or neonatal mortality before hospital discharge. Of four RCTs that monitored maternal death or serious morbidity, one RCT [(122)](#reference122) reported a 20% reduced risk for the \"severe maternal morbidity and mortality index\" (a summary indicator defined as the presence of at least one of the following outcomes: maternal admission to intensive care or any special care unit, eclampsia, severe preeclampsia, [placental](../glossary#placenta) abruption, HELLP [platelet](../glossary#platelet) count], [renal](../glossary#renal) failure, or death) with calcium supplementation; no events occurred in the other three RCTs [(121)](#reference121). [Chromium](../minerals/chromium) is known to enhance the action of [insulin](../glossary#insulin); therefore, several studies have investigated the utility of chromium [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) for the control of blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations in type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) (see the article on [Chromium](../minerals/chromium#type-2-diabetes-treatment)). However, its use in [gestational](../glossary#gestation) diabetes \u2014 a condition that affects 4.6%-9.2% of all pregnancies in the US [(123)](#reference123) \u2014 has not been well studied. Gestational diabetes is a glucose intolerance that usually appears in the second or third trimester of pregnancy; blood glucose concentrations must be tightly controlled to prevent adverse effects on the developing fetus and other pregnancy complications. After delivery, glucose tolerance generally reverts to normal, but women are at a heightened [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes [(124)](#reference124). In fact, a recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) found that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in women diagnosed with gestational diabetes is more than 7-fold higher than women not diagnosed with gestational diabetes [(125)](#reference125). Gestational diabetes is also considered a risk factor for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(124)](#reference124). Two [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found that [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of chromium in pregnant women were not associated with glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes [(126, 127)](#reference126), although serum chromium concentrations may not necessarily reflect tissue chromium concentrations. An eight-week [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 24 women with gestational diabetes found that supplementation in the form of chromium picolinate (4 g/day of chromium per kilogram of body weight) was associated with lower fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations [(128)](#reference128). However, it is important to note that insulin therapy was still required to normalize the severely elevated blood glucose concentrations. Thus, more research, especially from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), is needed to determine whether chromium supplementation has any utility in the treatment of gestational diabetes. [Iodine](../minerals/iodine) requirements are increased by more than 45% during pregnancy: the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for pregnant women is 220 g/day compared to 150 g/day for women who are not pregnant. Adequate intake of this [mineral](../glossary#mineral) is needed for maternal [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../glossary#hormone) production, and thyroid hormone is needed for [myelination](../glossary#myelination) of the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) and is thus essential for normal fetal brain development [(129)](#reference129). If iodine deficiency leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormone during pregnancy, irreversible brain damage in the fetus may occur [(130)](#reference130). Severe maternal iodine deficiency has also been associated with increased incidence of miscarriage, stillbirth, and birth defects [(131)](#reference131). One of the most devastating effects of severe maternal iodine deficiency is [congenital hypothyroidism](../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) [(132)](#reference132). A severe form of congenital hypothyroidism may lead to a condition that is sometimes referred to as [cretinism](../glossary#cretinism) and result in irreversible mental retardation. Cretinism occurs in two forms, [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) and myxedematous, although there is considerable overlap between them. The neurologic form is characterized by mental and physical retardation and deafness; it results from maternal iodine deficiency that affects the fetus before its own thyroid is functional. The myxedematous or hypothyroid form is characterized by short stature and mental retardation [(133)](#reference133). Severe maternal iodine deficiency has also been linked to neurocognitive deficits in the offspring [(134)](#reference134). In severely iodine-deficient pregnant women, iodine [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) effectively reduces rates of cretinism, and improves offspring cognitive function and survival (reviewed in [135](#reference135)). The timing of iodine supplementation appears to be important: supplementation should be initiated prior to conception and early in pregnancy (before the 10th week of [gestation](../glossary#gestation)) in order to see beneficial effects on offspring neurocognitive outcomes [(135)](#reference135). Even mild forms of maternal iodine deficiency may have adverse effects on cognitive development in the offspring [(136)](#reference136), though this outcome is less well studied. [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) conducted in moderately iodine deficient pregnant women demonstrate that iodine supplementation increases thyroid gland volume but has no effect on thyroid hormone concentrations compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) (reviewed in [130](#reference130) and [135](#reference135)). The extent to which supplementation in moderately iodine deficient pregnant women affects neurocognitive outcomes in their offspring is currently under investigation [(137)](#reference137). Iodine deficiency is now accepted as the most common cause of preventable brain damage in the world [(131)](#reference131). Thus, adequate intake of the mineral throughout pregnancy is critical. A daily supplement providing 150 g of iodine, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association [(138)](#reference138), will help to ensure that US pregnant women consume sufficient iodine. However, it is important to note that several prenatal supplements and some multivitamin/mineral supplements on the market in the US do not contain iodine [(139)](#reference139), presumably because manufacturers assume that women receive sufficient iodine through iodized salt and other food sources. For more information on iodine and iodine deficiency disorders, see the article on [Iodine](../minerals/iodine#deficiency). [Iron](../minerals/iron) requirements are significantly increased during pregnancy: the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) is 27 mg/day for pregnant women of all ages compared to 15 to 18 mg/day for nonpregnant women. Many women have dietary iron intakes below current recommendations. National surveys in the US indicate that the average dietary iron intake is about 12 mg/day in nonpregnant women and 15 mg/day in pregnant women [(140)](#reference140). Iron is needed for a number of biological functions (see the article on [Iron](../minerals/iron#function)), but during pregnancy, the [mineral](../glossary#mineral) is generally needed to support growth and development of the fetus and [placenta](../glossary#placenta) and to meet the increased demand for red blood cells to transport oxygen. Intestinal absorption of dietary iron increases during the second and third trimesters to accommodate for expansion of red cell mass [(140)](#reference140). Maternal blood volume expands by almost 50% during pregnancy, which results in a hemodilution of red blood cells [(141)](#reference141). Despite maternal physiologic changes that enhance iron absorption, many women develop iron-deficiency or iron-deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) during pregnancy. The World Health Organization estimates that the worldwide [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of anemia among pregnant women is 42%; the prevalence of anemia is much higher in less developed nations compared with industrialized nations, with almost 90% of these anemic women living in Africa or Asia [(142)](#reference142). In pregnant women in the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency is 18%, and the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia is 5% [(143)](#reference143). Anemias can be caused by deficiencies in other micronutrients, such as [folate](../vitamins/folate) or [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12), but iron deficiency is the primary cause of anemia during pregnancy [(1)](#references). Severe iron-deficiency anemia has been associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of maternal death [(142)](#reference142) and with an increased risk of low birth weight infants (<2,500 grams), premature delivery, and perinatal mortality [(144)](#reference144). Two 2015 [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) evaluated the effect of routine iron [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) or no treatment on maternal and birth outcomes [(145, 146)](#reference145). Both reviews found that routine supplementation with iron improved maternal iron status and decreased the risk of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia at term. There is some indication that maternal iron supplementation could improve birth outcomes (namely preterm birth and low birth weight) in developing countries, but the evidence was deemed of low quality [(146)](#reference146). Women taking higher doses of iron (60 mg/day) tended to have abnormally high [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) values at term and were more likely to report side effects [(146)](#reference146); side effects of high-dose iron supplements include nausea, constipation, vomiting, and diarrhea. Iron status of the woman at the time of conception is important for a healthy pregnancy, to avoid postpartum anemia, and to provide the breast-feeding infant with sufficient iron stores until six months of age, when complementary feeding is recommended. Because of the increased demands for the mineral during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, iron supplementation (30 mg/day) is usually recommended beginning at 12 weeks' [gestation](../glossary#gestation) [(147)](#reference147). Absorption of nonheme iron, which is the form of iron found in supplements, is affected by a number of enhancers (e.g., [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C)) as well as inhibitors (e.g., polyphenols found in [tea](../food-beverages/tea) and [coffee](../food-beverages/coffee)). In general, iron supplements are better absorbed on an empty stomach. High doses of iron supplements taken together with [zinc](../minerals/zinc) supplements on an empty stomach can inhibit the absorption of zinc [(140](#reference140), [148)](#reference148); supplemental iron at 38 to 65 mg/day of elemental iron may decrease zinc absorption [(149)](#reference149). For more information about dietary and supplemental sources of iron, as well as the side effects and safety of iron, see the article on [Iron](../minerals/iron). The [mineral](../glossary#mineral) [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium) plays a number of important roles in the structure and the function of the human body (see the article on [Magnesium](../minerals/magnesium#function)), and adequate intake of the mineral is needed for normal embryonic and fetal development. National dietary surveys indicate that magnesium insufficiency is relatively common in the US, with 56% of American adults not meeting the [EAR](../glossary#EAR) \u2014 the nutrient intake value that is estimated to meet the requirement of half of the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group [(150)](#reference150). Good sources of magnesium include green leafy vegetables, [whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains), and [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts) (see the article on [Magnesium](../minerals/magnesium#food-sources)). Several multivitamin/mineral and prenatal [supplements](../glossary#supplement) do not contain magnesium or contain no more than 100 mg of magnesium. Preeclampsia-eclampsia is a disease that is unique to pregnancy and may occur anytime after 20 weeks' gestation. [Preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) is defined as the presence of elevated blood pressure and [protein](../glossary#protein) in the urine; severe swelling ( [edema](../glossary#edema)) may also be present. [Eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia) occurs with the addition of seizures to these symptoms. Approximately 5%-8% of women with preeclampsia go on to develop eclampsia in developing countries, which is a significant cause of maternal death [(84)](#reference84). A 2014 pooled analysis of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) concluded that oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy has no significant effect on perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational age, or the [risk](../glossary#risk) of preeclampsia [(151)](#reference151). [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of high-dose magnesium sulfate has been the treatment of choice for preventing eclamptic seizures that may occur in association with preeclampsia-eclampsia in late pregnancy or during labor [(152-154)](#reference152). Magnesium is believed to relieve [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) blood vessel spasm and promote peripheral [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation), thereby increasing blood flow to the brain [(155-157)](#reference155). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for [zinc](../minerals/zinc) is increased during pregnancy (from 8 mg/day-9 mg/day to 11 mg/day-12 mg/day), and pregnant women, especially teenagers, are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of zinc deficiency. It has been estimated that 82% of pregnant women in the world may have inadequate intake of dietary zinc [(158)](#reference158), leading to poor nutritional status of the [mineral](../glossary#mineral). Poor nutritional status of zinc during pregnancy has been associated with a number of adverse outcomes, including low birth weight (<2,500 grams), premature delivery, labor and delivery complications, and [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) [(159)](#reference159). However, the results of maternal zinc [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) trials in the US and developing countries have been mixed [(160)](#reference160). A 2014 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 16 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that zinc supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a 14% reduction in premature deliveries; the lower incidence of preterm births was observed mainly in low-income women [(161)](#reference161). This analysis, however, did not find zinc supplementation to benefit other indicators of maternal or infant health. It is important to note that supplemental levels of iron (38 to 65 mg/day of elemental iron), but not dietary levels of iron, may decrease zinc absorption [(149)](#reference149). Because iron supplementation is often recommended during pregnancy (see [Iron](#iron) above), pregnant women who take more than 60 mg/day of elemental iron may want to take a prenatal or [multivitamin-mineral supplement](../health-disease/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) that also includes zinc [(162)](#reference162). Choline can be [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by the body in small amounts, but dietary intake is needed to maintain health [(163)](#reference163). Choline is essential for embryonic and fetal brain development, liver function, and [placental](../glossary#placenta) function [(164)](#reference164). The choline [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) betaine is a groups for methylation reactions; [DNA](../glossary#DNA) methylation modulates [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), and the formation of organs [(77)](#reference77). A mother delivers large amounts of choline to the fetus across the [placenta](../glossary#placeta) and to the infant via breast milk, placing an increased demand on maternal stores of choline during pregnancy and lactation [(164)](#reference164). The induction of [de novo](../glossary#de-vovo-synthesis) choline synthesis by the high levels of [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) during pregnancy helps to meet this increased demand [(165)](#reference165). Additionally, pregnant women are encouraged to consume choline-rich foods, such as eggs, meat, and seafood (for dietary sources, see the article on [Choline](../other-nutrients/choline#food-sources)). The adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) for pregnant women is 450 mg/day of choline, slightly higher than the 425 mg/day recommended for nonpregnant women [(166)](#reference166). [Case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) have reported mixed results regarding the relationship between dietary choline intake or blood choline concentration and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTDs). One case-control study reported a lower risk of having an NTD-affected pregnancy in those with the highest intake of betaine and choline combined [(167)](#reference167), while two other studies found no association between maternal choline intake and NTD risk [(168, 169)](#reference168). Similarly, one case-control study found low [serum](../glossary#serum) choline concentration was associated with a higher risk of NTDs [(170)](#reference170), while another study found no such association [(171)](#reference171). Additionally, it is not known if [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with choline or betaine, like supplementation with folic acid (see [Folate](#folate) above), will lower the incidence of NTDs. More research is needed to determine whether choline is involved in the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of NTDs. Maternal intake of choline during pregnancy could possibly affect [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) abilities of the offspring. Choline supplementation in pregnant rats, as well as rat pups during the first month of life, leads to improved performance in spatial memory tests months after choline supplementation has been discontinued [(172)](#reference172). A review by McCann et al. discusses the experimental evidence from rodent studies regarding the availability of choline during prenatal development and cognitive function in the offspring [(173)](#reference173). It is not clear whether findings in rodent studies are applicable to humans. One [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) demonstrated that choline supplementation (750 mg/day of choline in the form of phosphatidylcholine administered from week 18 of [gestation](../glossary#gestation) through 90 days postpartum) in pregnant women consuming a moderate-choline diet (approximately 360 mg/day) was safe but did not enhance infant cognitive function at 10 or 12 months of age [(174)](#reference174). Finally, choline is important for [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) during pregnancy. Methyl groups derived from choline may be used to convert homocysteine to [methionine](../glossary#methionine). Elevated blood homocysteine concentrations have been associated with increased risk of [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), premature delivery, low placental weight, low birth weight (<2,500 grams), very low birth weight (<1,500 grams), small for gestational age, NTDs, and stillbirth [(48-50)](#reference48). Although not [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient), certain [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) are required in the maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation; the US Institute of Medicine's adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) recommendations for omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation are listed in the separate article on [Essential Fatty Acids](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#US-IOM-recommendation). For more information on the importance of omega-3 fatty acids during these life stages, see two sections in the separate article on essential fatty acids: [Visual and neurological development](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#visual-neurological-development) and [Pregnancy and lactation](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#pregnancy-lactation-safety). Information about environmental contaminants in fish and supplements is included in the sections, [Contaminants in because data are lacking | bApplies to the synthetic form in fortified foods and supplements cApplies to only preformed vitamin A (retinol) dApplies to any form of supplemental -tocopherol eApplies only to the supplemental form fConsidered an essential nutrient, although not strictly a micronutrient Breast-feeding confers health benefits to the child, as well as the mother [(175)](#reference175). Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrition for the infant and also contains a number of bioactive compounds important in immunity, such as [antibodies](../glossary#antibody), [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) agents, and oligosaccharides [(176)](#reference176). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breast-feeding for the first six months of infancy, followed by continued breast-feeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breast-feeding until 12 months postpartum or longer as mutually desired by the mother and child [(177)](#reference177). The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breast-feeding for the first six months of life and continued breast-feeding, with complementary feeding, up to two years or more postpartum [(178)](#reference178). There are, however, a few exceptions when breast-feeding is contraindicated, including those listed on the [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/index.htm). Lactation is extremely energy expensive (exceeding pre-pregnancy demands by approximately 500 kcal/day), and [macronutrient](../glossary#macronutrient) requirements for breast-feeding women are even higher than during pregnancy [(175)](#reference175). Likewise, the intake recommendations ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA) or [AI](../glossary#AI)) for most [micronutrients](../glossary#micronutrient), which are based on amounts secreted in breast milk, are higher for lactating women compared to pregnant women (see [Table 3](#table-3)). One notable exception is the RDA for iron, which is significantly lower during lactation (9 to 10 mg/day) compared to pregnancy (27 mg/day) [(140)](#reference140). Breast milk is considered to be low in iron; however, the iron content of breast milk is not influenced by changes in maternal iron status, such as through maternal supplementation [(59)](#reference59). The RDA for folate is also lower during lactation compared with pregnancy. Dietary intake recommendations for calcium remain unchanged for lactating women compared to recommendations for nonlactating women, and calcium content in breast milk does not reflect maternal intake of the [mineral](../glossary#mineral). Adequate calcium is maintained in breast milk because of maternal physiological changes that involve transient bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption); increased maternal intake of calcium through diet and [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) does not prevent maternal bone demineralization, and studies have shown that maternal bone mineral content is restored upon weaning [(179)](#reference179). In general, the amounts of water-soluble [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) (B vitamins and vitamin C) in breast milk reflect maternal intake from diet and/or [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Thus, meeting daily intake recommendations for these micronutrients is important for the health of the child. Maternal vitamin deficiencies can negatively affect infant growth and development; for instance, [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) deficiency during infancy can impair brain development and cause [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) problems [(180)](#reference180). Vitamin B12 deficiency has been documented in nursing infants of mothers who have untreated [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia) and also in women who are strict vegetarians (vegans) [(181)](#reference181). Vitamin B12 is found only in foods of animal origin and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods, and lactating women who follow vegetarian diets should take supplemental vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency that results from pernicious anemia can easily be corrected with high-dose daily supplementation or with monthly intramuscular injections of the vitamin (see the article on [Vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12#pernicious-anemia)). However, there has been relatively little research on the effect of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in lactating women, and it has been suggested that supplementation during lactation may be too late to restore adequate milk concentrations and infant status [(182)](#reference182). Supplementation during pregnancy may more effectively improve infant vitamin B12 status. For instance, oral daily vitamin B12 supplementation (50 g/day) administered from <14 weeks [gestation](../glossary#gestation) through 6 weeks postpartum significantly increased maternal [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and breast milk concentrations of vitamin B12 and improved infant vitamin B12 status [(183)](#reference183). The concentrations of other water-soluble vitamins in breast milk, including [thiamin](../vitamins/thiamin), [riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin), and [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6), are also strongly dependent on maternal intake of these vitamins [(59](#reference59), [182)](#reference182). Likewise, vitamin C concentration in human milk varies with the vitamin C status of the mother. Vitamin C supplementation can moderately increase concentrations of the vitamin in breast milk, especially in lactating women with poor vitamin C status [(184)](#reference184), and maternal intakes of 100 mg/day maximize the amount of vitamin C in breast milk [(185)](#reference185). Compared to water-soluble vitamins, the concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) in breast milk are less correlated with maternal dietary intake. The RDA for vitamin A during lactation is 1,200 to 1,300 g/day (4,000 to 4,333 IU/day). At such levels of maternal intake, breast milk is a good source of [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) and provides the infant with a sufficient amount of the vitamin [(186)](#reference186). In contrast, breast milk is considered to be low in vitamins D and K. [Vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) concentrations in human milk are dependent on maternal vitamin D status, which is determined by the woman's sun exposure and dietary and supplemental intake. Vitamin D concentrations are low in breast milk, presumably because many women have insufficient vitamin D status. Vitamin D supplementation during lactation has been shown to improve vitamin D status in the woman and the infant [(187)](#reference187). The RDA for lactating women is 600 IU/day of vitamin D, but intake at this level in the absence of sun exposure likely results in insufficient amounts for the infant. To prevent vitamin D deficiency and rickets in infants, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all breast-fed and partially breast-fed infants be given a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day [(177)](#reference177). Liquid vitamin D supplements are commercially available for infant supplementation. The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that all adults take 2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D and aim for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). Human milk is also relatively low in [vitamin K](../vitamins/vitamin-K). Thus, exclusively breast-fed newborns are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for vitamin K deficiency. In general, newborns have low vitamin K status for the following reasons: (1) vitamin K is not easily transported across the [placental](../glossary#placenta) barrier; (2) the newborn's intestines are not yet colonized with [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin K; and (3) the vitamin K cycle may not be fully functional in newborns, especially premature infants [(188)](#reference188). Vitamin K deficiency in newborns may result in a bleeding disorder called vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). Because VKDB is life-threatening and easily prevented, the American Academy of Pediatrics and a number of similar international organizations recommend that an injection of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) be administered to all newborns shortly after birth [(110](#reference110), [114](#reference114), [177)](#reference177). Additionally, the [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) content in breast milk varies with maternal diet and vitamin E supplement use [(184, 186)](#reference184). The RDA for vitamin E during lactation is 19 mg/day (28.5 IU/day) of -tocopherol. National surveys indicate that more than 90% of US adults have daily vitamin E intakes below 12 mg (18 IU) [(85)](#reference85). Maternal dietary intake recommendations for the 14 essential minerals during lactation are shown in Table 3. The content of minerals in breast milk does not correlate well with maternal intake or status, except for [iodine](../minerals/iodine) and [selenium](../minerals/selenium) [(1](#references), [176)](#reference176). Iodine requirements are increased during lactation: breast-feeding women require 290 g/day of iodine compared to 220 g/day for pregnant women and 150 g/day for nonpregnant, nonlactating women [(129)](#reference129). Iodine-deficient women who are breast-feeding may not be able to provide sufficient iodine to their infants who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of iodine deficiency (see the article on [Iodine](../minerals/iodine#deficiency-pregnancy-lactation)). A daily supplement providing 150 g of iodine, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association [(138)](#reference138), will help to ensure that US breast-feeding women consume sufficient iodine during these critical periods. Additionally, the RDA for selenium is slightly higher for lactating women (from 60 to 70 g/day), and selenium content in breast milk reflects maternal intake [(189)](#reference189). |Micronutrient||Age||RDA| |Biotin||14-50 years|| 35 g/day ( | intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for each micronutrient is shown in the Table 4.

For each [micronutrient](../glossary#micronutrient), the Food and Nutrition Board of the [Institute of Medicine](http://iom.nationalacademies.org/) establishes a recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) or adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)). Generally, the Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendations of the Food and Nutrition Board, but any discrepancies in dietary recommendations are listed in the rightmost column of the table. Additionally, more information on the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation for a specific micronutrient can be found by clicking on the name of the micronutrient of interest. |Food and Nutrition Board Recommendations (RDA except where otherwise noted)||Linus Pauling Institute Recommendation| |Micronutrient||Men||Women| |Vitamins| | | Presently, there is no indication that older adults have an increased requirement for [biotin](../vitamins/biotin). If dietary biotin intake is not sufficient, a daily [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) will generally provide an intake of at least 30 g/day of biotin. The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adults take a 400 g [supplement](../glossary#supplement) of folic acid daily, in addition to [folate](../vitamins/folate) and folic acid consumed in the diet. A daily [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), containing 100% of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for folic acid provides 400 g of folic acid. Even with a larger than average intake of folic acid from [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food, it is unlikely that an individual's daily folic acid intake would regularly exceed the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) of 1,000 g/day established by the Food and Nutrition Board. The recommendation for 400 g/day of supplemental folic acid as part of a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, in addition to a folate-rich diet, is especially important for older adults because blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels tend to increase with age. Dietary surveys indicate that 15% to 25% of older adults do not consume enough [niacin](../vitamins/niacin) in their diets to meet the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (16 mg NE/day for men and 14 mg NE/day for women), and that dietary intake of niacin decreases between the ages of 60 and 90 years. Thus, it is advisable for older adults to supplement their dietary intake with a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which will generally provide at least 20 mg of niacin daily. Presently, there is little evidence that older adults differ in their intake or requirement for [pantothenic acid](../vitamins/pantothenic-acid). Most [multivitamin/mineral supplements](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) provide at least 5 mg/day of pantothenic acid. The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation by the Food and Nutrition Board of 5 mg/day of pantothenic acid for older adults. A varied diet should provide enough pantothenic acid for most people. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, containing 100% of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)), will ensure an intake of at least 5 mg/day of pantothenic acid. Some experts in nutrition and aging feel that the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of riboflavin (1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women) leaves little margin for error in people over 50 years of age [(1, 2)](#references). A study of independently living people between 65 and 90 years of age found that almost 25% consumed less than the recommended [riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin) intake, and 10% had biochemical evidence of that riboflavin 1.6 to 2.2 mg/day may reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing age-related cataracts. Additionally, older people suffering from acute [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) were found to be deficient for riboflavin [(4)](#reference4), and riboflavin deficiency has been linked to a higher risk of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in postmenopausal women with the MTHFR 677T variant [(5)](#reference5). Individuals whose diets may not supply adequate riboflavin, especially those over 50 years of age, should consider taking a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which generally provides at least 1.7 mg/day of riboflavin. Presently, there is no evidence that the requirement for [thiamin](../vitamins/thiamin) is increased in older adults, but some studies have found inadequate dietary intake and thiamin insufficiency to be more common in elderly populations [(2)](#reference2). Thus, it would be prudent for older adults to take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which will generally provide at least 1.5 mg of thiamin/day. Presently, there is little evidence that the requirement for [vitamin A](../vitamins/vitamin-A) in older adults differs from that of younger adults. Additionally, vitamin A toxicity may occur at lower doses in older adults than in younger adults. Further, data from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggested an inverse association between intakes of preformed vitamin A in excess of 1,500 g RAE (5,000 IU)/day and [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older people (see the [Safety](../vitamins/vitamin-A#safety) section in the article on Vitamin A). Yet, following the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) daily could supply as much as 5,000 IU/day of retinol, the amount that has been associated with adverse effects on bone health in older adults. For this reason, we recommend taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement that provides no more than 2,500 IU (750 g) of preformed vitamin A (usually labeled vitamin A acetate or vitamin A palmitate) and no more than 2,500 IU of additional vitamin A as -carotene. As for all age groups, high potency vitamin A supplements should not be used without medical supervision due to the risk of toxicity. Early metabolic studies have indicated that the requirement for [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6) in older adults is approximately 2 mg daily [(6)](#reference6). Yet, the analysis of the US population survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 showed that adequate vitamin B6 status and low homocysteine levels were associated with total vitamin B6 intakes equal to and above 3 mg/day in people aged 65 years and older [(7)](#reference7). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that older adults take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which provides at least 2.0 mg of vitamin B6 daily. Because [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) malabsorption and vitamin B12 deficiency are more common in older adults, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adults older than 50 years take 100 to 400 g/day of supplemental vitamin B12. Although it is not yet known with certainty whether older adults have higher requirements for [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C), some older populations have been found to have vitamin C intakes considerably below the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of 75 and 90 mg/day for women and men, respectively. A vitamin C intake of at least 400 mg daily may be particularly important for older adults who are at higher [risk](../glossary#risk) for age-related [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease). In addition, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 36 publications examining the relationship between vitamin C intake and [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of vitamin C concluded that older adults (aged 60-96 years) have considerably lower plasma levels of vitamin C following a certain intake of vitamin C compared with younger individuals (aged 15-65 years) [(8)](#reference8), suggesting that older adults have higher vitamin C requirements. [Pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies in older adults have not yet been conducted, but evidence suggests that the efficiency of one of the molecular mechanisms for the cellular uptake of vitamin C declines with age [(9)](#reference9). Because maximizing blood levels of vitamin C may be important in protection against [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to cells and biological molecules, a vitamin C intake of at least 400 mg daily is particularly important for older adults who are at higher risk for chronic diseases caused, in part, by oxidative damage, such as heart disease, [stroke](../glossary#stroke), certain [cancers](../glossary#cancer), and [cataract](../glossary#cataract). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that generally healthy adults take 2,000 IU (50 g) of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) [vitamin D](../vitamins/vitamin-D) daily. Most multivitamins contain 400 IU of vitamin D, and single ingredient vitamin D supplements are available for additional supplementation. Sun exposure, diet, skin color, and [obesity](../glossary#obesity) have variable, substantial impact on body vitamin D levels. To adjust for individual differences and ensure adequate body vitamin D status, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends aiming for a [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 80 nmol/L (32 ng/mL). Numerous [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 80 nmol/L (32 ng/mL) and above are associated with reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of bone [fractures](../glossary#fracture), several [cancers](../glossary#cancer), [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis), (insulin-dependent) [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU (50 g) of vitamin D is especially important for older adults because aging is associated with a reduced capacity to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin D in the skin upon sun exposure. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for adults of all ages is 15 mg (22.5 IU) per day of [-tocopherol](../vitamins/vitamin-E#alpha-tocopherol-function). Notably, more than 90% of individuals aged two years and older in the US do not meet the daily requirement for [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) from food sources alone. Major sources of vitamin E in the American diet are vegetable oils, nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables. LPI recommends that healthy older adults take a daily [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which usually contains 30 IU of synthetic vitamin E, or 90% of the RDA. Older adults are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture). Because adequate intake of [vitamin K](../vitamins/vitamin-K) is essential in maintaining bone health, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adults take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) and consume at least one cup of dark green leafy vegetables daily. Although the AI for vitamin K was recently increased, it is not clear if it will be enough to optimize the - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of vitamin K-dependent [proteins ](../glossary#protein)in bone (see the section on [Osteoporosis](../vitamins/vitamin-K#osteoporosis-prevention) in the article on vitamin K). Multivitamins generally contain 10 to 25 g of vitamin K, whereas vitamin K or \"bone\" supplements may contain 100 to 120 g of vitamin K. To consume the amount of vitamin K associated with a decreased risk of hip fracture in the Framingham Heart Study (about 250 g/day) [(10)](#reference10), an individual would need to eat a little more than \u00bd cup of chopped broccoli or a large salad of mixed greens every day. In addition to taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement and eating at least one cup of dark green leafy vegetables daily, replacing dietary [saturated fat](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) (e.g., butter and cheese) with [monounsaturated fat](../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid) (e.g., olive and canola oils) will increase dietary vitamin K intake and may also decrease the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). To minimize bone loss, older men (>70 years) and postmenopausal women should consume a total (diet plus [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) of 1,200 mg/day of [calcium](../minerals/calcium). Men aged 51-70 years should consume 1,000 mg of calcium per day. No [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) contains the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for calcium (1,000-1,200 mg/day) because the resulting pill would be too large to swallow. If your total daily calcium intake doesn't add up to 1,000 mg, LPI recommends taking an extra calcium supplement with a meal. Although the requirement for [chromium](../minerals/chromium) is not known to be higher for older adults, one study found that chromium concentrations in hair, sweat, and urine decreased with age [(11)](#reference11). Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) containing 100% of the daily values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of most nutrients should provide sufficient chromium for most older adults. Because [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and [type 2 diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) are associated with potentially serious health problems, individuals considering high-dose chromium supplementation to treat either condition should do so in collaboration with a qualified health care provider. Aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for [copper](../minerals/copper) [(12)](#reference12); thus, the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation for copper intake in older adults is the same as younger adults. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for copper (900 g/day for all adults) is sufficient to prevent deficiency, but the lack of clear indicators of copper nutritional status in humans makes it difficult to determine the level of copper intake most likely to promote optimum health or prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). A varied diet should provide enough copper for most people. For those who are concerned that their diet may not provide adequate copper, a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) will generally provide at least the RDA for copper. The safety and public health benefits of optimally [fluoridated](../minerals/fluoride) water for prevention of tooth decay in people of all ages have been well established. The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendations of the [American Dental Association](http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm), which include optimally fluoridated water and the use of fluoride toothpaste, fluoride mouth rinse, fluoride varnish, and when necessary, to the [risk](../glossary#risk) of fluorosis, any fluoride supplementation should be prescribed and closely monitored by a dentist or physician. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for [iodine](../minerals/iodine) (150 g/day for men and women) is sufficient to ensure normal [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) function. There is presently no evidence that iodine intakes higher than the RDA are beneficial. Most people in the US consume more than sufficient iodine in their diets, making supplementation unnecessary. A study in an elderly population found that high [iron](../minerals/iron) stores were much more common than iron deficiency [(13)](#reference13). Thus, older adults should not generally take nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing iron unless they have been diagnosed with iron deficiency. Moreover, it is extremely important to determine the underlying cause of the iron deficiency, rather than simply treating it with iron supplements. Older adults are less likely than younger adults to consume enough [magnesium](../minerals/magnesium) to meet their needs and should therefore take care to eat magnesium-rich food in addition to taking a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) daily. However, no multivitamin/mineral supplement contains 100% of the [DV](../glossary#DV) for magnesium. If you don't eat plenty of green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and nuts, you likely are not getting enough magnesium from your diet. Older adults are more likely to have impaired kidney function than younger individuals, they should avoid taking more than 350 mg/day of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) magnesium without medical consultation (see the section on [Safety](../minerals/magnesium#safety) in the article on magnesium). The requirement for [manganese](../minerals/manganese) is not known to be higher for older adults compared to younger adults. However, liver disease is more common in older adults and may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of manganese toxicity by decreasing the elimination of manganese from the body (see the section on [Toxicity](../minerals/manganese#safety) in the article on manganese). Manganese supplementation beyond 100% of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)=2 mg/day) is not recommended. Because aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for [molybdenum](../minerals/molybdenum) [(14)](#reference14), the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation for older adults is the same as that for younger adults. Specifically, the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for molybdenum, 45 g/day for adults of all ages, is sufficient to prevent deficiency. Although the intake of molybdenum most likely to promote optimum health is not known, there is presently no evidence that intakes higher than the RDA are beneficial. Most people in the US consume more than sufficient molybdenum in their diets, making [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) unnecessary. Following the Linus Pauling Institute's general recommendation to take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) that contains 100% of the daily values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for most nutrients is likely to provide 75 g/day of molybdenum because the DV for molybdenum has not been revised to reflect the most recent RDA. Although the amount of molybdenum presently found in most multivitamin/mineral supplements is higher than the RDA, it is well below the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) of 2,000 g/day and should be safe for older adults. At present, there is no evidence that [phosphorus](../minerals/phosphorus) requirements of older adults differ from that of younger adults, and a varied diet should easily provide the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (700 mg/day) of phosphorus for those over 50 years of age. A diet rich in [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) that supplies 2.6-3.7 g/day of potassium is appropriate for healthy older adults because such diets are associated with decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [stroke](../glossary#stroke), [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis), and [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones). This recommendation does not apply to individuals who have been advised to limit potassium consumption by a health care professional (see the section on [Safety](../minerals/potassium#safety) in the article on potassium). Aging has not been associated with significant changes in the requirement for [selenium](../minerals/selenium). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation of the Food and Nutrition Board, which is 55 g/day of selenium for adults of all ages. Although the amount of selenium in [multivitamin/mineral supplements](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) varies considerably, multivitamin/mineral supplements rarely provide more than the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of 70 g. The average American diet is estimated to provide about 100 g/day of selenium [(15, 16)](#reference15). Thus, eating a varied diet and taking a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement should provide sufficient selenium for most adults in the US. There is consistent evidence that diets relatively low in salt (5.8 grams/day or less) and high in [potassium](../minerals/potassium) are associated with decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of high blood pressure and [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), as well as the associated risks of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) and kidney diseases. Diets low in [sodium](../minerals/sodium) and rich in potassium are likely to be of particular benefit for older individuals, who are at increased risk of high blood pressure. Moreover, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial demonstrated that a diet emphasizing fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and low-fat dairy products substantially lowered blood pressure, an effect that was enhanced by reducing salt intake to 5.8 grams/day or less. For more information on the DASH diet, see the article on [Sodium](../minerals/sodium#DASH-trials). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends a diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables (at least 5 servings/day) and limits processed foods that are high in salt. Sensitivity to the blood pressure-raising effects of salt increases with age; therefore, consuming diets that are low in salt and high in potassium may especially benefit older adults. Diets rich in potassium (2.6 g/day of potassium) and low in salt (5.8 grams/day or less) are likely to be of particular benefit for older adults, who are at increased risk of high blood pressure along with its associated risks of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Since sensitivity to the blood pressure-raising effects of salt increases with age, consuming diets that are low in salt and high in potassium may especially benefit older adults. Although the requirement for [zinc](../minerals/zinc) is not known to be higher for older adults, their average zinc intake tends to be considerably less than the [RDA](../glossary#RDA). A reduced capacity to absorb zinc, increased likelihood of disease states that alter zinc utilization, and increased use of drugs that increase zinc [excretion](../glossary#excretion) may contribute to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of mild zinc deficiency in older adults. Because the consequences of mild zinc deficiency, such as impaired immune system function, are particularly relevant to the health of older adults, they should pay particular attention to maintaining adequate zinc intake. Little is known regarding the amount of dietary [choline](../other-nutrients/choline) most likely to promote optimum health or prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) in older adults. At present, there is no evidence to support a different intake of choline from that of younger adults (550 mg/day for men and 425 mg/day for women). -Linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid), and linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 fatty acid, are considered essential fatty acids because they cannot be [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by humans. In 2002, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US [Institute of Medicine](http://iom.nationalacademies.org/) established adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) levels for omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Essential fatty acid recommendations for adults over the age of 50 are listed in Table 2. For more information on ALA and LA, see the article the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) proposed adequate intakes (AI) for the essential fatty acids LA and ALA, as well as the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA [(18)](#reference18). EFSA recommends an LA intake of 4% of total energy and an ALA intake of 0.5% of total energy; an AI of 250 mg/day is recommended for EPA plus DHA. The World Health Organization recommends an acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for omega-6 fatty acid intake of 6-11% of energy and for omega-3 fatty acid intake of 0.5-2% of energy [(19)](#reference19). Their AMDR for EPA plus DHA is 0.250-2 g/day (the upper limit applying to the secondary prevention of [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease)). The International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids (ISSFAL) recommends for healthy adults an LA intake of 2% energy, ALA intake of 0.7% energy, and a minimum of 500 mg/day of EPA plus DHA for [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) health [(20)](#reference20). The American Heart Association recommends that people without documented [coronary heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) eat a variety of fish (preferably oily) at least twice weekly [(21)](#reference21). Two servings of oily fish provide approximately 500 mg of EPA plus DHA. People with documented CHD are advised to consume approximately 1 g/day of EPA + DHA preferably from oily fish, or to consider EPA + DHA supplements in consultation with a physician. Patients who need to lower [serum](../glossary#serum) [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) may take 2-4 g/day of EPA + DHA supplements under a physician's care. The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that generally healthy adults increase their intake of omega-3 fats by eating fish twice weekly and consuming foods rich in -linolenic acid, such as walnuts, flaxseeds, and flaxseed or canola oil. If you don't regularly consume fish, consider taking a two-gram fish oil supplement several times a week. If you are prone to bleeding or take anticoagulant drugs, consult your physician. Age-related declines in [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) function and increases in mitochondrial [oxidant](../glossary#oxidant) production are thought to be important contributors to the adverse effects of aging. Tissue L-carnitine levels have been found to decline with age in humans and animals [(22)](#reference22). One study found that feeding aged rats acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) reversed the age-related declines in tissue L-carnitine levels and also reversed a number of age-related changes in liver mitochondrial function; however, high doses of ALCAR increased liver mitochondrial oxidant production [(23)](#reference23). More recently, two studies found that supplementing aged rats with either ALCAR or lipoic acid, a mitochondrial [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) and [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), improved [(24, 25)](#reference24). Interestingly, co-supplementation of ALCAR and lipoic acid resulted in even greater improvements than either compound administered alone. Likewise, several studies have reported that supplementing rats with both L-carnitine and lipoic acid blunts the age-related [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation), protein carbonylation, and DNA strand breaks in a variety of tissues (heart, skeletal muscle, brain). Improvements in mitochondrial enzyme and respiratory chain activities were also observed [(26-33)](#reference26). While these findings are very exciting, it is important to realize that these studies used relatively high doses (100 to 300 mg/kg body weight/day) of the compounds and only for a short time (one month). It is not yet known whether taking relatively high doses of these two naturally occurring substances will benefit rats in the long-term or will have similar effects in humans. [Clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) in humans are planned, but it will be several years before the results are available. If you choose to take carnitine supplements, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends acetyl-L-carnitine at a daily dose of 500 to 1,000 mg. According to the [free radical](../glossary#free-radical) and [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) theories of aging, [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) of cell structures by [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) plays an important role in the functional declines that accompany aging [(34)](#reference34). ROS are generated by mitochondria as a byproduct of [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production. If not neutralized by [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), ROS may damage mitochondria over time, causing them to function less efficiently and to generate more damaging ROS in a self-perpetuating cycle. [Coenzyme Q10](../dietary-factors/coenzyme-Q10) plays an important role in mitochondrial ATP synthesis and functions as an antioxidant in mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, tissue levels of coenzyme Q10 have been reported to decline with age [(35)](#reference35). One of the hallmarks of aging is a decline in energy metabolism in many tissues, especially liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. It has been proposed that age-associated declines in tissue coenzyme Q10 levels may play a role in this decline [(36)](#reference36). In recent studies, lifelong dietary supplementation with coenzyme Q10 did not increase the life spans of rats or mice [(37, 38)](#reference37); however, one study showed that coenzyme the age-related increase in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage is no scientific evidence that coenzyme Q10 supplementation prolongs life or prevents age-related functional declines in humans. [Lipoic acid](../dietary-factors/lipoic-acid) alone or in combination with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) or L-carnitine has been found to improve measures of memory in animal models of age-associated cognitive decline, including rats [(24, 25)](#reference24), mice [(40)](#reference40), and dogs [(41)](#reference41). However, it is not clear whether oral lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) can slow cognitive decline related to aging or other pathology in humans. An uncontrolled, [open-label trial](../glossary#open-label-trial) in nine patients with [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) and related [dementias](../glossary#dementia), who were also taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, reported that oral supplementation with 600 mg/day of [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) lipoic acid appeared to stabilize cognitive function over a one-year period [(42)](#reference42). However, the significance of these findings is difficult to assess without a control group for comparison. A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that oral supplementation with 1,200 mg/day of racemic lipoic acid for 10 weeks was of no benefit in treating HIV-associated cognitive impairment [(43)](#reference43). Although studies in animals suggest that lipoic acid may be helpful in slowing age-related cognitive decline, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether lipoic acid supplementation is effective in preventing or slowing cognitive decline associated with age or [neurodegenerative disease](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease). If you choose to take lipoic acid supplements, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends a daily dose of 200-400 mg/day of racemic lipoic acid for generally healthy people. The [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of several [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) increases with advanced age. [Inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and transition metal accumulation appear to play a role in the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) [chelating](../glossary#chelate) are interested in the neuroprotective potential of flavonoid-rich diets or individual flavonoids. At present, the extent to which various dietary flavonoids and flavonoid [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) cross the blood-brain barrier in humans is not known [(44)](#reference44). Although flavonoid-rich diets and flavonoid administration have been found to prevent cognitive impairment associated with aging and inflammation in some animal studies [(45-48)](#reference45), [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have not found consistent inverse associations between flavonoid intake and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [dementia](../glossary#dementia) or neurodegenerative disease in humans [(49-53)](#reference49). In a cohort of Japanese-American men followed for 25-30 years, flavonoid intake from tea during midlife was not associated with the risk of Alzheimer's or other types of dementia in late life [(49)](#reference49). Surprisingly, higher intakes of isoflavone-rich tofu during midlife were associated with [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment and brain [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) in late life (see the article on [Soy Isoflavones](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones)) [(50)](#reference50). A prospective study of Dutch adults found that total dietary flavonoid intake was not associated with the risk of developing Parkinson's disease [(51)](#reference51) or Alzheimer's disease [(52)](#reference52), except in current smokers whose risk of Alzheimer's disease decreased by 50% for every 12 mg increase in daily flavonoid intake. In contrast, a study of elderly French men and women found that those with the lowest flavonoid intakes had a risk of developing dementia over the next five years that was 50% higher than those with the highest intakes [(53)](#reference53). More recently, a study in 1,640 elderly men and women found that those with higher dietary flavonoid intake (>13.6 mg/day) had better cognitive performance at baseline and experienced significantly less age-related cognitive decline over a 10-year period than those with a lower flavonoid intake (0-10.4 mg/day) [(54)](#reference54). Additionally, a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 202 postmenopausal women reported that daily supplementation with 25.6 g of soy protein (containing 99 mg of isoflavones) for one year did not improve cognitive function [(55)](#reference55). However, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, supplementation with 60 mg/day of isoflavones improved some measures of cognitive performance [(56)](#reference56). Although scientists are interested in the potential of flavonoids to protect the aging brain, it is not yet clear how flavonoid consumption affects neurodegenerative disease risk in humans. Caloric restriction is known to extend the lifespan of a number of species, including yeast, worms, flies, fish, rats, and mice [(57)](#reference57). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), caloric restriction stimulates the activity of an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) known as Silent information regulator 2 protein (Sir2) or lysine residues in target [proteins](../glossary#protein). Providing [resveratrol](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/resveratrol) to yeast increased Sir2 activity in the absence of caloric restriction and extended the replicative (but not the chronological) lifespan of yeast by 70% [(59)](#reference59). Resveratrol feeding also extended the lifespan of worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) by a similar mechanism [(60)](#reference60). Additionally, resveratrol dose-dependently lifespan of a vertebrate fish (Nothobranchius furzeri) [(61)](#reference61). Resveratrol was also found to extend the lifespan of mice on a high-calorie diet such that their lifespan was similar to that of mice fed a standard diet 62. Although resveratrol increased the activity of the Sir2 [homologous](../glossary#homologous) human sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the test tube [(59)](#reference59), there are no [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) data to link resveratrol, SIRT1 activation, and extended human lifespan. Moreover, the supraphysiological concentrations of resveratrol required to increase human SIRT1 activity were considerably higher than concentrations that have been measured in human [plasma](../glossary#plasma) after oral consumption. The Linus Pauling Institute provides dietary and lifestyle recommendations for generally healthy individuals interested in optimum health and prevention of [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) such as [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (heart disease and [stroke](../glossary#stroke)), [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [cancer](../glossary#cancer), and [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis). recommendations are contained in the Linus Pauling Institute's [Rx for Health](../../rx-health).
