I also developed antibodies for thyroid disease and lupus. I have seen a dermatologist because of the skin reaction on my neck, had a biopsy which shows an increased dermal mucin. I also have seen a rheumatologist who recomends me to take plaquenil. I think doctors are not well informed, I honestly have fear of gettting any more boosters or any other vaccines. Please, please let me know if anyone is taking any medications after being diagnosed with lupus. Interested in more discussions like this?
