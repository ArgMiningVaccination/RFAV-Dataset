Proponents claim that ELT can improve health and well-being by helping to detoxify the body and remove toxins. ELT is typically administered as a series of treatments over a period of several weeks. Patients sit or recline in a chair while electrodes are placed on their upper back, shoulders, or neck. The current is then applied, usually for about 10 minutes per session. Some people report feeling lightheaded or dizzy during treatment, but most say it is tolerable. The therapy has been promoted as a treatment for fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and other conditions. However, the effects of ELT are not well established and its safety is unknown. It is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any medical condition. Many people who do report improvements from ELT say that it helped them feel better in ways that conventional medicine could not - although there is no scientific evidence to show that ELT works for these conditions.
