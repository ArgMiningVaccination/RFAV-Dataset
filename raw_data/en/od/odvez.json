We believe this is a highly effective tool for pain management, especially among animals who have little tolerance for pain medications or are unable to take them altogether. What is Pet Acupuncture? Acupuncture is an ancient form of treatment involving the insertion of needles into various, highly precise, pressure points to promote specific healing responses. It can be used as a treatment in itself, a preventative treatment, and as a part of a larger treatment plan that combines old medicine with more modern treatment methods such as physical therapy. Which Pet Conditions does Acupuncture Treat? Acupuncture is used to treat a variety of neurological disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, inflammation, and provide pain management. This includes many of the following conditions: - Allergic dermatitis - Lick granulomas - Respiratory ailments - Gastrointestinal ailments - Hip Dysplasia - Degenerative joint disease - Intervertebral disc disease - Traumatic nerve injury For many pet owners, acupuncture is an acceptable alternative to surgery to help manage the pain their pets experience caused by various health conditions. One of the reasons for this is that acupuncture is a completely non-invasive treatment option. It has no side effects, and it can provide relief with or without medications to aid the progress. Is Acupuncture Right for Your Pet? We understand that your pet is family. Our goal is to work with you to find the right combination of treatment and therapy processes to offer maximum results with minimal pain to your pet who may already be experiencing no small amount of pain from his or her medical conditions. We will work with you to find a treatment option that provides you with peace of mind while giving your pet the greatest possible quality of life during treatment and recovery. One of the great things about acupuncture is that it stimulates the production of endorphins for your pet so that your pet's own body is able to produce what it needs to relieve the pain. It is important not to simply trust any veterinarian with this task. Only trust one who has had specific training and experience administering acupuncture therapy.
