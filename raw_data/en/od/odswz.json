ICD-10 codes Codes with a prefix C 91.10, C91.12 Regimen details Week 1 - Initial Dose Escalation Day Drug Dose Route 1 Alemtuzumab 3mg SC or IV infusion 3 IV infusion 5 Alemtuzumab 30mg SC or IV infusion Week 2 onwards Day Drug Dose Route 1 Alemtuzumab 30mg SC or IV infusion 3 IV infusion 5 Alemtuzumab 30mg SC or IV infusion If, at any point, therapy is withheld for more than 7 days, alemtuzumab should be restarted with gradual dose escalation from 3mg, as week 1 . Alemtuzumab may be combined with high dose steroid for patients with 17p deletion and/or bulky disease: Methylprednisolone 1 gram/m2 orally daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every 28 days for 4 cycles Cycle frequency Weekly (as above) Number of cycles Maximum of 12 cycles (12 weeks) Administration Alemtuzumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into th e thigh. Injection site reactions with the subcutaneous rou te may require switching to the IV route. Such reactions are less common when given with high dose steroids, and usually resolve within 2 weeks of starting treatment. Alemtuzumab m ay be administered intravenously in 100mL sodium chloride 0.9% over 2 hours. In the event of mild infusion -related react ions, the infusion should be temporarily stopped. Severe reactions should be treat ed with IV corticosteroids, or pethidine for severe rigors, and re -challenge with the same dose on the next day. If recurrent problems with infusion -related reactions, consid er extending the infusion time. Alemtuzumab Version 1 Review date : February 2017 Page 2 of 4 Patients must be observed for 2 hour s after the first three doses for delayed reaction s. Observations (temperature, BP, respiratory rate and saturations) should be recorded every 30 minutes. Pre-medication 30-60 minutes prior to alemtuzumab: Paracetamol 1 4mg PO or 10mg IV Dexamethasone 4 -8mg IV or PO during dose escalation. (Note: if patient is also receiving methylprednisolone, omit dexamethasone on that day and give the methylpred nisolone 30 -60 minutes prior to alemtuzumab). Emetogenicity This regimen has low emetic potential - no anti -emetics routinely required Additional supportive medication Allopurinol 300mg PO OD (100mg OD if CrCl < 20mL/min) for the first 1 -2 weeks for p atients with bulky disease or high white cell count (high risk of tumour lys is syndrome) Proton pump inhibitor for patients receiving high dose steroids. PCP prophylaxis, antiviral prophylaxis and antifungal prophylaxis as per local policy. Continue during therapy and for 6 months after completion of treatment (or until CD4+ cell count >200 cells/ L) GCSF and/or ciprofloxacin 109/L. Extravasation Alemtuzumab is a non-vesicant .

Restart at 30mg when platelet count > 50 x 109/L and neutrophils > 0.5 x 109/L* 2nd occurrence Discontinue alemtuzumab.

If baseline platelet count 25 x 109/l and/or baseline neutrophil count 0.25 x 109/L: Haematological toxicity Dose modification 50% decrease from baseline in patients starting therapy with a baseline platelet count 25 x 109/L and/or a baseline neutrophils 0.25 x 109/L 1st occurrence Discontinue alemtuzumab. Restart at 30mg when FBC returns to baseline values* 2nd occurrence Discontinue alemtuzumab. Restart at 10mg when FBC returns to baseline values* 3rd occurrence Discontinue alemtuzumab *If the duration of interruption in alemtuzumab therapy is 7 days, then restart at 3mg and increase dose according to week 1 initial dose escalation, to 10mg and then 30mg as tolerated. Haematological toxicity Dose modification Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia Discontinue alemtuzumab. No data exist on the resumption of alemtuzumab in patients with autoimmune cytopenias or marrow aplasia. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia Pure red cell aplasia Bone marrow aplasia Renal impairment No studies in renal impairment but unlikely to require a dose modification. Hepatic impairment No studies in hepatic impairment but unlikely to require a dose modification. Other toxicities Toxicity Definition Dose adjustment Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia 2 positive CMV PCR tests 1 week apart Withhold alemtuzumab until resolution. Local inflammatory reaction at injection site Injection site reaction grade 3 Withhold alemtuzumab until resolution to grade 1.
