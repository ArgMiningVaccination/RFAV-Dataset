Personal Statement I have long-standing interests in environmental influences on aging, which began with an invited review in Science that showed heritable factors account for <35% individual differences in lifespan (Finch & Tanzi, Science, 1997). The environment clearly has had a major role in the increase of lifespans since 1800 through diminishing inflammation and infection (Finch & Crimmins, Science 2004). As founding PI of the USC Alzheimer Center in 1984, I have a long record of leadership in brain sciences. My work on Alzheimer disease lead me to consider the role of diet and most recently, air pollution factors in brain aging. Discussions with Rob McConnell and other USC epidemiologists on their findings of air pollution particles and atherosclerosis motivated me to consider the impact on brain aging. Since 2010, I have collaborated with Costas Sioutas for rodent exposure studies. Our models show the adverse impact of nano -sized traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) on the brain throughout life. Most recently in collaboration with JC Chen, we showed that the ApoE4 Alzheimer risk factor increased dementia risk increased vulnerability to TRAP in his studies of the WHIMS cohort, and in our studies of EFAD mice. We also continue long-standing neuroendocrine studies on the peri- menopause that show altered glial neurotrophic activity with onset of cycle lengthening and sex-specific effects of APOE alleles on cerebral hemorrhages.

C. Contributions to Science Neurobiology of aging Since 1965, I have worked on biological mechanisms in aging using a systems approach to cell and organ interactions. My thesis work was the first analysis of gene expression in relationship to neuroendocrine changes with aging (#1). I pioneered concepts that brain neurotransmitter functions and neuroendocrine functions change across the lifespan and that clinical phases of aging changes are outcomes of life-long aging processes. My initial independent research focused on monoamine neurotransmitters in rodent models, which showed slowed turnover in aging mice (#2). Human brain samples from the first brain bank for normal brain aging (with Bengt Winblad, #3) revealed that healthy middle -aged humans and rodent share progressive slow declines of dopamine receptors (#4). Because aging rodents are free of atherosclerosis, our findings of receptor loss during middle -age showed the first ischemia -independent processes of neuron aging. The same decline of 5% per decade after age 40 was later shown for cortical synapse, grey matter atrophy, and cognitive processing speed. 1. Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.

PMID: 3600950 Female reproductive aging We innovated a systems approach to ovary -brain interactions during middle -age that cause the rodent hypothalamus to become desensitized to estrogen. Hypothalamic interactions with the aging ovary were analyzed by heterochronic ovarian transplantation between different ages and by long-term ovariectomy, which showed that the rodent hypothalamus is vulnerable to cumulative effects of estrogen (#1). Despite complete impairment of the estrogen -induced pre-ovulatory LH surge, there was no change in the number of hypothalamic LHRH neurons (#2). This was the first example of a major functional brain aging change in the absence neuron loss. Moreover, hypothalamic astrogliosis is driven by estrogen exposure. This finding led to recent studies on steroidal regulation of GFAP in relation to neurotrophic activity (#3) in the mouse peri-menopause, when the transition to irregular cycling increased GFAP transcription with decreased neurotrophic activity. Moreover, the onset of irregular cycling impairs hippocampal long-term-potentiation with a shift in gene expression different from regular cyclers of the same age (#4). This systems approach to ovary - brain interactions documented the plasticity of aging processes down to the level of gene expression. 1.

The perimenopausal aging transition in the female rat brain: decline in expression during Alzheimer disease in human and rodent models included apoE (#1) and several complement factors. Soon, ApoE4 was recognized as the first AD risk factor. In 1999, the USC Alzheimer Center in collaboration with U Washington and McGill showed further that women ApoE4 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 30 carriers had the highest risk (#2). Sex-apoE4 interactions include cerebral microbleeds, which show a male - bias, opposite to the higher amyloid load in women and mice carrying apoE4 (#3). ApoE continues to surprise: it has cognitive benefits in the Tsimane, an indigenous Amazonian tribe living under poor hygiene (#4). This finding is consistent with its evolutionary history as the ancestral allele, with pleiotropies that are not advantageous under conditions of low infection and excess nutrients. 1.

ApoE4 alleles are associated with improved cognitive function in individuals with a high parasite burden. FASEB J. 31: 1508 -11515. PMID:28031319 Environmental factors in brain aging are now a major thrust. An invited review by Science on the genetics of aging (#1) showed the surprising generality, that the heritable variance of life expectancy is less than 35% in humans and in lab animals, pointing to a major influence of environmental factors. Accordingly, I developed collaborations to understand environmental factors that enabled the major increase of human life expectancy since 1800. Studies with demographer E Crimmins shows the role of infection and inflammation in the progressively improving cohort mortality across the lifespan (#2). In 2010, JC Chen and I founded the AirPollBrain multi -disciplinary program on air pollution in brain aging and dementia http://envneurosci.usc.edu/APB/ ). In collaboration with C Sioutas, we developed rodent models for exposure to particulate material (PM) from urban traffic, collected in suspension for re-aerosolization. Under controlled time and dose of exposure to PM, mice show selective alterations in glutamate receptors (#3). The APOE4 allele enhanced amyloid deposits in the EFAD mouse, consistent with the greater vulnerability of women to dementia in the WHIMS cohort to high levels of air particles PM2.5 (#4). Gene -environment interactions are being sought for other AD-risk factors. 1. Finch CE, Tanzi RE 1997 The genetics of aging. Science 278:407 -411. 2.

Working with Dr. Sioutas who directs the Environmental Exposure and Neurotoxicology Core (Core C), I will be coordinating the effort to support the study design and conduct of large -scale air pollution/spatial epidemiologic studies on geographically -diverse cohorts; harmonize the spatiotemporal air pollution modeling approaches across two population studies (WHIMS; Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging [VETSA]); and contribute my knowledge/expertise in studying air pollution -neuroepidemiology of brain aging. The collaborative infrastructure of proposed P01 is the outgrowth of the AirPollBrain (APB) Network (PIs: Finch & Chen), a research development program funded by USC since 2010. The APB allows us to develop collaborative team projects across USC. For this application, we have assembled faculty investigators and scientists with complementary expertise in neurobiology of AD (Finch; Pike; Morgan), population & clinical neuroimaging imaging (Zlokovic; Mack), clinical neurology (Mack), cognitive neurosciences and neuropsychology (Gatz; Nation; Petkus), latent structure modeling (Petkus), (Gatz; Chen), air pollution/environmental -neuroepidemiology (Chen), inhalation exposure assessment and neurotoxicology (Sioutas; Forman). Over the last 2-3 years, we have been extending this \"team science\" approach to collaborative resea rch partnership with scientists outside USC. For instance, through the NIEHS inter-center collaborative initiative, I developed the MPI R01ES025888 with Dr. Joel Kaufman who leads the MESA -Air (Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution) with state -of-the-art spatiotemporal TRAP modeling tools not available to APB before. Through the NIH-supported IGEMS consortium, Dr. Gatz (APB executive committee member) and I forged the collaboration of APB and VETSA (Project -2) investigators. My leadership in Project -1 builds on my long-standing involvement in WHI research since 2004 -9 when I was on the faculty of Department of Epidemiology of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC -CH). By collaborating with senior WHI investigators at UNC and other institutes, I initiated/completed the effort to promote WHI/WHIMS as a unique resource for population environmental neurosciences to address pressing issues and health concerns (e.g., sleep -brain health) most relevant to post-menopausal and older women. As the PI of WHI's ancillary studies#226 & 252, I led the collaborative effort between UNC Depts of Epidemiology and Environ. Sci. & Eng. to enhance the environmental data resources and modeling tools applicable to nationwide cohorts including the WHIMS Suite of Studies. These efforts led to the previous recognition by the National Sleep Foundation, NHLBI Innovative Research Grant Program, the receiving of UNC Junior Faculty Development Award, and the Rosenblith Award from the Health Effects Institute. In summary, I have demonstrated a track -record of successful and productive multidisciplinary projects as well as the leadership in the emerging field of environmental neurosciences of brain aging in populations. These Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 33 experiences make me fully qualified to be the Co-PI of this P01 program, lead the Project -1 in WHIMS, and provide the Core C1 supporting function. B.

Contribution to Science I am a physician -epidemiologist with formal training in Internal Medicine, Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Environmental Health Sciences (EHS), and Epidemiology (Environmental; Occupational; Clinical). My research endeavors cover several key areas of EHS. One defining features of these studies is the \"team science\" approach. While often requiring the effective coordination of multidisciplinary team/multi -site studies, this approach enables the formulation of new EHS questions by integrating state -of-the knowledge and research tools in toxicology/disease pathogenesis with novel theories from other disciplines. Employed to studying population neurosciences, the team science approach also fosters the development/validation/ application of sophisticated quantitative methods to address statistical issues involving complex study design and multi -dimensional exposure/outcome data. Exposure Assessment Methods and Study Design for Large Populations My initial research training was in occupational epidemiology methods for exposure assessment in studying work -related musculoskeletal disorders. My doctoral study demonstrated an efficient study design approach to assessing occupational exposure by using validation data to develop statistical instruments for exposures that are hardly or not directly measurable in large cohorts. This work was the first introducing the efficient study design to assessing low-frequency whole -body vibration (WBV, a form of oscillating mechanical energy transmitted to human body through supporting surfaces) exposure in professional drivers. This approach has been adapted in subsequent occupational WBV studies conducted in Canada, Japan, Europe, and China to better predict occupational exposures and quantify WBV dosages. My doctoral study was a product of multidisciplinary team science, for which I brought together mechanical engineers and biomechanics ergonomists working with clinicians, health psychologists, musculoskeletal epidemiologists and biostatisticians to launch the largest occupational cohort of professional taxi drivers in Taipei City, Taiwan. While at UNC Dept. of Epidemiology, my interest in occupational/environmental epidemiologic methodology evolved into the development/validation of environmental exposure models applicable to nationwide large population - based cohorts. I worked closely with geostatisticians at the UNC Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) Modeling Lab to address two fundamental issues (temporal upscaling in multi -scale estimation; non- stationarity of spatial processes) in air pollution exposure modeling for large -scale cohorts. a.

Page 35 Mechanistic Mediators of and Individual Susceptibility to Cardiovascular Effects of Airborne Particles My pursuit of air pollution health effects research started during my post-doctoral work with faculty at the Particle Research Core of the Harvard -NIEHS Center of Environmental Health and Harvard -EPA Particulate Matter (PM) Center. The initial focus was on studying the mechanistic mediators/identifying the determinants of individual susceptibility to cardiovascular effects of airborne particles. To this end, I contributed to integrating the knowledge of particle toxicity in animals with the analyses of gene expression data from human panel studies to better understand the mechanistic pathways involved in cardiophysiological an d inflammatory responses. My post-doctoral work was the first to demonstrate the utility of the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Score (a widely used clinical tool for CVD risk stratification and clinical management) to better characterize the individual susceptibility to air pollution -related cardiac effects. This useful strategy was recognized in the American Heart Association's Scientific Statement on Air Pollution and CVD. My subsequent work demonstrated the first link between systemic inflammation with long-term exposure to particulate air pollutants, and identified obesity and metabolic syndrome as new indicators of susceptibility of PM exposures. a.

Health and Aging While at UNC -CH, I expanded my research to epidemiology of aging, primarily focused on examining whether and how environmental stressors in workplaces and communities affect development and progression of chronic diseases (e.g., CVD, osteoarthritis, sleep disorders) as well as the quality of life as people age. One example was my contribution to a new line of collaborative research with the Thurston Arthritis Research Center to investigate how social factors (e.g., workplace policies; occupational physical activities; lead exposure) determine health disparities in osteoarthritis. After I left UNC, several clinical fellows and junior investigators continued on this important albeit understudied area of environmental health and aging. a.

PMCID: PMC3132016 Ambient Air Pollution, Neurodevelopment, and Brain Aging Since 2009, my primary research effort has been devoted to investigating whether and how exposures to neurotoxic air pollutants affect the neurobehavioral development and cognitive functions across the life span. These studies involve a wide range of unique populations, including children, community -dwelling residents, nationwide survey samples, and large population -based cohorts. This novel line of research in population environmental neurosciences began with the first epidemiologic evidence supporting neurotoxic effect of ambient ozone exposure in adults and then making the first effort to tackle neurotoxic mixture with correlated air pollution exposure contexts for their impact on autism risk. In the last few years, I helped create a vibrant program of research, including mechanistic studies with inhaled particle exposures in animal models, which has grown into several funded projects ( ) on air pollution and cognitive aging had produced compelling data (including the new discovery of potential white matter loss associated with PM 2.5) to redefine air pollution neurotoxicology concerning the relative importance of neurovascular damage and structural neurotoxicity in late life. a.

Personal Statement My research focuses mainly on neuroimaging Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and cognitive aging, with an emphasis on preclinical AD and early mild cognitive impairment. In particular, I evaluate how genetic and environmental risk factors for AD relate to brain structure, function, and connectivity throughout adulthood. I also seek to understand the biological mechanisms and signaling pathways that may contribute to or protect against AD-related changes, using relevant blood and cerebrospinal fluid measures and multimodal imaging. My research projects and publications to date have all have involved various modes of brain imaging, including structural MRI (using both tensor based morphometry and FreeSurfer analyses), fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and white matter hyperintensity assessments on FLAIR images. I am experienced in performing positron emission tomography (PET) analyses and have worked on/published studies using PET with various ligands: FDDNP (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), FDG (glucose metabolism), AV45 (amyloid), and FMT (dopamine synthesis capacity). My publication record includes 37 co-authored peer-reviewed journal articles (as lead author for 17), as well as 1 submitted manuscript. Four of my first authored papers were published in The Journal of Neuroscience , including one about the relationship between the AD risk gene CLU and white matter integrity that received worldwide recognition. As a post doc, I proposed and wrote the majority of an R01 examining the genetics of Alzheimer's disease as relates to functional and structural brain connectivity (PI Thompson). I later won a small local grant and directed the analyses that led to a publication. These analyses also provided preliminary data for another R01, on which I am currently directing the work of a Research Assistant, a Post Doctoral Scholar, a Neuroscience PhD Student, and undergraduate volunteers. Now as junior faculty at the University of Southern California, I am the project leader for Project 2 of our Alzheimer's Disease Research Center grant (PI Chui) and am ensuring that the goals of that project are being met. I am committed to Alzheimer's disease research personally and professionally and have extensive experience with a variety of neuroimaging modalities and AD research, as is evidenced by my productive publication history.

Contribution to Science 1. Genetic associations with brain measures Understanding how genetic variants affect brain structure and connectivity is an important first step in designing treatments for the disease that are affected by the systems those genes influence. In my graduate work, I was involved in a study by Burggren et al.,that was the first to show how the Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk variant APOE 4 related to the thickness of hippocampal area subregions. My role in that highly cited study was to help with the scanning, hippocampal unfolding, and data interpretation, and to edit the manuscript. In my postdoctoral work, I became a fellow supported by an institutional NRSA grant at UCLA in Neurobehavioral Genetics (PI Nelson Freimer) and continued to study genetic effects on the brain, this time related to structural connectivity. We were the first to publish how the newly confirmed genetic risk allele C of the clusterin (CLU) gene variant rs11136000, related to brain measures in living humans. We found that each C allele of the CLU variant was associated with lower diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy (DTI FA), a widely accepted measure of white matter integrity, broadly throughout the brain, including in regions having preferential degeneration in AD. Clusterin is implicated in -amyloid transport. However, our 398 young adult subjects were likely too young to have amyloid deposits in their brains. Our results suggest another way by which the CLU C allele may make the brain vulnerable to AD-related cognitive decline, decades before an AD diagnosis would be expected. Our findings were reported by newspapers in at least 15 countries, widely on the internet, and by KCBS radio news in San Francisco. The Journal of Neuroscience paper that resulted has been cited nearly 130 times. In another paper published in The Journal of Neuroscience , we found that a genetic variant in the NTRK1 (also known as TRKA ) gene was associated with white matter integrity in a large sample of healthy young adults. NTRK1 is a high affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), which has been implicated in normal brain development, AD, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders. My role in these two studies was to conceive the research idea, perform statistical analyses, interpret the results, write the initial draft of the paper, and to implement all subsequent revisions. I was also lead author on two fMRI studies of people from families that carry rare genetic mutations that confer AD in middle age in an autosomal dominant manner. In one of these, published in Neurobiology of Aging , fMRI activity during a novelty encoding task increased the closer AD mutation carriers got to the expected age of disease onset, suggesting that the increase in activity related to disease processes rather than to developmental differences related to the gene mutation. In a follow -up paper, published in Human Brain Mapping , preclinical mutation carriers showed greater fMRI activation during memory retrieval, and this activation was greatest in those who performed most poorly on the task. This suggests that pathological processes rather than benign compensation are responsible for the increased activity that occurs prior to clinically relevant cognitive decline. In these studies, I planned and executed the analyses, interpreted the results, and wrote and revised the manuscript. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 39 a.

Amyloid PET in cognitively intact older adults I was the lead author on the first paper published online to demonstrate that amyloid PET signal was associated with cognition in cognitively intact older adults. This paper, published in Neurobiology of Aging , has been cited >100 times. We used the (18F)FDDNP -PET ligand, which labels amyloid plaques and, to a lesser extent, neurofibrillary tangles. Using MRI-derived cortical surface models, aligned across subjects with sulcal matching, we showed that in AD patients, those with MCI, and healthy older controls, AD pathology was significantly correlated with cognitive performance in a pattern that mirrored a classic pattern of pathological progression. When only cognitively intact older controls were considered, FDDNP signal in small regions of the frontal and parietal cortex was still significantly higher in those who had worse cognition. My role in this project was to conceive of the idea, perform MRI scanning and analysis, interpret the data, and write and revise the manuscript. A graduate individual NRSA grant on which I was the principal investigator funded this work. In Scott et al., 2016, we found in cognitively intact older adults, that greater amyloid burden at baseline was associated with greater WMH accrual over a two-year period of time. This association was especially pronounced in those with hypertension, but the relationship remained significant even after controlling for age and hypertension. Our results suggest that the contribution of possible amyloid deposition should be considered as an independent factor when evaluating white matter lesion etiology. a.

Neurobiology of Aging. 48:48 -52. PMCID in process. 3. Somatic health and brain aging One of my major interests is how general health, particularly cardiovascular and metabolic health and the immune system, affects brain aging and AD risk. We previously discovered that even within the normal range of systolic blood pressure and body mass index, higher values were associated with greater fMRI activity in regions vulnerable to AD. Cardiovascular deficits and AD frequently co-occur. Our results suggest that part of the AD- related pattern frequently seen in those with increased risk may relate to cardiovascular risk. Conversely, the pattern of brain changes associated with cardiovascular risk may create a vulnerability to cognitive deficits when AD-related pathology is present. In this study, I conceived the idea for the study, performed all analyses, interpreted the results, and wrote and revised the manuscript. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 40 More recently, we examined the relationship of total brain volume and voxelwise brain volume (assessed using tensor -based morphology) with reported physical activity intensity and blood serum levels of TNF, a pro- inflammatory cytokine. We found that lower physical activity intensity and higher levels of TNFwere both independently associated with smaller brains, and that higher TNFwas associated with lower voxelwise brain volume in the inferior parietal lobule. TNFand physical activity intensity were not significantly correlated with one another. Our results suggest that the effect of physical activity on brain volume is largely independent of any effect it might have on inflammation. For this paper, I planned the study, conceived the idea for and wrote the grant that funded the study, performed all imaging analyses, interpreted the results, and wrote and revised the manuscript. In Scott et al., 2015, we found that amyloid deposition and hypertension were independently associated with white matter hyperintensity volume in older adults. a.

Dopamine synthesis capacity, early adult development, and cognitive aging In our Journal of Neuroscience paper, in which I was the lead author, we used the (PET) radiotracer 6- [(18)F]fluoro -l-m-tyrosine (FMT), a marker for activity of the dopamine -synthesizing enzyme, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), to measure dopamine synthesis capacity in the caudate in healthy older and younger adults. We evaluated how FMT signal in the caudate related to frontal lobe function and age. Prior studies using FDOPA as a radiotracer to measure striatal dopamine synthesis had inconsistent results. However, FDOPA signal is subject to some aspects of post-release processing, which may themselves change with aging, while FMT signal is a purer measure of AADC function. Consistent with prior work in non-human primates, we found that FMT signal in the dorsal caudate increased with age, suggesting compensation for deficits elsewhere in the dopamine system. In contrast, in younger adults, FMT signal in the dorsal caudate was lower with age, possibly due to ongoing developmental in young adulthood. Younger adults who performed worse on tests of frontal lobe function showed greater FMT signal in the right dorsal caudate, independent of age effects. Together this suggests that higher striatal higher striatal FMT signal is associated with non-optimal dopamine processing. In a follow -up study, we found older cognitively intact adults showed less fMRI deactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus during a delayed recognition working memory task than younger adults. These regions are an integral part of the default mode network, which shows deficits in many disease and disorders, including AD. We also found that in young adult subjects, greater task-induced fMRI deactivations were associated with higher FMT signal in the caudate, and with worse memory performance. This suggests that dopamine synthesis may help modulate default mode network activity, and changes to this system may contribute to working memory deficits in older adults. For both of these studies, I recruited and performed MRI scanning all the younger subjects in this study as well as coordinating their neuropsychological testing and PET scanning. I analyzed the PET and MRI scans included in the study and trained, supervised, and checked the analyses of the others who assisted me. I also wrote and revised the manuscripts. a.

Personal Statement I look forward to continuing my long-term collaboration with Dr. Jiu-Chiuan Chen to study mechanisms linking air pollution to Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Chen is conducting important and impactful research in this area. I am well-prepared for this collaboration. I am founding Chair of the Department of Biostatistical Sciences at the Wake Forest School of Medicine and a Fellow of the American Statistical Association (1996) for my formative work in missing data and misclassification methods and a Fellow of the Society for Clinical Trials (2011) for my work in the design and conduct of multi-center studies. Later into my career, my primary research has shifted from methodology to have greater concentration on identifying approaches to preserving brain health during later life and the interfaces among aging, diabetes, obesity, and cognitive function. This shift in focus began in 1995 when I joined with Dr. Sally Shumaker to develop the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, which is still ongoing and has spawned several inter-locking programs related to brain health. Since then, I am currently PI of the multi-center Look AHEAD coordinating center and past-PI of the Look AHEAD Brain MRI study. I have growing experience in diabetes and neuroepidemiology: 104 of the 114 published articles I have authored/co -authored since 2010 are focused on brain health and/or lifestyle intervention. The Modan Award I received from the American Diabetes Association in 2012 was based on my work examining trajectories of cognitive decline among women with diabetes. I also have considerable prior experience in cardiovascular disease: the Remington Award I received from the American Heart Association in 1996 was based on my work towards developing and introducing missing data methods for use in clinical trials with atherosclerotic outcomes. My induction in the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2014 drew from my biomedical and biostatistical work spanning several research fields. I have held leadership roles in dozens of coordinating centers. I am a frequent consultant to the NIH and industry and to the Alzheimer's Association, a past member of the NIA Clinical Trials Advisory Panel, a current member of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Reducing Risks of Alzheimer's Disease, and statistical editor for the Journal of Gerontology. I have served on or chaired dozens of DSMBs for NIH and industry. I direct the Data Analysis Core for the Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Center. I have authored/co -authored 296 papers on statistical methodology and biomedical research (and 68 additional consortium publications). Four of these that support my ability to conduct the research related to cognitive health are: 1.

Contribution to Science Influence Of Diabetes On Cognitive Health Lately in my career, I have become very interested in understanding the impact of diabetes and obesity on the late-life brain health. This has drawn from several papers from the WHI which helped to establish their influence on cognitive trajectories and brain MRI outcomes. One of these led to my recognition from the American Diabetes Association Michaela Modan Award for Epidemiological Research. I have led the first paper from the Look AHEAD study group to examine the impact of its weight loss intervention on cognition. My current paper describing the primary findings of the Look AHEAD brain MRI study is currently in press. 1. Espeland MA, Miller ME, Goveas JS, JD, Naughton MJ, Resnick SM.

PMCID: PMC4657616 Impact of Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy on the Brain I have been an investigator of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies related to brain health since 1995. At that time, postmenopausal hormone therapy was often recommended as a treatment for the preservation of cognitive function in older women based on cohort studies and considerable basic science work. We tested this assumption in the WHI randomized clinical trial of hormone therapy and found that, in women aged 65 years and older, hormone therapy markedly increased risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. This has led to a marked drop in the prescription of hormone therapy to older women and has saved lives. My 2009 publication listed below sets the basis for understanding the potential mechanism for this: hormone therapy increases brain atrophy which accounts for the increased risk. My 2015 Neurology paper listed above furthers our understanding of the mechanism for this, which is related to estrogen's \"healthy cell bias\" role in regulating energy metabolism in the brain. My 2013 paper below supports this mechanism demonstrating that while hormone therapy does not benefit cognition overall in younger women, it does not appear to have harmful effects. While my recent award as a fellow of the AAAS is as a biostatistician, my work in neuro -epidemiology also contributed to this award. 1.

My first experience with study coordination began in 1981 when I became an investigator at the coordinating center for the NHLBI -funded Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease and published a JASA paper on missing data methods I developed for that cohort study. During the subsequent 34 years, I have been continuously involved in study collaboration and leadership and directed groups that have made major advances in this field. These include the development of integrated web-based data management systems and the development of on-line monitoring reports. This also includes advances in study design and analyses.

Personal Statement The proposed P01 aims to better define the individual risk, heterogeneity, and biological basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in aging populations. Multimodal human neuroimaging data will be explored with respect to spatiotemporal data on air polluti on and integrated with translational mechanistic studies in mice, with an emphasis on effects within the white matter in particular. As a cognitive neuroscientist with extensive expertise in multi -modal neuroimaging and the effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease on the brain, I am well qualified to contribute to the proposed study. My research broadly emphasizes MRI methods development and validation, and the clinical application of these methods to normal aging, neurodegenerative disease, HIV, and psychiatric disorders, including my ongoing collaboration with the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA; PI W. Kremen), a nationwide cohort to be leveraged in the proposed study. My work in neuroimaging and biomedical informatics includes assessing method performance and validation to improve outcomes and allow pooling of data across multiple sites, which has led to the development of large datasets, as well as scientific advances in our understanding of phenotypes associated with risk and progression of diseases including Alzheimer's disease and HIV. Of particular relevance to the proposed work, I began collaborating with the VETSA study during its first wave, and became a key investigator in the neuroimaging aspects of VETSA Waves 2 and 3, continuing to work closely with Drs. William Kremen and Carol Franz. I lead the image analysis for the white matter hyperintensities, and I play a key role in the structural and diffusion work as well as in quality control. Over time, I have served as the Director of the Biomedical Informatics Research Network Data Repository, the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) Neuroimaging Core, and the multi-site CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) Neuroimaging Core. Currently, in addit ion to my role in VETSA, I lead a study on the Impact of Cannabinoid Use on HIV-related Brain Alterations in Young Adults, direct the neuroimaging aspects of the recently funded Age Related Determinants of HAND: A 12 Year Follow -up of CHARTER Participants ; and play a key role in the Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC) Neuroimaging Core and several clinical trial studies. Research in these programs involves cross -sectional and longitudinal morphological, diffusion, and MR spectroscopy image analysis, development and validation of methods, and associated studies in relation to cognition, immune recovery, biomarkers of inflammation, metabolic disorders, and substance use. For the proposed work, I will provide consultation and support related to the neuroimaging data from the VETSA cohort, with an emphasis on the structural and white matter measures, and scientific integration of findings.

Contributions to Science 1. My early work emphasized methodology and biomedical informatics related to image analysis and data sharing, including methods validation (a, b) and improved pooling of data across multiple sites (b). With the national Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) and related testbeds, I aimed to enable multi -site clinical imaging projects and foster data sharing and integration. As Director of the BIRN Data Repository, I worked with all sites on infrastructure development to enable public data sharing including development of enhanced database infrastructures (c).

Catalyzed by this work, I led the development of large, comprehensive datasets to explore the neuroimaging profiles of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (a,b), and to advance our understanding of phenotypes associated with risk and progression of disease (b,c,d). One overarching goal is to improve effectiveness of clinical trials, to bring us closer to treatment strategies that will slow the progression of or prevent neurodegeneration. This original work provides a strong foundation for our understanding of brain alterations associated with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease relevant to the proposed study. a.

My work expanded into the study of normal aging, emphasizing the genetic and environmental influences on the brain, collaborating with the VETSA team (W. Kremen and C. Franz) leading this component of the proposed P01. This large scale project of male twins in midlife includes structural, diffusion, perfusion, and functional connecvity measures. Supporting training of a post-doctoral fellow, I explored whether neuroimaging phenotypes were genetically driven and distinct from each other (a). Subsequently, I led a study defining the genetic and environmental influences of the brain's structural phenotypes in middle -age (b). In this cohort, I also examined the impact of carrying the ApoE 4 allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, on brain structure, demonstrating differences in the frontal cortex prior to clinical impairment (c). This work and subsequent VETSA studies demonstrating interactions between ApoE and other modifying factors provides guidance for the proposed study. Recently, our work demonstrated strong associations between hypertension and white matter microstructure, using diffusion tensor imaging, supporting associations between cardiovascular health and brain structure (d), and a study of the heritability of white matter hyperintensities and hypertension is in progress. a.

Of particular relevance to my work with white matter disease, I brought my neuroimaging expertise to the study of HIV infection, including structural, diffusion, and spectroscopy MRI explorations and training. Building on prior work demonstrating white matter damage in HIV infection, I found that increases in CD4 cell count, evidence of immune recovery, were associated with an increase in white matter abnormalities, suggesting neuroinflammation may be occurring in the CNS during recovery (a). It is possible that these immune recovery -associated changes are transient and may resolve once recovery has plateaued, although immune recovery lags viral suppression and may continue for years. In another study, we found structural associations, including white matter volume, with metabolic factors (e.g., body mass index) in HIV infection (c). With trainees, we found an association between distal neuropathic pain and cortical gray matter (b), and our recent MR spectroscopy study sugg ested that monocyte activation and chemotaxis continue to contribute to brain abnormalities in anti-retroviral -treated individuals (d). Recently, I started a study of the Impact of Cannabinoid Use on HIV-related Brain Alterations in Young Adults (NIH R21DA037667); the high rate of cannabis use may impact the progression of HIV infection, given cannabinoids link to greater immune suppression and potential anti-inflammatory effects. a.

In addition, my broadly collaborative efforts have yielded several outcomes to advance our understanding of the impact of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease on the brain. Early work supports the need for careful evaluation of brain and cognitive profiles for which \"normal\" may be defined differentially in very old age (a & c). We explored the interaction between the ApoE 4 allele status and age on the rate of decline in AD. Young -old individuals with AD had more severe deficits and steeper declines in cognition and brain structure than the very-old, and the young -old AD carrying an 4 allele were the most significantly impacted. This work underscores the importance of integrating age and genetic susceptibility when examining neuropsychological and neuroimaging changes in aging and early AD. Continuing my work with the ADNI sample, I led a study examining the association between cognitive reserve and cortical thickness in aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and we found that early -life education did not provide a protective buffer, in terms of greater cortical thickness, against cognitive decline (b).

Personal Statement My primary research is in the fields of redox signaling and adaptation to oxidative stress. My interest in redox biology began during my graduate studies, beginning with studies on the kinetics of an enzyme that had superoxide as an intermediate, postdoctoral work on the enzymology of the superoxide dismutases, continuing through studies on induction of antioxidant enzymes that continues today, pioneering work on redox signaling that also continues. Our current studies focus on both the oxidative aspects of sickle cell disease and, in this proposal, on the age-induced alterations in redox signaling that result in greater basal expression of antioxidant enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but a blunted antioxidant response that inhibits protective adaptive changes in the elderly. I have published over 200 peer-reviewed articles and over 40 book chapters. I am Past President of the Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine and served many years as the Reviews Editor for Free Radical Biology & Medicine. I am now the Editor -in-Chief of Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics. While my research has been very focused on redox biology, my training and teaching experience has ranged from organic chemistry to physiology. This broad experience has influenced the approaches I take to research. In 2016, I won both the Award Lectureship from the Society for Free Radical Research - Europe and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Redox Biology and Medicine. For this proposal, I will supervise part of Core C and participate in planning of the experiments that produce the samples to be assayed in the core.

Contribution to Science 1. Early work on superoxide biochemistry. My graduate work was on the kinetics, catalytic mechanism and allosteric regulation of tryptophan oxygenase in which I demonstrated that superoxide was an intermediate. My interest in superoxide led me to a postdoctoral fellowship with Irwin Fridovich in which I did some of the early work on superoxide dismutase (SOD) and in using SOD as a tool to investigate redox chemistry. A study on the role of zinc in cytosolic SOD led others year later to investigate the role of zinc binding in an aberrant form of SOD producing an inherited form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

On the stability of bovine superoxide dismutase: the effects of metals. J. Biol. Chem. 248: 2645 -2649, 1973. 2. Mitochondrial production of superoxide. In the course of investigating the role of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in mammalian pyrimidine biosynthesis, I found that the enzyme, which transfers electrons to complex III in mitochondria, could also cause production of superoxide. In that first study, I demonstrated that mitochondrial SOD was responsible for pulling the reaction forward by displacing a kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable reaction, which subsequently was shown to be the autooxidation of ubisemiquinone in complex III. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was significant skepticism about the physiological significance of mitochondrial superoxide production, but now, it is thought to be responsible for a large variety of physiological and pathological processes.

Pulmonary oxidative stress, induction of antioxidant enzymes, and early studies on signal transduction in macrophages. I joined Aron Fisher at the University of Pennsylvania in a program project on pulmonary oxygen toxicity. We did a number of studies on oxygen and paraquat toxicity, which I continued for many years and are now relevant to studies of sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies, which have a large oxidative component due to hemolysis. But my focus turned toward two other areas that continue as interests to this day; adaptation to oxidative stress and oxidant -altered signal transduction. We demonstrated that several antioxidant enzymes increased in type II pneumocytes in the lungs of rats that adapted to breathing high O2 concentrations Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 59 that permitted rats to survive in subsequent exposure to 100% O2. Although many studies were focused on how oxidative stress caused irreversible damage and death, realizing that we get sick many more times than we die, led me to study altered cell function by oxidants, particularly focusing on altered calcium signaling. Along the way, I also realized that to study pathophysiology meant I needed to investigate normal physiology and biochemistry as well. Thus, we showed that in the normal respiratory burst of macrophages, NADPH rather than NADH was the required substrate for the NADPH oxidase. Forman, H.J., Nelson, J. and Fisher, A.B. Rat alveolar macrophages require NADPH for superoxide production respiratory J. Biol. Chem. 255: 9879 -9883, 1980. Forman, H.J. Antioxidant enzymes in rat granular pneumocytes: constitutive levels and effect of hyperoxia. Lab. Invest. 45: 1-6, 1981. 4. Glutathione biosynthesis. One of the major adaptive responses to oxidative stress is an increase in glutathione (GSH) through induction of both subunits of the in its de novo, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and pathway, -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). My laboratory demonstrated that quinones, which can both conjugate to protein thiols and redox cycle to generate superoxide and H2O2 induced GCL and GGT. My lab has continued to make important advances in understanding how the transcription of these genes are regulated by coordination of Nrf2/EpRE and AP-1/TRE signaling pathways. More recently, we have demonstrated that both GCL genes and other genes regulated by Nrf2 change from being inducible by oxidants in young mice become uninducible in aging mice at least in part through an increase in the Nrf2 inhibitors c-Myc and Bach1 with age. We also did studies on GSH transport in cystic fibrosis, demonstrating its regulation by CFTR. Shi, M.M., Kugelman, T., Tian, oxidative stress elevates glutathione and induces -glutamylcysteine activity in rat lung epithelial L2 cells. J. Biol. Chem. 269: 26512 -26517, 1994.

IUBMB Life 62: 237-246, 2010 Zhang, H., Liu, H., Davies, K.J.A., Sioutas, C., Morgan, T., Finch, C.E., and Forman, H.J. Nrf2-regulated phase II enzymes are induced by chronic ambient nanoparticle exposure in young mice with age-related impairments. Med. Redox signaling. Studies on redox signaling, which overlaps with the other areas above began with the realization that oxidants at low concentration enhanced rather than inhibited functions in alveolar macrophages. This led us to investigate the role of endogenously generated H2O2 as a second messenger. An early publication in this area was our demonstration that H2O2 made by stimulated macrophages activated NF-B signaling (43). At that time, phagocytes were the only cells known to produce H2O2 upon stimulation of an NADPH oxidase rather than as a byproduct of metabolism. Many other studies had previously demonstrated signaling by the addition of exogenous H2O2. So, our report was looked upon as a curiosity of phagocytes until the discovery by Lambeth of the multiple and ubiquitous NADPH oxidases. Regardless, how H2O2 functioned as a second messenger was not revealed until it became apparent that some of the targets formed protein mixed disulfides or adducts to protein cysteines. We demonstrated the glutathionylation of PTP1B by endogenously generated H2O2 and suggested that this and other H2O2-mediated signaling was enzymatically driven rather than dependent on non-enzymatic protein cysteine oxidation that is far too slow in most cases to account for the observed activation. The involvement of an enzymatic process was then demonstrated in the peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin oxidation mediated activation of JNK in stimulated macrophages. We have also demonstrated that electrophiles, such as the commonly generated lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy -2-nonenal, have specific target thiols, including another protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1. We have shown that TGF-1 activation kinase involves the oxidative modification of Src cysteines. We have also studied NF-B dependent signaling stimulated in macrophages by environmentally relevant levels of silica particles and determined that it depends on both the activation of H2O2 production and the presence of iron on the surface that causes a lipid raft disruption through very minor lipid peroxidation. Subsequently, the products from the NF-B pathway can activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway in macrophages. Kaul, N. and Forman, H.J. Activation of NF-B by the respiratory burst of macrophages.

PERSONAL STATEMENT. I am Associate Professor in the UCSD Department of Psychiatry and associate director of the twin research laboratory at the Center for Behavioral Genomics. I have been a co-investigator and co-director on all of the VETSA studies (VETSA 1 & 2; VETSA MRI VETSA Cortisol; VETSA MRI 3 and VETSA 3) since their inception in 2002. My expertise is in genetic and environmental influences on cognitive aging as it relates to psychosocial and health factors with a focus on stress, adaptive mechanisms, and aging. I developed the psychosocial/personality batteries for the first two VETSA data collections and was part of the team that developed the health measures. I am trained as a personality psychologist, specializing in adult development; my training emphasized secondary data analysis and longitudinal methods. In my postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University with Dr. David McClelland examined adult development and human motivation across 40 years of life, thus solidifying my knowledge of mid-life development at a time when few researchers investigated that life period. I later trained with Dr. Jack Block, at UC Berkeley, working on issues related to life course development and longitudinal design. At UC Davis, I was mentored by Richard Kravitz, MD, MPH in health services research with a focus on depression, dementia, health care, and barriers to care. With VETSA and other investigators I have worked on a variety of papers linking life experiences, stress, personality/psychosocial characteristics, health, biological systems (e.g. cortisol) with cognition, and brain. My expertise in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive aging includes my collaboration with Ladson Hinton MD at UC Davis on studies of caregiver s of elderly with dementia and the role of primary care in care for elderly adults with AD. With Dr. Kremen I am co-director of the VETSA projects and the Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging at UCSD. I have worked closely on research studies with Drs. Kremen, Fennema -Notestine, Hagler, and Smith for over a decade. In summary, my demonstrated experience as a researcher on aging, my scientific background in genetic and environmental influences on aging, health, personality and life course development, my technical skills, and effective collaborations position me to be an effective PI for this study. This project moves the VETSA study in a new direction for these investigators \u2014towards the exploration of putative environmental influences in the context of a genetically informed study. B.

Stress and aging: It has long been recognized that stress affects multiple aspects of the aging body and brain, including physical and mental health, as well as cognition; however mechanisms by which stress and aging are linked are poorly understood. With the VETSA studies my colleagues and I have made unique contributions to our understanding of the genetic and environmental influences on the HPA axis, new findings regarding associations between cortisol and brain structures, and on longitudinal influences on the relationships between midlife cortisol and cognition. I was lead author on all of this work. a.

Mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's Disease. The above studies focus more on my contributions to normal or typical adult functioning; yet a key aspect of aging is pathological cognitive aging. This problem affects individuals, families, institutions, and public policy. Solving the important problem of the growing number of elderly with dementia requires both research that addresses identification of and causes of dementia; as well as social and institutional barriers to care. One of my contributions to science includes my approach to research which emphasizes the necessity of using multiple methods to fully understand a problem --shown here as ranging from in-depth qualitative analysis of caregivers of elderly with dementia to examination of the heritability of MCI and its association with brain structure. This is highlighted in the Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Two key aspects of aging are the contributions of physical and psychological health to cognitive aging. Through my work with VETSA and other studies, I have made important and unique contributions to both areas. Here I highlight work focusing on physical health factors that play key roles in aging; behavior genetic studies of aging starting in middle -age have been rare and importantly contribute to early identification of cognitive and brain aging and associated risks. a) Franz CE, Grant MD, Jacobson KC, Kremen WS, Eisen SA, Xian H, Romeis J, Thompson -Brenner H, Lyons MJ.

Since the beginning of my career I have been interested in associations between childhood/young adult experiences and aging. Here my most important contributions, and highly cited papers, focused on three types of risk/protective factors: childhood SES and familial experiences, early cognitive ability; and combat exposure. Although attachments (close relationships) as a core feature of adult Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 65 development and adjustment is now widely accepted; this was not the case in 1985 when I wrote my first theoretical paper on the overlooked role of attachments in life course development. Since the original paper I have published a number of important papers examining the origins and outcomes of key relationships from a variety of studies and types of relationships. This includes an influential study published in JAMA for which I was senior project manager and co-investigator examining the role of physician patient relationships in the diagnosis and treatment of depression (Kravitz et al 2005, JAMA). The range of my research expertise is also one of my unique contributions to science in that I have led high quality complex projects to completion across my career ranging from qualitative projects, to experimental studies, to large -scale longitudinal epidemiological studies. a) Koestner R, Franz CE, & Weinberger J.

Personal Statement I have a background in psychology, with a focus on clinical psychology and aging. My primary scholarly focus is the use of longitudinal and twin studies to identify potentially modifiable risk and protective factors across the lifespan, influences that may work in interaction with genes to influence emotional, cognitive, and physical well- being in old age. These interests led me to initiate the Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins and by extension to identifying cases of dementia throughout the Swedish longitudinal twin studies. With these data, we have demonstrated the contribution of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and obesity to the risk for Alzheimer's disease and dementia; the role of depression, anxiety, and other psychosocial variables in dementia and cognitive change trajectories; the protective role of education, occupation, and leisure activities; and most recently geographic variation in occurrence of dementia in Sweden. We have also considered sex differences in the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors for liability to Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and gender differences in the importance of various lifestyle and environmental risks for dementia. Presently, as part of the Interplay of Genes and Environment across Multiple Studies (IGEMS) consortium, I am participating in harmonizing data and analyses across multiple twin studies from around the world \u2014including the VETSA study that is in Project -2 of the current application. These data are being harnessed in particular to address health disparities related to socioeconomic class and sex. Additionally, I am working with the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to develop the National Academy of Sciences -National Research Council Twin Registry (WW II Twin Registry) as a scientific resource. Since 2010, I have been a part of the USC AirPollBrain group with Drs. Chen and Finch, serving on the executive committee. I will participate in Project -1 of the current application, which is designed to investigate the contribution of traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) to the risk, susceptibility and mechanisms of AD and related dementias (ADRD) in a nationwide cohort of post-menopausal and older women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Memory Studies (WHIMS). I will facilitate the integration of Project -1 and -2 findings about cognitive functions and cross -comparison of the analytic results. B.

Contributions to Science 1. Several of my early publications challenged prevailing views about depression in older adults, which on the one hand exaggerated its prevalence, and on the other hand normalized depression as an expected consequence of growing older. I have also been concerned with how depression is (or is not) detected by health practitioners as well as how depression is measured in surveys of older adults. More recently, with colleagues and students, I have argued that depression with its first onset late in life may represent a prodromal symptom of dementia, and we have identified shared genetic variation between late onset depression and vascular factors. a.

Working with a team of collaborators, I have documented the substantial heritability of Alzheimer's disease, indicating the importance of genetic risk for predicting who will develop Alzheimer's disease. Our observations have provided a point of reference for those seeking to identify genes underlying Alzheimer's disease. At the same time, we also pointed to variability in intra-pair differences in age of onset between monozygotic twins concordant for the disorder, demonstrating the complementary and interacting role of the environment. a.

We are digitalizing additional information, updating the NACDA archive, and updating dates of death. Role: Project AG037985 and Aging -Related Outcomes The Interplay of Genes and Environment across Multiple Studies (IGEMS) consortium seeks to characterize gene -environment interplay in aging -related outcomes toward understanding mechanisms for socioeconomic status inequalities in cognitive and physical health outcomes. IGEMS includes 15 twin studies from 5 countries. The project includes developing commensurable measures of occupations and education across participating IGEMS studies, then evaluating a model whereby social class differences in health arise in part through gene -environment processes such that individuals with greater education and occupational status are able to manage genetic risk for disease and cognitive impairment through lifestyle choices made possible by social and economic resources that accompany attainment of high SES. Role: MPI R01 AG056163 Prescott (PI) 09/15/16 - 04/30/21 Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline in Project TALENT Project Talent is a longitudinal study that began in 1960 with 377,000 U.S. high school students from 1,200 schools, including 2,300 sets of twins and 80,000 other siblings. This project will follow up 7,500 of the original participants (now aged 70-75) to answer questions about the mechanisms by which higher educational attainment is associated with preserved cognitive performance and reduced risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias. Participants will be assessed for dementia status and cognitive performance using a contemporary battery of cognitive measures harmonized with several of the original 1960 PT measures, allowing direct measurement of change across 1960 to 2017 on multiple cognitive domains. Other measures include educational and occupational outcomes, and a broad range of health and well-being measures, enabling comparisons with other studies of aging. This unique merger of within -family, between -family, within - school and between -school designs controls for genetic and environmental factors that are confounded in other cohort studies and provides an unprecedented opportunity to address causal hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying individual differences in risk for AD, other dementias and cognitive decline. Brain Aging in the WHI Memory Studies This project will support the development/refinement of state -of-the-art spatiotemporal air pollution modeling tools and apply the resulting comprehensive new exposure data (from 1990s to 2016) to better understand the long-term influences of ambient air pollutants including particulate mixture on increased dementia risk and further investigate novel mediators and pathways leading to pathological brain aging in late life.

Personal Statement I have the expertise and training necessary to successfully carry out my role in the proposed research project. I have a quantitative neuroscience background, with expertise in the development and use of innovative multimodal brain imaging analysis methods. As a postdoctoral fellow with Martin Sereno at UCSD, I gained experience in cognitive neuroscience, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and cortical surface -based analysis. After joining the Multimodal Imaging Laboratory (MMIL) at UCSD, co-directed by Drs. Anders Dale and Eric Halgren, I received training in the use and development of computational methods for multimodal integration and broadened my areas of expertise to include magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion MRI (dMRI). As principal investigator on an NIH K01 career development award, I developed expertise in multimodal integration, developing an fMRI retinotopy -constrained source estimation method for MEG/EEG visual evoked responses. As a participant in a variety of collaborations, I have become experienced with large -scale processing and analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data. In addition, I have developed leadership and instructional skills by training and supervising staff research associates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and medical residents. I have authored several peer-reviewed publications and been a co-author on many more, demonstrating a record of productive research. The current proposal builds upon my previous work developing and applying innovative methods for the processing and analysis of multimodal imaging data. As Co-Investigator on project 2, I will continue my ongoing collaboration with PIs Kremen and Franz to implement our analytic strategy and contribute to the communication of results. My role will also be to communicate with the USC neuroimaging core about the MRI data in VETSA that is being used in Project 2 and work on ways to harmonize this data with other data. I have a demonstrated record of productive research projects, and my expertise and experience have prepared me to be Co-Investigator for the proposed project. a.

Contributions to Science 1. Maps of visual space in the brain allow humans and other species to process visual information about the world around them. My work was the first to demonstrate the existence of topographic maps of visual space in frontal and prefrontal cortex. I also extended previous work to better characterize the multiple spatial maps in posterior parietal cortex. These maps in higher level areas appear to be involved in the application of top-down attentional control and tracking task-relevant objects in coordination with the numerous maps that have been identified in occipital cortex. My role in these studies related to the acquisition and analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and the implementation of cortical surface -based analysis methods. a.

The relatively poor temporal resolution of fMRI and the difficulties of source localization for electroencephalography (EEG) and MEG have presented significant challenges for the noninvasive study of visual processing in humans. I developed a novel method for estimating the time courses of visual responses in individual visual cortical areas using MEG/EEG, fMRI retinotopic mapping, and cortical surface reconstructions derived from structural MRI (sMRI). After further improvements to this method, I have begun to study the timing of evoked responses in early visual areas, somethin g not previously possible.

Vis. 14(14):13. 3. Early methods for identifying white matter tracts involved manual selection of streamlines created using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). I developed an automated method for white matter tract segmentation that uses atlas -based information about tract locations and local orientations. Because it is completely automated, this method is a much more efficient way - and much more practical for large -scale studies - to create regions of interest (ROIs) for extracting imaging -derived measures for white matter tracts. Another advantage is that the method is applied in an unbiased, uniform manner across participants. An advantage over popular, probabilistic tractography methods is that only pre-determined, validated white matter tracts are included, excluding artifactual connections. My role in these studies has been the implementation and development of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data processing methods, development of the tract segmentation method, and data analysis. a.

Personal Statement I have more than 30 years experience in the theory, hardware/software development and application of high resolution preclinical MRI. Extensive history of supervising successful Post Doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and technicians. Animal models understudy have included: embryonic development, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, and substance abuse. I am also heavily involved in several multimodal imaging efforts including contrast agent development, implementation of a simultaneous dual PET/MRI scanner, and quantitative analysis of MR images using an array of computational warping and statistical parametric analyses. Simultaneous PET/MRI is a truly synergistic merging of technologies. In particular, our work with agents visible in both modalities allows unequivocal identification of the multimodal agent within its anatomical context (MRI) at picomolar sensitivity (PET). \"Unequivocal\" because it must manifest in both modalities at the same place and time. For the past 7 years I have been collaborating with Drs. Colcher at City of Hope using our in vivo imaging technologies to visualize potential immunotherapies in animal models. Recent encouraging preliminary results using focused ultrasound melded with in vivo longitudinal imaging prompt the current proposal. Our current preclinical efforts with simultaneous PET/MRI will be ideally suited to cell tracking studies, elucidation of effects of focused ultrasound and rodent brain imaging (functional and structural).

Contribution to Science Lipid -bilayer / membrane protein interactions: My early work used solid-state MRI of deuterated lipids, calorimetry, and some simple computer modeling to gain insights into how steroids, hydrophobic peptides and membrane proteins associate with biomembranes. At that time the only known membrane protein \"structure\" was that of bacterial rhodopsin (determined via cryo-electron microscopy) and even now fewer that ~30 such structures are determined yearly - an extremely small number consider that ~30% of the mammalian proteome is comprised of membrane proteins. Thus, it was and is important to characterize lipid - peptide/protein interactions with a variety of experimentally methods as well as computational models. I used solid-state NMR, calorimetry, and binding constant determinations to describe how well defined hydrophobic peptides interacted with lipid bilayer membranes. With Prof. White, we developed an \"interfacial hydrophobicity scale\" that allows one to examine the consequences of different assumptions about the average hydrogen bond status of polar side chains. I did or supervised all the experimental work, including building a solid-state NMR spectrometer, designed experiments, wrote computer programs to analyze and model data, and wrote manuscripts and NIH proposals to support these efforts. a.

Development & Applications of high resolution in vivo MRI : In the late 1980's, MRI microscopy was in its infancy (Blackband published the first \"single cell\" MR image in 1986). In collaboration with Dr. Cho's group at UC Irvine we modified our 7T widebore NMR spectrometer to an MRI scanner. I personally designed and built several gradient and RF coils, as well as writing image collection and processing software. Applications is developmental biology demonstrated for the first time that MRI could be used in cell fate mapping in the early embryo, revealing information not obtainable by optical methods due to sample opacity. In collaboration with Meade, Fraser, & Louie; we developed the first \"smart\" MRI contrast agent - an agent activated in vivo by cleavage with -galactosidase. I contributed to the design of the agent and experiments to test it in vivo, as well as supervising all aspects of the MR imaging. Further, the use of timelapse in vivo MRI in embryology provided insight into the 3 dimensional character of morphological development, while ex vivo MRI provided data for 3D atlases of the mouse, quail, and lemur (http://atlasserv.caltech.edu ).

MRI in mouse models of neuro -diseases: The overarching goal of this work is to gain insight into the etiology of neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and drug abuse) using mouse models so that this increased understanding can be applied in the human condition. The work with Bloom & later with Voskuhl established that MRI provides quantitative detailed information about changes in brain volume & structure through comparison of MRI with gold standard stereology and histology. Manganese enhanced MRI provides a methodology to evaluate changes in neuronal circuitry in mouse models. My major contributions in this area are to import and refine two technologies from other fields: stereotaxic injection of Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Cherry & Louie I have been blessed with insightful, productive, and collegial associates. My role in the collaboration is threefold: 1) management - as PI with overall responsibility; 2) MRI engineering aspects and overall integration of the PET component into our MR scanner; and 3) scientific applications including cancer immunotherapies and agents for detection of vulnerable vascular plaque. Along with the Pichler group in Germany, in 2008 we published a demonstration of a relatively easy to use PET system 'insert' that fits in a preclinical MR scanner allowing synchronized PET/MR image acquisition in vivo in small animals. Our applications of this technology emphasize imaging of phenomena that require examination over both time and space (e.g. tracking of immune system molecules and cells, as well as how they modulate the tumor milieu). An important underlying goal of my lab is to employ synchronized PET/MR to develop & evaluate PET and MR biomarkers in tandem, so that in the future MRI biomarkers can be employed clinically to minimize the need for PET scans. a.

PERSONAL STATEMENT Dr. Kaufman is a physician -scientist and epidemiologist, with research focused on human health effects of environmental agents, with research spanning epidemiology, toxicology, clinical medicine, and exposure sciences. He has led several investigations regarding the effects of environmental agents on the incidence and progression of chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, using new methods to estimate individual -level pollutant exposures for epidemiology. Dr. Kaufman has led the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) project, building on the NHLBI's MESA cohort, which represents an unprecedented effort to characterize cohort members' exposures to air pollutants of ambient origin. He has also worked with several other cohorts to develop specialized exposure assessment systems for hundreds of thousands of study participants and locations, including in the Women's Health Initiative and the NIEHS Sister Study. Through these efforts, the research group has led state -of-the-art cohort -specific monitoring campaigns, and developed advanced spatiotemporal modeling approaches incorporating numerous geographic covariates, which can accurately estimate air pollutant concentrations at point locations. This experience, and the datasets and products developed by his research group, provides the basis for his contributions to this project. 1.

Contribution to Science As a physician -epidemiologist studying environmental and occupational health factors in disease and disability, my work has focused on addressing problems at the nexus of epidemiology, environmental health sciences, toxicology, and clinical medicine. Leveraging advances in each of these disciplines, and conducting multi -investigator collaborations which include state -of-the-art quantitative methods, is common to each area. 1. Exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with chronic diseases . Our epidemiological work has focused on well-conducted studies with good control of potential confounding factors and excellent outcome assessment. We approach our work with equipoise and have observed and published both null and positive findings. Our findings are most compelling and show more consistent effects for studies of long-term exposure than for short -term exposures. a.

Personal Statement My formal training is in Applied Physics, but my emphasis in graduate school and as a post-doctoral researcher has been in biophysics, and the development and application of advanced imaging techniques to biological problems. As a graduate student in Dr. Manfred Lindau's laboratory, I studied the mechanism of exocytosis, a critical cellular function that has been implicated in various diseases, at the single cell level using the electrochemical technique of amperometry and various fluorescence imaging techniques, including total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and confocal microscopy. I developed microelectrode arrays for amperometric detection of exocytotic release events from single cells, and combined them with then cutting - edge fluorescence microscopy techniques to tease out details of the SNARE proteins involved in the underlying molecular mechanism, resulting in two publications in PNAS . Note that I typically publish under my maiden name, Kassandra Kisler . At the end of my PhD, I spent a brief but fruitful time in collaboration between Drs. Lois Pollack and Susan Daniel establishing a TIRF microscopy system and developing protocols to investigate viral fusion into supported lipid bilayers using two-color TIRF microscopy and caged (photoactivatable) compounds. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 86 I furthered my training in advanced imaging techniques and electrophysiology in the laboratory of Dr. Robert H. Chow while studying complexin, a protein involved in exocytosis. I used single cell patch clamp electrophysiology to detect differences in exocytotic function in chromaffin cells expressing mutant forms of complexin. Here, I had the opportunity to attend the Advanced Imaging Methods (AIM) Workshop at UC Berkeley, where lecturers have often included Nobel Prize winners. In experiments with our collaborators, I gained experience in multiphoton imaging of mouse retina slices. Additionally, I used \"super -resolution\" imaging techniques to further my studies of the complexin protein, which included design and construction of a super -resolution microscope for the Chow lab. Because of my broad background and expertise in imaging techniques, I was invited to attend the prestigious European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Advanced Optical Microscopy Course in Plymouth, England as a teaching assistant. My work in the Zlokovic lab builds upon my experience with imaging techniques and electrophysiology to tackle important questions related to blood -brain barrier (BBB) integrity, vascular regulation and function, its relation to brain electrical activity, and the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's using transgenic model animals. My work has included the study of transcytosis of amyloid across the BBB using various in vivo and in vitro techniques, and establishment of in vitro electrophysiology techniques for the lab. Furthermore, I have introduced new protocols for in vivo intrinsic optical signal imaging, and visualization of cortical electrical activity using high-speed voltage sensitive dye imaging. My current projects, including a recently published study in Nature Neuroscience , focus on the role of pericytes in regulating cortical circulation in vivo using exogenous tracers with multiphoton microscopy. Here, I have established multiphoton techniques to study vascular dynamics and blood flow changes on the single capillary level in living mice. Furthermore, I have established techniques in the lab for quantitative multiphoton optical measurement of vascular leakage and permeability -surface (PS) constants in vivo. Leveraging these techniques has resulted in a method manuscript currently in preparation and two additional studies in preparation for, and under review in top scientific journals. Overall, my expertise in these techniques provides me with the background necessary to successfully conduct the experiments proposed . Relevant publications and abstracts: Hafez, I., K. Kisler M.

Contribution to Science TIRF microscopy and electrophysiology: The exocytotic mechanism, cell surface trafficking, and neuronal function. Much of my graduate and early postdoctoral work focused on the development and use of electrophysiological detectors, and their use in combination with fluorescence and TIRF microscopy to gain insight into the mechanism of exocytosis. Exocytosis is a highly regulated cell process by which cells, most importantly neurons, release signaling molecules or neurotransmitters. Dysregulation of this process is implicated in multiple diseases. My work involved design and development of microfabr icated planar electrode arrays sized to fit single cells on glass coverslips. These arrays enabled fluorescent observation of labeled proteins or compartments within the cells of interest simultaneously with amperometric electrophysiology measurement. Using this method, I and my colleagues were able to measure accurate transmitter release and diffusion from single cells, and changes in exocytosis with manipulation of synaptobrevin, a SNARE protein essential for exocytosis. I also applied the TIRF imaging technique to the study of estrogen receptor -alpha (ER) at the cell surface in live cells in real time, publishing one of the first papers detailing this technique. To this point, evidence of estrogen receptor presence at the cell membrane and live visualization of its trafficking was virtually unexplored. Our experiments showed that ERwas present at the membrane in live cells, and that binding of ligands to ERat the cell surface induced endocytosis of the receptor. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 88 More recently, I have mastered patch clamp electrophysiology and multielectrode array measurement techniques. In collaboration with the Ichida Lab, I applied these techniques to study motor neuron degeneration mechanisms in ALS using patient -derived motor neuro ns, helping to elucidate the mechanism behind the C9orf72 risk gene. This work is currently in revision for a high-impact journal. 1. Kisler, K, R. H. Chow, & R.

In vivo Imaging: Vascular contributions to neurodegenerative diseases In my work studying the vascular contributions to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, I have focused strongly on the application of in vivo imaging techniques to study vascular dynamics and the neurovascular unit in real time. The neurovascular unit is composed of several cell types working in concert to maintain the blood -brain barrier (BBB) and regulate the blood and nutrient supply to the brain. The pericyte, one of the cell types that compose the neurovascular unit, has been shown to play a role in maintenance of the BBB, but its role in vascular dynamics is unclear. Using loss-of-function pericyte -deficient mice and multiple in vivo multiphoton and other imaging techniques, we demonstrated that pericyte degeneration leads to diminished CBF responses, neurovascular uncoupling, reduced oxygen supply to brain and metabolic stress, which over time lead to impaired neuronal excitability and neurodegenerative changes. These important findings have led to a publication detailing these observations and follow up studies (in progress). My use of In vivo multiphoton imaging has also lead to new information regarding permeability of brain vasculature in pericyte deficient and Alzheimer's disease ApoE4 model animals. 1. K.

Page 89 Regulation of PICALM: An Alzheimer's risk gene. Another focus of my work has been to help uncover the role of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk gene phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly (PICALM) protein in disease progression. It is known that there is less PICALM present in the brains of AD patients then healthy individuals, but how that affects the disease still a topic of debate. Recently, we identified a critical role for PICALM in brain endothelium, where the protein acts as an endocytotic adaptor protein and chaperone to direct clearance of amyloid out of the brain. Furthermore, we found that a reduction of PICALM expression in amyloid overproducing mice retained more amyloid in their brains then littermates with normal PICALM expression. Currently, I am in the process of screening for drugs that affect PICALM regulation, with the goal to develop a new therapy for AD. 1. Zhao Z*, A. P. Sagare*, Q. Ma*, M. R. Halliday, P. Kong, K.

Personal Statement I am a clinical psychologist and research neuropsychologist. I am also Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, Co-Director of the Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging and Director of the Twin Research Laboratory in the Department's Center for Behavioral Genomics. I have been PI of the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA) projects since 2001: primary study; VETSA MRI; VETSA Cortisol. Since the start of VETSA, I continue to work very closely with the contact PI, Dr. Franz, who is Co-Director of VETSA and of the Center for Behavior Genetics of Aging. I have also worked closely with Drs. Fennema -Notestine (VETSA MRI 1 & 2) and Hagler (VETSA MRI 2), and with Dr. Reynolds on VETSA 3 and the international twin consortium on Interplay of Genes and Environment (IGEMS). VETSA is a set of longitudinal behavioral genetic studies that focuses on genetic and environmental influences on aging and outcomes of approximately 1500 middle -aged twins living throughout the U.S. VETSA includes extensive cognitive, psychosocial, psychiatric symptom, health/medical, sleep quality, neuroendocrine, and multi -modal neuroimaging assessments. We also have genome -wide genotyping data and plasma stored from wave 1 for assessment of biomarkers. At wave 1, all subjects were 51-60 years old, so we have detailed characterization beginning in midlife. We began data collection for wave 3 in March 2016. Data are also available from prior assessments of VETSA twins at average ages 20, 37, and 42, thus allowing for the study of very long -term trajectories and outcomes, including the role of genetic factors and associations with brain structure. This makes VETSA very strong with respect to cognitive and brain aging, and early identification of risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. I, thus, have substantial experience in coordinating a large twin study project, in neurocognitive assessment and analysis, and analysis of twin/genetic data. I will ensure that appropriate variables from these studies are incorporated into the database along with the newly collected geocoding/pollutant data. We will be able to extend previous work on the effects of air pollutants on brain and cognition because VETSA has much more extensive data in both of these domains. My responsibilities will be primarily on overseeing the cognitive and imaging data. I will work with the other investigators to refine variables and to maximize comparability of variables for analysis across different studies. I will work closely with the other investigators to provide all relevant VETSA data, and ensure the proper analysis and interpretation of all of the data. I will also play a key role in editing any presentations or manuscripts. 1.

Contribution to Science 1. Publications in the early stages of my career were focused on neuropsychological function and brain structure in people with schizophrenia and their nonpsychotic biological relatives. The predominant view in the field had been that cognitive deficits were downstream consequences of preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations. It was also unclear whether brain abnormalities in schizophrenia were pre-existing or consequences of illness, and if normal neuropsychological function was possible in people with schizophrenia. These publications showed there were cognitive deficits and hippocampal volume reductions in relatives who were genetically related to people with schizophrenia , but who did not themselves have the illness. After matching for educational attainment, people with schizophrenia had poorer cognitive function than controls but equal or higher estimated premorbid ability. If you matched for IQ, people with schizophrenia had poorer neuropsychological function than controls. This work was among the first to show that some brain abnormalities are likely pre-existing, and that cognitive deficits are core features of schizophrenia. It contributed key findings clarifying the question of risk factors vs. consequences of illness, and it resulted in a 180-degree shift of the predominant view of cognition in Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 92 schizophrenia. It also made important contributions to understanding of the trajectory of schizophrenic illness, strongly suggesting that all people with schizophrenia have impaired cognitive function relative to their premorbid ability. I was a co-investigator on all of these studies, and led the science in several of them. a. Kremen, W, Seidman, L, Faraone, S, Pepple, J, Lyons, M, Tsuang, M. 1996.

The power of family/genetic studies to change (even reverse) thinking in the field led to greater interest in truly genetically -informative studies, i.e. twin studies. That ultimately led to my NIA-funded VETSA projects, a set of large -multidisciplinary projects with approximately 25 investigators and consultants that I lead. One key VETSA contribution is basic science work needed to better understand the genetic underpinnings of brain structure so it can then be applied to studying the genetics of cognition and psychiatric disorders. Most MRI studies of cortex, including psychiatric disorders, examined cortical volume s. We showed that global cortical surface area and thickness are genetically distinct. Volume (area x thickness) thus conflates two distinct sets of genes. Thus, it is best to examine surface area and thickness separately, particularly for genetic studies. This work has substantial impact as most studies now do this. We then showed that general cognitive ability is driven by genetic associations with surface area rather than thickness. All prior brain atlases were based on structure or function. We created the first brain atlas derived solely on genetically -based information. We were the first to show in living human brains the anterior -posterior gradient of genetic effects, i.e., the same genes that cause anterior cortical area expansion cause posterior contraction. I am PI on all of these studies. a.

The pathological process in AD begins decades before the onset of clinical dementia, and genetic factors are important in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Widespread agreement on these two truths about AD has led to emphasis on the paramount importance of early identification, and of elucidating the genetic underpinnings of cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia. A focus of VETSA was to use an extensive neurocognitive battery in order to avoid celling effects in middle -aged adults. With that battery, we were able to identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in our subjects when they were only in their 50s. Almost all other studies of MCI focus on adults 70+. Being able to identify MCI in midlife holds great promise for early identification. We provided validation for our diagnoses, showing that there was greater hippocampal atrophy in those with amnestic MCI. To our knowledge this study was also the first to show heritability of MCI. We have also been using multivariate biometrical modeling to elucidate the genetic Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 93 architecture of cognitive abilities. For example, we showed that there are different genetic influences underlying different episodic memory tests, and that they each change differently over time. We also showed that task -evoked pupil responses could serve as a biomarker of early risk for MCI or AD even before cognitive deficits are present. These findings highlight the importance of extensive neuropsychological assessment when assessing cognitive change, as well as the value that twin analyses can have for informing genome -wide association studies. I am PI on all of these studies. a. Kremen, W, Jak, A, Panizzon, M, Spoon, K, Franz, C, Thompson, W, Jacobson, K, Vasilopoulos, T, Vuoksimaa, E, Xian, H, Toomey, R, Lyons, M. 2014.

With our long-term longitudinal data, assessed when subjects' average age was 38 years, we have now begun to examine the very long-term outcomes associated with stress and PTS symptoms. This shows the importance of stress, not just PTSD. There are few longitudinal data on these very long-term outcomes. Importantly, they demonstrate the importance of stress on aging outcomes as even subthreshold PTS symptoms (when individuals meeting criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD were excluded) still have deleterious effects on functioning in middle and late middle age. They also address the question of whether factors are risk factors or consequences of illness. For example, our twin study showed that pre-trauma cognitive ability was a risk factor for PTSD, and that the relationship was due to shared genetic influences. We also examined genetic associations with cortisol (a \"stress\" hormone), showing negative effects of childhood adversity on cortisol and negative effects of cortisol on brain structure in frontal cortex, but not hippocampus in middle aged VETSA twins.

Page 96 C. Contributions to Science 1. Characterization of Cerebral Metabolic Activity and Functional Connectivity in Cognitively Normal Elderly with Genetic Risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Early -onset AD (EOAD), and Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) . Cortical metabolism and blood oxygen fluctuation (functional connectivity) are important measures of brain activity. AD and other dementias have characteristic hypometabolic patterns, useful for making clinical diagnosis. We have examined the correlation between hypometabolism and cognitive deficits in early -onset AD and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a related dementia. These hypometabolic patterns can be understood as networks, with structural and functional connectivity demonstrable by MRI analyses (voxel -based morphometry and blood - oxygen level dependent signal). We have applied these analyses to elderly cognitively normal subjects with genetic risk for AD (Apoe -E4 allele) and early AD patients. A novel measure of BOLD signal complexity (approximate entropy) has also been introduced. These findings help characterize pathological brain activity in Apoe -E4, EOAD, and PCA.

Recently, a vascular hypothesis of AD has emerged, which posits that cerebrovascular dysfunctions, such as arterial stiffening, loss of autoregulation, oligemia, and breakdown of blood -brain barrier (BBB), likely precede and may even cause vascular and parenchymal amyloid deposition. The development of imaging markers for cerebrovascular pathologies might provides a new window of therapy. Using advanced MRI sequences, we have successfully examined cerebral perfusion, BBB permeability, and vascular compliance in in MCI and early AD patients (see Figure).

Personal Statement As Professor within the Division of Biostatistics in the Department of Preventive Medicine at USC, I have over 25 years of experience in directing biostatistical and data coordination activities for multiple single -centered and multi -centered clinical trials and observational studies. I have directed the biostatistical and data coordination activities of 14 randomized clinical trials (10 of these NIH- or PCORI -funded), and two NIA-funded program projects, and have a wealth of experience and expertise in analysis of longitudinal clinical trial outcomes. Four of these trials have focused on hormonal and soy interventions related to atherosclerosis and cognitive outcomes in postmenopausal women. Importantly, I direct the biostatistical functions including support for design and conduct of clinical trials and clinical studies, of the USC CTSI. In all of this research, I hav e been responsible for all statistical and data-related functions from inception and study design through data collection and oversight, interim reporting, data analyses and final reporting. Therefore, I have extensive expertise in the design, conduct and analysis of longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials. Related to the dissemination of this research, I have contributed directly to the statistical analyses, interpretation of results and preparation of abstracts and manuscripts. For the randomized clinical trials specifically, this has resulted in more than 80 publications over 25 years. I am furthermore deeply committed to training the next generation of clinical investigators and biostatisticians. In my CTSI position and as director of the M.S. programs in Biostatistics and Epidemiolog y in the Department of Preventive Medicine, I have served as primary (over 100) and secondary (40) mentor to K-awardees, junior faculty, and graduate students (MS and PhD); over 40 of my peer-reviewed publications, co-authored with mentees, have resulted from these mentoring activities.

Contribution to Science 1. Non-invasive measures of atherosclerosis progression: statistical contributions. Early in my biostatistics career at the University of Southern California, I was fortunate to include Dr. David Blankenhorn as a faculty mentor. At that time, Dr. Blankenhorn was actively seeking to develop and validate non-invasive measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. Working with Robert Selzer of the CalTech Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Dr. Howard Hodis, we designed and conducted multiple studies to develop carotid ultrasongraphic measures of intima -media thickness (CIMT) and arterial stiffness as valid and highly reproducible atherosclerosis measures. We importantly demonstrated associations of longitudinal measures of CIMT progression with measures of atherosclerosis change measured by invasive coronary angiography as well as CVD event risk. This body of work provided crucial rationale and validation for these non-invasive measures that are now used routinely in both longitudinal observational and clinical trials to assess vascular risk factors as well as efficacy of interventions. a.

While observational studies overwhelmingly support the hypothesis that postmenopausal hormone therapy reduces cardiovascular disease risk, randomized clinical trials testing this hypothesis have in general failed to support the hypothesis. Notable differences in the populations evaluated in observational studies compared to clinical trials, as well as animal and human data, led to the proposition of the timing hypothesis that hormone therapy effects on disease risk varies by timing of initiation and the underlying status of the vasculature. In collaboration with Howard Hodis, I have designed, conducted and analyzed three major randomized clinical trials that used the non-invasive CIMT measure as well as coronary Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 100 angiographic measures of atherosclerosis as primary outcomes. Major contributions of these trials have shown that: (1) hormone therapy postmenopause reduces the progression of atherosclerosis under primary prevention (reference a), but not under secondary prevention (reference b) conditions, and (2) major mechanisms of benefit are cholesterol modification (HDL increase, LDL decrease). The seminal clin ical trial specifically designed to test the timing hypothesis was recently published (reference d). a.

Vascular contributions to cognitive decline and dementia. Understanding the contribution of vascular disease and risk factors to the onset and progression of cognitive impairment has potential high impact on both the prevention and treatment of cognitive -impairing disease, most notably Alzheimer disease. For more than 15 years, I collaborated as the primary biostatistician on a program project ( Helena Chui, PI) to specifically evaluate the role of vascular disease and risk factors on cognitive impairment. As the biostatistician, I was intimately involved in the study designs and data collection and analysis for these observational studies; critical aspects of study design included definitions of study populations and study groups, sampling methods, and planning of longitudinal assessments. Using longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive evaluations, our group has reported associations of vascular disease and risk with Alzheimer disease and vascular brain pathology, as well as both MRI- and PET-measures of brain structure and pathology. a.

Personal Statement I have a long-standing interest in the role of inflammation in cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease processes. A unique clinical background and research training have prepared me well to pursue this scientific focus. I am a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon with a translational science laboratory. My post-doctoral training focused on the vascular biology of cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion injury and the design and implementation of experimental models of cerebrovascular disease. Through interactions with mentors and collaborators at the University of Southern California's Air Pollution and the Brain Network and Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) , I have become especially interested in the effects of air pollution in the setting of stroke and cerebral hypoperfusion. I have assumed these understudied areas as my principal research focus . As an Associate Scientific Advisor for Science Translational Medicine , I authored editor's choice articles on air pollution: Clearing the air about stroke (Mack, 2013); and Breathe easy, but be concerned (Mack, 2013) and Alzheimer's disease : Looking into the crystal ball for Alzheimer's disease (Mack, 2013). My team has recently demonstrated the detrimental impact of particulate matter exposure on the progression of experimental stroke (Liu, 2016) and has a review paper accepted on the effects of air pollution in the central nervous system. Through support of an ADRC pilot grant, our laboratory established a role for the complement cascade (C5) in white matter injury secondary to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (Liu, 2013). Leveraging the concepts and models from these studies, we are now examining the joint influence of nanoparticulate matter (nPM) exposure and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) on white matter injury, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease risk. I was granted an NIH/NIEHS ONES award to study the joint effects of nPM exposure and CCH in young male mice (Mack; R01ES024936) . I have collaborated closely with Drs. Finch, Chen, Zlokovic, Mack and Sioutas (all investigators on this P01) on these studies. The current project proposal is a logical extension of my scientific interest and prior work. B.

Our group has employed both murine and clinical models of cerebral hypoperfusion to examine the impact of inflammatory mediators on ischemic injury and cognitive outcomes. In a clinical carotid endarterectomy model of cerebral hypoperfusion, our research has demonstrated a roughly 25% incidence of subtle cognitive decline in the absence of overt neurologic change or radiographic evidence of stroke. Our studies have demonstrated that neurocognitve change is associated with elevations in biochemical markers of cerebral injury (S100B,) and upregulation of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators (Mack 2008, Mocco 2006) These putative risk factors parallel those of AD/ vascular dementia and suggest an inflammatory mechanism. We demonstrated the intravenous Magnesium infusion is protective against neurocognitive deficits in a clinical carotid endarterectomy model of cerebral hypoperfusion (Mack, 2009). Our murine chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) studies have established an association between white matter injury, astrocyte/ microglial reactivity, and working memory deficits. We have demonstrated that the C5 complement component plays a critical role in white matter injury following CCH. Further, we have demonstrated that C5 deficient mice are protected from white matter ischemic injury secondary to CCH (Liu, 2013). 1.

Air Pollution in Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseaae I have contributed an invited editorial to Science Translational Medicine on the association between air pollution exposure and stroke incidence/ mortality (Mack 2013). Our group was the first to study the influence of nanoparticulate matter in the setting of experimental stroke. Air pollution is a prevalent environmental source of both inflammation and oxidative stress. These processes are both known to contribute to the progression of stroke. My laboratory has demonstrated that nanoparticulate matter exposure increases stroke damage in an experimental murine model (Liu 2016). Following cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion, mice exposed to nPM exhibit significantly larger infarct volumes and less favorable neurological deficit scores. These mice also demonstrate increases in markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the region of the ischemic core. We plan on extending these findings to studies in other cerebrovascular pathologies and neurodegenerative disease. 1.

Med . 2014 6, 219ec10 Inflammation/ oxidative stress and micrvascular failure in the setting of stroke The effects of microvascular failure on stroke progression are well documented. Imaging studies demonstrate that marginally viable cortical tissue is recruited into a central ischemic core within forty-eight hours of cerebral large vessel occlusion. Moreover, susceptible territories closely match early perfusion deficits, implying that regional flow failure is a prominent feature of tissue ultimately destined for infarction. Our group has examined the temporal characteristics of complement upregulation following experimental stroke (Mack 2006). Additionally, we have investigated the effects of genetic deletion and pharmacologic inhibition of the major components. Our studies have demonstrated ischemic protection in C3 knockout mice and through pharmacologic inhibition of the C3a C5a receptors (Mocco 2006). receptor modulation of granulocyte infiltration appears to be reperfusion dependent. Together, these results suggest an anaphylotoxin mediated inflammatory mechanism of complement related injury. We have also demonstrated the cerebroprotective effects of citrate/sorbitol -stabilized Dehydroascorbic acid through suppression of excessive oxidative metabolism (Mack 2006) and the feasibility of intracorporeal hypothermia in the setting of acute stroke (Mack, 2003). 1.

Inflammation and Blood Brain Barrier Breakdown Following Brain Aneurysm Rupture Cerebral vasospasm following rupture of a brain aneurysm results in stroke in approximately thirty percent of patients. Evolution in management strategies has been slowed by deficiencies in understanding of the Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 106 mechanisms that underlie this process. Coupled with increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, inflammation may incite delayed stroke. My work has focused on elucidating the role of inflammation in the setting of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Leveraging serum biomarkers, imaging and clinical data from aSAH patients, our group has demonstrated a role for Intercellular Adhesion Molecule -1 and the C3a complement component in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm (Mack 2002, Mack 2007). We are currently studying the role of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9). MMP9 is an enzyme involved in breakdown of the blood brain barrier. Prior studies have demonstrated a correlation between elevated MMP 9 levels in the blood and stroke following rupture of brain aneurysms. A clear mechanism is yet to be determined. Our investigation utilize data obtained from advanced MRI perfusion imaging sequences to demonstrate an association between MMP 9 upregulation and breakdown of the blood brain barrier following aneurysm rupture (Mills 2013). The study examines the relationship between compromised blood brain barrier integrity and the occurrence of stroke. A positive correlation would suggest a potential role for MMP 9 as an early diagnostic biomarker and blood brain barrier permeability as a therapeutic target in the management of stroke following rupture of brain aneurysms. 1.

Personal Statement Throughout my career, my research interests and efforts have focused on the problems of high dimensional data, particularly, biological -based measures in population studies (e.g., population -based genomic and transcriptomic data) in the context of better understanding the pathogenesis of complex diseases. I have developed statistical methods for the analysis of integrative genomic data in the context of animal model, epidemiological, and clinical studies. There are three major areas of statistical methods development that have dominated much of my professional career, i) powerful and computationally efficient approaches to identify epistasis and statistical interactions in general, ii) mediation analysis hypothesis testing, and iii) false discovery rates. The common theme of these approaches is their key importance in extracting knowledge from high- dimensional and biologically -based measures, such as genomic data. These approaches all address the critical need for sound statistical tools applicable to integrate and analyze large -scale complex biological data. For example, there is broad agreement regarding the widespread existence of epistasis, gene -environment interactions, etc., but statistical methods that can handle genomic data remain fairly limited. Mediation analysis is essential in the ability to differentiate between the deluge of dependencies that are not in a disease pathway versus those that are. I have developed the permutation -based FDR approach that does not depend on parametric assumptions that may be difficult to satisfy. My background in neuroscience and statistical methods designed for molecular data in clinical and epidemiological settings compliments the team and provides necessary support for developing strong experimental design and analysis. My experience in developing and applying methodology with few parametric assumptions and advanced quantification of uncertainty in the context of causal inference will be a strong asset for Project 1, Aim 3 in particular. I will also contribute to the dissemination of scientific findings from the Program Project. B.

Contributions to Science (link to full list of publications: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/1T1UacyCvssQm/bibliography/48012715/public/?sort=date&direction =ascending) Two-step methods to discover gene -gene or gene -environment interactions. The paper below (1), the first publication of this type of statistical approach, has been cited 164 times as of today (5/15), a substantial number for a statistical methods paper, which typically has a relatively small readership. I introduced the concept of using dependencies between features such as SNPs (or SNPs and environmental exposures) as a screening statistic in a two-step analysis designed to detect interactions between those features. Another novel concept presented in this paper (1) was the extreme power advantage of multi-degree -of-freedom tests of main effects and interactions over formal interaction tests. This paper has spawned a number of other methodology papers with approaches designed to detect gene - gene and gene -environment interactions. 1. Millstein J, Conti DV, Gilliland FD, Gauderman WJ.

The papers below describe a novel statistical hypothesis test for causal mediation of a measured feature that potentially mediates a known causal relationship between two other measured features. This test is robust and computationally efficient and thereby useful for genomic applications. It has been applied to genomic challenges such as identifying genes whose expression affects sleep phenotypes, identifying DNA methylation loci predictive of epithelial ovarian cancer risk, and identifying cis eQTL genes that mediate trans eQTL effects. Unlike many other mediation approaches commonly used, such as the Sobel test, the publications below demonstrate that is well suited to distinguish reverse causality from causality, minimizing cause -effect confusion. 4.

Commentary on the importance of this article was published in same issue by Watson NF. Searching for the -based false discovery rate methods (FDR). The papers below are the first publications of a novel, computationally efficient approach for computing confidence intervals for FDR estimates. This work has the potential to have a high impact across scientific disciplines because it can fundamentally change how we approach 'statistical significance' in high dimensional testing settings. FDR, recently gaining popularity for addressing the multiple testing problem, can be thought of as a signal -to-noise ratio approach, which is already a substantial departure from the traditional Bonferroni method. FDR confiden ce intervals allow for another sea change in how we approach multiple testing by freeing the investigator from an a priori significance threshold, which may not yield any discoveries even when there is ample evidence that multiple null hypotheses are false.

The papers below describe a novel approach that allows affected -sib-parent studies to be used in a statistically versatile and powerful analysis, where association and linkage effects can be simultaneously estimated in a joint model. Joint estimation allows for increased power using joint tests of association and linkage, but it also allows for conditional tests of linkage given association. The conditional test of linkage will provide signal that will go to zero at the disease locus, providing a novel way of fine mapping a linkage effect without collecting additional data. 11.

Normandy, Caen, FRANCE Ph.D. Oct 2012 Neuroscience, Stroke, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA Feb 2013 - Neuroscience, present Alzheimer, Stroke, MRI A. Personal Statement I received my PhD in Neuroscience in October 2012, supervised by Pr. Denis Vivien from the University of Caen Lower Normandy. During my PhD, I investigated the impact of a well-known serine protease, called tissue - type plasminogen activator (tPA, the only approved treatment in the acute phase of stroke), on the neurovascular unit and specifically its role on the positive modulation of the glutamatergic neurotransmission involving N- Methyl -D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In parallel, I developed and optimized molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of endothelial activation with a contrast agent targeting molecules associated with inflammation, specifically vascular cell adhesion molecule -1 (VCAM -1). By examining endothelial cells, diagnosis and non- invasive evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders appear to be feasible even before symptom appearance including cognitive decline. My works clearly showed that it is possible to evaluate inflammation of the CNS with non-invasive and semi -quantitative manners, using very high sensitivity. This approach would allow selecting patients that are the most likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment in numerous neuropathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). I started my postdoctoral training in February 2013 in the outstanding team supervised by Dr. Berislav Zlokovic. I brought my expertise in molecular MRI and other types of MRI analysis, in vivo optical imaging, animal surgeries, among other molecular and cellular biology skills. Over the past 4 years, I generated data on the blood -brain barrier (BBB) permeability Ktrans measurements working closely with Dr. Zlokovic, Dr. Law, Director of the ADRC Imaging Core along with Dr. Toga, and Dr. Chui and other members of the USC imaging team. I also collaborated with Drs. Jacobs and Barnes from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) to develop and test different paradigms to quantify BBB permeability in the entire brain both in humans and mice using a modified dynamic contrast -enhanced (DCE) -MRI technique. I used several approaches including Patlak's mathematical modeling and Tofts -based pharmacokinetic analysis of DCE-MRI and our newly developed software (Rocketship ) to compute the blood -to-brain constant Ktrans reflecting the vascular integrity. I recently developed a new dynamic susceptibility -contrast (DSC) imaging method in order to get quantitative and precise Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 114 measurements of cerebral blood flow and volume. I also set up a new high-resolution 3D-T2*-weighted imaging sequence to detect small microhemorrhages, hemosiderin plaques, brain calcification, and amyloid deposits as small as 10-microns diameter in rodents. Finally, in collaboration with Drs. Thompson and Jacobs, I have actively participated in the improvement of a new multi -shell hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI) method for white matter fibers reconstruction (tractography) from DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) -MRI data acquired both in humans and rodents. The wide range of MRI techniques that I developed and optimized over the past 8 years allow simultaneous study of pathophysiological features in AD and ischemic stroke in both humans and animals. Our new set of high-resolution MRI sequences will improve knowledge of neurovascular dysfunctions that occur in AD and other neurological disorders. B.

Personal Statement My research interests originated in studies of cerebral control of circulation and cardiovascular disease. My early work focused on animal models of atherosclerosis, including apoE knockout mice, and cellular models of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress. More recently, I have applied this background to study vascular contributions to neurodegenerative disease (Nation et al. 2014; Nation et al., 2015), occult cerebrovascular disease (Nation et al 2012) and neuropsychological decline. This research has involved novel approaches to MRI-based assessment of cerebrovascular dysfunction (Nation et al., 2013). Since coming to USC in the fall of 2013, I have continued to focus on mechanisms linking systemic vascular disease to neurodegenerative pathophysiology, and development of clinical and research tools to better assess underlying vascular contributors during early stage disease. My most recent unpublished work has focused on the role of vascular protective factors, including cells expressing hematopoietic and vascular progenitor markers. Using in vitro models from patient blood samples, I have found that these progenitor cells are reduced in patients with cognitive impairment, where they correlat e with memory performance and cortical thickness. Further research in this area will contribute to efforts aimed at predicting and preventing dementia, as well as identification of new treatment targets. B.

Contributions to Science (selected from over 36 publications) URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Nation+DA%5BAuthor%5D 1. Vascular stiffness contributes to Alzheimer's disease. I have contributed to our understanding of how systemic vascular disease relates to AD. Prior work had suggested that age-related arterial stiffening was associated with cognitive decline and that this may be due to cerebrovascular injury secondary to hemodynamic alterations (incre ased pulse wave velocity and decreased buffering of pressure oscillations). It has been hypothesized that these hemodynamic changes may also impact AD pathophysiology by interfering with amyloid clearance. To investigate these possibilities, I led a series of clinical studies investigating relationships between markers of arterial stiffness and a variety of AD markers (cognitive decline, CSF biomarkers, autopsy). In collaboration with co- authors, I discovered that brachial artery pulse pressure, a marker of arterial stiffening, is associated with cognitive decline and CSF biomarkers of AD in cognitively normal older adults (Nation et al. 2013). Specifically, this research revealed that pulse pressure is associated with both decreased CSF amyloid and increased phosphorylated tau, a novel finding that we have replicated in two separate samples of older adults (Nation et al. 2013, 2015). Finally, I developed an MRI-based marker of cerebrovascular resistance by investigating relationships between blood pressure and cerebral blood flow using arterial spin labeling MRI in older adults and AD patients. Results indicated cortical and subcortical cerebrovascular resistance are elevated across the aging -MCI-AD spectrum (Nation et al. 2013). These findings were extended to a larger cohort where cerebrovascular resistance was found to be increased in patients who were amyloid positive and to correlate with with future regional amyloid deposition. Finally, increased cerebrovascular resistance in conjunction with cerebral amyloidosis was highly predictive of neuropsychological decline, brain atrophy and progression to dementia over several years of follow -up (Yew and Nation, in press). Findings support the hypothesis that arterial stiffening may contribute to cogn itive decline and AD pathogenesis through its effects on the neurovascular unit, amyloid clearance, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. 1a.

Pulse pressure in relation to tau-mediated neurodegeneration, cerebral amyloidosis, and progression Neurology . 72(5):546 -553. 2. Vascular stiffness contributes to cognitive and brain aging. I identified brachial artery pulse pressure as a risk factor associated with worse cognitive performance in older adults (Nation et al., 2010). I also led another study in which we showed that ante-mortem pulse pressure elevation greatly increases the risk of occult cerebrovascular disease in AD patient brains at autopsy (Nation et al. 2012). Additional studies indicated that pulse pressure predicted decline in executive function over 5-7 year follow -up, and exhibited greater associations with decline among those at genetic risk for AD due to APOE4 carrier status (Nation et al., 2016). These data suggest that pulse pressure may be a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline among those at high risk for AD. In a collaborative study investigating an MRI-based marker of cerebrovascular resistance, we found that increased pulse pressure was associated with cognitive decline in those with reduced cerebral blood flow (Clark, Nation, et al., 2015). These studies suggest that pulse pressure may influence cognitive decline by impairing cerebral blood flow. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page D., M.W. (2010).

Use of AT1-receptor blockers (ARBs) is linked to neurocognitive benefits in older adults AT1-receptor blockers (ARBs) represent one class of antihypertensive medications that have been highlighted for their salutary effects on cognition. ARBs are also thought to specifically attenuate the pulsatile component of blood flow through their vascular \"de-stiffening\" effects. In a recent study, I found that older adults taking ARBs showed improved AD biomarker profiles in CSF samples, and attenuated progression to dementia over longitudinal follow -up (Nation et al., 2015). In a more recent follow -up study we found that patients taking ARBs that are capable of crossing the blood -brain barrier seem to show particularly salient benefits. Specifically, these individuals exhibit less memory impairment and less white matter lesion burden, potentially suggesting salutary effects on cerebrovascular disease and vascular cognitive impairment (Ho and Nation, in press). 3a.

Ongoing work from my own laboratory, and the focus of the present application, involves unpublished studies of circulating angiogenic and vascular -repair factors (e.g., endothelial progenitor cells and circulating angiogenic cells) in age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline. I have hypothesized that these factors represent a \"vascular reserve\" that may become senescent and attenuate in the context of vascular risk and aging, leading to problems maintaining and repairing the cerebrovasculature and neurovascular unit. These studies focused on novel protective factors will substantially advance our understanding of resilience mechanisms in the aging brain and will lead to new insights and targets for therapeutic and risk assessment science. Initial findings indicate that progenitor cells are attenuated in mild cognitive impairment, where they correlate with memory performance and cortical thickness (Nation et al., 2017). 4a.

Abstract to be presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in London. 5. Behavioral and neurohypophyseal contributions to cardiovascular disease. I have contributed to our understanding of how behavioral and endocrine factors influence the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Prior work had demonstrated that sedentary lifestyle in humans and physical inactivity in animals can lead to accelerated atherosclerotic disease, but the mechanisms involved remained unclear. Using animal models of atherosclerosis (apoE knockout and WHHL rabbit), I found that physical inactivity leads to increased vascular NAD(P)H oxidase activity (Nation et al. 2008), which may represent a major mechanism by which sedentary lifestyle leads to cardiovascular disease. I also investigated a potential role for the neurohypophyseal peptide, oxytocin, in the amelioration of atherosclerotic of attenuates atherosclerotic lesion progression, vascular inflammation, and adipose tissue inflammation in apoE knockout mice (Nation et al. 2010). In collaboration with colleagues, we found that oxytocin prevents vascular inflammation and oxidant stress in vitro, as it reduced NAD(P)H oxidase activity and Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Personal Statement Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating disease first described more than 100 years ago yet the underlying mechanisms causing sporadic AD remain elusive. Interestingly, many neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and AD share several underlying similarities including protein misfolding and programmed cell death. Strikingly, disruption of the blood -brain barrier also occurs in these diseases which allow toxins and other molecules to enter the brain. One key player in BBB maintenance is the pericyte. Notably, pericyte number is reduced in AD post-mortem brain tissue. Unfortunately, little is known about how pericyte reduction alters overall brain function. I hypothesize that pericyte maintenance of the BBB is crucial for proper neuronal function. Specifically, I am interested in how pericyte reduction affects the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and memory. I have extensive hands -on experience with immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology, and have utilized EFAD and other Alzheimer's related mouse models. Also, I have studied the beneficial effects of estrogen on hippocampal function. Therefore, this P01 is an extension of my experience and interests to understand how air pollution impacts the BBB which could lead to Alzheimer's disease. For this Sub-Core, I will perform tissue immunofluorescent and fluorescent lectin staining and confocal imaging of the NVU and quantification. I am excited to work with Drs. Mack and Finch for Projects 3 and 4 planning and discussion, and will work closely with Drs. Zlokovic, Montagne and Kisler on a daily basis for experimental design, execution and data interpretation. I will spend 20%/2.4 calendar months per year working on this project. B.

In Press Beneficial effects of estrogen on hippocampal function: The benefits of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on cognition is controversial. However, previous studies have varied the time after menopause at which ERT is initiated. In rats, we found that estrogen replacement restored hippocampal plasticity up to 15 months post-ovariectomy. This beneficial effect was no longer observed 19 months post-ovariectomy. Our studies suggested that there is a critical period during which ERT is beneficial for cognition.

Duration of estrogen deprivation, not chronological age, prevents estrogen's ability to in Alzheimer' s disease : Cholinergic degeneration occurs in AD, and can be mimicked in rats by lesioning of nerve growth factor (NGF), leading to its accumulation, which subsequently triggers sprouting of noradrenergic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglia into hippocampus. Coincident with this sprouting, there is an increase in cholinergic innervation that correlates with a recovery of M1 muscarinic receptor dependent plasticity at CA3-CA1 synapses and visual cortex. M1 mAChRs have been a recent focus as a therapeutic target for AD given their role in cognition and non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that noradrenergic sympathetic sprouting and the associated increase in cholinergic innervation maintains non-amyloidogenic APP processing that is dependent upon M1 mAChRs. We found that NGF stimulates sprouting and that sprouting maintains non- amyloidogenic APP processing. Furthermore, we showed that A42 is not only toxic to central cholinergic fibers innervating hippocampus, but it prevents and reverses noradrenergic sympathetic sprouting and the accompanying cholinergic reinnervation. 1.

In this application, we will examine the neurotoxic effects on postmenopausal women enrolled in the WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS -Y), focusing our collective effort to investigate the long-term TRAP exposure effects on the new measures of structural brain MRI harmonized by USC investigators using the Neuroimaging Core using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) biomarkers data. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at USC. My research interests include utilizing longitudinal data analysis to examine risk factors for cognitive decline and emotional distress in older adulthood. My work has utilized complex data analytic methods including: bivariate dual change score modeling, multilevel latent growth models, longitudinal biometric simplex modeling, gene by environment bivariate biometric twin modeling, survival analysis, and factor analysis. In addition to my work in longitudinal data analysis I have expertise in cognitive assessment and interpreting neuropsychological test data. I will work closely with Dr. Chen and the Project Data Core Director to develop the data analysis plan as related to: (1) applying the latent structural modeling to characterize the longitudinal profiles of cognitive domains pertinent to episodic memory and executive functions; (2) determining how these domain profiles are affected by TRAP exposures or associated with ADNI -derived structural brain MRI biomarkers; (3) constructing the structural equation models to evaluate the proposed mechanistic mediations for their contribution to the TRAP neurotoxic effects. I will also contribute to the publications and presentations over the course of the project. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 130 Relevant work related to this project include: 1. Petkus, A.

Contributions to Science 1. My postdoctoral research and predoctoral dissertation have focused on elucidating the complex association between anxiety, depression and cognitive decline. Anxiety is associated with worse cognitive performance in older adulthood; however, research had not examined the temporal dynamics between anxiety and cognitive performance. Before my work it was unknown if higher anxiety was contributing to worse cognitive performance or if worse cognitive performance was associated with subsequently higher anxiety. The extent to which genetic factors shared between anxiety and cognitive performance was contributing to this association was unclear. My work in this area found that cognitive performance was a leading indicator of change in anxiety while anxiety was not associated with changes in cognitive performance. I also found that higher anxiety was associated with increased risk of dementia over the 28-year follow -up period. Co-twin control analyses found that genetic factors common to anxiety were partially mediating this association. a) Petkus, A. J., Reynolds, C. A., Wetherell, J. L., Kremen, W.

I have served as a project coordinator or therapist on two NIH funded clinical trials examining psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for late life Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My duties on these projects included project recruitment, preparing IRB submissions, clinical assessment, managing data and providing health education. Many clinical trials for anxiety disorders have excluded participants over the age of 60. Because of this, the effects of common psychosocial treatments for anxiety were unclear. This work with Dr. Wetherell found that augmenting pharmacological treatment with Cognitive -Behavioral Psychotherapy prevented relapse of GAD over the subsequent year of follow -up. I was part of another collaboration with Dr. Wetherell documenting that interventions, both psychosocial and pharmacological, are less effective for older adults compared to younger adults. This led to the development of a review paper describing the rationale for testing new intervention methods for later life anxiety such as using mindfulness based Acceptance and Commitment (ACT) therapy. a) Petkus, A.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in older adults: A preliminary report. Behavior Therapy, 42 , 127-134. 3. My contributions to science also include elucidating the long-term impact of early life trauma exposure on later life health, emotional, and cognitive functioning. The long-term impact of trauma in chronically ill, physically impaired homebound older adults was unknown. The long-term impact of trauma early in life on cognitive functioning was also unknown, especially how genetic factors may moderate this association. My work found that homebound older adults who reported a history of trauma exposure were in worse physical and mental health than homebound older adults without this history. In the second examination we found that experiencing multiple sexual assaults was associated with greater declines in executive functioning over time, and the APOE e4 allele moderated this association. My work as a postdoctoral fellow, currently in press in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry , has examined the extent to which childhood trauma is associated with cognitive performance in older adults with anxiety and depressive disorders. We found that childhood trauma was associated with slower processing speed and worse attention and executive functioning in two independent samples of anxious and depressed older adults. a) Petkus, A.

Personal Statement I will serve as a Co-Investigator on this P01 application that will evaluate the relationships between APOE gentotype, sex and vulnerability to neural injury caused by air pollution. My training and experience in the neurobiology and neuroendocrinology of aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases are well suited to the proposed application. As outlined in Section C below, my doctoral studies focused on structure -activity relationships of the AD-related protein -amyloid with an emphasis on its neurodegenerative mechanisms. In my postdoctoral work, I extended my AD interests to include study of factors that regulate disease risk, focusing initially on the sex steroid hormone estrogen and its actions in reducing -amyloid toxicity and AD-related neurodegeneration. Subsequent research directions broadened this general theme of sex steroids, aging, and AD with the inclusion of ongoing projects with two other sex steroid hormones, progesterone and testosterone. Emerging areas of emphasis in my lab include (i) elucidation of the interactions between obesity, apoE, and AD and, (ii) identification of AD-related therapeutics in preclinical models. I have collaborated with Dr. Caleb Finch for several years. Recently, our laboratories have been jointly pursuing studies on the neural effects of apoE4. Our shared interests in sex differences and apoE are highly relevant to the proposed studies. Recent publications from my lab that are especially relevant to this grant application include the following: 1.

Contributions to Science 1. -Amyloid aggregation and toxicity. A critical step that jumpstarted modern AD research was the mid 1980's identification of a novel protein called -amyloid as the primary component of senile plaques. When I began my graduate work at UC Irvine in 1989 with mentor Carl Cotman and collaborator Charlie Glabe, very little was known about -amyloid and its role in AD. In studying the effects of -amyloid on neurons, I made a seminal discovery: the biological activities of -amyloid depend upon its physical conformation. My studies demonstrated that the inherent ability of -amyloid to change from a soluble, monomeric peptide into -sheet aggregates conferred the peptide with a pathological property: neurotoxicity. Additional work described the process of apoptosis as a key component in the mechanism of -amyloid toxicity. These findings helped to explain how - amyloid, a normal protein that is benign in its soluble state, can drive neurodegenerative changes when it accumulates in aggregated forms in the aging brain. a. Pike CJ, Walencewicz AJ, Glabe CG and Cotman CW (1991) In aging of -amyloid protein causes peptide aggregation and neurotoxicity. Neurodegeneration induced by -amyloid peptides in vitro: the role of peptide assembly state. Journal of -amyloid peptides: contributions of the 25-35 Journal of Neurochemistry , 253-265. and Alzheimer's disease . Although the most significant risk factor for developing AD is advancing age, there remains a large void in our understanding of which components of normal aging promote AD pathogenesis. One significant consequence of normal aging in men is a gradual depletion of testosterone, which is linked with increased risk of several diseases including sarcopenia and osteoporosis. My research program defined key aspects in the role of age-related testosterone loss in AD, an area largely unexplored when I began my investigations. We demonstrated for the first time that the male human brain is particularly vulnerable to loss of androgens with increasing age and helped establish that testosterone loss is an AD risk factor in men. Further, my lab identified and mechanistically defined three distinct neural actions of testosterone linked to its protective role against AD: (1) reduction of -amyloid accumulation by a mechanism that involves upregulation of the - amyloid degrading enzyme neprilysin, (2) neuroprotection mediated by androgen receptor activation of MAPK signaling, and (3) inhibition of tau phosphorylation by inactivating the kinase GSK3via a signaling pathway dependent upon androgen receptor activation of Akt and PI3 kinase.

Neurobiology of Aging 32 (4): 604- Progesterone and Alzheimer's disease . Estrogen loss at menopause was established as a risk factor for AD in women prior to my work in the field, but many questions were unanswered. Research by my lab determined that women with AD have low brain levels of estrogen. Notably, we found that depletion of estrogen accelerates pathology in animal models of AD, an effect prevented by estrogen treatment. Because hormone therapy in women usually includes both estrogens and progestins, we investigated the interactions between these hormones in regulation of AD-related pathology. A significant discovery by my group is that that the beneficial effects of estrogen are strongly regulated by progesterone. Protective estrogen actions are attenuated when progesterone is co-delivered in a continuous manner, but increased when progesterone is co-delivered in a more natural, cyclic pattern. One important action of estrogen associated with protection against AD and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases is protection from neuronal death. My research group has made important advances in the field's understanding of estrogen neuroprotection by defining key mechanisms. a.

Together with Adam Szpiro and other colleagues we have made important contributions on developing measurement error correction methods for inference about health effects for application to air pollution cohort studies. This work has fundamentally changed the perspective on measurement error. In these studies pollution is modeled using a statistical model. The measurement error induced has classical -like and Berkson - like components. These advances are critical to appropriate inference about air pollution health effects. a.

Personal Statement Airborne particulate matter (PM) in urban areas, derived from vehicle emissions and other sources, have well documented adverse effects with direct impact on life expectancy and quality of life. According to WHO, outdoor PM air pollution in both urban and rural areas was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2012; this mortality is due to exposure to small particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter (PM10), which causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease as well as cancers. In contrast to multiple health risks from toxic airborne PM for cardiopulmonary conditions, the direct involvement of the nervous system is less appreciated, even though the brain may be as vulnerable to toxic airborne PM as the heart and lungs. There is, therefore, an urgent need to define the links between PM exposure and onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and to identify possible preventive or therapeutic interventions, which is the goal of the proposed research. My earlier work has focused almost exclusively on respiratory and cardiovascular effects of air pollution. In limited studies published recently in collaboration with the group of Drs. Finch, Morgan, Forman and Mack (see list below), we demonstrated the role of urban PM on neuro -inflammation. Our ground - breaking work has been showcased in a feature article at Science events have been associated with neurodegenerative processes, it is possible that extended exposure to PM may aggravate events connected to the progression of these disorders. The work described in this proposal, represents natural continuation - expansion of my research in this area, as these novel studies will establish the direct link between urban airborne ultra-fine particles (UFP) and neurodegenerative disease. 1.

Contribution to Science 1. My research has followed an integrated approach to the problem of the well-publicized and significant effects of aerosols produced from anthropogenic processes on health and the environment. My group at the University of Southern California, and a significant number of my collaborating colleagues from many institutions in the US and Europe, have worked collectively to investigate the underlying mechanisms that produce the health effects associated with exposure to air pollutants generated by a variety of combustion sources, such as traffic, harbor and airport operations, power plants, and photo -chemically induced atmospheric reactions. We have conducted extensive studies examining the oxidative properties of urban coarse, fine, and ultrafine particles (UFPs). We showed that UFPs were most potent particulates in the urban environment toward inducing cellular (HO-1) expression and sensitive marker for oxidative stress, is directly correlated with the high organic carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of UFPs. Because the small size of UFPs allows better tissue penetration, we used electron microscopy to study subcellular localization. UFPs and, to a lesser extent, fine particles, localize in mitochondria, where they induce major structural damage. This may contribute to oxidative stress. Our studies demonstrated that the increased biological potency of UFPs is related to the content of redox cycling organic chemicals and their ability to damage mitochondria. Moreover, we showed that mice exposed to UFP exhibited significantly larger early atherosclerotic lesions than mice exposed to PM 2.5 or filtered air. Exposure to ultrafine particles also resulted in an inhibition of the anti- inflammatory capacity of plasma high-density lipoprotein and greater systemic oxidative stress as evidenced by a significant increase in hepatic malondialdehyde levels and upregulation of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes. a.

I have been the principal investigator in the design and development of state -of-the-art particle concentrator technologies that have enabled the assessment of the relative toxicity of particulate pollution sources using for the first time in the literature realistic atmospheres in in vivo and in vitro studies in multimillion -dollar research centers funded by the US EPA, NIH and CARB in Southern California. Several of these technologies are also being used by agencies such as the U.S. EPA, as well as a host of international institutes in Europe and Asia. These technologies have been used in a number of major toxicological investigations funded by EPA, NIH and CARB, exploring the linkages between PM emitted from traffic and cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological health effects. a.

I have also led the design and development of innovative and effective personal monitoring devices that were used by epidemiologists in many parts of the world to measure population exposures to air pollutants and determine how this exposure relates to lung growth, exacerbation of early asthma and cardiopulmonary inflammation. These technologies, combined with novel source apportionment techniques, have also been instrumental in major NIH- funded panel studies in demonstrating for the first time stronger associations between systemic inflammation and primary (i.e. directly emitted) than secondary (photo -chemically formed) PM in elderly populations in the LA Basin. On the other hand, the same studies demonstrated stronger association between respiratory inflammation and secondary organic aerosols than primary PM, thereby establishing for the first time a clear distinction of the effects of primary vs secondary emissions in the LA basin. These findings are very important in the promulgation of air quality control strategies, as they underscore for the first time differential health outcomes associated with primary vs secondary PM. a.

My group at USC has conducted in the past 18 years the most extensive physical, chemical and toxicological characterization of PM in the Los Angeles Basin (LAB) to-date. These data were crucial in understanding the physico -chemical evolution of PM in the LA Basin and formed the basis for the design of hypotheses - based toxicological and panel studies using our LA Basin as a real-world laboratory. We have studied the formation and dynamics of traffic - generated air pollutants near freeways and demonstrated the increased (more than 10-fold) exposures to these toxic pollutants near freeways and busy thoroughfares. These studies have produced highly cited publications, (including the Hagen -Smit award of Atmospheric Environment for seminal paper ) and have been used as a criterion for placing schools near roadways as part of the state of California Senate Bill 25 (SB25). a.

Comparative Safety of Commonly used Medications High-quality, observational pharmacoepidemiologic research can provide important insights into the unanticipated adverse health effects of established and newly marketed medications. Of particular interest to me and my colleagues have been hormones and cardiovascular medications. Observational epidemiology can also further our understanding of within -class effects, both beneficial and harmful. I had led several NIH-funded studies investigating comparative -safety of commonly used hormone therapy in peri and postmenopausal women. Our research, which has taken advantage of formulary changes at Group Health Cooperative to conduct a quasi -experimental design, demonstrated that oral conjugated equine estrogens (marked at Premarin and Prempro) are less safe than other oral hormones, including estradiol and esterifie d estrogen. Relative to estradiol, conjugated equine estrogens are associated with a marked increased risk of venous thrombosis. Using blood from controls in our case-control study, we demonstrated that women using conjugated equine estrogens had a higher propensity to clot than those using the other oral estrogens. a.

Genetic Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Endo and Clinical Phenotypes I have contributed to a better understanding of the biology underlying common cardiovascular conditions by conducting statistically -informed research into the genetic predictors of cardiovascular clinical phenotypes and their endophenotypes. Part of my contributions has come from my leadership in 3 settings where I co-convene international working groups addressing the genetics of venous thrombosis, hemostasis, and heart failure. Our work has been cutting edge and has provided the larger biologic research community with validated results. As a recent example, we conducted the largest meta -analysis of a genome -wide investigation identified 9 genome -wide significant hits: 6 were previously validated, 2 replicated in 3 different populations, and 1 did not replicate. The 2 genes newly associated with venous thrombosis have never been suspected, have no known role in coagulation or fibrinolysis yet account for 25% (2 of 8) of the validated findings. a.

Personal Statement I direct the 35-member USC Imaging Genetics Center and am PI and Co-founder of the ENIGMA Consortium, which conducts the largest brain imaging studies in the world (e.g., Hibar et al., Nature , 2015; Nature Communications , 2017). I direct the ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging and Genomics, an NIH Center of Excellence that brings together over 800 scientists to study 18 major brain diseases, from schizophrenia, bipolar illness and depression to HIV, and most recently, stroke recovery. ENIGMA's work has been covered in Science, Nature , and MIT Technology Review and honored (Kent Innovations in Academia First Prize, 2015) as an innovative approach for \"crowd -sourcing\" science. ENIGMA's work led to the discovery of common genetic variants that affect the brain in over 30,000 people scanned with MRI and genome -wide scans. I was trained as a mathematician and later received a Ph.D. in neuroscience. In 2013, my team and I moved to the University of Southern California, to create the USC Imaging Genetics Center (http://igc.ini.usc.edu) and the USC Stevens Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics, a new facility in a dedicated 5-floor building, with the staff and expertise to coordinate and assist hundreds of worldwide neuroimaging collaborations. I am a Professor of Neurology, Psychiatry, Engineering, Radiology, Pediatrics, and Ophthalmology at USC. Our Center's research focuses on the neuroscience, mathematics, software engineering and clinical aspects of neuroimaging and brain mapping. My group of 35 trainees develops new methods to analyze brain images. We track how diseases spread in the brain over time, often before symptoms begin, and how medications resist them. We specialize in multi -site neuroimaging efforts on an unprecedented scale, such as the ENIGMA Consortium, whose 30 working groups analyze data from over 35 countries (Thompson + 287 authors, 2013; Hibar et al., Nature, 2015). I serve as PI for numerous NIH grants on large -scale brain MRI and DTI studies, and have organized Summer Schools for over 200 students on Mathematics in Brain Imaging (2004, 2008). Over 20 researchers visit our Center annually to learn brain image analysis. In my 23+ years in neuroimaging, I published over 1,879 publications, including over 800 peer-reviewed journal papers, now cited over 80,000 times (h-index=132). I am on the board of editors for 7 journals in engineering and neuroscience. Our Center's mathematical and computational tools are used in over 100 national and international collaborations, with research teams in drug companies and other universities. Recent work, reported in Nature, Nature Genetics, New England Journal of Medicine, Nature Neuroscience, and PNAS , has mapped dynamic (4D) processes in brain development and in clinical populations, and factors that influence them. I manage many large -scale image analysis studies. All our analysis methods are available to all interested investigators, and have already been used to initiate collaborations with many investigators interested in medical imaging.

Contribution to Science For 23 years I have developed new neuroimaging methods and approaches to study brain development, aging, neurological disease and psychiatric disorders. This effort led to over 700 publications with over 1,000 co- authors. I now lead a worldwide alliance of scientists, called the ENIGMA Consortium, which brings together 800 scientists from 35 countries to study 18 major brain diseases. Thomson Reuters lists me as a Top Cited Researcher in Science (h-index=132; 700+ publications). 1. ENIGMA Consortium and Imaging Genetics . I co-founded and lead the ENIGMA Consortium (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu ) - a global alliance of 800 scientists - with all their vast biomedical data and expertise - discovering factors that help or harm the brain. ENIGMA published the largest neuroimaging studies to date of Major Depressive Disorder (Schmaal 2016a,b; N=10,105), Schizophrenia 2017; N=3,242) combining MRI data from >20,000 people. Papers on epilepsy, addictions, HIV, and neurogenetic disorders (22q deletion syndrome) 2017; Villalon 2017). We study 18 major brain diseases in over 30 countries worldwide - schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar illness, ADHD, anorexia, anxiety, HIV/AIDS, addictions, autism and 22q deletion syndrome, OCD and epilepsy. ENIGMA performs the largest -ever genomic screens of brain measures, involving GWAS in >31,000 people with brain MRI scans and clinical data. A dynamically evolving community - attracting new members, projects, and opportunities - ENIGMA's sites work 24/7 on computational projects in harmonizing, integrating, and relating distributed biodata worldwide. Our algorithms analyze brain maps, measures and signals, and relate them to genomic, environmental and epidemiological data, and clinical outcomes. With worldwide alliances tackling major brain diseases, and different imaging techniques, ENIGMA's 30 Working Groups study medication effects, clinical symptoms, and brain connectivity. A network Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 152 of concurrent subprojects share information dynamically. Together, we discovered 8 genetic loci that affect brain volumes in over 30,000 people (Hibar +287 authors, Nature , Jan. 2015; Adams et al., ., et al., Nature Communications , 2017; Stein +207 authors, Nature Genetics , 2012). The Lancet noted this effort as \"Crowd sourcing meets neuroscience\". The New York Times noted that ENIGMA \"gives us a source of power we have not had\".

I and my team developed the first method to track the dynamic progression of Alzheimer's disease in the living brain (Thompson et al., J. Neuroscience, 2003), creating dynamic time-lapse movies of disease progression. I developed mathematical innovations in a method called tensor -based morphometry (Thompson et al., Nature, 2000) to measure growth and tissue loss in the living brain, and profiles of tissue loss in the dementias. We published over 100 papers discovering factors that affect brain aging -from exercise and diet, obesity (Ho et al., PNAS 2010), blood markers of pathology, genetics, and drug treatments. In the New England Journal of Medicine, we reported evidence that brain tissue loss is faster in carriers of a TREM2 mutation, leading to an approach to boost power in drug trials. I was first author on a paper mapping methamphetamine effects on the brain, picked by Discover Magazine as one of the \"Top 100 Discoveries in Science\" (2004). a.

In Nature (2000), I was first author on a paper reporting a new method to track brain growth rates in children , using continuum mechanics and covariant partial differential equations from physics. We applied this with collaborators worldwide to study autism, fetal alcohol syndrome, and neurogenetic disorders (Fragile X, Williams syndrome). My most highly cited paper (2704 citations) tracked the sequence of development of the human cerebral cortex from age 4 to 21 (Gogtay et al., 2001). We used this same method to suggest how some antipsychotics might slow brain changes in schizophrenia. a.

Personal Statement I have a unique background and expertise in the fields of meteorology and human health, which although seemingly distinct, they are interconnected and important to study in concert. This background has allowed me to push forward into new frontiers concerning the relationships of the state of the atmosphere on large and smaller scales with human health, specifically extreme heat and air pollution. I focus on the physical process of dangerous environmental conditions, and how these conditions affect human health in time and space. At the microclimate scale, I focus on the biophysical causes and impacts extreme heat and air pollution on human health under dynamic conditions, such as in complex urban environments and/or during physical activity. My research areas include human heat balance modeling, extreme heat climatology, urban bioclimatic design and instrumentation, children's heat health, and air pollution epidemiology. My interdisciplinary expertise in these areas, leadership and organizational skills, and intrinsic motivation to use my skills to optimize health will allow me to successfully carry out my tasks on this project related to the managing air pollution data, providing guidance on the application of the given data in conjunction with relevant environmental connections, and guiding the team on manuscript preparation and reporting of air quality information. I am currently successfully administering multiple projects and guiding graduate students (e.g. staffing, research organization and tasks, b udgeting), continue to collaborate in interdisciplinary research across institutions and countries, and produce numerous peer-reviewed publications each year. The proposed research project builds logically on my prior work. I also bring a dimension of working across disciplines in a joint interdisciplinary position at UC San Diego (Climate, Atmospheric Science, Physical Oceanography and Family Medicine and Public Health) to bridge the gap between the atmosphere and human health.

POWE Junior Faculty Enhancement Award, Oak Ridge Associated Universities C. Contributions to Science 1. Early research throughout my Ph.D. focused on urban micrometeorology and addressed issues related to human heat balance modeling for thermal comfort in outdoor environments. My research completed in this area comprehensively examined gaps in the scientific literature pertaining to human physiology connected to fine-scale weather features during exercise, including mechanisms of heat formation and dissipation, heat stress on the body, the importance of skin temperature monitoring, and clothing effects. I also applied heat wave and climate projections to urban parks and heat balance modeling into the future. This work Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 161 further improved upon the ability to model outdoor thermal comfort of humans performing physical activity and applied findings to health, emergency heat stress preparedness, and urban bioclimatic design --a topic prominent in European city design, yet minimal in North America. Linking these various disciplines provided me with a strong interdisciplinary foundation from which to grow, and further provided a critical foundation for microclimatologists and biometeorologists in the completion and comprehension of climate research involving human physiology. The four publications below built upon one another to jointly demonstrate the viability and potential uses of outdoor energy balance models. a. Vanos, JK., Warland, JS., Gillespie, TJ., Kenny, NA.

Journal of Applied Meteorology & Climatology. 51(9): 1639 completed during my Postdoctoral Degree at Health Canada involved air pollution and applied synoptic climatology studies assessing the syner gistic impacts of synoptic -scale air masses (large -scale weather systems) and air pollution on human health. Air pollution is a significant contributor to illness and death, yet understanding the confounding and interactive factors of various pollutants and meteorological combinations (e.g. heat wave 'types') proves difficult, and the effects also vary across different subpopulations. Work that I led in this position addressed air pollution -related mortality in various ages of the population, particularly the elderly, and cause -specific mortality (cardiovascular and respiratory) in the full population of all large Canadian cities. Findings demonstrated that mortality risks due to air pollution exposure differ by weather type (hot or cold, dry or moist), with increased accuracy obtained when accounting for interactive effects through adjustment for dependent pollutants using a new distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM). My Post-Doctoral work culminated in assisting with investigations of the modifying effects of socioeconomic in connecting respiratory health with air pollution and traffic related air pollution exposure within 200m of busy roadways in Windsor, Ontario. a.

PMID: 27064731 3. My most recent research endeavors synthesize my Doctoral and Post-Doctoral training to link environmental design, physiology, and behavior with exposures of heat, ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), and air pollution at a personal scale, particularly in children. Personal monitoring is an important future research avenue, underscoring two research thrusts: 1) the need to for personal assessments of exposures to solve issues at finer scales rather than generalized population outcomes, and 2) children are among the population groups disproportionately affected by ambient extremes and climate change, yet minimally studied. Hence, I am working towards developing real-world observations using personalized instruments in urban and schoolyard microclimates for risk exposure assessments. Initial findings indicate that more Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Personal Statement I have a career long focus studying the role of cerebral blood vessels in the pathogenesis and treatment of neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, and related disorders and stroke. Using animal models and studying human brain, my laboratory has shown that dysfunction in the blood -brain barrier (BBB) and brain microcirculation can accumulate before neuronal dysfunction and contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. My research team has identified the cellular and molecular mechanisms in cerebral blood vessels causing disruption of the neurovascular unit and BBB breakdown, which leads to neuron loss in models of Alzheimer's disease, pericyte -deficient rodents and stroke. We have developed novel neuroimaging and molecular biomarkers of the neurovascular unit and BBB integrity in the living human brain. My group has identified molecular mechanisms at the BBB that maintain clearance of Alzheimer's toxin amyloid -beta from the brain into the circulation, and its influx or re-entry from the circulation into the brain, reflecting an important physiologic function of the BBB in maintaining amyloid -beta homeostasis. Discoveries of my research team have contributed to the development of Phase 2 and 3 studies in Alzheimer's disease patients based on amyloid -beta clearance and/or inhibition of its re-entry into the brain, respectively, and Phase 2 studies in stroke patients based on activated protein C as a neuroprotective agent.

Our studies in different models of neurological disorders and humans addressed the role of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and blood -brain barrier (BBB) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, dementia, ALS and stroke. We found that a chronic BBB breakdown leads to neuronal dysfunction, injury and secondary neurodegeneration. Our recent study in the living human brain found an age-dependent BBB breakdown in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory, which worsens with mild dementia and correlates with injury to pericytes, a BBB-associated cell. Listed below are recent original contributions and two reviews that cite several of our primary papers in this area. I served as the primary investigator in these studies.

Our studies of vascular brain mural cells have demonstrated that pericytes control key neurovascular functions including regulation of the BBB permeability, cerebrovascular integrity and cerebral blood flow that is necessary for normal neuronal structure and function. We also showed that aberrant signal transduction between endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes BBB and CBF dysregulation causing secondary neurodegenerative changes and neuronal loss.

Nature Neuroscience , 20, 406 -416. 3. In my earlier research, we found that peptide bond prevents peptides from using rapid amino acid transport systems at the BBB and that neuropeptides (e.g., enkephalins, vasopressin, DSIP, TRH, leptin) have limited access to the brain, but can still be transported slowly across the BBB via specific \"peptidergic\" carriers and/or receptors. This work led to discovery of RAGE and LRP1 as major influx and efflux receptors for Aat the BBB, Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 170 respectively, that control Alevels in the brain. These studies led to a concept that i) peripheral circulating A contributes to Alevels in the brain and ii) clearing Afrom brain to blood limits Alzheimer's cerebral - amyloidosis. Both findings contributed to development of A-lowering clinical trials. I was the primary investigator in these studies.

Page 174 Project Summary/Abstract Our overarching goal is to further resolve the neurodegenerative role of traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP), a ubiquitous exposure in urban areas where most older Americans reside. Our recently published epidemiologic data showed strong association between elevated PM 2.5 (particulate matter <2.5\u00b5m) and increased dementia risk in women >65 years, with a bias for ApoE4 homozygotes (JC Chen in Cacciottolo et al 2017, PMID 28140404). In this same report, experimental studies of female mice from the Finch -Sioutas Labs showed that exposure to nPM (a nano -sized subfraction of TRAP) was pro-amyloidogenic with an ApoE4 bias. Other changes include attrition of hippocampal CA1 neurites and myelin, which model selective damage in AD and cerebral ischemia. In a mouse stroke model, nPM exposure exacerbated cerebral ischemic damage (William Mack: Liu et al 2016, PMID 27071057 ). Differences by sex and ApoE alleles suggest sources of heterogeneity in human responses to TRAP. We propose four projects: epidemiological studies of two nationwide cohorts of women (Project 1, JC Chen: Women's Health Initiative Memory Studies; WHIMS) and men (Project 2, C Franz and W Kremen: Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging, VETSA) and two experimental studies of air pollution exposure (Project 3, Finch: mouse models of aging and AD; Project 4 Wm Mack, chronic ceebral hypoperfusion). These projects address a common set of questions: (1) What is the AD risk imposed by TRAP and does the associated risk vary by sex, life stage, and APOE/other alleles? (2) What neurodegenerative changes are induced by TRAP and what is the resulting risk for early cognitive decline of AD? (3) Which brain pathways are most susceptible to TRAP neurotoxicity? (4) Do shared mechanisms (e.g., amyloidogenesis, cerebrovascular damage and hypoperfusion, and neuroinflammation) predispose to premature cognitive decline and an increased AD risk? Two supporting Cores provide population neuroinformatics, neuroimaging of blood -brain -barrier (BBB) and myelinated tracts, large -scale air pollution modeling and epidemiology, inhalation exposure assessment and neurotoxicology. Neuroimaging Core B1 provides human brain imaging harmonized across sites and mediation analyses (Projects1 -2). B2 provides high-resolution imaging of BBB and tractography for mouse models (Projects 3-4). Core C Environmental Exposure and Neurotoxicology subcore C1 harmonizes exposure (Projects1 -2); C2 provides inhalation exposure of mice for studies of sex and ApoE allele responses (Project 3) and of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (Project 4); C3 analyzes brain inflammatory protein responses to TRAP. For P01 integration, the Administrative Core builds on the infrastructure of AirPollBrain (led by Finch& Chen), a USC -funded collaborative network since 2010. Results of this program will advance understanding of TRAP contributions to AD risk and accelerated cognitive decline, and provide a rationale for preventive intervention in the environmental neurotoxicology of AD. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 175 Project Narrative Relevance to Public Health [revised ] The brain is vulnerable to air pollution. A multi -disciplinary and multi -institutional team from the University of Southern California and their collaborators will study how traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) from metropolitan areas where most older Americans reside contributes to accelerated brain aging and risk of dementia . In the next 5 years, the team will study human populations and experimental models to examine the brain pathways that are specific for Alzheimer disease for gender and age differences in vulnerability to TRAP. These studies address the neglected role of common environmental neurotoxins in the development of Alzheimer disease and interactions with Alzheimer risk genes.

Integration across human versus rodent projects: shared hypotheses; mechanisms . See 'Overall Program A3 and Approach, Summary of Scientific Projects C1'. We hypothesize that the adverse effects of traffic - related air pollutants (TRAP) on cognitive impairment and increased risk for MCI/AD are mediated through multiple convergent neuropathological pathways pathology; APOE4 and sex. Traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP) -associated cerebrovascular injuries will be evaluated by the volume of white matter hyperintensities measured by structural brain MRI in populations (Projects 1&2). For mouse studies (Projects 3&4), cerebrovascular and white matter tract responses to TRAP exposure will be assessed by in vivo multiphoton imaging for regional CBF and (7.0T) brain imaging at 80\u00b5m isotropic spatial resolution will assess white matter connectivity in fractional anisotropy maps. 2. Dose -exposure data: a. for human projects: variation of air pollution exposure data across different regions in the country and different time/place for the study populations . The proposed approaches will account for the variation in air pollution exposure present in both the modeled environmental processes and constructed individual residential histories. The standard MESA -AIR models follow a \"regionalized\" framework combining temporal basis functions with spatially -varying coefficients and spatiotemporal residuals1 (see Core C1). This approach captures both regional - and local -scale exposure variability. The WHIMS prospective design allows the Project -1 to account for time -varying exposure levels due to relocation since enrollment, and we could estimate the residence -specific exposures (weighted by the duration at each location) already used in the published work.2-4 This approach will be applied to Project -2 built on VETSA. b. for animal projects: much higher doses than the estimated exposures in humans; further definition and justification of the exposure dosing in animal studies may be needed . See Project 3 Methods and Core C2. The mouse exposure to PM0.2 at 300 ug/m3 for 150 h (1% of the lifespan) delivers 2.25 mg/kg. For humans, exposure to PM0.2 at 30 ug/m3 for 1% of lifespan yields 2.5 mg/kg, assuming inhalation rates: mouse, 0.025 L/min; human, 12 L/min. 3. Harmonization of neuroimaging for human projects ADNI, WHIMS, and VETSA scans will be analyzed separately. We will adjust for scanner strength and site effects in all within -cohort analyses that contain multiple sites or scanner strength. To analyze cross -site data within VETSA, we will use random effects meta -analyses, which avoids the need to use the same scan protocol across sites and gives more robust effects than aggregated mega -analysis. We have related expertise leading ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ ), in which we pool scans from >60 sites to detect genetic, epigenetic, and disease -related brain effects. 4. Distinction between mouse Projects 3 & 4. See Project 4 Introduction. To maximize connections between the projects and increase the overall interaction of the program grant, Project 4 employs similar exposure paradigms (nPM, age, mouse strain) and outcome assessments as Project 3. Project 4 is designed to assess the effects of nPM in an experimental paradigm that isolates an exclusively vascular influence/ risk factor for AD and cognitive decline (CCH). While the exposure paradigm is intentionally shared, the scientific questions are independent and different. Project 4 examines synergistic relationships between nPM exposures and CCH. As stated, critical vascular endpoints in Project 4 examine effects of age in nPM/ CCH exposed mice. Project 4 hypothesizes that nPM -CCH will not show a \"ceiling effect\" seen in mice exposed to only nPM and described in Project 3. Additionally, Project 4 Aim 3 now examines TLR4 and C5 interplay as a central mechanism of injury in nPM/CCH mice. 5. New institutional support from three USC deans . See Administrative Core 2.A.2. The development of this new program of environmental neurosciences has received continuing support from the Provost's Research Office since 2010. For the P01 resubmission, new support is committed from USC Vice President, Prof. J Randolph Hall, for $20,000/year (see Support letter); from the Keck School of Medicine for 3% of Indirects/yr for 5 years (email documentation from Keck Dean Rohit Varma and Tom Buchanan, Vice -Dean for Research); from the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology for $40,00/year (support letter from Dean Pinchas Cohen); and from the Viterbi School of Engineering for $5,000/yr for 5 years (support letter from Vice Dean Moghaddam). Total institutional support is $401,200 for the entire program period. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 182 Specific Aims OVERVIEW OF PROGRAM SPECIFIC AIMS The long-term goal of this program is to resolve individual risk, heterogeneity, and biological basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in aging populations. The development of this new P01 follows recommendations by the 2015 AD Research Summit for conducting \"Interdisciplinary Research to Understand the Heterogeneity and Multifactorial Etiology of Disease.\" 1, 2 Older adults are most susceptible to the adverse effects of ambient air pollution3, 4 that is well known to impact respiratory, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Increasing evidence from the environmental health sciences (EHS) literature has pointed to the neurotoxic effects of outdoor air pollution, including pollutants from regional emissions and local sources such as vehicular exhausts. Our investigative team is empowered by the USC -funded AirPollBrain Network to develop the collaborative network at the frontier of environmental neurosciences in air pollution and brain aging. We focus on traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP), because traffic is the biggest source of urban air pollution, accounting for 25% of ambient PM 2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <2.5\u00b5m) across the world.5 In the US, TRAP has become a major public health concern,6 because of its association with a wide range of adverse health outcomes. With NIA's critical support from NIA (RF1AG051521, R21AG040683, R21AG040753, R21AG050201), USC investigators have started translating the new EHS knowledge into studying the contribution of TRAP to brain aging in experimental models.7-12 Since 2014, three epidemiologic studies13-15 in non-US populations have linked regional air pollutants (including PM 2.5) with an increased risk for dementia. NIA support (R01AG033078; R21AG051113) also helped established the first epidemiologic evidence for association of increased dementia risk with regional PM 2.5 exposure in an US-wide cohort of older women which has ApoE4 bias (Fig.2, section A4). However, whether TRAP increases AD risk in both women and men remains unclear. This new P01 proposes to further resolve the role of TRAP, a ubiquitous exposure in metropolitan areas where over 75% of older Americans reside. Specifically, this application assembles four projects, including two community -based cohort studies and two neurotoxicological experimental projects. These projects are cohesively designed and integrated to address a common set of four fundamental questions: Q1: What is the AD risk imposed by TRAP and does the associated risk vary by sex, life stage, APOE and other alleles? Q2: What neurodegenerative changes are induced by TRAP and what is the resulting risk for early cognitive decline of AD? Q3: Which brain regions are most susceptible to TRAP neurotoxicity? Q4: Are there shared underlying mechanisms predisposing to premature cognitive decline and an increased AD risk? We formulate these questions, based on a conceptual framework which combines new data from air pollution epidemiology and neurotoxicology with state -of-the-knowledge in cognitive neurosciences, clinical neuroimaging and neuropathology as related to the life course and mechanisms of AD. The two population studies are designed cost-efficiently, each built on a geographically -diverse cohort of women (from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Studies [WHIMS]; Project -1) and men (from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging [VETSA]; Project -2). The proposed studies on WHIMS and VETSA examine putative associations of TRAP with early neuroanatomic biomarkers predictive of increased risks for AD, mild cognitive impairment, and preclinical AD. We will assess whether/how exposure before and/or during late life influence the neuropsychological processes; elucidate the brain structure/neuropathology affected by TRAP; and assess the biological susceptibility to adverse TRAP effects on brain aging. Projects 1 and 2 innovate by bringing together sophisticated spatio -temporal air pollution modeling and novel neuroimaging to advance our knowledge in population neurosciences of TRAP and brain aging. In Projects 3 and 4, mouse models are exposed to precisely defined air pollution for neurotoxicological responses of AD-specific pathways. Cutting -edge mouse brain imaging studies are integrated in mouse models (AD transgenic mice; chronic cerebral hypoperfusion; inducible microglial knockout of TLR4) to address mechanistic links of TRAP to amyloidogenesis, cerebrovascular damage, and neuroinflammation. Each project leverages expertise and unique resources from two Supporting Cores equipped with state -of-the-art tools and analyses in environmental epidemiology, exposure sciences, air pollution neurotoxicology, population neuroinformatics, and white matter and neurovascular brain imaging. Findings from the proposed research will improve our understanding of the critical and greatly understudied role of environmental contributions to AD and related dementia16-18: With our novel environmental neuroscience approaches, this PO1 can provide new impetus for preventive intervention and deciphering the environmental neurobiology of AD.

Public Health Significance of Studying Traffic -Related Air Pollutants and ADRD Risk [revised ] Our recent epidemiologic findings show strong associations of elevated PM 2.5 (particulate matter <2.5\u00b5m) with white matter loss4 and increased dementia1 risk in a US-wide cohort of older women (>65 years) from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) (Fig.2 below, R01AG033078; PI: Chen). Correspondingly, experimental studies show that nPM (a nano -sized subfraction of PM 2.5) exposure in urban environments induces oxidative stress with selective attrition of hippocampal neurites and glutamate receptors and also increases amyloid deposits in AD transgenic female mice with ApoE4 preference 1 (Fig. 3 below; RF1AG051521; PI: Finch). This revised P01 application proposes to further resolve the role of traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP),23 a ubiquitous exposure in metropolitan areas where >75% of older Americans reside.24 Since 2014, seven studies1, 17-19, 25-27 reported an increased risk for dementia associated with exposures to regional air pollutants (including PM 2.5)1, 17-19, 26 or TRAP.25, 27 Using the medical claims data from 2.2 million adults aged 55-85 years who resided in Ontario, Canada,25 investigators found that the dementia risk increased by 7%, comparing people living less than 50 m from a major traffic road versus >300 m. This could translate to 7-11% of dementia cases among those with high exposure to traffic; the elevated risk remained (~5%) even after accounting for regional air pollutants. However, their approach did not allow for ascertaining the clinical AD cases . We recently expanded our analyses of WHIMS outcome data and showed that high PM 2.5 exposure (exceeding the US EPA standard of 3-year average >12 \u00b5g/m3) in 1999 -2010 increased AD risk by 71% (see section A4). Traffic accounted for 15%-50% of source -related PM 2.5 across the US, depending on regions and differences in primary vehicular sources.28-31 If the hypothesized causal link is substantiated by the proposed research in both sexes, long-term exposure to TRAP could account for 5-16% of incident AD cases .32 A2. Ambient Air Pollution - a Novel Environmental Determinant of Brain Aging [revised ] Growing evidence supports the emerging concept that exposures to ambient air pollutants are a novel environmental determinant of brain aging.33 In the last few years, cross -sectional studies reported relatively low performance in various tests of cognitive function among adults and older people residing in places with higher levels of ambient air pollutants (including PM 2.5 34-36 and ozone36, 37) or in proximity to major roadways.38, 39 Adverse PM effects on cognitive declines were also shown in most longitudinal studies.40-43 Of the seven reports 1, 17-19, 25-27 of increased risks for dementia associated with ambient air pollution, only three non-US studies examined TRAP. However, there were notable limitations in their exposure characterization. One study only measured the proximity to major roadways,25 the second study relied on aggregated exposure estimates26 prone to ecological biases, or the third study using a spatial model towards the end of study follow -up to estimate the NO x exposure in earlier years,27 which obscured the temporality of the reported association. We identify six critical knowledge gaps in the current literature on air pollution - neuroepidemiology of pathological brain aging, which are addressed in Projects 1 and -2. (1) Dearth of prospective cohort data linking individual -level exposure estimates with increased ADRD risks in US-based populations (except our recent findings;1 and preliminary data from Project -1, section A4). (2) No studies have examined the putative exposure effects on early biomarkers predictive of AD. (3) The existing evidence linking air pollution with cognitive aging was not specific to understanding the exposure effects of early cognitive decline predictive of AD. (4) No study has examined mid-life (e.g., aged <60 y) TRAP exposure effects on brain aging. (5) Very few neuroimaging studies elucidated the vulnerable target areas in adult brains and mechanistic pathways underlying the neurotoxicity of air pollution. (6) We lack longitudinal data to examine individual susceptibility to and gene -environment interactions in neurotoxic effects of air pollution on ADRD risk (except our recent findings;1 see Fig.2 below in Section A4). Mechanisms in air pollution neurotoxicology are proposed in Projects 3-4, using the same mouse genotypes and paradigm for exposure to TRAP, to address six critical knowledge gaps . (1) How closely do neurodegenerative pathways in AD match the brain regions responding to air pollution; (2) How do sex and age alter neurodegenerative and white matter vulnerability to TRAP. (3) How do human ApoE3 and E4 alleles alter vulnerability. (4) How does cerebral hypoperfusion alter vulnerability. (5) Does TRAP exposure alter the blood -brain barrier. (6) What is the role of microglial TLR4 in neurodegenerative responses to TRAP . A3. Overall Framework of Proposed P01 Application [revised ] Figures 1 depicts the overall conceptual framework of this program project linking exposure to TRAP with neuropathology, adverse subclinical neurotoxicity, and risk for AD in both populations and experimental models. Based on this framework, we posit that the adverse effects of TRAP on cognitive impairment and Research Strategy Page 183 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. increased risk for MCI/AD are mediated through multiple convergent neuropathological pathways pathology; tauopathy) that are modulated by APOE4 and sex. The cerebrovascular hypothesis is increasingly recognized, as highlighted in editorials by JC Chen (Co-PI of P01).44, 45 Extensive literature documents that regional air pollutants, especially the airborne particles, increase the risks of coronary heart disease and stroke.46-48 Epidemiologic data from recent cohort studies further pointed to the important role of TRAP contributing to the increased risk and mortality of cerebrovascular disease.48-50 These putative TRAP -associated cerebrovascular injuries will be evaluated by the volume of white matter hyperintensities measured by structural brain MRI in populations (Projects1 & 2). Project -2 will also use extant data on arterial spin labeling to assess cerebral hypoperfusion in men. Projects 1 and 2 will examine the TRAP -induced neurodegeneration by investigating cortical thinning and GM/WM volume loss measured by structural MRI. For mouse studies in Projects 3&4, blood -brain barrier (BBB) integrity after TRAP -nPM exposure will be assessed by 7.0T MRI brain imaging with gadolinium tracer. Recently published data of Project 3 showed TRAP -nPM induced hippocampal that model the greater vulnerability of CA1 neurons to AD and cerebral ischemia. TRAP - induced cerebrovascular hypoperfusion affecting myelin and neuron degeneration (Project 4; in collaboration with Project 3) will be examined in hippocampal subregions by histochemistry and by Western blots for myelin and neuron proteins. The proposed studies of these putative brain structural neurotoxicity will focus on the medial temporal lobe-hippocampus memory system 52 and the frontostriatal -executive system, 53 vulnerable neural networks affected in brain aging and in AD.54 A4. Environmental Neurosciences of Brain Aging USC investigators have led new discoveries in the emerging field of environmental neurosciences of ADRD in human populations1, 3, 4, 36 and experimental studies1, 11, 13, 14, 16, 51, 55-57 with critical NIA support. Our recent report 1 (R01AG033078, PI: Chen), showed that elevated PM 2.5 (3-year average >12 \u00b5g/m3) was associated with 1.65-fold higher risk of accelerated cognitive decline and 1.92-fold increased risk of dementia (Fig.2A), with potentially greater impact in ApoE 4 carriers (Fig.2B). We employed a conventional spatiotemporal modeling approach58, 59 to estimating PM 2.5 and examined its adverse effects using Cox models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for global cognitive decline (>8-point loss in modified mini-mental state exam) and dementia risk among non-Hispanic white women (N=3647 with 3 or 4; aged 70.3\u00b13.7) in 1999 -2010. Our results showed that residing in high PM 2.5 locations (exceeding the US EPA standard of 3-year average >12 \u00b5g/m3) increased the incidence of global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia, and these observed adverse PM 2.5 effects were greater among women of 4/4. The overall incidence rate of accelerated global Figure 2. Adverse effects of PM 2.5 exposure on pathological brain aging, stratified by APOE alleles, in Cox models. Hazard ratios for adverse outcomes were estimated with high (3-year averages PM 2.5 >12 \u00b5g/m3) versus low exposure, all adjusting for age, geographic region, spatial random effect, years of education, household income, employment status, lifestyle factors (smoking; alcohol use; physical activities), and clinical characteristics Research Strategy (use of hormone treatment; depression; body Pagem1a8s4s index; hypercholesterolemia; 1 Figure 1: Schematic neurodegenerative Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 185 Research Strategy cognitive decline increased by 81% (hazard ratio or HR=1.81; 1.42-2.32), comparing older women residing at locations with high versus low PM 2.5 (Fig.2A). The incidence of all-cause dementia in older women with high PM 2.5 exposure was 92% higher (HR=1.92; 1.32-2.80) than the incidence with low exposure (Fig.2B). Incidence rate for all-cause dementia associated with high PM 2.5 exposure increased 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4 carriers. High PM 2.5 exposure was also associated with greater incidence of global cognitive decline by 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4 alleles. Incidence rate of AD increased by 71% (HR=1.71; 1.18-2.48) associated with residing in location with high PM 2.5 exposure in the full sample (n=134 AD in the final adjusted model; N=6128). The relatively small number of AD cases limited our further assessment of interaction with APOE alleles. Studies with mice showed that airborne ultrafine particulate matter from urban TRAP is proamyloidogenic1 (R01AG051521, PI: Finch). EFAD mice (transgenic for human ApoE alleles and Familial Alzheimer disease mutations) showed sex-ApoE differences in cerebral cortex amyloid deposits after chronic exposure to a nPM, which is a nano -sized subfraction of PM 2.5.16 Female E4FAD showed the strongest response, while male EFAD did not respond. The increase of fibrillary amyloid deposits in nPM -exposed E4FAD mice (Fig.3A; unpublished) is the first experimental evidence for sex differences in response to TRAP components for brain amyloid deposition and is consistent with greater risks for ADRD associated with high PM 2.5 in older women 4/4 carriers (Fig.2B) . Wildtype mice also responded to chronic nPM, with a pro-amyloidogenic shift in processing of the endogenous murine APP towards A production, with an increased ratio of sAPPb:a (Fig. 3B). These novel findings extend prior reports on wild-type rodents, two with inhaled exposure to Figure 3. TRAP -nPM is proamyloidogenic for EFAD and C57BL/6 mice. (A). Female E4FAD mice chronically exposed to nPM had robust increase of A42 deposits in cortex (immunoreactive area), while male EFAD did not respond. (B). Male C57BL/6 mice ('B6', the background strain of EFAD) with chronic nPM had a pro-amyloidogenic shift of APP processing (an increased ratio of the sAPPb:a peptides by Western blot). N=7-9, Mean+/ -SEM, *p<0.05 diesel particles 60, 61 and others using nickel -nanoparticle enriched ambient air62 or concentrated PM 2.5, 63 all with increased endogenous soluble A peptide. Wildtype rodents have never shown fibrillary A deposits during aging, possibly because the endogenous rodent A peptide has less aggregation to neurotoxic forms because of three amino acid differences from the human,64. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TRAP -nPM accelerates cognitive decline and increases dementia risk by synergizing with AD pathway -specific neurodegenerative mechanisms . A precedent for these air pollution ApoE4 interactions is the greater vulnerability of ApoE4 carriers to an increased AD risk associated with pesticide exposure.65, 66 Downstream effects of TRAP -nPM include degeneration of hippocampal CA1 myelinated neurons that mediate episodic memory and that are selectively vulnerable to AD and ischemia. 67 A5. Novel Mechanistic Pathways of Air Pollution Neurotoxicity [revised ] We propose an overarching neuropathogenetic hypothesis that TRAP exposure accelerates cognitive decline and increases the risk of AD by promoting AD-specific neurodegenerative pathways (Figure 4), which spread progressively from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, with extensive white matter deterioration. The locus coeruleus is especially vulnerable to toxins and likely the earliest site of tauopathy.68 The propagation of Figure 4: Schema of AD neurodegenerative pathways. The locus coeruleus shows the tauopathy, followed the trans -entorhinal cortex, and thence to other neocortical and subcortical regions. Neurons of entorhinal cortex (ERC) layers II and III project via the perforant path (PP) to hippocampal neurons of and CA1. A. EFAD Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 186 Research Strategy AD neuropathologies follows a pathway of neurodegeneration from the entorhinal cortex in the medial the myelinated perforant path (PP).67, 69 These postmortem findings are further supported by brain imaging MR studies, which show a sequence of neurodegeneration in the MTL posterior parahippocampal gyrus white matter (PWM) that spreads via the PP to the hippocampus. Consistent data from human brain imaging studies have shown the atrophy biomarkers of AD.70-73 For instance, clinical AD brains had smallest PMW volumes, while amnestic MCI had intermediate PWM loss.74, 75 Moreover, cognitively normal elderly with initially smaller PWM volumes incurred accelerated memory decline and increased AD risk.76 Because of the shared vulnerability of hippocampal CA1 neurons to AD and to cerebral ischemia,67 TRAP exposure may promote convergent neurodegenerative processes from cerebrovascular and neuronal interactions. Aspects of this overarching hypothesis are addressed by each project (Table C below). Project -2 also has unique data on pupillary responses reflecting the activation of locus coeruleus77 where the AD pathology may first appear , as suggested by neuropathology in young adults with \"pre-tangle\" tauopathy propagating rostrally to the trans -entorhinal region of the MTL. 69, 78, 79 Together the four projects will assess WM neurodegeneration as an early signature of TRAP neurotoxicity. A6. Traffic -Related Air Pollutants Urban -dwelling populations, especially those living in close proximity to the roadways, are potentially exposed to high levels of traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP) from motor vehicle emissions. TRAP represents a complex mixture of the EPA-regulated criteria air pollutants (e.g., carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxides [NO 2]; PM) and other hazards. Despite the improving air quality in the past two decades,80 with both the vehicle miles traveled81 82 and size of urban -dwelling population continue to grow, the TRAP and its contribution to PM exposure will remain a major public health concern. A recent CDC report linked the 1999 -2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) to the National Highway Planning Network,83 showed that more than 40% of the geocoded locations were within 500m of one or more major roads, which is often considered the TRAP exposure zone.84 For this P01 application, we focus on TRAP primarily from automobile exhaust near roadways for two main reasons. First, epidemiological studies have linked exposure to automobile exhaust with a wide range of adverse health outcomes (e.g., cancers, heart disease, asthma, preterm birth, autism).10, 84 However, the impact of long-term TRAP exposure on brain aging remains unclear (as reviewed in Project -1&-2). Second, the literature in air pollution neurotoxicology33, 85- 88 points to the critical role of smaller -sized airborne particles in TRAP. Although there is interest in assessing health risks from brake -wear, tire-wear or road-dust suspension,89-92 the neurotoxicity of these \"non-exhaust\" emissions is not well defined. The mixture of TRAP can be difficult to measure and model, because it is inherently dynamic in place and time. For the epidemiologic studies , TRAP will be characterized by the estimated ambient levels of NO2 (a gaseous surrogate), elemental carbon (EC) component of PM 2.5 (a marker of diesel exhaust),93-96 and predicted source profiles of PM 2.5. After obtaining the geocoded information over time, we will conduct the individual -level, residence -specific exposure estimation of these TRAP exposures, using state -of-the-art spatiotemporal modeling approaches (Core C1). Studying exposure to ambient air pollutants near residences is particularly relevant to aging Americans, because elderly people may spend most of their time on core activities in residential neighborhoods and local areas.97, 98 For experimental studies , mice are exposed to a nano -sized (nPM) subfraction of PM 2.5 collected near a local urban freeway in Los Angeles.16 Although primary emissions from diesel engines are used as a model TRAP pollutant, we prefer TRAP -nPM from near-roadway air samples as more representative of real-world exposure (see Core C2). B. Innovation [revised ] The following features define the innovation of this PO1 application: (1) The proposed interdisciplinary research program follows a cohesive conceptual framework to investigate the impact of TRAP on neuropathology, biomarkers/subclinical measures of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular damage, and long-term consequence on early cognitive decline predictive of AD. (2) In Projects 1&2, state -of-the-art spatiotemporal air pollution models are brought together with the novel population neuroimaging approaches to advancing our knowledge in population neurosciences of TRAP and brain aging. (3) In Projects 3 & 4, air pollution inhalation toxicological approach and cutting -edge mouse brain imaging studies are integrated with mouse experimental models: EFAD transgenic mice ; chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and a new inducible microglial targeted TLR4 -knockout mouse to probe mechanisms of TRAP neurotoxicity. (3) The design of our P01 population studies is cost-efficient by building on two large, unusually well- characterized, geographically diverse cohorts of women and men with unique clinical, neuropsychological, and structural brain MRI data NIA had invested for more than ten years.

In the Table C, we summarized the respective contribution of each project, including the key design feature and methodological approaches.

Page 188 Research Strategy Summary of Scientific Projects Project -1 aims to: (1) determine the impact of TRAP on early biomarkers predictive of increased risks for AD, MCI, and preclinical AD in older women; (2) examine the associations of cognitive decline reflecting early AD with TRAP exposure before/during late life; (3) elucidate the brain structure and neuropathology mediating the TRAP effects on pathological brain aging, using both targeted and agnostic approached with high-dimensional neurocomputation; and (4) evaluate the contribution of ApoE4 and vascular brain injuries to the individual susceptibility to neurotoxic TRAP effects. Extended the NIA-funded study (R01AG033078), Project -1 is built on the joint cohort of mid-aged and older women in the WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS -Y; n=1326, inception age 50-54) and WHIMS -MRI (n=1403, inception age 65-80) followed annually since 1996, both with comparable longitudinal assessments of neuropsychological functions. Complementary to Project -1 in women, Project -2 is built on the VETSA (Veterans Twin Study of Aging), a nationwide prospective study designed to identify early biomarkers of late-life cognitive impairment by following a twin cohort of men starting at late midlife (age 51-60). Project -2 will (1) assess TRAP effects on AD- related brain signature risk scores; (2) assess the impact of TRAP on cognitive and brain aging; and (3) examine gene -environment interactions. The twin design of VETSA plus the proposed MZ co-twin analyses provides major methodological advantages to control for potential confounding by early life environment and genetic factors. Project -2 unique data include Diffusion Tensor Imaging, arterial spin labeling, and pupillary - based cognitive responses as biomarkers of early cognitive decline reflecting locus coeruleus dysfunction. Projects 3 and 4 use mouse models of TRAP exposure to probe age and sex differences in AD risk and mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Project 3 defines the progression of neuron and white matter degeneration and cerebrovascular disturbances in wildtype and EFAD mice exposed to TRAP for age and sex differences in vulnerability. The new microglial -targeted TLR4 -ko roles in neurodegenerative responses to air pollution. Project 4 introduces interactions of TRAP with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Because ApoE4 carrying women have greatest AD risk, mice carrying human ApoE alleles (EFAD) will be studied for sex interactions with TRAP.

Environment: USC is becoming a national leader in building basic, clinical, and translational neurosciences. During the past 5 years, USC recruited leading investigators: Arthur Toga and Paul Thompson (Lab of Neuroimaging), and Berislav Zlokovic (Zilkha Neurogenetics Institute). Thompson and Zlokovic are part of this P01 team. Thompson also serves on the Executive Committee of AirPollBrain (PIs: Finch & Chen), a USC - funded collaborative network since 2010. AirPollBrain Network has created a unique intellectual environment, interdisciplinary research infrastructure, educational resources and mentoring capacities. In addition to supporting this P01, AirPollBrain helped several junior faculty (R00AG039528; R01ES023780) and trainees (F31ES025080; F31ES027340) compete for NIH funding to support careers in environmental neurosciences. Investigators : This P01 assembled USC faculty scientists with complementary expertise in neurobiology of AD (Finch; Pike; Morgan), population & clinical neuroimaging imaging (Zlokovic; Mack), clinical neurology (Liu) neurosurgery (Mack), cognitive neurosciences and neuropsychology (Gatz; Nation, Petkus), latent structure modeling (Petkus), epidemiology of AD (Gatz; Chen), air pollution/environmental -neuroepidemiology (Chen), inhalation exposure assessment and neurotoxicology (Sioutas; Forman). Besides collaboration with WHIMS investigators, through NIH-funded collaborative initiatives, we extended this \"team science\" approach to working with the MESA -AIR group (subcontract PI: Kaufman) and the VETSA investigators (Kremen & Franz). Together, we will address the fundamental research questions in the frontier of environmental neurosciences in brain aging. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 189 Multiple PD/PI Leadership Plan Multiple Principal Investigator Leadership Plan Rationale and Justification of Leadership by Multiple Principal Investigators (PI) This program integrates multi -disciplinary approaches of four projects and three cores to address a common set of fundamental questions. The two community -based cohort studies and two neurotoxicological experimental projects are supported by resources and expertise from the Neuroimaging Core and the Environmental Exposure & Neurotoxicology Core. This research involves the translation and integration of different concepts and approaches in several scientific fields, including neurobiology of AD; population neuroimaging; mouse brain imaging, neuroinformatics and data analyses; brain vascular biology, clinical neurology and neurosurgery; cognitive neurosciences and neuropsychology; latent structure modeling; epidemiology of AD, environmental -neuroepidemiology; air pollution modeling for large cohort populations; inhalation exposure assessment and neurotoxicology. Thus, the multiple -PI (MPI) mechanism is most appropriate for this application to ensure equal input from each PI. The governance and organization of this multidisciplinary research team falls naturally into the areas of expertise brought to the project by Finch (contact PI) and Chen. This P01 application represents a collaboration of environmental neurosciences initiatives across USC. In 2010, Co-PIs Finch & Chen initiated the AirPollBrain (APB) Network with support from USC Vice-Provost for Research Dr. Randolph Hall and the USC Collaboration Fund. The APB is a scientific network of multidisciplinary USC faculty from multiple schools, with its primary mission to develop an interdisciplinary research and educational/ training program in Environmental Neurosciences of Neurodevelopment and Brain Aging in Urban -Dwelling Populations . The APB group represents 15 faculty and about 30 trainees, from undergraduates to postdoctoral levels. Since 2011, Drs. Finch and Chen have worked together and helped the APB faculty obtained more than 10 federal grants supporting their effort to better understand whether and how exposure to ambient air pollutants affect human brain development and aging across life course. These new grants include awards to junior faculty (R00AG039528; R01ES024936 [ONES APB group also works closely with the USC Neurosciences graduate program to develop training in Environmental Neurosciences and mentoring for potential careers in this underdeveloped but critical are in basic, clinical, and translational neurosciences.

Chen is the PI of the \"Environmental Determinants of Cognitive Aging in the WHI Memory Study\" (R01AG033078), \"Neurodevelopment in Urban Environments: Role of Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution \" (R21ES022369), and \"Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging \" (R21AG051113). For this MPI project, Chen will lead the USC -based Population Environmental Neurosciences team members who have been working on the NIA- funded R01 in the last 5 years. Chen will continue leading this team to contribute their collective expertise in epidemiology of dementia, vascular neurology and neuroimaging in dementia, geriatric neuropsychology, cognitive psychometrics, and quantitative psychology to study the neurotoxic effects of air pollution on brain aging. As the environmental epidemiologist PI with expertise in translational environmental health research, Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Page 190 Multiple PD/PI Leadership Plan Chen will also contribute his expertise in environmental health sciences, spatial epidemiology, and development/application of large -scale spatiotemporal modeling. Communication Plan The two PIs will exchange emails (or phone conversations as needed) with a progress note on a weekly basis. This MPI will lead bimonthly meetings including four projects, quarterly meetings of the Executive Committee consisting of Project PIs and Core Directors, and annual meetings with the External SAB. The annual meeting will invite the Internal Advisory Committee (see below) to join. These large joint group meetings will take place alternating between USC University Park Campus (UPC) and Health Science Campus (HSC). Additional meetings between the two PIs and/or for joint group meetings will be arranged for specific needs, e.g., cross - project integrated analyses; planning for joint publications and presentations. Process for Making Decisions on Scientific Direction Drs. Finch and Chen will share decision -making responsibility for issues related to the scientific direction and conduct of the study. Finch and Chen have complementary expertise in the above mentioned areas for appropriate decisions on scientific direction Conflict Resolution Procedures For this application, both PIs have participated in defining the fundamental research questions, developing the integrated projects, and preparing the scientific proposals with all project PIs and core directors. The scientific research and project management plans contain no conflicts. If a conflict arises between the 2 PIs, attempts will be made to resolve the conflict through discussion and negotiation. In principle, the PI with the most relevant expertise will make the final decision. As needed we will consult with our Internal USC advisors (see below). If this should not prove successful, the PIs will seek mediation via joint discussions with their respective division directors and department chairs. Internal Advisory Committee In case of remaining conflict that cannot be resolved, the two PIs will seek guidance from the Internal Advisory Committee and. The Internal Advisory Committee members include: (1) Helena Chui, M.D., Director, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center/Memory -Aging Center, Keck School of Medicine, Chair of Neurology; expertise in clinical neurosciences and neuroimaging of AD (2) Pinchas Cohen, M.D., Executive Director, Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center; expertise in translational neurobiology of aging (3) Rob McConnell, M.D., Director of Southern California Children's Environmental Health Center, Deputy Director of the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center, AirPollBrain Executive Committee Member; expertise in air pollution health effects and toxicology (4) Jonathan Samet, M.D., M.S., Chair Dept. of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine; expertise in air pollution health effects/toxicology, and integrated environmental health sciences. The Internal Advisors will also attend the annual progress report meeting Change in PI Location If one of the PIs moves, the relevant portion of the grant will be transferred to the new institution. In the event that a PI cannot maintain full participation, a new PI will be recruited in consultation with the Internal Advisors and, subject to the approval of the Institution. Data Sharing and Publication Procedures The PIs will share data analyses in conjunction with the P01 biostatisticians. We will establish a Central Program Data Repository for Project 3&4 databases, with data dictionary for password -protected access (Core A, Research Strategy; http://envneurosci.usc.edu/APB/ )). Authorship rank in publications will be based on the relative scientific contributions of the PIs/core directors, and other contributing research personnel. Authorship disputes will be considered by the Internal Advisors Committee. Budget Allocation and Fiscal Management Finch will be responsible for budget allocation and resources in consultation with Chen. Budget allocation and distribution of resources to specific project/supporting core of the proposed P01 have already been agreed upon by all project PIs and core directors. When the need to re-budget and/or re-allocate the P01 resource, Finch will work with Chen and the respective project PI/core director to develop a revised budget with detailed categorical items, written as line-by-line, year-by-year USC budget that reconciles with proposed budget and scientific scope of work in line with this P01 application.

We believe that this collaborative multidisciplinary examination of the effects of urban air pollution on cognitive and brain outcomes in both humans and rodents has potential to make major contributions to our understanding of environmental risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and their mechanisms of action. We look forward to continuing to work with you and the rest of the P01 team over the next five years. We will participate in scientific planning, data collection of the historic geolocation data for the VETSA twins, data analyses, and manuscript preparation. With our all-male VETSA sample, we will provide a valuable addition to age-related research the effects of air pollution, which has been conducted on primarily older women. This collaborative project is truly unique and the extensive data from these different studies will doubtless yield many valuable insights; the work you are proposing to do is very important and is poised to address critical public health issues in our rapidly growing aged population.

Wednesday, May 24, 2017 Caleb Finch, PhD Professor of Gerontology USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology Dear Tuck, I wish to provide specific support for your P01 AG005567 \"Urban Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease: Risk, Heterogeneity, and Mechanisms. \". The reviews are very encouraging for resubmission. You and JC Chen have built an outstanding program on air pollution. Your efforts have already recruited at least four other Gerontology faculty into research on air pollution, including demographers Jennifer Ailshire and Eileen Crimmins, nematode biologist Sean Curran, and several scientists in the mitochondrial space. For institutional support of your P01 and related projects, I am authorizing the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology to develop a new Center for Environmental Gerontology (CEG). The mission of the CEG is to catalyze and support faculty and trainee research on air pollution and other environmental factors that impact human aging processes. It seems like that most processes of aging are exacerbated by air pollution. The vulnerability of ApoE4 carriers to air pollution in your studies anticipates other gene -environment interactions in precision medicine, and as targets for intervention. The School of Gerontology will provide initial support to CEG of $40,000/year. These funds will include (a) $15,000 for support for a protected portion of your salary and for Todd Morgan's salary; (b) $5,000 for support for an annual symposium on the topic of the medical implications of air pollution; (c) $10,000 for vouchers for air pollution investigators to use in the gerontology core facilities, including the SeaHorse -Core, The Biomarkers -Core, and the Mouse -Core; and (d) $10,000 for support for graduate and postdoc attendance at National meetings. I would like you to be the founding Director of the CEG . We anticipate that you will continue to work closely with the USC Alzheimer Center and with the AirPollBrain Network in expanding environmental research across USC. We also expect that other Schools participating in your P01 will give commensurate support.

OFFICE OF THE DEAN 22 May 2017 Dear Professor Finch, The Viterbi School of Engineering wishes to provide enthusiastic support for your P01 AG005567 \"Urban Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease: Risk, Heterogeneity, and Mechanisms.\" The reviews are very encouraging for resubmission. Your collaborations with Professors Costas Sioutas of the Viterbi School of Engineering and JC Chen of the Keck Medical School have built an outstanding program on air pollution. We are pleased that the leading journal Science specifically recognized these contributions in their Perspective The Polluted Brain (Jan 27, 2017). In the Viterbi School, other faculty, including George Ban-Weiss, have developed studies on air pollution. When the P01 is funded, the Viterbi School of Engineering will provide institutional support of $5,000 per year to the Administrative Core for its 5 year duration. We expect these funds to support Viterbi School pre- and post-doctoral trainee attendance at off-campus meetings and for publication costs. We are aware that the very tight P01 budget could not include these important budget lines. We anticipate that you will continue to work closely with Professors Sioutas and Chen, and with the AirPollBrain Network in expanding environmental research across USC. We also expect that other Schools participating in your P01 will give commensurate support. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact me.

I have reviewed and collaborated with your teams on the study design and statistical approaches, and will be actively involved in data analysis and interpretation. I have a long-standing collaboration with Professor Finch in P01 AG026572 -011 Brinton (PI) 09/21/16 -09/20/20, Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and we have co-authored several articles, e.g., Yin et al 2015, PMID25921624. I have also worked with Dr. Bill Mack extensively as a co-investigator on your ongoing study (Mack; R01ES024936 Neurotoxicity of Airborne Particles: Role of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion) that utilizes similar analysis methods. In addition, I will advise P01 Projects 3 and 4 in year 1 on the development of a common REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database for data entry and management. I will provide statistical consultation in project years 2 -5 for analysis and reporting of the common dataset. As you know, I am the director of the Biostatistics Resources core of the Southern California CTSI (of which Dr. Bill Mack is a KL2 scholar) as well as the Biostatistics and Data Management Core of the USC Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (of which Professor Finch is a Co-Director and Dr. Bill Mack is a pilot grant awardee). Your work is highly relevant to both of these institutes and biostatistics and data resources from these institutes will be available. Your pilot data demonstrate a female and apoE4 bias in amyloid -beta load in response to air pollution exposure (project 3) and pilot data from Project 4 suggests a role for air pollution in white matter injury and the progression of acute ischemic stroke. I have worked with you in developing the analysis sections of the current grant proposal; the proposed research is very exciting. It incorporates a well-designed study plan to assess the influence of age and sex on the joint influence of particulate matter and underlying cerebrovascular disease. I look forward to working with you to address this topic, and heartily express my support for and commitment to collaborate with you on this research.

Admin -Core -001 (724) INTRODUCTION TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE The review panel considered the Administrative Core (Core A), led by Drs. Finch and Chen, an integral and important component of the PPG. At the First Stage Review highlighted several major strengths, including \"its outstanding investigative team ,\" \"access to extensive resources and expertise of USC in TRAP, AD and neurotoxicology research, \" \"involvement of multiple renowned programs at USC and three external participating sites, \" and the \"leadership and communications facilitated by the existing AirPollBrain Network \" which engages the PIs and senior co-investigators at USC. This Core's overall strengths (high to moderate ) were somewhat distracted by several weaknesses, as parsed below in italic and followed by brief summaries of our responses (in the specific Sections). There were no notable weaknesses at the Second Stage Review of Core A. Accordingly, the Section Subheadings with submitted changes in text (Georgia font) are labeled as [revised ], [new] or otherwise left unchanged in the A1 proposal . 1. \"lack of a well described dissemination plan\" To correct this omission, we have added more details of the dissemination plan, under the revised Specific Aim 5: Carry out the joint dissemination of study results to the broader scientific community. 2. \"absence of mentoring plans for faculty and trainees\" We have revised the Specific Aim 2 (\"Strengthen existing partnerships, facilitate new collaborations, and foster the career development of junior investigators/trainees across USC and participating institutes\") to correct this omission. The proposed approach was described in Section 2B, under the Specific Aim 2. 3. \"lack of ...plans about data management, data quality monitoring, data security and medical informatics\" For this P01, this critical function is not designed within the Administrative Core. Detailed description of the scientific expertise and facility was given in the respective list of personnel biosketch and environments/facilities section for each Research Project/Supporting Core. Given the complexity of this P01, we believe this arrangement is more cost-efficient, since it leverages the wide range of expertise and resources across USC and participating institutes. 4. \"inadequate communications with participating sites, given only quarterly videoconferencing\" One new section was added under Specific Aim 1, where we described the Systems for External Information Flow. We also clarified the frequency of regular meetings that will involve the other participating sites outside USC. Systems for External Information Flow [new]. AirPollBrain will benefit from communications of findings with collaborating institutes. The Core will organize monthly joint group meetings of all project and core leaders; quarterly meetings of the entire project teams, with videoconferencing for non-USC members; and annual meetings of project - core leaders with External Advisory Committee (EAC). The Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) will attend the quarterly and annual EAC meetings. 5. \"limited institutional commitment\" The development of this new program of environmental neurosciences has received continuing support from the Provost's Research Office since 2010. For the P01 resubmission, new support is committed from USC Vice President, Prof. J Randolph Hall, for $20,000/year (see Support letter); from the Keck School of Medicine for 3% of Indirects/yr for 5 years (email documentation from Keck Dean Rohit Varma and Tom Buchanan, Vice-Dean for Research); from the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology for $40,00/year (support letter from Dean Pinchas Cohen); and from the Viterbi School of Engineering for $5,000/yr for 5 years (support letter from Vice Dean Moghaddam). Total institutional support is $401,200 for the entire program period. 6. \"lack of adequate staff, including a full-time PPG administrator\" The revised budget increases Core A support to include a full-time Program Project Coordinator. Introduction to Application Page 236 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Admin -Core -001 (724) CORE A. ADMINISTRATIVE CORE 1. SPECIFIC AIMS [revised ] The Administrative Core, Co-Directors Caleb Finch and Jiu-Chiuan Chen, will support this interdisciplinary team for the overarching goal to better characterize the individual risk, heterogeneity, and mechanisms of AD associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in aging populations. The P01 program has three performance sites: the USC University Park Campus (Core C, Projects 3); USC Health Science Campus (Core B, Projects 1 & 4); and University of California, San Diego (UCSD, Project 2). Core C1 Environmental Exposure Data Support receives input from the University of Washington. Project 1 has a subcontract with Wake Forest School of Medicine. The proposed program includes an established group of collaborative scientists with expertise in neurobiology of AD, population neuroimaging, mouse brain imaging, brain vascular biology, clinical neurology & neurosurgery, cognitive neurosciences, neuropsychology, epidemiology of AD, large -scale air pollution modeling, environmental epidemiology, inhalation exposure assessment and neurotoxicology. Given the complexities in its scientific activities, the primary objective of the Administrative Core is to provide leadership, oversight, planning, and coordination to facilitate scientific integration and synthesis across projects, promote cross -disciplinary interactions, and support multi -site operation of proposed program activities. The collaborative infrastructure of proposed P01 is the product of the AirPollBrain Network (PIs: Finch & Chen), a collaborative network funded by USC since 2010 that has recruited 15 USC faculty to the topic. Over the last few years, the AirPollBrain has built partnerships with several USC -based leading Centers/Institutes in brain sciences (e.g., ADRC/Memory and Aging Center, Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute , Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute; Institute of Developing Mind) and also helped create the new Research Program on Neurological Effects of Environmental Exposure for the latest renewal of Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center (P30 ES007048 -20). The Administrative Core is well positioned to leverage these institutional resources and maximize impact of the proposed P01 research. The operation of Administrative Core will be guided by the External Advisory Committee bringing expertise from other institutions, and also receive input from the Internal Advisory Committee of senior USC faculty. The specific aims of the Administrative Core are to: 1. Provide the integrated program leadership and coordination; 2. Strengthen existing partnerships, facilitate new collaborations, and foster the career development of junior investigators/trainees across USC and participating institutes; 3. Assess scientific progress of the program, through monthly joint group meetings of all four projects and core leaders; quarterly meetings of the entire project teams, with videoconferencing for non-USC members; and annual meetings of the project -core leaders and key personnel with External Advisory Committee. 4. Provide fiscal management and administrative services and monitor resources and expenditures; and 5. Carry out the joint dissemination of study results to the broader scientific community. Specific Aims Page 237 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Admin -Core -001 (724) Page 238 Research Strategy 2. RESEARCH STRATEGY (CORE A. ADMINISTRATIVE CORE) [revised Figure 1] 2.A. SIGNIFICANCE Environmental risk factors in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) are poorly defined. This Core supports an ambitious program of research to address major gaps in air pollution epidemiology and neurotoxicology to characterize the individual risk, heterogeneity, and biological basis of AD associated ambient air pollution in aging populations. With critical support from NIA (R01AG033078, RF1AG051521, R21AG040683, R21AG040753, R21AG051113, R21AG050201), USC is emerging as a national leader in this frontier of environmental neurosciences of brain aging. Our interdisciplinary leadership is comprised of a core group of experienced scientists with well-defined roles to facilitate the Administrative Core support of overall vision and aims. The Core will organize monthly joint group meetings of all project and core leaders; quarterly meetings of the entire project teams, with videoconferencing for non-USC members; and annual meetings of project -core leaders with External Advisory Committee (EAC). The Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) will attend the quarterly and annual EAC meetings. CE Finch, JC Chen, TE Morgan, C Sioutas, CJ Pike, and Wm Mack have worked together since 2010. The External Advisory Committee for the program will include recognized leaders in urban air pollution, ADRD, and neuroimaging, details below). Core A draws from the AirPollBrain Network (PI: Finch & Chen), a USC -funded collaboration network since 2010 (details below), as well as institutional resources from USC's Department of Preventive Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine; the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology; the ADRC/Memory and Aging Center; the Zilkha Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute; and, the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center. 2.A.1.

Core A provides the structure (Fig.1) to facilitate administrative and scientific oversight, and effective links to projects and cores. Figure 1. Program Project Team Organizational Structure Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Admin -Core -001 (724) Page 239 Research Strategy Core A will be led by Program Project Co-Directors, Caleb Finch and Jiu-Chiuan Chen from USC. Finch and Chen bring extensive expertise in administering large research programs, which translate environmental health sciences knowledge (air pollution epidemiology; neurotoxicology) and approaches (spatiotemporal modeling; inhalation exposure sciences) into study the risk, heterogeneity and mechanism of AD, integrated with state -of- the-art neuroimaging and neuroinformatics. Program Project Co-Director: Caleb Finch PhD is ARCO/William F. Kieschnick Professor in the Neurobiology of Aging at USC's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. Dr. Finch's major research interest is basic mechanisms in human aging with a focus on inflammation. He was the founder of the NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Research Center in 1984 and continues as Associate -Director. A new research area is the effect of air pollution on brain development and aging, which he is developing through a USC -wide network. Program Project Co-Director: Dr. Jiu-Chiuan (JC) Chen is an Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine in the Division of Environmental Health at USC's Keck School of Medicine. Dr. Chen is a physician - epidemiologist with formal training in Internal Medicine, Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Environmental Health Sciences, and Epidemiology (Clinical, Environmental, and Occupational). He brings extensive knowledge in medicine and toxicology together with skills in quantitative methods to study environmental health and chronic disease epidemiology. He is applying the translational epidemiologic approach to understanding the neurocardio -physiological and inflammatory responses to environmental hazards in workplace and ambient environment, concerning how environmental stressors affect the development and progression of chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular and neurological diseases), with primary focus on the elderly population. Executive Committee and Internal Advisory Committee . Oversight of the P01 resides with the Executive Committee, composed of Project and Core Directors: CE Finch C Sioutas (USC).

APPROACH Specific Aim 1: Provide the integrated program leadership and coordination. Leadership and Oversight. Program Project Co-Directors Finch and Chen will work closely to discuss the Project's administrative, research, and dissemination objectives. Finch and Chen meet weekly in person, or by teleconference as needed to direct the Project. Issues that they cannot resolve or needing further input will be discussed ad hoc with the Executive Committee, for further consideration at the monthly meetings of project and core directors. The communication links between the Co-PIs and the Project and Core Directors are well established through prior collaborations and the AirPollBrain Network. Several members of the APB Executive Committee are Co-PIs and senior co-investigators of this P01: Chen, Gatz, Finch, Sioutas, Thompson. The Administrative Core will be seated in the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology on USC's University Park Campus. This campus is also the site of the laboratories of CE Finch, H Forman, CJ Pike, and C Sioutas. A full-time Project Coordinator will be hired based on accounting and administrative experience, and will have permanent office space in the Leonard Davis School, close to the labs of CE Finch. This position will coordinate meetings make travel arrangements, process invoices, input and maintain accounting data from the Projects and Cores, including subcontracts to University of California San Diego (UCSD), University of Washington (UW), and Wake Forest School of Medicine (WF SOM). Lastly, the Project Coordinator will create monthly P01-wide action items, timelines, and is responsible for all financial records. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Any issues of disputes that the Co- Directors cannot resolve alone will be discussed and resolved with input from the Executive Committee, and subsequently NIA if still unresolved. The Co-Directors will meet biweekly (including via Skype for personnel who are unavailable in person) with Core and Research Project Directors to ensure satisfactory progress of Center and Core/Project goals. The Project Coordinator will assist Co-Directors in the coordination of meetings, archiving discussions and action points, and the resolution of action points. Website and Communications : Core A will utilize the existing AirPollBrain website (http://envneurosci.usc.edu/APB/ ) to facilitate internal communication among cores and projects, as well as external communication with stakeholders and the general public. The AirPollBrain website will have both public and private components. Internally the website will be password protected for each project. Each core will have its own link for posting study protocols and findings for internal review. Some areas of the website will be password protected and managed by the Administrative Core. The Project Coordinator will prepare and make available meeting notes from Project and Core Directors, and EAC meetings. All data will available to Program Project members through Drop Box, already established for the APB Network, with password access protected for specific projects and investigative subgroups. Systems for External Information Flow [new]. AirPollBrain has a history of jointly sponsored projects SOM (R01ES025888; RF1AG054068; R21AG051113; R01AG033078) and UW (R01ES025888). instrumental to the development of the ABCD -E (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development & Environments) Consortium, which involves UCSD and was supported by AirPollBrain shortly before the ABCD cohort was funded by the NIDA in 2016. The P01 team will continue to develop resources of our multiple institutions. We will respond to the evolving needs and priorities of our AD research community. The AirPollBrain website will provide forums for registered users to post questions or provide answers in a publicly available web space. Wiki pages, blogs, RSS feeds, forums, and mailing lists allow user groups to share, organize information, and collaborate from open web browsers. Mailing lists will be provided for targeted communication between members of the P01 team. Shared calendars will publicize events or track meetings. Specific Aim 2 [revised ]: Strengthen existing partnerships, facilitate new collaborations, and foster the career development of junior investigators/trainees across USC and participating institutes . We employ a multidisciplinary approach to characterize the individual risk, heterogeneity, and mechanisms of ADRD associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in aging populations. Operationally, the Administrative Core will organize the monthly and quarterly group meetings of Project and Core Directors to address new results and identify new research opportunities. These meetings will be coordinated with the AirPollBrain bimonthly meetings. This integrated approach will enhance collaboration with other groups at USC. Over the last few years, the AirPollBrain Network has created a unique intellectual environment, interdisciplinary research infrastructure, educational resources and mentoring capacities that have helped junior faculty compete for NIH grants (R00AG039528; R01ES024936 [ONES Award 2015]; R01ES023780 ). Dr. Rob McConnell (IAC member), Director of the SCEHSC Career Development Program (https://scehsc.usc.edu/career_development_program.php), has agreed to provide our young investigators full access for these mentoring resources and training opportunities. The Executive Committee will also ensure that junior faculty and trainees are appropriately matched with senior investigators. Senior faculty will provide junior faculty and trainees guidance on research projects, compliance issues, and data analyses, and as appropriate, reviewing papers, grant proposals, presentations, and professional/career development, community engagement in research, and dissemination activities to the scientific community, the community at large, and policy and decision -makers, all with an eye toward supporting the development of independent investigators. This pairing ensures that junior faculty/trainees obtain critical insights in these projects. In 2015, Chen developed a training model for predoctoral research in population environmental neurosciences of neurobehavioral development (ES025080; 1/5 NIEHS F31s in 2015), which was subsequently replicated for two other trainees (F31ES027340; F31ES026482). This predoctoral training model can be extended to studying environmental neurosciences of brain aging in human populations and experimental models. Specific Aim 3: Ascertain scientific progress of the program through joint group meetings per month, quarterly work -in-progress meetings, and annual meetings with External Advisory Committee . The Administrative Core will assess scientific progress of the program, through monthly joint group meetings of all four projects and core leaders; quarterly meetings of the entire project teams, with videoconferencing for non-USC members; and annual meetings of the project -core leaders with External Advisory Committee, with participation of key personnel. A P01-specific subsite will be established on the AirPollBrain home page to give Project members for access to project specific data and for general communication across projects and cores. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Admin -Core -001 (724) Page 243 Research Strategy This mechanism will ensure daily connections across all members at USC, UCSD, WF SOM, and UW, to enhance monitoring the scientific progress. Additionally, in-person interaction will be supported by joint Project and Core meetings alternating between at the Leonard Davis School on the University Park Campus and the Dept. of Preventive Medicine on the Health Sciences Campus, which have been the sites of the AirPollBrain meetings since 2010. These meeting rooms are equipped for video -conferencing for participating researchers at UCSD, UW, and WF SOM. The quarterly 'Work -in-progress' meetings will summarize findings across Projects, including Cores, as relevant. Finally, the EAC will meet annually at USC with the P01 Co-Directors to assess progress of each project and Core, but also to identify new scientific opportunities from other findings in this growing field. The External Advisory Committee (EAC) will be responsible for: Advising P01 Co-Directors on needs of the broader scientific community; Strategic counsel to the Executive Committee on implementing the Program Project's vision; and Review progress of the P01 Projects and Cores and suggest new approaches and priorities as needed. Specific Aim 4: Provide fiscal management and administrative services and monitor resources and expenditures. P01 Co-Directors Finch and Chen have overall fiscal responsibility and will provide oversight of the Project and Core budgets to ensure that all Projects and Cores are meeting their objectives and are spending appropriately. Project and Core Directors will be responsible for managing individual budgets (as satellite accounts), with regular oversight by the P01 Co-Directors. As noted above, the Program Coordinator will assist the P01 Co-Directors in fiscal management, administrative oversight, and monitoring of resources. Specific Aim 5 [revised ]: Carry out the joint dissemination of study results to the broader scientific community. We will oversee efforts to communicate its progress with multiple audiences, both academic and community - based, to promote the conduct of research related to environmental risk factors in ADRD within and beyond the USC community. These may include researchers, community and academic scholars, health care providers, and the public health community. Data will be disseminated via webinars and conferences. Scientific Information will be translated to public health and clinic providers. Information relevant to policy and decision -makers will be promoted to engage policy makers, key opinion leaders and decision makers. The AirPollBrain personnel will integrate and disseminate emerging research findings: providing speakers for public organizations, e.g. the Alzheimer's Association Southland Chapter; ADRC Community Outreach activities; and SCEHSC Town hall meetings. Investigators also anticipate participating in nationwide calls of the NIA programs on AD as new findings emerge. We are committed to collaborative research and to the NIH Grant Policy on Sharing of Unique Research Resources including the Sharing of Biomedical Research Resources Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Grants and Contracts. Table 2 shows dissemination products and strategies to target audiences external to our Program Project. Table 2. Summary of Audiences, Products, and Dissemination Strategies.

Core -001 (257) Page 248 Facilities & Other Resources FACILITIES & OTHER RESOURCES CORE B1: UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MARK AND MARY STEVENS NEUROIMAGING AND INFORMATICS INSTITUTE The USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute is housed in a state -of-the-art facility designed specifically to accommodate our research. The overall academic environment is a remarkable specially designed modern building of 35,000 gross sq ft. called Stevens Hall for Neuroimaging (SHN) (Figure 1) on the Health Sciences Campus. The facility will houses a data center, a state -of-the art theater, offices, and workspaces. The allocation of significant campus funding to create this Institute, and its facilities, creates the opportunity to establish a broad and rich multidisciplinary expertise. The Keck School of Medicine has dedicated significant campus resources, capital infrastructure and space, to LONI and the Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute. SHN houses nearly 100 faculty, postdocs, students and staff in a variety of seating configurations from private offices to shared offices to open workspaces designed for collaboration. Great care was taken to design the people space to facilitate ongoing discussion and collaboration while providing a peaceful work environment for all. The Institute provides an extensive infrastructure designed and operated to facilitate modern informatics research and support for hundreds of projects including several multi -site national and global efforts. We have redundancies built in to all equipment, and a completely secure facility to protect equipment and data. The resources described below provide networking, storage and computational capabilities that will ensure a stable, secure and robust environment. It is an unprecedented test bed to create and validate big data solutions. Because these resources have been designed, built and continuously upgraded over the years by our systems administration team, we have the appropriate expertise and operating procedures in place to use these resources to their maximum benefit. Data Center Infrastructure . The data center is approximately 3,000 square feet and was designed using cutting -edge high density cooling solutions and high density bladed compute solutions. A total of 48 racks are dedicated to research use. Of the 48, 10 racks are reserved for core services. The core services are on separate, dedicated, redundant power to ensure continuous operation. The data center includes a Powerware 9395 UPS system providing two 750kW/825kVA UPSs in an N+1 configuration for non-core racks and two 225kW/250kVA in a 2N configuration for core services racks. The UPS sends conditioned power to 300kVA Power Distribution Units (PDUs) located inside the data center. The PDUs feed 400A rated Track Power Busways mounted above rows of racks providing an \"A\" bus and a \"B\" bus for flexible overhead power distribution to the racks. There are VRLA batteries with 9 minutes of battery run time for the core services UPS and 6 minutes of battery run time for the non-core UPS (note that the generator requires less than 2 minutes of battery run time in order to fully take over the load in the event of an outage). A 750kW/938kVA diesel emergency generator located in a weatherproof sound attenuated enclosure adjacent to the building will provide at least 8 hours of operation before needing to be refueled. Data Center Physical Site Security. The datacenter is secured by three levels of physical access to ensure HIPAA compliance for data security. The facility is secured 24/7 with card and biometric access control devices. The interior of the datacenter contains glass break and motion detection censors that report events directly to the campus Department of Public Safety (DPS). Only authorized personnel are allowed in, and guests are permitted only after checking in, and only during business hours. The datacenter itself is additionally secured by a second layer of proximity card access. Only authorized staff are permitted to enter the datacenter facility. All racks are secured, allowing the functional presumption that any system might Figure 1. The newly renovated Stevens Hall for Neuroimaging (SHN) Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 249 Facilities & Other Resources contain sensitive data, ensuring all systems receive the same level of protection, minimizing the physical attack surface for the entire datacenter. Computational and Storage Resources. Rapid advancements in imaging and genetics technology have provided researchers with the ability to produce very high-resolution, time-varying, multidimensional data sets of the brain. The complexity of the new data, however, requires immense computing capabilities. The compute infrastructure within the datacenter boasts 4,096 cores and 38 terabytes of aggregate memory space. This highly available, redundant system is designed for demanding big data applications. Blades in the Cisco UCS environment are easy to replace. A failing blade sends an alert to Cisco where a replacement ticket is generated automatically. Upon arrival, the new blade can go from the shipping box to being fully provisioned and in production in as little as 5 minutes. The Cisco UCS blade solution described above allows the Institute to run the services of a much larger physical infrastructure in a much smaller footprint without sacrificing availability or flexibility. Each Cisco chassis hosts 8 server blades and has 160 gigabits of external bandwidth available per chassis. Each of the 48 racks can hold up to 6 chassis plus requisite networking equipment (4 fabric extenders). Thus, the new data center has adequate rack space to accommodate this project. Institutions and scientists worldwide rely on the Institute's resources to conduct research. The Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute is architected using a fault-tolerant, high-availability systems design to ensure 24/7 functionality. The primary storage cluster is 51 EMC Isilon nodes with 5.3 usable petabytes of highly available, high performance storage. The Image & Data Archive has a secondary cluster of 9 Isilon nodes, coming to approximately 1 petabyte usable. A third three -node Isilon cluster of approximately 320 terabytes is used to test volatile and functionally aggressive environments. A 3 node Cisco UCS C3260 storage cluster provides 1 petabyte of storage running an operating system and filesystem tailored specifically for large informatics workflows. Data in these clusters moves exclusively over 10g links excepting node -to- node communication in the Isilon clusters which is handled by QDR Infiniband, providing 40 gigabit bidirectional throughput on each of the Isilon clusters' 126 links. Fault tolerance is as important as speed in the design of this datacenter. The Isilon storage clusters can each gracefully lose multiple nodes simultaneously without noticeably affecting throughput or introducing errors. The virtualization environment uses a 15 terabyte EMC XtremIO all-flash storage array. An EMC VNX 15 terabyte SAN cluster with tiered solid state disk storage complements the storage environment, providing another avenue of redundant storage offered across differentiated networking to provide another layer of resilience for the data and virtualization infrastructure. External services are load balanced across four F5 BIG-IP 2200S load balancers. The F5 load balancers provide balancing services for web sites, applications, as well as ICSA -certified firewall services. The core network is entirely Cisco Nexus hardware. Each of the two Cisco Nexus 9504s supports 15 terabits per second of throughput. Immediately adjacent to this machine room is a user space with twelve individual stations separated by office partitions. These workspaces are manned by staff who constantly monitor the health of the data center as well as plan for future improvements. Each space is also equipped with a networked workstation for image processing, visualization and statistical analysis. Network Resources. Service continuity, deterministic performance and security were fundamental objectives that governed the design of the network infrastructure. The Institute's intranet is architected using separate edge, core and distribution layers, with redundant switches in the edge and core for high availability. While ground network connectivity is entirely Gigabit, server data connectivity is nearly all 10 Gigabit fiber and Twinax connected to an array of Cisco 9372 distribution switches, numerous Cisco Nexus 6628 switches, and Cisco Nexus 2248 fabric extenders. For Internet access, the Institute is connected to the vBNS of Internet2 via six fiber optic Gigabit lines using a variety of route paths to ensure that the facility's external connectivity will be maintained in the case of a single path failure. The facility has two next generation firewall appliances providing network security and deep packet inspections. The Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute has also implemented virtual private network (VPN) services using SSLVPN and IPsec services to facilitate access to internal resources by authorized Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 250 Facilities & Other Resources users. A VPN connection establishes an encrypted tunnel over the Internet between client and server, ensuring that communications over the Web are secure. Furthermore, the Institute has an extensive library of communications software for transmitting data and for recording transaction logs. The library includes software for monitoring network processes, automatically warning system operators of potential problems, restarting processes that have failed, or migrating network services to an available server. For instance, the laboratory has configured multiple web servers with Linux Virtual Server (LVS) software for high-availability web, application and database service provisioning as well as load balancing. A round -robin balancing algorithm is currently used such that if the processing load on one server is heavy, incoming requests, be it HTTP, JSP or MySQL, are forwarded to the next available server by the LVS software layer. Listeners on one virtual server monitor the status and responsiveness of the others. If a failure is detected, an available server is elected as master and it assumes control and request forwarding for the entire LVS environment. Offsite and Onsite Backup Resources. All critical system data and source code is backed up regularly to local nearline storage and cloned to LTO6 magnetic tape for offsite archival with Iron Mountain. Offsite backup data is kept in current within one week to enable rapid redeployment of all services with a view of operations and data as of a reasonable time frame. The EMC Isilon nodes retain snapshots of one month's worth of data to offer the most rapid, but least disaster -resilient restoration. Snapshot retention allows rapid restoration of unintentionally overwritten or deleted data and does not require retrieval from archived tape. Nearline -stored backup data provides similarly rapid restoration of the prior year's on-site data. Offsite archived magnetic media, while the last resort, can be recalled the same day and offers retrieval of data from a date range as recent as the prior week to as old as the initial archival series of tapes over one year old. Onsite datasets grow rapidly, constantly and require a flexible tape backup solution. Clones are pushed to tape by way of a pair of EMC backup accelerators to an expandable 34 LTO6 drive Quantum i6000 tape array. The array provides the backup parallelism the expansive data collection requires for offsite archival on such an aggressive schedule. Virtualized Resources. Due to the rate that new servers need to be provisioned for scientific research, the Institute deploys a sophisticated high availability virtualized environment. This environment allows systems administrators to deploy new compute resources (virtual machines or VM's) in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days. Furthermore, once deployed these virtualized resources can float uninhibitedly between all the physical servers within the cluster. This is advantageous because the virtualization cluster can intelligently balance virtual machines amongst all the physical servers, which permits resource failover if a virtual machine becomes I/O starved or a physical server becomes unavailable. The net benefit for the Institute is more software resources are being efficiently deployed on a smaller hardware footprint, which results in a savings in hardware purchases, rack space and heat expulsion. The software powering the virtualized environment is VMware's ESX 6. This is deployed on eight Cisco UCS B200 M3 servers and eight Cisco UCS B200 B200 M3 servers each 2.6/3.3 GHz CPU cores and 128GB of DDR3 RAM. The B200 M4 servers each have 64 2.3/3.6 GHz CPU cores and 512GB of DDR4 RAM. These sixteen servers reside within a number of Cisco UCS 5108 blade chassis with dual 8x 10 Gigabit mezzanine cards providing a total of 160 Gigabits of available external bandwidth per chassis. Storage for the virtualization cluster is housed on the aforementioned Isilon clusters, XtremeIO, and VNX storage arrays. The primary bottleneck for the majority of virtualization solutions is disk I/O and these storage arrays more than meet the demands of creating a highly available virtualized infrastructure whose capabilities and efficiency meet or greatly exceed those of a physical infrastructure. A single six rack unit (6RU), eight blade chassis can easily replicate the resources of a 600+ server physical infrastructure when paired with the appropriate storage solution such as the Isilon storage cluster.

To facilitate the submission and execution of compute jobs in this compute environment, various batch -queuing systems such as SGE (https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE) can be used to virtualize the resources above into a compute service. A grid layer sits atop the compute resources and submits jobs to available resources according to user-defined criteria such as CPU type, processor count, memory requirements, etc. The laboratory has successfully integrated the latest version of the LONI Pipeline (http://pipeline.loni.usc.edu ) with SGE using DRMAA and JGDI interface bindings. The bindings allow jobs to be submitted natively from the LONI Pipeline to the grid without the need for external scripts. Furthermore, the LONI Pipeline can directly control the grid with those interfaces, significantly increasing the operating environment's versatility and efficacy, and improving overall end-user experience. See Figure 3 for a screenshot of the latest version of the pipeline. Figure 3. The LONI Pipeline Execution Environment Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 252 Facilities & Other Resources Figure 5. Siemens 3T Prisma In addition to a data center, SHN houses a 50-seat high definition theater - the Data Immersive Visualization Environment (DIVE) (Figure 4). The prominent feature of the DIVE is a large curved display that can present highly detailed images, video, interactive graphics and rich media generated by specialized research data. The DIVE display features a dominant image area, with consistent brightness across the entire display surface, high contrast, and 150\u00b0 horizontal viewing angle. The display resolution target is 4k Ultra HD, 3840x2160 (8.3 megapixels), in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The DIVE is designed to facilitate research communication, dissemination, training and high levels of interaction. Adjoining the SHN on the north side is a brand new MRI facility. The Center for Imaging Acquisition houses a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3 Tesla MRI scanner and a Siemens Magnetom Terra 7T MRI scanner. The MAGNETOM Prisma 3T includes simultaneous 80mT/m @ 200T/m/s gradients, a new, high end gradient system that delivers high gradient amplitudes and fast switching capabilities in a combination that is currently truly innovative. The Siemens Magnetom Terra 7T MRI system is an investigational device. Both MRI scanners are at the leading edge for neuroimaging The Magnetom Prisma 3T MRI is a high performance 3T based on the Trio system. It allows for unparalled simultaneous 80mT/m @ 200T/m/s gradients. It's 60 cm bore diameter allows for magnet homogeneity at 40 cm DSV - 0.2 ppm. With 64 - 128 channel receive it is really the ultimate MRI scanner for neuroimaging. High performance gradients will allow for human connectomics. The Prisma offers as standard Diffusion Spectrum Imaging up to 514 diffusion directsions allowing characterization of crossing fibers. Higher resolution DTI with it's reduced field of view - ZOOMit DTI for isotopic DTI. Higher SNR will also allow reproducible 3D ASL perfusion and improved resting state fMRI data. The new Magnetom Prisma is also FDA approved now for clinical imaging. This is important to allow the data acquisition for patients with neurological diseases. This includes but is not limited to patients with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Stroke, Brain Tumor patients. The key part of this scanner which is unique are the powerful XR Gradients, which have a strength of 80 milliTesla per meter (mT/m) combined with a 200T -per-meter -per-second (T/m/s) slew rate. Furthermore, it employs advanced homogeneity and shimming functions for optimal MRI data acquisition. This will be critical for reproducibility in longitudinal studies of patients and subjects over time such as those being studied by the USC ADRC and ADNI. The Human Connectome Project is already working on methods for improving mapping the Connectome such as Multi -shell HARDI reconstructed with a Fiber Orientation Density methodology. This will be enhanced having the gradient performance of the 3T Prisma. The USC Siemens Terra 7T MRI consists of a magnet system which generates the ultrahigh magnetic field. The electrical and mechanical shim are integrated in the gradient coil. The magnet comprises the superconducting magnet including the system for cooling (interface for helium fill/refill, cold head), energizing (current probe) and monitoring the magnet during operation. In addition, it includes the cabling up to the point Figure 4. Data Immersive Visualization Environment (DIVE) Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 253 Facilities & Other Resources where the external lines are connected. The system consists of an actively shielded highly homogeneous superconducting magnet (7.0 Tesla) housed in a 830 mm horizontal room temperature bore, low-loss helium cryostat and zero helium boil-off accomplished using superconducting shim coils. Final shimming is performed with a small number of passive shims. The system is supplied with a helium level monitor and an emergency quench heater control unit. A two-stage 4.2 K cryo refrigerator cooling system is employed, consisting of two independent cryocooler systems that eliminate the static cryogenic consumption. Gradients & RF Receiver Technology. The gradient system essentially consists of a Gradient Power Amplifier (GPA) and a Gradient Coil (GC), both water cooled to sustain a high duty cycle. The Magnetom 7T uses the GPA model as is used on other Magnetom systems. The XR gradients are the same as Prisma and capable of 80mT/m @ 200T/m/s gradients. The gradient coil includes the full set of 5 second order electrical shim coils to adjust B0 homogeneity for patient and each measurement volume. The Siemens RF receiver technology has 64 channels receive and the USC 7T includes a Nova Medical 32 channel head coil. The system also has an 8-channel parallel RF transmit array (pTx). 3rd order shims provide four out of the seven possible 3rd order shims that built into the SC72 gradients, along with 2nd 4-fold SPS cabinet, wiring for 3rd order shim, electric infrastructure expansion, SW interface to drive additional 3rd order shims. Siemens Magnetom Terra 7T system. The Siemens 7T is an actively shielded whole body highly homogeneous superconducting magnet. Construction has begun and the delivery date is slated for Oct 2016. The 7T Terra system is designed for future clinical use with planned clinical clearances, and can be switched to clinical tasks with Dual Mode. The CIA is also equipped with a variety of patient monitoring and stimulus equipment. Patient physiologic monitoring is achieved with either a BIOPAC MP150 system or a Phillips Invivo Expression Patient Monitor (MR400). Stimulation equipment includes a Cambridge Research Systems BOLDscreen LCD display for fMRI and a Current Designs 4-button response box pad. Contrast is delivered via a Medrad Spectris Solaris EP Injector. Additional Office Spaces.

Core -001 (257) Page 256 Equipment Equipment CORE B1: UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MARK AND MARY STEVENS NEUROIMAGING AND INFORMATICS INSTITUTE Data Center Infrastructure . The data center is approximately 3,000 square feet and was designed using cutting -edge high density cooling solutions and high density bladed compute solutions. A total of 48 racks are dedicated to research use. Of the 48, 10 racks are reserved for core services. The core services are on separate, dedicated, redundant power to ensure continuous operation. The data center includes a Powerware 9395 UPS system providing two 750kW/825kVA UPSs in an N+1 configuration for non-core racks and two 225kW/250kVA in a 2N configuration for core services racks. The UPS sends conditioned power to 300kVA Power Distribution Units (PDUs) located inside the data center. The PDUs feed 400A rated Track Power Busways mounted above rows of racks providing an \"A\" bus and a \"B\" bus for flexible overhead power distribution to the racks. There are VRLA batteries with 9 minutes of battery run time for the core services UPS and 6 minutes of battery run time for the non-core UPS (note that the generator requires less than 2 minutes of battery run time in order to fully take over the load in the event of an outage). A 750kW/938kVA diesel emergency generator located in a weatherproof sound attenuated enclosure adjacent to the building will provide at least 8 hours of operation before needing to be refueled. Data Center Physical Site Security. The datacenter is secured by three levels of physical access to ensure HIPAA compliance for data security. The facility is secured 24/7 with card and biometric access control devices. The interior of the datacenter contains glass break and motion detection censors that report events directly to the campus Department of Public Safety (DPS). Only authorized personnel are allowed in, and guests are permitted only after checking in, and only during business hours. The datacenter itself is additionally secured by a second layer of proximity card access. Only authorized staff are permitted to enter the datacenter facility. All racks are secured, allowing the functional presumption that any system might contain sensitive data, ensuring all systems receive the same level of protection, minimizing the physical attack surface for the entire datacenter. Computational and Storage Resources. Rapid advancements in imaging and genetics technology have provided researchers with the ability to produce very high-resolution, time-varying, multidimensional data sets of the brain. The complexity of the new data, however, requires immense computing capabilities. The compute infrastructure within the datacenter boasts 4,096 cores and 38 terabytes of aggregate memory space. This highly available, redundant system is designed for demanding big data applications. Blades in the Cisco UCS environment are easy to replace. A failing blade sends an alert to Cisco where a replacement ticket is generated automatically. Upon arrival, the new blade can go from the shipping box to being fully provisioned and in production in as little as 5 minutes. The Cisco UCS blade solution described above allows the Institute to run the services of a much larger physical infrastructure in a much smaller footprint without sacrificing availability or flexibility. Each Cisco chassis hosts 8 server blades and has 160 gigabits of external bandwidth available per chassis. Each of the 48 racks can hold up to 6 chassis plus requisite networking equipment (4 fabric extenders). Thus, the new data center has adequate rack space to accommodate this project. Institutions and scientists worldwide rely on the Institute's resources to conduct research. The Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute is architected using a fault-tolerant, high-availability systems design to ensure 24/7 functionality. The primary storage cluster is 51 EMC Isilon nodes with 5.3 usable petabytes of highly available, high performance storage. The Image & Data Archive has a secondary cluster of 9 Isilon nodes, coming to approximately 1 petabyte usable. A third three -node Isilon cluster of approximately 320 terabytes is used to test volatile and functionally aggressive environments. A 3 node Cisco UCS C3260 storage cluster provides 1 petabyte of storage running an operating system and filesystem tailored specifically for large informatics workflows. Data in these clusters moves exclusively over 10g links excepting node -to- node communication in the Isilon clusters which is handled by QDR Infiniband, providing 40 gigabit Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 257 Equipment bidirectional throughput on each of the Isilon clusters' 126 links. Fault tolerance is as important as speed in the design of this datacenter. The Isilon storage clusters can each gracefully lose multiple nodes simultaneously without noticeably affecting throughput or introducing errors. The virtualization environment uses a 15 terabyte EMC XtremIO all-flash storage array. An EMC VNX 15 terabyte SAN cluster with tiered solid state disk storage complements the storage environment, providing another avenue of redundant storage offered across differentiated networking to provide another layer of resilience for the data and virtualization infrastructure. External services are load balanced across four F5 BIG-IP 2200S load balancers. The F5 load balancers provide balancing services for web sites, applications, as well as ICSA -certified firewall services. The core network is entirely Cisco Nexus hardware. Each of the two Cisco Nexus 9504s supports 15 terabits per second of throughput. Immediately adjacent to this machine room is a user space with twelve individual stations separated by office partitions. These workspaces are manned by staff who constantly monitor the health of the data center as well as plan for future improvements. Each space is also equipped with a networked workstation for image processing, visualization and statistical analysis. Adjoining the SHN on the north side is a brand new MRI facility.

In addition to the Zlokovic' lab and Center for Neurodegeneration and Regeneration the members of the lab regularly use the University Core Facilities for different projects including: Biomolecular Interaction Laboratory, Electron Microscope Research Core, Flow Cytometry Core, Functional Genomics Center, Gene Targeting and Transgenic Core, High Throughput Screening Core, Molecular Imaging Core, Proteomics Center, and Small Animal MRI Imaging Core Facility. This proposal does not anticipate using any of the other core facilities for the proposed research in the present application. Figure 1. MR Solutions Preclinical MRI 7.0T Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute - MR Solutions Preclinical MRI 7.0T/24cm, PET System. The MR Solutions Preclinical MRI System (Figure 1) is 24 cm in diameter and is designed for mice and rats for both in vivo and ex vivo applications. The system is based on the revolutionary and advanced cryogen -free superconducting magnet technology. The unit is also equipped with a preclinical PET imaging system with 2 rings for simultaneous imaging. This allows simultaneous imaging of the whole body of a mouse and rat. Additionally, the PET module can be removed from the MRI and used as a stand -alone unit. This new PET module offers a major breakthrough in high performance functional imaging technology. Furthermore, the unit has a motorized imaging translation support which is a horizontal translation stage for scanning animals in the prone position for simultaneous or sequential multimodality imaging. Also, the unit is novel in that it has a variable field magnet allowing the field of the magnet to be adjusted from 1-7 Tesla. Zilkha Neurogenetics Institute is in the process of acquiring this new magnet and it will be available for use by the end of 2016. The magnet will be housed in room 115C of the ZNI building and the room is prepped and ready for the unit to be installed. Page 260 Funding Opportunity Number: PAR -16-359 .

Core -001 (257) Page 288 Introduction to Application CORE B - Introduction UB-CORE B1 HUMAN IMAGING Reviewers 1 & 2 1. Explain the MRI protocols, how data acquired on different scanners will be harmonized, and what quality control steps will be undertaken (Crtq p11 & 12). Response: Our projects are from three different types of population, and were scanned using different scanners. Therefore, a harmonization of the data acquisition across projects will not be possible, and differences in the outcomes of the different analyses between projects must be interpreted cautiously. However, data from each cohort will be considered separately. Similarities of findings across studies with diverse populations will add support for TRAP -related effects that transcend between -subject variability. We have added the following sections to the grant to explain our data acquisition by cohort, quality control and harmonization procedures: Table 1, Scan acquisition (Table 1) and harmonization , and Imaging quality control . Reviewer 1 2. How will the Core support the projects with their mediation analyses? (Crtq p11) Response: Core B will perform the targeted Structural Equation Model (SEM) analyses, including testing mediations to help Projects 1 & 2 address their aims and hypotheses. For the Agnostic Mediation Analysis, we will provide Project 1 with summary brain measure values to be included. For both targeted and agnostic approaches, we will provide image visualization needed for publications and will assist in data interpretation. 3. What alternative strategies will be used if the AD risk score fails to be validated with the WHIMS data set (Crtq p11). Response: We have added the following text to address this: If we fail to validate the ADNI cortical thickness signature in WHIMS, we will refine the ADNI signatures by creating new cortical thickness signatures in WHIMS in the controls who progress to MCI or AD versus stable controls. We will then create an overlap map between the WHIMS and ADNI signatures. Finally, we will evaluate whether these refined maps predict cognitive decline from controls to MCI or AD in ADNI. If so, these refined maps may better indicate cognitive decline across cohorts. Patterns of atrophy may also differ by sex. To test this, we can generate sex-specific cortical thickness signatures in ADNI, and evaluate whether the female pattern is better validated in WHIMS relative to the initial signature pattern. 4. We are focused on AD, while other parts of PPG also included studies on cerebrovascular damage (Crtq p11). Response: To enhance our consideration of cerebrovascular damage, in addition to including total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume in our SEMs, we will obtain WMH volume estimates both periventricularly and in deep white matter, which may have different histopathological correlates. We will test two models that evaluate whether brain measures mediate the relationship between TRAP and global cognition - one with total WMH, and one with periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities considered separately. Reviewer 2 5. Core B1 is understaffed for the amount of work (Crtq p12). Response: We have added another graduate student, Brandalyn Reidel, to the budget. Her focus is Alzheimer's disease and brain imaging. She is an expert at using EPIC and heavily edited the initial computer program to refine and expand its capabilities. Overall : We have now submitted a resource sharing plan. SUB -CORE B2 MOUSE IMAGING 1. The imaging protocol was not well-articulated leaving the logistics (especially timing) in question (Crtq p31).

Core -001 (257) Page 289 Specific Aims SPECIFIC AIMS - Core B The primary mission of the Neuroimaging Core is to provide high-quality human MRI brain image analysis in support of Projects 1 & 2, and to acquire and analyze mouse brain MRI scans in support of Projects 3 & 4. Exposure to traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP) contributes to cognitive aging 1, 2, posing a pervasive threat to the aging American populations. The Neuroimaging Core B will provide the scientific expertise and technical support needed for the four scientific projects. We will help the projects to assess the impact of TRAP on predicted Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and to better understand the underlying mechanisms in both human populations and experimental animal models. The Neuroimaging Core B will work with the scientific project PIs/co -investigators to examine whether TRAP exposure is associated with neurodegenenerative changes, measures of structural brain integrity, and cerebrovascular damage (e.g., disrupted blood -brain barriers), and also assess whether/how the resulting differences in of vulnerable brain regions and cerebrovascular injuries mediate the relationship between TRAP exposure and cognitive decline indicative of an increased AD risk as observed in human populations and tested in experimental animals The Neuroimaging Core, which includes two subcores, will be led by Dr. Paul Thompson , a world -renowned scientist whose focus is developing novel computational strategies for analyzing brain images. Dr. Meredith Braskie , whose research focus is to assess and understand AD risk through clinical and population neuroimaging, will lead The Population Neuroimaging Subcore (B1). Dr. Berislav Zlokovic, whose preeminent work focuses on Alzheimer's disease and blood brain barrier integrity will direct the Mouse Brain Imaging Subcore (B2). Core B has the following specific aims: Aim 1. To harmonize the structural brain MRI measures for population studies. We will perform standardized data analysis on already -collected structural MRI (sMRI) scans from ADNI, VETSA and WHIMS to assess vertex amygdala), white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and segmented white matter volume. In ADNI and VETSA we will calculate DTI mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and axial and radial diffusivity (Dax and Drad). Project 2 will be analyzing their Arterial Spin Labeling scans independently. Aim 2. To generate AD risk and related sMRI biomarker signatures and associated predicted risk scores for preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. To derive the predicted risk scores for AD and other associated early risk signatures, we will employ EPIC, a novel neuroimaging analysis tool that optimally partitions the cortex to classify a disease or other trait based on a neuroimaging measure, such as connectivity or cortical thickness 3, 4. The resulting Aim 2 products to be delivered to Projects 1 & 2 include the following predicted risk scores: Signature patterns of vertex -wise cortical thickness derived in ADNI that optimally classify higher versus lower AD risk based on: a) overall AD vs. controls; b) controls who progress to MCI vs. stable controls; c) preclinical AD 5 - amyloid + controls vs. amyloid - 6; d) CSF tau+ controls vs. tau- 7; e) overall MCI vs. controls; f) MCI amyloid+ vs. amyloid - controls 6. For the overall predicted risk for AD and MCI, we will conduct a prospective validation: incident AD (~40 expected by 2017) and incident MCI (~150 expected by 2017) ascertained during the follow -up of 1313 WHIMS MRI participants who were cognitively normal at the time of brain MRI scanning. Aim 3. Support Projects 1 & 2 in their proposed mediation analyses using both targeted approach in structural equation models (SEM) and agnostic approach with high -dimensional analyses. We will aid Projects 1 & 2 (VETSA and WHIMS cohorts) in performing their targeted structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate how a priori targeted AD brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, frontal cortex, or AD risk related cortical thickness patterns assessed in Aim 2) mediate the previously identified relationship between TRAP and cognition 1, 2, specifically global cognition, episodic memory, and executive function. We will evaluate how FreeSurfer -derived regional white matter volumes relate to TRAP exposure. In VETSA, we also will evaluate how voxelwise DTI MD relates to air pollution. Mouse imaging SubCore Aim1. Perform in vivo mouse brain imaging to assess cerebral blood flow, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, vascular angiography, and MRI tractography. Aim 2. neurovascular unit & BBB by confocal microscopy for immunofluorescence. Aim 3. Ultra -highfield MRI to detect mouse connectivity changes through diffusivity and tractography maps & quantification of BBB permeability by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) -MRI. Aim 4 Analyze mouse data from Projects 3 and 4. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 290 Research Strategy NEUROIMAGING CORE RESEARCH STRATEGY SIGNIFICANCE: Our Imaging Core has a novel, unified focus of characterizing the relationship between traffic - related air pollutants (TRAP) exposure and brain integrity and cognition in humans and mice. TRAP exposure may contribute to cognitive decline in humans and brain integrity disruptions in animal models 1-7. POPULATION (HUMAN) NEUROIMAGING (SUBCORE B1) SIGNIFICANCE: We will perform large -scale, high-quality human brain MRI scan analyses in support of Projects 1 & 2's aims to examine how TRAP relates to brain structure and connectivity, cerebrovascular damage, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cognitive decline in two geographically -diverse, largely non- demented cohorts of women (Project -1; WHIMS MRI) and men (Project -2; VETSA). We will synchronize data analyses across three cohorts (ADNI; WHIMS; and VETSA) and will: (1) use ADNI scans to define sMRI -based signatures and associated risk scores of AD, MCI, and preclinical AD, and deliver these measures to WHIMS MRI and VETSA cohorts; and (2) provide technical and statistical support to Projects 1 & 2 for their proposed analyses linking TRAP to harmonized sMRI measures tensor imaging (DTI) measures. We will use structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess whether brain structure integrity in targeted regions (such as the medial temporal lobe), mediates the relationship between TRAP exposure and cognitive aging. To define the risk signatures and scores associated with diagnostic group and AD neuropathology pathology in older adults, we will apply an innovative machine learning approach to whole -brain cortical thickness at each vertex on the brain's surface. Our work will help us to better understand the effects of TRAP exposure on the brain and cognition in non- demented older adults. This may focus for future interventional research in at-risk older adults. APPROACH: Scan acquisition (Table 1) and harmonization: ADNI scans are acquired at many sites, using standardized scan protocols and procedures (such as use of an MRI phantom) to minimize variability among sites. We will adjust for scanner strength (1.5 T or 3T) in all ADNI analyses except for DTI, which were collected only at 3T. Data for the WHIMS study were collected at 1.5 T across 14 sites, using a standardized protocol. VETSA scans were collected at two separate sites: at USCD on a GE 3T Discovery and at MGH using a Siemens 3T Tim Trio. Data from the two VETSA sites will be combined using random effect meta - analyses based on a tests (p<0.05). Each VETSA collection site will be weighted by the inverse of its variance and the between -studies variance With DTI, we use meta -analysis of the model coefficients, as the mean and variance of some DTI parameters (e.g. FA) depend on the voxel size, number of diffusion gradients, and the signal to noise ratio of the protocol. Meta -analysis avoids the need to use the same DTI protocol across sites and gives more robust effects than aggregated mega -analysis. We have related expertise leading ENIGMA, in which we pool scans from >60 sites 8 to detect genetic brain effects. We will adjust for site effects. Imaging quality control: We will visually inspect all scans and will exclude any 1) subject having non-AD Table 1. encode polarity 51 directions (b=1,000 s/mm2); 2 b0 with opposite phase 2 repetitions; 30 directions echo T2/PD double echo T2 FLAIR related anatomical anomalies, 2) scan with distortion or artifacts that prevent adequate co-registration or successful individual analysis, and 3) measure of interest that is >3 S.D. from the mean in either direction. For FreeSurfer analyses, we will visually assess segmentations slice by slice and will exclude from our statistics failed segmentations, defined as those whose partitions misestimate the correct hippocampal outline or gray -white matter -CSF boundaries on more than three consecutive sagittal slices. Research Staff will read training materials and complete relevant quality control training on practice sets before performing quality control on scans or analyses. FreeSurfer analysis: In Aim 1, we will harmonize structural data analysis across ADNI, WHIMS and VETSA, using FreeSurfer software (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to segment the brain by tissue class (gray, white, CSF). FreeSurfer automatically labels the gray matter and associated white matter regions (Figure 1) using standardized delineations based on the Desikan -Killiany brain atlas 9. We will also use FreeSurfer to calculate Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 291 Research Strategy hippocampal volume, total white matter volume, and estimated intracranial volume (ICV). Hippocampal segmentations will be based on a standard protocol 10. Hippocampal, WMH, and regional white matter volumes will be adjusted for intracranial volume. Of more than 3000 sMRI scans to be reprocessed, 2133 (including 730 with repeated measures) came from WHIMS MRI and 992 (including 350 repeated) from VETSA. Creating and Validating Predicted Risk Scores and Identifying Cortical Thickness Signatures: Prior studies have created AD \"signatures\" that allow for a summary assessment of AD risk based on patterns of atrophy that best characterize AD vs. controls 11, 12. Here, we will create similar topographic signatures in ADNI, but will combine the information based on both diagnosis and neuropathology (see AD Risk Categories below ) for use in Project 1 & 2 Aims . AD-related pathology has been associated with cortical thickness in cognitively intact older adults previously using vertex -wise or AD-signature approaches in many 11, 13-15, but not all 16 studies. In our largely non- demented subject cohorts, we focus on adults having increased risk for AD, allowing us to isolate the earliest structural indicators of AD. In neuroimaging studies, cortical thickness analyses are typically performed in one of two ways. Either statistics are run at every vertex or voxel in the brain, or statistics are performed on summary measures representing the mean cortical thickness across all the voxels or vertices within each standard region, such as those delineated in the Desikan -Killiany atlas 9. These methods, while Figure 1. Example gray and white matter parcellation in FreeSurfer. PHC WM= white matter; GM = gray matter valuable, evaluate each brain region or vertex in isolation, rather than considering patterns of cortical thickness across the brain surface that may be representative of a disease or other phenotype. This increases the number of individual comparisons that must be made, and thus decreases the statistical power to detect effects. Averaging results across an anatomically defined region of interest additionally may obscure effects if cortical thinning is not uniform within what may be a somewhat arbitrarily defined region. In contrast, \"Evolving Partitions to Improve Connectomics\" (EPIC) 17 is a data-driven approach, which clusters or subdivides existing regions of interest to partition the cortex in a way that optimizes the classification of disease based on brain connectivity or cortical thickness 18. For Aim 2, we will begin with vertex -wise cortical thickness measurements derived from FreeSurfer analyses of ADNI data to arrive at patterns of cortical thickness that best separate high risk versus low risk (See AD Risk Categories ). EPIC will use logistic regression as a classifier, and will perform leave -one-out validation. We will also perform external prospective validation within WHIMS on select comparisons (see AD Risk Validations ). Predicted risk scores indicate the probability of being considered high-risk based on a subject's cortical thickness pattern. As a result of Aim2 performance, we will generate mean cortical thickness values within the AD risk signatures and 6 categories of predicted AD/MCI Neuropathology risk scores that will be submitted to Projects 1 & 2 for the subsequent SEM (Aim3). AD Neuropathological Biomarkers - ADNI: AV45 amyloid positivity will be assessed using the mean positron emission tomography (PET) scan standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) using the whole cerebellum as the reference region and a threshold of >1.11 19. Of the 266 total cognitively intact older adults who had MRI scans at baseline (Table 2), 207 had diagnoses available both at baseline and at a 24-month follow -up. Of those, 148 had AV45 amyloid PET scans at baseline, 135 had CSF A42, and ptau 181, and 133 had CSF tau available at baseline. Of the 207 controls, 13 had declined to a diagnosis of AD or MCI at 24 months. CSF total tau positivity (tau+; > 93 pg/ml 20) and AV45 amyloid positivity (amyloid+; PET mean signal >1.11 19) were both significantly different between stable and declining older adults in this sample (p = 0.48 and p = 0.016, respectively). CSF A42 (<192 pg/ml) and ptau 181 Table 2. ADNI - Assessing Biomarkers N Controls at baseline who also have 24 month diagnosis. 207 -Subset with AV45 amyloid PET 148 -Subset with CSF A42 & ptau 181 135 -Subset with CSF tau 133 Table 3.

Core -001 (257) Page 292 Research Strategy positivity (>23 pg/ml) 20 did not successfully distinguish stable cognition from decliners in this sample (p = 0.74 and p = 0.48, respectively). Although this is a small sample, this is consistent with a past model of AD biomarkers that CSF tau and amyloid PET may show detectable differences closer to an AD diagnosis compared with CSF A, which changes earlier 21. Thus CSF Apositivity, may be less informative when evaluating short term (24 month) decline. Here we focus on CSF tau+ and AV45 amyloid + as AD biomarkers AD Risk Categories - ADNI, WHIMS, VETSA: We will use EPIC to partition cortical thickness patterns to best classify high versus low predicted risks for AD, MCI, and preclinical AD in ADNI (Table 3). We will define high versus low AD risk in six separate analyses in ADNI: 1) an overall risk score for clinical AD derived by comparing 714 AD versus 266 cognitively intact older adults (controls); 2) an overall risk score for incident MCI derived by comparing 66 controls who progress to MCI within two years versus 194 controls at baseline who are cognitively stable over two years; 3) a specific risk score for preclinical AD comparing 60 controls who are amyloid + assessed with an AV45 PET scan versus 147 amyloid - controls; 4) a risk score for increased tau pathology comparing 36 CSF tau+ controls versus 99 controls who are both CSF AB- and tau-; 5) an overall MCI risk score comparing 377 MCI versus 266 controls; 6) a specific risk score for amyloid+ MCI, comparing 187 AV45 amyloid+ MCI versus 147 amyloid - controls. Controls who progressed to MCI were not included in comparison 2 above if they first regressed from MCI or later regressed to control, as this suggests a less stable diagnosis. In WHIMS and VETSA, we will assess mean cortical thickness within these signatures and will provide Projects 1 & 2 with these values and predicted risk scores (the probability each subject has of being in the \"high risk\" category for each analysis). We will use linear regression to assess which of these signatures best predict a decline in cognitive domain scores or diagnosis in WHIMS and VETSA. See Table 4 for subject population information in WHIMS and VETSA. The cortical thickness or predictive risk values from the best cognitive decline predictor in each cohort will be used by the projects in further analyses, including SEM. AD Risk Validations - WHIMS: We will perform prospective validations using independent data in the WHIMS cohort on the optimal cortical partitions derived from the training. Specifically, we will validate the ADNI cortical thickness signature for AD versus control using a longitudinal validation of WHIMS 36-46 controls who progressed to AD in subsequent years. We will validate the ADNI cortical thickness signature for 150 controls who progressed to MCI versus cognitively stable controls using a longitudinal validation of WHIMS controls who progressed to MCI in subsequent years, both out of the 1313 subjects who were cognitively intact at the time of MRI scan 1. If we fail to validate the ADNI cortical thickness signature in WHIMS, we will refine the ADNI signatures by creating new cortical thickness signatures in WHIMS in the controls who progress to MCI or AD versus stable controls. We will then create an overlap map between the WHIMS and ADNI signatures. Finally, we will evaluate whether these refined maps predict cognitive decline from controls to MCI or AD in ADNI. If so, these refined maps may better indicate cognitive decline across cohorts. Possibly, patterns of atrophy will differ by sex 22, 23. To test this, we can generate sex-specific cortical thickness signatures in ADNI, and evaluate whether the female pattern is better validated in WHIMS relative to the initial signature pattern Diffusion tensor imaging analyses - VETSA and ADNI : We will remove non-brain material and will perform eddy -correction before non-linearly aligning the diffusion scans to their associated T1-weighted image in template space. We will calculate scan -wide fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusivity using FSL's DTIfit tool. We will evaluate MD, which is particularly sensitive to AD risk 24, 25 specifically within FreeSurfer -derived white matter parcellations adjacent to gray matter targeted as important to either episodic memory or frontal lobe-dependent function. These MD values will be included in our targeted structural equation models (Aim 3). We also will perform voxelwise statistics on MD within the total white matter to assess the white matter tracts most associated with TRAP exposure. In ADNI, we will compare DTI MD between 1) AD versus controls 2) MCI versus controls 3) amyloid+ controls versus amyloid - controls and 4) MCI amyloid+ versus controls for use in future analyses. White matter hyperintensities: We will assess WMH using previously published methods based on a Bayesian segmentation approach applied in ADNI 26. Each FLAIR or double echo image will be co-registered Table 4.

Inhomogeneity of our FLAIR or double echo scans will be based on a previously published local histogram normalization method 27. We will then estimate WMH using a modified Bayesian probability structure using an established histogram fitting method. We will threshold these probabilities at 3.5 sd above the mean consistent with prior work to create a binary WMH mask 28, and will also create separate masks of periventricular and deep WMH. Statistical Analyses: Single -sex based analyses will be performed separately in Projects 2 & 2 using WHIMS MRI and VETSA cohorts. Please see Projects 1 & 2 for covariates to be used for each cohort. We will use the false discovery rate (FDR) to control for voxel - and region -wise multiple comparisons. Targeted Structural Equation Models (SEM): We previously used SEM to evaluate contributions to AD risk 29, 30. Here, our targeted SEMs evaluate whether the integrity of a priori selected AD risk regions mediate the established relationship between TRAP and cognition to aid Projects 1 & 2 in their Aims. We will assess how well brain measures mediate an effect between TRAP and 1) Global cognition (Figure 2).

Agnostic Approach : In Project -1, we will work with Dr. Millstein to conduct mediation analysis with an agnostic approach to identifying regions of the brain that mediate effects of TRAP on brain aging. Specifically, the causal inference test (CIT),31, 32 developed by Dr. Millstein, will be applied to the Project -1 proposed high-dimensional analyses (Aim3b). Two published studies 33, 34 on the mediation analyses of environmental neurotoxicity followed approaches closely related to the 30-year old Sobel test 35 that was not designed to distinguish causality from reverse causality. The CIT is uniquely suited to address this challenge, by providing a statistically powerful approach when multiple null hypotheses are false as has been demonstrated in simulation studies.31, 32 In addition, to reduce the search space of mediators, the CIT-based framework could incorporate prior knowledge, such as the ADNI -defined signatures of cortical thinning that best differentiates AD from controls. In VETSA, we also will evaluate how voxelwise DTI MD relates to TRAP. MOUSE IMAGING SUB -CORE B2 Core B2 assesses cerebrovascular and white matter tract responses to nPM exposure with in vivo multiphoton imaging for regional DTE-MRI, at 80 resolution provides white matter fractional anisotropy maps. BBB cellular integrity is assessed by confocal microscopy. SIGNIFICANCE . The neurovascular unit (NVU)1 links neurons with the cerebral vascular system and is comprised of vascular cells (endothelial between these cells maintains normal neurovascular integrity. Endothelial cells and pericytes form the BBB which limits entry of blood -derived toxic substances, pathogens and cells into the brain1,2,8,9. Dysfunction in each NVU cellular constituents (vascular, glia, neurons) is linked to AD progression in experimental, imaging, pathological, and epidemiological studies1-8,10-14. Vascular insults can initiate and exacerbate molecular neurodegenerative cascades to cognitive impairment and AD1-7. Urban Traffic Associated Air Pollution (TRAP) is hypothesized to be a major insult to the NVU that increases the risk of stroke, AD and AD-like brain pathologies, including to the BBB15-17, which is exacerbated in APOE4 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 294 Research Strategy carriers18. In experimental studies, mixed vehicle exhaust can increase BBB permeability, decrease tight junction proteins (e.g. occludin and claudin -5) and elevate production of reactive oxygen species in ApoE-/- mice19. Endothelial in vitro that PM2.5 permeability and monocyte transmigration20. Furthermore, air pollution -derived fine PM stimulated increased A42 production in wild-type mice: nPM from TRAP and nickel 21. Additionally, cause hippocampal neuron atrophy and impaired glutamatergic functions20 (Project 3) and exacerbate cerebral ischemia22. Preliminary data (Project 4) show major increase in BBB permeability with a concordant decrease in endothelial pericyte coverage in the corpus callosum after 3 days of experimental CCH. Furthermore, female EFAD mice have more A positive vessels than males, with additive effects of APOE4 (Project 3). Moreover, female E4FAD and APOE4 -TR mice without FAD have microbleeds, which we showed the CypA -nuclear factor -kB- matrixmetalloproteinase -9 pathway23. Sub-Core B2 will evaluate the impact of TRAP on the integrity of the NVU (including PWM: perforant path and CA1 neurons) and BBB in B6 and EFAD (Project 3) and in CCH mice (Project 4) allowing consistency and direct comparison between the findings of both projects. Using cutting edge methodologies, we will employ multiphoton in vivo imaging to measure BBB permeability and angiography, ultra-high field MRI to detect connectivity changes through various diffusivity and tractography maps and for quantification of BBB permeability using dynamic contrast enhanced immunofluorescent and fluorescent lectin staining. These methodologies will be used to test the hypothesis that TRAP components promote convergent neurodegenerative processes from cerebrovascular and neuronal interactions. The Mouse Imaging Sub-Core2 group has decades of experience and state -of-the-art equipment to measure BBB dysfunction and disruption of signaling between different cell types within the NVU1,2,4,6,8,9,12,14,23 -40. The Zilkha Neurogenetics Institute has installed a new 7.0 Tesla MR for mice, which will enable ultra-high field MRI to detect connectivity changes through diffusivity and tractography and quantification of BBB permeability using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) -MRI. See Fig 1. APPROACH : The Mouse Imaging Sub-Core is led by Dr. Berislav Zlokovic, a leader in the NVU and BBB in collaboration with Dr. Russel Jacobs on small animal MRI. Zlokovic lab members, Drs.

Cranial window: Mice will be anesthetized (ketamine, mg/kg xylazine, 50 mg/kg), fixed in frame Instruments) and transitioned to isoflurane anesthesia. A circular cranial window will be drilled over the hindlimb region of somatosensory cortex (center at AP, -0.94 mm; L,1.5 mm). The window will be filled with 2% low melt agarose in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and covered with 3 mm coverslips. Laser -doppler flowmetry (LDF). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to hindlimb stimulation will be measured in anesthetized mice (~1% isofluorane) using laser -Doppler flowmetry measured through a cranial window 23,24,41. The tip of the laser -Doppler probe (Transonic Systems Inc.) is stereotaxically placed above the cranial window over the somatosensory cortex hind-limb region. CBF will be measured at baseline and following 60 sec electrical stimulation of a hind-limb. The % increase in CBF due to stimulation will be obtained by subtracting baseline CBF from the stable maximum plateau during stimulus, averaged of 3 trials per mouse. BBB permeability: Cortical cerebrovascular permeability will be determined with rapid in vivo multiphoton microscopy imaging as we described25. medium -size dextran (40,000 Da, Invitrogen) is injected via the left femoral vein. In vivo time-lapse images will be acquired every 2 min for 30 min. Images are subjected to threshold processing; the extravascular fluorescent intensity will be measured with the integrated density measurement function by a blinded investigator. The in vivo BBB permeability for TMR - dextran is estimated as PS product25-27 by the formula: PS = (1-Hct) 1/Iv V x where Hct is hematocrit (45%), Iv is initial fluorescence intensity of the region of interest (ROI) within the vessel, It is the intensity of the ROI at time t, V is vessel volume, assuming 1 g of brain is equivalent to 50 cm2.

Aim 3: Ultra -highfield MRI to detect mouse connectivity changes through various diffusivity and tractography maps & quantification of BBB permeability by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) -MRI. Ultra -high field MRI in mice: Methods were developed to detect microstructural and connectivity changes through various diffusivity and tractography from diffusion weighted MR images (DTI)28,42. Quantification of BBB permeability changes using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) -MRI mouse protocols are adapted from methodologies developed in humans29-31.

In brief, TMR -conjugated medium -size dextran (40,000 Da, Invitrogen) is injected via the left femoral vein. In vivo time-lapse images will be acquired every 2 min for 30 min.

Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -001 (257) Page 297 Vertebrate Animals Imaging is performed on the entire brain at 80 \u00b5m isotropic resolution, which will allow measurement of white matter changes in corpus callosum, the perforant path, and CA1 neuron fields. A 7T MR scanner is used to acquire all diffusion weighted images (DWIs) of the mouse brains. Fixed brains are kept within the skull, all skin and cartilaginous tissue are removed, and brains are soaked at 4\u00b0C in 5 mM gadolinium contrast ProHance (Bracco Diagnostics, Inc., Princeton, NJ) for 4 days prior to scanning to minimize the T1 relaxation effect on the tissue. For each scan, two intact fixed heads are secured in a Teflon\u00ae holder, submerged in Galden\u00ae (perfluoropolyether with same magnetic susceptibility as water) (Fomblin\u00ae, Solvay Solexis, Inc., Thorofare, NJ). This ensures that no leakage will occur and that the signal will not change during acquisition. First, 3D-rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) anatomical images is acquired (TR/TE = 250/9 ms; DWIs acquired a conventional pulsed -gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence (TR/TE 80 \u00b5m isotropic voxel size, 1 average, = 3 ms, = 8 ms, Gd = 1000 mT/m, nominal b-factor = 3000 s/mm2). Six diffusion weighted images are acquired in addition to one volume with no diffusion sensitization using an optimized six points icosahedral encoding scheme for a total imaging time of 24 h. To pre-process the raw ex vivo DWIs, we first correct for eddy current distortions using the \"eddy correct\" tool in FSL (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ). Extra cerebral tissue is removed using the \"skull -stripping\" Brain Extraction Tool from BrainSuite (http://brainsuite.org/). All resulting volumes are visually inspected and manually edited as needed. Then, all images are linearly aligned using FSL's \"flirt\" function with 12 degrees of freedom to allow for rotation, translation, scaling, and skewing in 3D. The gradient direction tables are rotated accordingly after each linear registration for the 6 diffusion volumes. Furthermore, each skull-stripped b0 images are elastically registered to a minimum deformation template created using all linearly registered images for both groups. This is done to ensure that all scans are in the same space for further analysis. We will then apply the DTI model using the FSL's \"dtifit\" tool to compute fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. The diffusion tensor is computed using the eddy corrected and elastically registered DWI scans. A Gaussian low- pass filter with kernel size 3 (i.e., 3x3x3 voxel) is applied to all maps. To test for group differences, a voxel -wise linear regression is run, with X (experimental) mice coded as 1 and Y (control) mice coded as 0. We run this for EFAD and CCH mice separately. A regional false discovery rate (FDR) correction will be used to correct for multiple comparisons across voxels. Additionally, searchlight -based multivoxel pattern statistics are performed on the resulting probabilistic p-value maps from the regression in all cohorts. As we published previously (Daianu SPIE and PlosOne), tractography maps are then performed on the eddy corrected DWI scans aligned to the Mori atlas using a deterministic fiber reconstruction method, FACT, in Trackvis (http://trackvis.org/ ). 2. Justifications: Provide justification that the species are appropriate for the proposed research. Explain why the research goals cannot be accomplished using an alternative model (e.g. computational, human, invertebrate, in vitro). In vitro studies or computer/ mathematical models cannot satisfactorily reproduce the white matter/ neuronal injury and functional deficits resulting from nPM/ CCH exposures. Due to cost, ethical concerns, and reproducibility, mice are most appropriate for these studies. We choose mice because of our experience in the models being tested, availability of applicable antibodies/ assays, and potential for future investigations. C57BL/6 mice are the standard murine strain used by most aging researchers and are available through the NIA Aging Mouse Colony. Further, all previous nPM data has been collected using C57BL/6J mice. Altering background strains for the study would likely introduce strain specific differences in exposure responses and outcomes. This variation would increase sample sizes. Male and female mice are selected to study sex influences and comply with recent NIH initiatives to balance sex in animal studies. Power analyses are designed to limit sample size. 3. Minimization of Pain and Distress. Describe the interventions including analgesia, anesthesia, sedation, palliative care and humane endpoints to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury. Discomfort, distress, pain, and injury will be minimized in all phases of the experiment. We will monitor behavioral changes, e.g., loss of appetite, grooming and activity. Moribund criteria include one or a combination of the following: >20% weight loss, sustained hunched posture, respiratory difficulty, hypo/hyperthermia, inability of access food/water, inability to ambulate or make normal postural adjustments. Mice will be monitored for any signs of stress or pain as well as general criteria outlined by IACUC (Body Condition Score 2, BC2) and will be euthanized. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Ranked as the top academic department in preventive medicine with the largest NIH-sponsored researches, the department is home to worldwide authorities on chronic disease epidemiology (including cancer and cardiovascular disease), biostatistics, environmental medicine, health behavior, and prevention, detection, and treatment methods. The Division of Environmental Health (EH) is home to two federally funded regional research centers, including the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center (SCEHSC) and the Children's Environmental Health Center. The EH division is the operational house of the Children's Health Study, which is one of the most comprehensive cohort studies on the long-term health effects of air pollution among more than 15,000 school - aged children across 12 different communities in Southern California. Division faculty members have the scientific expertise in studying air pollution health effects in children. To support large -scale air pollution epidemiologic studies, the Division includes experienced staff scientists with the research capacities to conduct complex spatial epidemiologic analyses and monitor levels of the major components of smog \u2014ozone gas, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and acid vapors \u2014in population -based cohorts. The active research programs within the EH Division are almost entirely supported by extramural funds with approximately eight million dollars per year. Detailed description of the EH Division can be found at http://keck.usc.edu/en/Education/Academic_Department_and_Div isions/Department_of_Preventive_Medicine/ Divisions/Environmental_Health.aspx Intellectual Environment The EH Division offers an excellent intellectual environment fostering innovative research in environmental epidemiology research and air pollution health effects sciences. EH Division faculty members study chronic health effects associated with environmental exposures, and many scientific products of their scholarly work have appeared in high-impact journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine , the Lancet , and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Of its 10 primary faculty members, two serve in the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and one serves in the National Advisory Environmental Health Sciences Council. Dr. JC Chen has been co-leading the USC AirPollBrain (APB) Network, a product of the program development project entitled \"Brain Health during Development and Aging in Urban Environments\" (co-PIs\" Finch and Chen) funded by the USC Collaboration Fund (https://research.usc.edu/collaboration -fund-current -projects/ ) since 2010. This program brings together a network of USC faculty from Gerontology, the Viterbi School of Engineering, the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Keck School of Medicine, School of Pharmacy, and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to better understand the scientific basis for the impacts of pollution on the brain, and to explore the health consequences. This program aims to promote the optimal neurodevelopment in humans and healthy brain aging by better understanding environmental effects of urban air pollution and gene environment interactions. Bimonthly meetings convene faculty and trainees on specific topics with a focus on developing new research projects and consortia. As of March 2016, the AirPollBrain has helped USC faculty obtained more than $10 millions of NIH funding to support the continuing development of research and education programs in environmental neurosciences studying ambient air pollution and neurodevelopment/brain aging. The research program described in this application draws upon the expertise of faculty and staff scientists in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California and collaborating researchers from the NIEHS -sponsored Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center (SCEHSC). The Division of Environmental Health is home to two federally funded regional research centers, including the SCEHSC and the Children's Environmental Health Center. The NIH-funded SCEHSC is a multi -university consortium of over 60 leading researchers across the region. The SCEHSC has several research initiatives, including \"Air Pollution, Neurodevelopment and Neurological Diseases,\" led by Dr. JC Chen (the USC PI). Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -002 (249) Page 312 Facilities & Other Resources The major goal of the initiatives has been to incubate new programs of EHS research by providing infrastructure and support to grow new research into mature programs supported by investigator -initiated grants, program projects and new centers. Laboratories and Facilities The project PI is a core member of the SCEHSC, which includes the Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) and the Biostatistics Facility Core (BFC).

The AirPollBrain Group at USC is an organized research group of scholars who do research on ways to promote optimal neurodevelopment in humans and healthy brain aging by better understanding environmental effects of urban air pollution and gene -environment interactions. The APB group developed from a core of USC's leadership in urban environmental health research in the Los Angeles Basin, with collaborating institutions. Taking a multi -disciplinary research, APB addresses effects of environmental pollution on the brain across the lifespan. APB is pursuing five main goals: I, Identify environmental risk factors impacting brain health in human populations with different environmental settings and genetic backgrounds; II, Develop experimental paradigms relevant to human studies and public health interventions; III, Integrate the existing environmental, neurosciences, and public health sciences programs at USC; IV, Provide the best sciences to support evidence -based regulations to protect public's health?; V, Create resources for training and education in interdisciplinary environmental health sciences from basic environmental biology to societal levels of analysis. Bimonthly meetings convene faculty and trainees on specific topics with a focus on developing new research projects and consortia. USC has a number of research centers that provide a resource rich intellectual environment for the work proposed in this application: NIA Center on Biodemography and Population Health: The USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography and Population Health (CBPH) aims to enhance understanding of biological and other processes that contribute to Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Major text changes are italicized in Research Strategy C1: Environmental Data Support for Projects 1 & 2 (JC Chen, co-Director) Core C1 will provide harmonized measures of the residence -specific TRAP exposure estimates in geographically diverse populations, by refining/applying state -of-the-art spatiotemporal models. Core C1 is an integrated part of Core C, for which Reviewers (Stage -1) had recognized its multiple strengths (\"its organization, integration and synergies, the well-established team \") and were impressed with the \"overall leadership, the integration and synergy between the three sub-cores, and inclusion of innovative spatial - temporal models... \" Although not a major weakness, several technical issues were raised at two stages of reviews, as parsed below in bold and followed by brief summaries of our responses. (Crtq p3) \"...weaknesses included validation of the actual environmental exposures over time.\" Response Core C1 will implement exposure models focused on outdoor pollutant concentrations. All available models have been cross -validated 1-5 using out-of-sample actual monitoring data from the reference methods available at the time in question. For the pre-1999 models, we validate using older monitoring data. (Crtq p3) \"...historical data...subject to variability in terms of quality in different regions of the country... \" Response Our historical PM 2.5 model is robust and captures available data sources,3 using both the USEPA Federal Reference Method (FRM) network and the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environment (IMPROVE) network. Whereas FRM sites were located mostly in urban areas, IMPROVE sites monitor visibility and were located mostly in wilderness areas and national parks. We developed the model using both sets of data from 1999 -2010, thus incorporating rural and urban data. We then validated the model using the available IMPROVE data from 1990 -1998 as well as three other data sets from before 1999: California Air Resources Board dichotomous sampler monitoring, the Children's Health Study, and the Inhalable Particulate Network. (Crtq p3) \"People don't live in the same place for the entire lifespan .\" Response We were able to estimate residence -specific exposures since recruitment,6-8 weighted by the duration at each location. The exposure time window of scientific interest covers both mid- to late life. Without high -quality monitoring data prior to 1970s, it was not possible to reliably estimate air pollution exposures in early life or young adulthood for nationwide cohorts like WHIMS/WHIMS -Y and VETSA (aged 65-80/50 -54 and 51-60 years at the respective study inception in 1995 -6 and 2002). We acknowledged this limitation in resubmission. The spatiotemporal modeling was \"very ambitious\" and \"data -fusion ...methods [were] not specified.\" Response More technical details with appropriate references5, 9 are given in the revised Core C1. C2: Collection and Characterization of TRAP -nPM and mouse exposure (C Sioutas, Director) Crtq p14. *focus on primary aerosols in Subcore C2 may not be consistent with exposure measures in Subcore C1, e.g., NO 2 from vehicles is largely a secondary pollutant; further justification is warranted . Response : We focus on PM from primary aerosols that show consistent responses across decade of studies in vivo and in vitro. Inclusion of NO 2 or other trace gases is not feasible for the re-aerosolization of particles collected on filter because such oxidants would further change the activity of the collected particles in uncontrolled ways from contact with animals in the exposure and cage content . *Characterization of the collected PM appears limited. Sample storage and potential changes in sample integrity is not described . Response : The nPM show retention of chemical stability for 3 mo10 and replicable dose responses for TNFa induction in batches from 2010 and 2015 (Fig. 3 of Cheng et al 201611). C3: Brain Responses to TRAP -PM (HJ Forman, co-Director) Crtq p15: *C3 provides preliminary data that is not specific to the cell lines or proteins proposed. No one has mechanistically proven that neuroinflammatory effects of PM are due to direct toxicity; from a dosimetric standpoint, the levels of PM that access the brain are trivial, even via the olfactory bulb. Response We agree and have discussed this issue in Cheng et al.11 Crtq p15*Direct application of PM onto neurons/microglia is odd. Response : Studies with neurons/microglia are deleted. *Integration of Aim 3 with the toxicology projects seems absent. Will they investigate toxicity of PM from different sources? Response The proposed experimental studies are in continuity with a decade of work with nPM collected from this Los Angeles site. Cheng et al11 shows in Fig 3 that the in vitro dose response of TNFa to nPM was identical in batches collected in 2010 and 2015, cited in the revision. The Sioutas group has shown seasonal differences of nPM batches in oxidative activity12. We describe collection in cooler months to minimize confounds from seasonal wildfires and secondary aerosols. Nonetheless, we will assess new nPM batches for dose -response induction of TNFa and IL1a with THP -1 cells. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -002 (249) Page 363 Specific Aims Environmental Exposures and Neurotoxicology Core (Core C) Director, C Sioutas, Co-Directors: JC Chen and H Forman Specific Aims SubCore C1, Environmental Data Support characterizes ambient air pollution exposures in the geographically - diverse populations of Project 1 (Women's Health Initiative Memory Study) and Project 2 (VETSA: Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging). Core C1 will: (1) support the design and conduct of environmental epidemiologic studies on large cohorts; (2) harmonize the spatiotemporal modeling approaches across two population studies; and (3) provide the P01 team with expertise in analyses and interpretation of air pollution -neuroepidemiologic data. The environmental data resource, exposure modeling tools, and collaborative infrastructure have been built from several NIH-funded air pollution -neuroepidemiologic projects based at USC. To harmonize the TRAP exposure characterization, Dr. Chen will coordinate the effort, through a subcontract with Dr. Joel Kaufman who leads the MESA -Air (Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution) team at the U. of Washington. SubCore C2, Collection of TRAP -PM and Mouse Exposure is responsible for the collection and physico - chemical characterization of TRAP particulate material (TRAP -PM), and for carrying out the inhalation mouse exposures in Projects 3 &4. The main TRAP -PM studied is nano -sized particulate matter (nPM) of the ultrafine size range (PM 0.2um), which is collected at a well-characterized site in central Los Angeles , heavily impacted by traffic emissions . Given the focus of the study on capturing the fresh traffic -related nPM, the sampling period will be constrained to colder months to minimize the effects of ozone and the contribution of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). TRAP nano -size particulate matter is collected into ultrapure (milli-Q) water suspensions using highly innovative state -of the-art aerosol sampling technologies developed by the USC Aerosol group, led by prof. Sioutas. The nPM aqueous suspensions collected during the year are stored in the freezer, following protocols established by the US EPA, and subsequently analyzed for size and chemical composition, followed by re-aerosolization and exposure of mice. The nPM mass concentration and size distribution of the exposure atmospheres are continuously monitored throughout the animal exposure. We maintain average concentration of 250 (+/- 50) ug/m3- roughly twice that of busy roadways, consistently with our prior and published work. nPM-bound Inorganic ions [ammonium (NH 4+), nitrate (NO 3-), are analyzed by ion chromatography and nPM-bound metals/ trace elements are assayed by magnetic -sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Water -soluble organic carbon will be assayed by a GE-Sievers liquid analyzer (GE-Sievers, Boulder, CO). SubCore C3, Brain Cell Responses to TRAP -PM (i) tests individual batches of collected nPM using THP-1 cells for cytokine expression; and (ii) performs Western blot assay of brain protein changes to in vivo nPM exposure for Projects 3 & 4.

Subcore C1 Environmental Data Support (JC Chen, Co-Director) The Environmental Data Subcore aims to: (1) support the study design and conduct of large -scale air pollution/spatial epidemiologic studies on geographically -diverse cohorts; (2) harmonize the spatiotemporal air pollution modeling approaches across two population studies (Project -1 & -2); and (3) provide the P01 team members access to expertise in the analyses and interpretation air pollution -neuroepidemiology of brain aging. Significance : [revised ] For a multi -region longitudinal cohort study such as WHIMS and VETSA, estimating TRAP exposures requires a model with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In developing such spatiotemporal models, several challenges arise. These challenges include accounting for small -scale and intra -urban variation in TRAP concentrations, and developing comprehensive exposure predictions over time and space when the quality, availability and/or interpretation of relevant environmental data depends on regions and can vary from year to year. Existing methods for modeling NO 2 (gaseous surrogate) and other TRAP exposure indicators include land use regression (LUR), dispersion models, universal kriging and Bayesian hierarchical models. LUR incorporates geographic covariates to inform small -scale variation in unmonitored areas and has become a popular approach for modeling TRAP exposure. Recent simulation work13 showed that LUR -spatiotemporal models would produce less biased estimates of chronic health effects compared with conventional geostatistical approaches. The MESA -AIR (http://deohs.washington.edu/mesaair/researchers) team, led by Dr. Joel Kaufman (subcontract PI) has developed a suite of well -validated spatiotemporal models1, 4, 9, 14-19 to predict ambient outdoor concentrations of air pollutants. These approaches were successfully applied to other multi -region longitudinal cohorts including WHI,20 the Sister Study,21, 22 and the Cardiovascular Health Study. a. Approach (1) Organization of Subcore: Dr. JC Chen will direct the Environmental Data Subcore. In addition to serving his role as the environmental/spatial epidemiology expert of the Core C based at USC, Chen will lead the coordinated efforts to ensure the quality and comparability of TRAP exposure estimates used in Projects -1 & - 2. He will advise Project -2 PI and co-investigators in developing the questionnaires/survey tools to update/reconstruct the residential histories and selecting the optimal procedures for geocoding. To harmonize the TRAP exposure characterization, Core C will establish a subcontract with U. of Washington, where Dr. Joel Kaufman (subcontract PI) leads the MESA -Air team. Chen & Kaufman recently helped develop the location data and air pollution exposure estimates needed for a nationwide study on air pollution and risk of Parkinson's disease.23 The subcontract supports Dr. Kaufman and team to apply relevant MESA -AIR spatiotemporal air pollution models and derive location -specific time-varying yearly TRAP exposure for this P01. (2) Methods : The proposed extension/implementation of MESA -AIR approach represents state -of-the-art in modeling air pollution exposures for large cohort studies, as it incorporates the methodological advances and environmental data resources developed from the EPA's long-term investment in MESA -AIR (2006 -onward).24 The novel modeling approach integrates measurements from the U.S. EPA Air Quality System25 with comprehensive (n>800) spatiotemporal covariates assembled in the MESA -AIR Exposure Assessment Core Database.26 The MESA -AIR approach models pollutant concentrations as a linear combination of temporal basis functions with spatially - 18 varying coefficients and spatiotemporal residuals. The resulting exposure estimates therefore capture both regional - and local-scale variability.4 In the context of WHIMS, Chen and Kaufman has been working on the R01ES025888 (2016 -21), which will support the downscaling of yearly MESA -AIR models to estimate monthly outdoor concentrations (1990 -2016 for NO 2;1999 -2016 for PM 2.5) on the national - scale. Although downscaling of spatiotemporal models is computationally intensive, we have previously shown that exposure estimation processes starting with shorter time-scales followed by temporal aggregation is more preferable than directly modeling yearly exposure.27 Figure 1.1 depicted the preliminary results of a downscaled MESA -AIR model of monthly PM 2.5 in one climatic zone (the Southeastern US) in 1999 -2013, with the model performance via 10-fold cross 2 validation showing a high degree of estimation accuracy (RCV = 0.73). Also available to this P01 is a new spatiotemporal model of historical annual PM 2.5 concentrations in the Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -002 (249) Page 365 Research Strategy continental US from 1980 -1998 . This pre-1999 model performed well when validated using IMPROVE Network and USC -based Children's Health Study data (R2=0.84 -0.91).3 We will also implement the national spatial exposure models1 to estimate annual average concentrations of major PM 2.5 components, focused on elemental carbon (a marker of diesel exhaust particle). In the Table 1 below, we applied the existing yearly models (PM 2.54; NO 25) to the WHI cohort and showed the desirable exposure contrasts in both urban (census tracts > 50% classified as urban; 87% of WHI locations) and rural areas. Table 1 Rural vs urban exposures 1999 PM 2.5 Rural 2011 PM 2.5 Rural 1999 NO 2 Rural 2011 NO 2 Rural Mean (SD) 11.4 (3.3) \u00b5g/m3 8.3 (1.7) \u00b5g/m3 7.3 (2.5) ppb 4.1 (1.5) ppb Range 2.2 - 22.5 \u00b5g/m3 1.7 - 15 \u00b5g/m3 0.1 - 40 ppb 0.7 - 32 ppb 1999 PM 2.5 Urban 2011 PM 2.5 Urban 1999 NO 2 Urban 2011 NO 2 Urban Mean (SD) 13.7 (3.5) \u00b5g/m3 9.4 (1.6) \u00b5g/m3 17.2 (6.8) ppb 10.1 (4.4) ppb Range 2.4 - 26.6 \u00b5g/m3 1.9 - 16.1 \u00b5g/m3 0.5 - 46 ppb 1.1 - 33 ppb For this application , the P01 subcontract will support the MESA -Air team for continuing development of augmented exposure models , including the extension of downscaled monthly NO 2 model (from the already validated yearly model for 1990 -2012) to 1980s and refinement of PM 2.5 composition models/clustering analyses. The MESA -AIR team has already developed techniques for incorporating satellite measures and chemical transport model output,5, 9 fusing data into a flexible spatiotemporal modeling approach implemented in the SpatioTemporal R package.18, 28 Methodological development for characterizing PM composition (and hence sources) includes a novel clustering approach (based on predictive k-means and predictive sparse principal component analyses) recently applied to identify profiles of PM 2.5 composition from EPA's Chemical Speciation Network to predict the source profile labels at residential locations of the Sister Study.2 SubCore C2: Collection and Characterization of TRAP -nPM (Constantinos Sioutas, Director) Significance During the past decade, using state -of-the-art aerosol sampling technologies29 developed by the USC Aerosol lab directed by Professor Sioutas, we have collected and characterized TRAP -nPM from several freeways and urban sites in Los Angeles, impacted by a variety of air pollution sources and formation mechanisms, for experimental inhalation exposures of caged rodents in collaboration with USC faculty, including the present coPIs11, 30, 31, 35, 59. These collaborations since 2010 have yielded more than 10 co- authored publications and 6 funded NIH projects (Biosketches of Finch, Forman, Mack, Morgan, and Sioutas). Air pollution and exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) have received considerable attention from the health science community. Epidemiological and toxicological studies document short - and long-term effects of PM exposure on cardiovascular and respiratory systems32-35 and neurodegenerative issues.36, 37 Moreover, secondary species such as sulfate, nitrate and/or organics were associated with myocardial infarction.38 Response to Crtq p14. We focus on PM from primary aerosols that show consistent responses across decade of studies in vivo and in vitro. Inclusion of NO2 or other trace gases is not feasible for the re- aerosolization of particles collected on filter because such oxidants would further change the activity of the collected particles in uncontrolled ways from contact with animals in the exposure and cage content. The PM size critically influences bioactivities and the type and severity of the health effects. In comparison to larger particles, ultrafine nanoparticles (nPM), traditionally defined as PM with an aerodynamic diameter < 0.2 \u00b5m, have higher number concentration and surface area and therefore larger concentrations of adsorbed or condensed toxic air pollutants per unit mass.39 The nPM are strongly linked to systemic oxidative stress and promote more atherosclerotic plaque formation than PM2.5 in mouse models.40 nPM likely act as the most efficient particle delivery vehicles for toxic chemicals to the respiratory system and systemic circulation, causing adverse health outcomes.41 These adverse associations linked to nPM have been extended to show the acceleration of cognitive decline of elderly community - based populations42-45 and neurodevelopmental impairments of children.46, 47 The causes of cognitive impairment were analyzed in rodent and cell models, which implicate neuro -inflammatory responses to urban air pollutants.48-50 Specifically, we and others observed that rodents exposed to nPM had brain -wide activation of microglia, with induced TNF and IL-1, among other inflammatory responses.51-53 This evidence supports findings of increased microglial activation and white matter hyperintensities in small postmortem samples of children from a highly polluted Mexican city46, 54 and in the association of white matter loss in older human adults in an MRI analysis of the WHIMS cohort of US women.55 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -002 (249) Page 366 Research Strategy b.Approach. (i) Methods : The sampling period will be constrained to colder months to minimize the effects of ozone, and the contribution from seasonal wildfires and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Recent studies show that SOA contribution to nPM is about 50% less in colder vs warmer seasons, while ozone is roughly 3-fold lower.56-58 The mouse exposure to PM0.2 at 300 ug/m3 for 150 h (1% of the lifespan) delivers 2.25 mg/kg. For humans, exposure to PM0.2 at 30 ug/m3 for 1% of lifespan yields 2.5 mg/kg, assuming inhalation rates: mouse, 0.025 L/min; human, 12 collection : TRAP nano -size particulate matter (nPM) is collected as described in Morgan et al.37 Briefly, urban nPM (aerodynamic diameter <200 nm) is collected at 400 L/min flow using a high-volume ultrafine particle sampler.29 The sampler incorporates an ultrafine particle multiple rectangular (slit) geometry jet conventional impactor and an after-filter holder. The nPM are collected at a single site adjacent to the CA-110 highway in Los Angeles. These aerosols represent a mix of fresh ambient PM mostly from vehicular traffic.12 The nPM is collected on Teflon filters (8x10\", PTFE, 2 m pore) and transferred to aqueous suspension by 30 min soaking of filters in Milli-Q deionized water; total organic compounds followed vortexing (5 min) and sonication (30 min) for resuspension. No endotoxin is detected in these suspensions (Limulus amoebocyte assay: LPS <0.02EU/ml). As control, fresh sterile filters are sham extracted. Aqueous nPM suspensions are pooled and frozen as a stock at -20\u00b0C, following US EPA recommended procedures. These nPM retain chemical stability for 3 mo10 and replicable dose responses for TNFa induction in batches from 2010 and 2015 (Fig. 3 of Cheng 201659). For mouse exposure, the nPM are re-aerosolized by an atomizer using compressed particle -free filtered air (Fig.2). Passage through a silica gel will diffusion -dry the generated nPM; static charges are removed by passage over polonium -210 neutralizers. During mouse exposure, the particle size and concentration are continuously monitored by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS model 3080; TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN) in parallel with mouse exposure chambers. Average concentration of 300 (+/- 50) ug/m3- are ca. twice that of busy roadways.50 From the total of 15 l/min of aerosol flow generated, the majority (10 l/min) is drawn through the exposure chamber. The remaining 5 l/min is diverted to filters for particle collection and characterization. Teflon and quartz filters sample aerosols during exposure. Inorganic ions [ammonium (NH 4+), nitrate (NO analyzed by ion chromatography; PM-bound metals/trace elements assayed by mass spectroscopy. Water -soluble organic carbon collected on quartz filters is assayed by a GE-Sievers liquid analyzer (GE-Sievers, Boulder, CO). For details of inorganic and organic contents of these samples, see 37. Concentrations of gaseous co-pollutants (CO, NOx and O3) are monitored as in prior studies 37. Fig.3 shows a typical chemical/ elemental composition of nPM from the Los Angeles site (Morgan et al.37). Size distribution measurements corresponding to ambient particles and re-aerosolized (i.e. concentrated) nPM in prior studies consistently show that re-aerosolization preserves the size characteristics of urban nPM (Fig. 3). Additional measurements of the aqueous -phase (i.e slurry) size distribution of nPM using Dynamic Light Fig. 3: Chemical composition and size distribution of re-aerosolized nPM Morgan et al.37 Fig.2 Schematic of the exposure apparatus Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -002 (249) Page 367 Research Strategy Scattering (DLS) show that size distribution is well-preserved during water -extraction: with 95% of the nPM based on number, and 85% based on surface area similar to the airborne nPM phase. (ii) nPM exposure of mice for Projects 3 &4, in participation with their personnel . Mice will be transferred to whole -body exposure chambers, see Morgan et al.37 Temperature and airflow are controlled for adequate ventilation and to minimize buildup of animal -generated contaminants. Re-aerosolized nPM or HEPA -filtered air (for the control group) is delivered to the sealed exposure chambers for 5 hrs/day, 3 d/week. In all studies, mice did not lose weight or shown respiratory distress.31, 37, 59 The exposure team consists of graduate PhD students supervised by C Sioutas and TE Morgan. All observations, exposures, surgeries (Project 4), and behavioral assessments are performed in the RRI Vivarium on the University Park Campus. After euthanasia by isoflurane, tissues are distributed to Projects 3 &4. For behavioral and cognitive tests, see Projects 3&4. (iii) Comparability of nPM with other ultrafine PM in literature We compared the cellular effects of ambient ultrafine nanoparticles (nPM) with manufactured titanium dioxide (TiO 2), carbon black, fullerol, and polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs)60. The study used an established phagocytic cell line (RAW 264.7) that is representative of a lung target for NPs. Physicochemical characterization of the tested nanoparticles showed a dramatic change in their state of aggregation, dispersibility, and charge during transfer from a buffered aqueous solution to cell culture medium. Nanoparticles differed with respect to cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and ability to stimulate the production of oxidants under biotic and abiotic conditions. Spontaneous oxidant production was compared by using an oxidizable probe (furfuryl alcohol) as well as an NADPH peroxidase bioelectrode platform. Among the particles tested, ambient nanoparticles (nPM) and cationic PS nanospheres robustly induced cellular oxidant production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage. While increased TNF-r production could be seen to accompany nPM-induced oxidant injury, cationic PS nanospheres induced mitochondrial damage and cell death without inflammation. All considered, ambient nPM and NH2-PS nanoparticles showed the clearest evidence of toxicity and stand apart from the other particle types, even particles capable of spontaneous oxidant production (TiO 2 and fullerol). We therefore rank nPM and NH2-PS nanospheres as the most toxic, with ambient nPM additionally inducing proinflammatory responses.60 Several health studies involving inhalation exposures to PM have used \"standardized\" diesel exhaust PM (DEP) collected in chassis dynamometers, which can capture direct tailpipe emissions in controlled sets of experimental conditions. However, this type of PM collection does not take into account non-tailpipe emissions , which contribute to TRAP61 particularly in light of the significant recent reductions achieved in direct exhaust emissions62, 63. Non-tailpipe emissions are significant sources of several potentially toxic metals including Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn61 and are associated with PM-induced oxidative activity.64-66 Moreover, dynamometer studies do not consider various urban atmospheric processes, such as dilution and photo -chemical transformation, which can alter the physicochemical and oxidative characteristics of the emitted particles.30, 67 Concentrated ambient particle systems36, 40, 52 (CAPS) are very similar to our system, in that both types of aerosols are close to their \"real-world\" form; CAPS offer the advantage of providing the aerosol in real time and its airborne state, but with the disadvantage of substantial diurnal and seasonal changes in its chemical composition during the course of the exposures, which we cannot control, and which might have a significant effect on the progression of the observed health outcomes during the exposure (iv) Anticipated problems . We do not anticipate any problems since we will involve aerosol sampling and characterization methodologies which we have extensively used and published in the past, as noted above. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -002 (249) Page 368 Research Strategy SubCore C3. Brain Responses to TRAP -PM (HJ Forman, co-Director) a. Significance : Goals (i) test individual batches of collected nPM using THP -1 cells for cytokine expression ; and (ii) Western blot assay of brain protein changes to in vivo nPM exposure for Projects 3 & 4. The Finch and Sioutas labs have been performing in vivo and in vitro studies on nPM since 2009. Each batch of collected nPM is characterized for chemical composition and biological activity. The uniformity of the nPM collections is illustrated by the replicable dose responses for TNFa induction in batches from 2010 and 2015 (Fig. 3 of Cheng et al 2016 59). For this P01, Core C3 will test individual nPM collections, using the differentiated THP -1 cell line, as described below. Table 2 lists the proteins for Western assay from Projects 3- 4, chosen by their response in mouse brain to nPM or CCH.

Approach : (i) THP -1 cell responses to compare nPM batches : THP -1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) from American Type Culture Collection are cultured with standard conditions. Prior to measurements, cells (3 x 105 cells/cm2) are differentiated into macrophages by 7.5 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate -13-acetate (PMA) for 2 days, then normal media one day before treatment. The nPM from SubCore C2 is suspended in deionized water at 1 mg/ml and sonicated 2 min -response of TNFand IL-1a, assayed by RT-PCR . (ii) Measurement of brain protein changes to in vivo exposure of mice from Projects 3 & 4. Western blot analysis using multiple infrared (IR)-labeled secondary antibodies for tissue samples from Projects 3 & 4. We will Frozen tissues are homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (~5mg 1-5 mg/mL) with an electric homogenizer; 10-20 g protein per well will be resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE acrylamide gel in Tris-Glycine -SDS Running buffer. Following electrophoresis, proteins are transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with specific primary and secondary antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Beta-tubulin53 is used as loading control to normalize the signal intensity of each band. Averaged values from three independent experiments are used for the final statistical analysis. A SyngenePXi 6 Access Multi -application Gel Imaging System (Syngene, Frederick, MD) is used for Western blot imaging. This system offers IR fluorescence capturing quantification and is more sensitive and accurate with a broader dynamic range compared to the traditional X-ray film method. It enables multiplexed imaging of IR fluorophores and up to 5 different target proteins of different molecular weights can be detected simultaneously on the same blot using available different IR fluorophores dye-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorophores dye- conjugated secondary antibodies are from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) or LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). (iii) Data storage and access . Our ongoing collaboration has established a shared lab website with password protection. All Western blot images are digitized and saved. Initial data on specific bands are stored on Excel spread sheets, which will be accessed by Statistical consultant Prof Wendy Mack through our REDCap data base. (iv) Anticipated problems . Based on five years of in vivo exposures in ten studies, we do not anticipate significant variation in proinflammatory activities of different nPM batches, as measured by THP assay. Western analysis is routine in the Forman lab. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Core -002 (249) Page 369 Vertebrate Animals VERTEBRATE ANIMALS 1. Provide a detailed description of the proposed use of the animals in the work outlined in the Research Strategy section. Identify the species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers of animals to be used in the proposed work. Core C will not handle mice. Core C2 will operate the air pollution exposure equipment to deliver nPM or filtered air through the exposure chambers. Personnel from Project 3 & 4 will be responsible for transferring the mice into the chambers, monitoring them during the exposure period, and returning them to their home cages. The exposure protocol is included in the Vertebrate Animal Sections of Project 3 & 4. Core C3 will obtain tissues from Project 3 & 4. 2. Justifications: Provide justification that the species are appropriate for the proposed research. Explain why the research goals cannot be accomplished using an alternative model (e.g. computational, human, invertebrate, in vitro). In vitro studies or computer/ mathematical models cannot satisfactorily reproduce the white matter/ neuronal injury and functional deficits resulting from nPM/ CCH exposures. Due to cost, ethical concerns, and reproducibility, mice are most appropriate for these studies. We choose mice because of our experience in the models being tested, availability of applicable antibodies/ assays, and potential for future investigations. C57BL/6 mice are the standard murine strain used by most aging researchers and are available through the NIA Aging Mouse Colony. Further, all previous nPM data has been collected using C57BL/6 mice. Altering background strains for the study would likely introduce strain specific differences in exposure responses and outcomes. This variation would increase sample sizes. Male and female mice are selected to study sex influences and comply with recent NIH initiatives to balance sex in animal studies. 3. Minimization of Pain and Distress. Describe the interventions including analgesia, anesthesia, sedation, palliative care and humane endpoints to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury. Discomfort, distress, pain, and injury will be minimized in all phases of the experiment. No pain or distress is expected based on our past nPM exposure studies using the same dose of nPM. Project 3 has detected subtle learning and memory deficits, mild systemic and neuroinflammation which do not appear to affect the well being of the mouse. Project 3 & 4 will monitor behavioral changes, e.g., loss of appetite, grooming and activity. Moribund criteria include one or a combination of the following: >20% weight loss, sustained hunched posture, respiratory difficulty, hypo/hyperthermia, inability of access food/water, inability to ambulate or make normal postural adjustments. Mice will be monitored for any signs of stress or pain as well as general criteria outlined by IACUC (Body Condition Score 2, BC2) and will be euthanized. 4. Euthanasia. After completion of experimental procedures, all rodents will be euthanized by methods approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals.

Contribution to Science As a physician -epidemiologist studying environmental and occupational health factors in disease and disability, my work has focused on addressing problems at the nexus of epidemiology, environmental health sciences, toxicology, and clinical medicine. Leveraging advances in each of these disciplines, and conducting multi -investigator collaborations which include state -of-the-art quantitative methods, is common to each area. 1. Exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with chronic diseases . Our epidemiological work has focused on well-conducted studies with good control of potential confounding factors and excellent outcome assessment. We approach our work with equipoise and have observed and published both null and positive findings. Our findings are most compelling and show more consistent effects for studies of long-term exposure than for short -term exposures. a.

Personal Statement My research interests focus on statistical methods for understanding the health effects of environmental and occupational exposures; they include study design, measurement error, exposure modeling and estimation, and estimation of environmental exposure effects with application to a wide range of health outcomes. The current proposal, which is focused on air pollution exposure and risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, is strongly related to several projects in my past and current portfolio. I am co -PI of the study Air Pollution, the Aging Brain and Alzheimer's Disease. Early in my career I worked on Alzheimer's disease research reflected in 3 citations below. As a biostatistician jointly appointed in two departments, I actively collaborate with many different principal investigators on multiple projects in the environmental and occupational health sciences. I have over 145 peer-reviewed publications; most pertain to statistics in the environmental and occupational health sciences. These include biostatistical methods papers (see Section C), numerous publications from the Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) study (including a May 2016 paper in The Lancet showing the relationship between air pollution exposure and increased pr ogression of subclinical cardiovascular disease), and a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine estimating the risk in post- menopausal women of long-term air pollution exposure on cardiovascular disease incidence from the Women's Health Initiative cohort. In addition, I have extensive training and mentoring experience. In my role as Assistant Chair I actively support the development of our junior faculty. I direct a training grant to advance quantitative training in the environmental health sciences, BEBTEH (Biostatistics, Epidemiologic and Bioinformatic Training in Environmental Health) and an undergraduate research experience program to enhance diversity in the environmental health sciences, SURE -EH (Supporting Undergraduate Research Experience in Environmental Health). I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, a member of the HEI Review Committee, and a member of the Editorial Board of Epidemiology. I am one of seven statutory Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) members, I have served on various CASAC Special Panels, I have served on two of EPA's Scientific Advisory Board Panels: Ethylene Oxide, and Toxicological Review of Libby Amphibole Asbestos, and I am currently serving on the EPA FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel evaluating the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate. 1.

Contributions to Science Statistical Methods 1. Early in my career I collaborated with Ross Prentice to develop statistical methods for aggregate data studies. These studies are a substantial improvement upon ecological studies focused on the association between an exposure such as dietary intake and a health outcome such as breast cancer. They give better estimates of the health effect parameter targeted in individual -level studies while using a group -level study design and analysis coupled with some limited sampling of exposure data from individuals. a.

Together with Adam Szpiro and other colleagues we have made important contributions on developing measurement error correction methods for inference about health effects for application to air pollution cohort studies. This work has fundamentally changed the perspective on measurement error. In these studies pollution is modeled using a statistical model. The measurement error induced has classical -like and Berkson - like components. These advances are critical to appropriate inference about air pollution health effects. a.

Project -001 (987) Page 411 Project Summary/Abstract Project -1 is designed to investigate the contribution of traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) to the risk, susceptibility and mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) in a nationwide cohort of women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Memory Studies (WHIMS). ADRD affects more women than men, and increasing evidence indicates different risk factors by sex, pointing to the need to identify modifiable environmental factors separately for women and men. In the last two decades, compelling data have shown that exposure to outdoor air pollutants including TRAP is a novel environmental determinant of brain aging. Despite the strong evidence for TRAP -induced neurotoxicity (e.g., increased A deposit shown in Project -3), human data on whether and how TRAP exposure effects brain aging remain limited and inconsistent. Previous studies had notable limitations: (1) lacking prospective evidence for an increased ADRD risk associated with TRAP; (2) not based on our current understanding of early cognitive change, biomarkers, and neurobiological classification of AD; (3) not studying AD risk resulting from TRAP effects before late life (e.g., aged < 55); and (4) providing limited insight on the brain structure and neuropathology linking TRAP to early cognitive deficits or an increased risk of AD. To address these knowledge gaps cost-efficiently, Project -1 builds on two well-characterized and geographically -diverse cohorts of mid-aged and older women in the WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS -Y; n=1346, inception age 50-54) and WHIMS -MRI (n=1403, inception age 65-80) followed annually since 1996, both with comparable longitudinal assessments on episodic memory and executive function. We further capitalize an NIEHS -funded R01 in WHIMS which employs sophisticated air pollution models developed by the MESA -Air (\"Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution\" ) to estimate TRAP (NO 2; PM 2.5; exposure sources/components). Supported by the Core B1, we take the novel population neuroimaging approach to studying pathological brain aging in communities, drawing on both clinical and neuropathological classification of AD defined in very well-characterized samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with biomarkers of -amyloid and neuronal injuries. State -of-the- art mediation and neurocomputational analyses will be conducted to examine the TRAP -affected brain structures and neuropathological pathways underlying the early cognitive deficits or MRI biomarkers of increased AD risk. Aim 1 will determine the impact of TRAP on early biomarkers predictive of increased risks for AD, mild cognitive impairment, and preclinical AD in older women. Aim 2 will examine the associations of cognitive decline reflecting early AD with TRAP exposure before/during late life. In Aim 3, we will take both targeted and agnostic approached with high-dimensional neurocomputation to elucidate the brain structure and neuropathology mediating the TRAP effects on pathological brain aging. Aim 4 will evaluate whether APOE4 and vascular brain injuries increase the susceptibility to the neurotoxic effects of TRAP exposure. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 412 Facilities & Other Resources FACILITIES AND OTHER RESOURCES OVERVIEW: Project -1 aims to: (1) determine the impact of traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP) on early biomarkers predictive of increased risks for AD, MCI, and preclinical AD in older women; (2) examine the associations of cognitive decline (episodic memory; executive functions) reflecting early AD with TRAP exposure before/during late life; (3) elucidate the brain structure and neuropathology mediating the TRAP effects on pathological brain aging, using both targeted and agnostic approached with high-dimensional neurocomputation; and (4) evaluate the contribution of APOE4 and vascular brain injuries to the individual susceptibility to neurotoxic effects of TRAP exposure from 1990 -2016. To address these aims in a cost-efficient manner, Project -1 is designed as part of an ancillary study to Women's Health Initiative (WHI AS252, \"Environmental Determinants of Cognitive Aging in the WHI Memory Study\" ), which had been approved by the WHI Ancillary Studies Committee and the NHLBI WHI Project Office (see the Letters of Support and Approval). The operation of AS252 was supported by a 4-year (2011 -2015) NIA-funded study (R01AG033078; PI: Chen), which helped create a custom -made epidemiologic dataset combining comprehensive and longitudinal WHI clinical and longitudinal covariates database with the multi -dimensional/multi -sourced dementia and neurocognitive outcome data from WHIMS Suite of Studies before 2010. Specifically, Project -1 is built on a well-characterized, geographically -diverse cohort of mid-aged and older women in the WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS -Y; n=1326, inception age 50- 54) and WHIMS -MRI (n=1403, inception age 65-80) followed annually since 1996, both with comparable longitudinal assessments of neuropsychological functions. Since 2010, two NIA-funded epidemiologic studies on cognitive aging in older and younger postmenopausal women in WHI have been funded. The proposed Project -1 will therefor e draw additional longitudinal neuropsychological data on episodic memory and executive functions collected during the concurrent follow -up of WHIMS -ECHO and WHIMS -Y cohorts that were not available to the NIA R01. The scientific activities described in the subcontract at WFU will be coordinated within the WHI Southeast Regional Network, headed by the WHIMS PIs/senior investigators at WFU, which was the WHIMS Clinical Coordination Center (WHIMS) based at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine. Dr. Espeland is Co-PIs of the WHIMS, the WHI Study on Cognitive Aging, and the WHIMS -MRI. The subcontract at the Wake Forest University Health Sciences (which served as the WHIMS+WHIMS -Y Coordination Center) supports the continuing collaboration between USC team and Dr. Mark Espeland to ensure the research team will have the maximum benefit of the ongoing WHI/WHIMS data resources and information. 1. University of Southern California A. Keck School of Medicine, Department of Preventive Medicine, Division of Environmental Health The Department of Preventive Medicine has been one of the leading academic departments of preventive medicine and public health sciences for more than three decades. Ranked as the top academic department in preventive medicine with the largest NIH -sponsored researches, the department is home to worldwide authorities on chronic disease epidemiology (including cancer and cardiovascular disease), biostatistics, environmental medicine, health behavior, and prevention, detection, and treatment methods. The Division of Environmental Health (EH) is home to two federally funded regional research centers, including the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center (SCEHSC) and the Children's Environmental Health Center. The EH division is the operational house of the Children's Health Study, which is one of the most comprehensive cohort studies on the long-term health effects of air pollution among more than 15,000 school - aged children across 12 different communities in Southern California. Division faculty members have the scientific expertise in studying air pollution health effects in children. To support large -scale air pollution epidemiologic studies, the Division includes experienced staff scientists with the research capacities to conduct complex spatial epidemiologic analyses and monitor levels of the major components of smog \u2014ozone gas, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and acid vapors \u2014in population -based cohorts. The active research programs within the EH Division are almost entirely supported by extramural funds with approximately ten million dollars per year. Detailed description of the Dept. of Preventive Medicine and the EH Division can be found at: https://pm.usc.edu/about.php?page_id=Mission https://pm.usc.edu/research.php?page_id=Environmental_Healt h_Research https://scehsc.usc.edu/ Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 413 Facilities & Other Resources Intellectual Environment The EH Division offers an excellent intellectual environment fostering innovative research in environmental epidemiology research and air pollution health effects sciences. EH Division faculty members study chronic health effects associated with environmental exposures, and many scientific products of their scholarly work have appeared in high-impact journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine , the Lancet , and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Of its 10 primary faculty members, two had served in the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and one had served in the National Advisory Environmental Health Sciences Council. Dr. JC Chen has been co-leading the USC AirPollBrain (APB) Network, a product of the program development project entitled \"Brain Health during Development and Aging in Urban Environments\" (co-PIs\" Finch and Chen) funded by the USC Collaboration Fund (https://research.usc.edu/collaboration -fund-current -projects/ ) since 2010. This program brings together a network of USC faculty from Gerontology, the Viterbi School of Engineering, the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Keck School of Medicine, School of Pharmacy, and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to better understand the scientific basis for the impacts of pollution on the brain, and to explore the health consequences. This program aims to promote the optimal neurodevelopment in humans and healthy brain aging by better understanding environmental effects of urban air pollution and gene environment interactions. Bimonthly meetings convene faculty and trainees on specific topics with a focus on developing new research projects and consortia. As of March 2016, the AirPollBrain has helped USC faculty obtained over $10 millions of NIH funding to support the continuing development of research and education programs in environmental neurosciences studying ambient air pollution and neurodevelopment/brain aging. The research program described in this application draws upon the expertise of faculty and staff scientists in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California and collaborating researchers from the NIEHS -sponsored Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center (SCEHSC). The Division of Environmental Health is home to two federally funded regional research centers, including the SCEHSC and the Children's Environmental Health Center. The NIH-funded SCEHSC is a multi-university consortium of over 60 leading researchers across the region. The SCEHSC has several research initiatives, including \"Air Pollution, Neurodevelopment and Neurological Diseases,\" led by Dr. JC Chen (the HSC PI). The major goal of the initiatives has been to incubate new programs of EHS research by providing infrastructure and support to grow new research into mature programs supported by investigator -initiated grants, program projects and new centers. Laboratories and Facilities The project PI is a core member of the SCEHSC, which includes the Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) and the Biostatistics Facility Core (BFC). The research team will thus benefit from consultation and technical support in areas needed for exposure assessment of air pollution including aerosol science, environmental chemistry, and geospatial modeling. Facilities involved in the performance of the proposed research include offices and laboratories, in particular, the BFC and GIS Research Laboratory, which is part of the IHSFC resources of the SCEHSC. (1) GIS Research Laboratory The GIS Research Laboratory is a university - and project -supported laboratory with a number of impressive software and hardware resources. It has its own server room with an IBM Blade Center System H Chassis, HS20 Blade Servers, Xiotech Storage Area Network, Cisco MDS 9000 Fiber Channel Switches, and Quantum PX-502 Tape Library. The servers are located behind a Sonicwall Pro 5060 firewall with stateful and deep packet inspection, potentially analyzing packets all the way up to the application level. Applications requiring high-performance are attached to high-speed fiber-channel drives, 15k RPM, RAID 10.

(2) Biostatistics Facility Core of SCEHSC The Biostatistics Facility Core (BFC) provides statistical support for planned and ongoing research projects by Center investigators. Core members assist in the development of research protocols from Center investigator who are requesting research grants or extramural support. This entails deciding on study design, calculating sample size or power, and reviewing proposed statistical methods. Core members also provide an interface between Center investigators and statistical resources by matching statisticians to investigators so that, to the maximum extent possible, Center projects will benefit from statisticians with particular expertise in the areas under investigation. Additionally, Core members stimulate collaboration between statisticians and other investigators by providing a focal point for statisticians to discuss issues with investigators from all the research cores. The Core also maintains a fast multi -processor computer that is accessible directly or through the campus network by all Center investigators. This resource provides a central repository for data, facilitates file sharing among Center investigators, and supports many commonly used software packages. The Core also assists Center member in the use of USC's High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC), a university wide resource that provides thousands of processors for high-volume computing requirements. In addition to research support, the Core includes an educational component. This involves increasing the understanding of statistical issues among Center investigators through formal and informal consult ations, broadening the awareness by statisticians of the many applications of statistical theory to environmental health problems, and enhancing graduate programs in biostatistics and epidemiology by providing a mechanism to assign graduate students to research problems in environmental health on which they can work under supervision. Core members are also very active in working with the Center Outreach and Education Core to make presentations and to disseminate research results.

Scientific Resources from the Women's Health Initiative Overview The proposed application is an extension of the WHI ancillary study#252 (AS252), entitled \"Environmental Determinants of Cognitive Aging in the WHI Memory Study. \" (PI: Chen). Dr. Espeland at the Wake Forest University (WFU) School of Medicine is the Co-PI of WHI AS.252 which was designed to investigate the later- life environmental influence on cognitive aging. The research administration of WHI has been restructured, with its original 39 field centers reduced to several regional networks, each with specific Scientific Interest Groups (SIGs) to lead and coordinate the collective scientific efforts nationwide. One of the new scientific networks is the WHI Southeast Regional Network (WHI -SERN), headed by the WFU. The WHI-SERN is committed to supporting research projects related to the environment (\"Environmental SIG\") and cognition (\"Aging SIG\"). Functions of SIG include, stimulating scientific exchange, encouraging productive collaboration within specific topic areas, advancing science by developing innovative scientific papers and ancillary studies, providing opportunities to engage current and new scientists to WHI, and coordinating activities in an area of mutual scientific interest. The proposed research is aligned with the SIGs of the WHI-SERN. As the co-PI of the WHI SERN, Dr. Espeland will continue his close collaboration with Dr. Chen and his USC research team to access the data from the WHIMS Suite of Studies and WHIMS -Y, as well as other elated data resources available to this application. Multi -disciplinary Research Management Coordination of all the proposed scientific activities requires multi-center management, data analyses, and multi -disciplinary communication. Drs. Chen, Espeland & He have had extensive experiences in collaborating with multi-disciplinary invest igators from institutes based in different geographic regions. Several successful telecommunication tools used in both previous and ongoing projects, such as teleconferencing, videoconferencing, email correspondence, and web-based blogs, will be adapted in the proposed project. Verbal communication between the project PIs with other investigators, either by teleconference or videoconference, will take place on a bi-weekly basis. The investigators from the USC will post pertinent information, presentations, and data analysis to an internal project blog, and coordinate with the subcontract PIs to update the respective progress in the bi-weekly meetings and monthly work -in-progress meetings. WHI Biological and Other Extant Data Resources The WHI Biological Da ta and other (dietary/nutrition/psychosocial factors) extant data resources offer this application the great potential to pursue mechanistic studies/interactions.

Project -001 (987) INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT -1 To investigate the contribution of TRAP to the risk, susceptibility and mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) in women, Project -1 builds on two well-characterized, geographically -diverse, prospective cohorts of mid-aged and older women in the WHIMS of Younger Women and WHIMS -MRI, both followed for 20 years. These resources were regarded as \"a great strength \" of the overall PPG. A wide appreciation was given to our outstanding research team (e.g., PL recognized as \"a leader in this area\" plus \"other renowned investigators and collaborators \") and excellent institutional environments. The panel highlighted \"many important strengths \", such as the \"outcome data very comprehensive...includes longitudinal...MRIs, \" using \"spatiotemporal modeling will reduce exposure misclassification ,\" \"sophisticated analyses, including causal inference testing methods ,\" and \"excellent integration between study components .\" Reviewers also noted some minor weaknesses and possible points of confusions, as parsed below in italic and followed by brief summaries of our responses (detailed in Section#). Accordingly, the Sections with submitted changes in texts (Georgia font) are labeled as [revised ], [new] or otherwise left unchanged in the A1 proposal . Significance : Reviewers' critiques included (Rev#1) \"air pollution steadily declining across US cities\" and (Rev#2) \"public health relevance of evaluating historical exposures; ...a challenge to detect significant effects (of low levels) \" Retrospective studies like Project -1 provide the critical human data needed for rigorous ex post analyses to reaffirm the effectiveness of existing regulatory policies or justify stronger programs for future actions.1 Despite the overall trend2 of decreasing PM 2.5 (which substantially increased the dementia risk in older women3), on- road vehicles have contributed to an increasing proportion of PM emissions,4 and yet whether/how TRAP exposures affect the brain health of urban -dwelling aging Americans remain unclear (section A1). Using the lower levels of exposure estimates (3y average PM 2.5 before 2005 -6), our preliminary analyses (C9.3) showed the promise of high-dimensional neurocomputational approach. The adverse PM 2.5 effect on WM remained with PM 2.5 <12\u00b5g/m3 (C9.3 ) We also estimated that the statistical powers are sufficient (C10). (Rev#1) on cohort representativeness: The biracial distribution (Blacks and Whites) in WHIMS was comparable to the US older women in 1990s (C12.1 ) Outcome Data: \"shifts in some measurement approaches\" \"power issues related to the analysis of AD and MCI data\" Reviewers likely referred to the shift from in-person to telephone -based cognitive testing across subcohorts in 2008 -9 (e.g., WHISCA WHIMS -ECHO; Table C4.2). These phone -based assessments had great reliability and test validity,5 and such approaches substantially increased enrollment/retention/data completeness and reduced potential biases.6 To account for the variation in outcome measure, our statistical analyses will include an additional covariate indicating the different testing approach and subcohort (C8.2). We delete the WHIMS AD/MCI data that were included in A0 proposal (Aim -1b) to test predictive validity of ADNI -derived risk scores. To avoid further confusion, this validation substudy is only described in Core B1. TRAP Exposures: \"how time-varying exposure(s)...be \"unknown exposure contrasts and trends\" and\"how...exposure...windows be selected\" The prospective design (C5) allowed us to account for time-varying exposure levels due to relocation since enrollment, and we could estimate the residence -specific exposures (weighted by the duration at each location) already used in the published work.3, 7, 8 See examples of exposure contrasts and trends in Core C1. Our analyses plans will include both long-term (cumulative) and intermediate -term (e.g., 1- to 3-year moving averages) exposures preceding the outcome measures \"heterogeneity of exposures...not other microenvironments... [and] TRAP in 1990s or before\" \"IMPROVE and other... networks do not emphasize traffic sites.\" Standard MESA -AIR models follow a \"regionalized\" framework combining temporal basis functions with spatially -varying coefficients and spatiotemporal residuals9 (see Core C1 which the PL directs). This approach captures both regional - and local-scale exposure variability. For this application, we will use the downscaled spatiotemporal model to estimate monthly NO 2 (gaseous surrogate of TRAP) concentrations in 1990 -2016. We further noted the limitations to characterize nPM and estimate pre-1999 PM 2.5 from traffic (C12.1 ). The P01 is focused on ambient exposure from traffic. Exposures from other \"microenvironments\" are unlikely to confound the observed associations (C12.1). (Rev#2) other questions at the zip-code level\" and \"statistical power and interpretations in the event of null findings.\" Time -varying confounding was considered in the listed covariates (C8.2) and statistical analyses (C9). We will conduct sensitivity analyses excluding addresses geocoded at the zip-code levels (C5). The estimated statistical powers are sufficient (C10). Since Project -1 is built on a population context found with neurotoxic effects of PM 2.5,3, 7, 8 even null findings with TRAP may point to the importance of other PM sources. (Rev#3) \"mixed results of some prior and similar investigations\" The same conclusion was given in our review on PM and vascular brain injuries, and we also identified two major limitations to be addressed by Project -1 (A2). Scope of Work/Budget : Need to clarify \"Roles of team members\" \"potential overlap with ongoing projects at USC\" Beyond the Personal Statement, the expected role/contribution was noted in the Budget Justification, which also tabulated the comparison of Project -1 (2017 -22) vs. other R01s (completed 2011 -15; new 2016 -2021). Introduction to Application Page 471 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) 2. Specific Aims [revised ] Growing evidence supports that outdoor air pollution is a novel environmental determinant of brain aging.10-12 In the last two decades, compelling experimental data have documented significant neurotoxicity of ambient air pollutants,13-16 including traffic -related air pollution (TRAP)17-23 in urban environments. Although lagging behind neurotoxicological data, recent epidemiologic studies began to show that individuals living in places with higher levels of regional air pollutants (including PM 2.5: particulate matter <2.5\u00b5m; 24-26 and O3 26, 27) had cognitive deficits or accelerated cognitive decline.28-30 Since 2014, six studies 3, 31 -35 reported an increased risk for dementia associated with exposures to regional air pollutants. For instance, in our NIA -funded study (R01AG033078), high regional PM 2.5 increased the ADRD risk in a nationwide cohort of older women (aged >65) from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) .3 Despite the strong evidence for TRAP - induced neurotoxicity in animal models18-23 (e.g., Project -3 showed A deposit with TRAP), human data on whether and how TRAP exposure affects the aging brain remain limited and inconsistent. Project -1 will extend the NIA-funded R01 to further address several notable knowledge gaps in the current literature on air pollution -neuroepidemiology of pathological brain aging. (1) We lacked convincing prospective cohort data showing ADRD risks increase with individual -level TRAP exposure. The extant evidence from three published studies was inconclusive, because of the limitations to their exposure characterization that was based on measuring the proximity to major roadways,35 relying on aggregated exposure estimates31 prone to ecological biases, or modeling the TRAP exposure after or shortly before dementia ascertainment.36 (2) We did not know whether such neurotoxic effects start before late-life (e.g., aged <60). (3) No studies examined the putative exposure effects on early biomarkers or neurobiological classification of AD.37-39 All published studies relied on claims data31-33 (which have questionable validity 40) or used clinical criteria41 to define dementia.34, 36 (4) No studies assessed TRAP effects on early cognitive changes predictive of AD. (5) Very few neuroimaging studies elucidated the neuropathology underlying the neurotoxic effects of TRAP on aging brain. Project -1 builds on two well-characterized and geographically -diverse cohorts of mid-aged and older women in the WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS -Y; n=1346, inception age 50-54) and WHIMS -MRI (n=1403, inception age 65-80) followed annually since 1996, both with comparable longitudinal assessments on episodic memory and executive function. We further capitalize one NIEHS -funded R01 which employs sophisticated models developed by the MESA -Air (\"Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution\") team to estimate residential TRAP exposure (NO 2; PM 2.5; sources/components). We take the novel population neuroimaging approach to studying pathological brain aging in communities, drawing on both clinical and neuropathological classification of AD defined in well-characterized samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with biomarkers of A and neuronal injuries, plus the Core B-developed tools to predict early risks for AD (overall and neuropathological categories), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and preclinical AD, based on structural MRI (sMRI) matrices of harmonized measures of grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and WM hyperintensities (WMH). State -of-the-art mediation and computational analyses will be conducted to examine the TRAP -affected brain structures/neuropathological pathways underlying the early cognitive deficits. (AIM 1) To assess the TRAP effects on early biomarkers of AD/MCI /preclinical AD risk in older women The associations between TRAP and sMRI biomarkers of predicted risks for AD/MCI/preclinical AD in WHIMS - MRI will be investigated in multicovariate -adjusted regression models. In WHIMS -MRI cohort, we hypothesize that TRAP exposures increase the risk scores for clinically - and neuropathological biomarkers -defined MCI/AD . (AIM 2) To examine the associations of cognitive decline of early AD with TRAP before/during late life We will employ the latent curve modeling to test the hypothesis that TRAP adversely influences the decline in episodic memory and executive function, starting with exposures estimated during middle age (aged 50-54 in WHIMS -Y) and continuing into later life (in WHIMS -Y+ WHIMS -MRI). (AIM 3) To elucidate the brain structure and neuropathology mediating the TRAP effects on brain aging (Aim 3a) Using structural equation models, we will examine whether the putative adverse effects (Aims 1&2) are mediated through reduced brain surfaces/volumes of GM/WM in vulnerable areas (medial temporal lobe; complex) or by increasing WM (Aim 3b) We will perform agnostic computations in high-dimensional space to identify neuroanatomic structures mediating TRAP neurotoxicity. (AIM 4) To assess the biological susceptibility to neurotoxicity of TRAP exposure We will examine whether the adverse TRAP effects are stronger in women with APOE4 or greater WMH. Bringing together experienced USC investigators and collaborating scientists with complementary expertise, Project -1 will greatly advance our understanding of the role of TRAP in contributing to early AD risk, biological susceptibility and mechanisms of AD in late life. Specific Aims Page 472 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 473 Research Strategy 3. Research Strategy A. Significance Project -1 is designed to investigate the contribution of traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) to the risk, susceptibility and mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) in a nationwide cohort of women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Memory Studies (WHIMS). AD is the most common form of pathological brain aging affecting elderly. In 2017, one in 10 Americans over age 65 is living with AD. Of these more than 5.5 million people with AD in the US, two -thirds are women. Epidemiologic data indicate that women are 2 -3 times as likely as men to be affected by AD over the lifetime,42-44 and neurobiological experiments also support this differential risk by sex.45 There is increasing evidence for different risk factors by sex and gender46-48 not simply attributed to the higher longevity of women versus men.45 Concerning the increasing ADRD burden as an important women's health issue, many have called for research on identifying environmental risk factors.42, 49 However, scientific evidence linking environments with ADRD risks remains elusive,50 and there is a very short list of candidates that are modifiable during late life. A1. Ambient Air Pollution - a Novel Environmental Determinant of Brain Aging [revised ] Growing evidence supports the emerging concept that exposures to ambient air pollutants are a novel environmental determinant of brain aging.12 In animals with in vivo exposures to ozone or particulate matter (PM), numerous neurotoxicological experiments have shown oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and other neurotoxic reactions in multiple brain regions.51-53 Post-mortem data suggest that poor air quality might accelerate brain aging (e.g., -amyloid accumulation) in mice18, 54, 55 and humans,56 and result in possible neurodegeneration (e.g., neuro -fibrillary tangles) in canines.57, 58 As a result, there is an increasing concern about the potential impact of ambient air pollution on human brain aging.59 In the last few years, cross - sectional studies reported relatively low performance in various tests of cognitive functions among adults and older people residing in places with higher levels of ambient air pollutants (including fine PM [PM 2.5] 24-26 and ozone26, 27) or in proximity to major roadways.60, 61 Adverse PM effects on cognitive declines were also shown in most longitudinal studies.28-30, 62 Seven studies 3, 31-36 had examined neurodegenerative effects of ambient air pollution, all pointing to a possible increase in ADRD risk. However, there were great uncertainties with these reported associations, due to their methodological limitations. Four studies31-33, 35 used claims data to determine incident dementia/AD, an approach with questionable validity.40 Four studies31-34 were of retrospectiv e design, which was subject to selection biases.63 Of the three studies examining TRAP, methodological limitations to their exposure characterization were evident. One study only measured the proximity to major roadways,35 the second study relied on aggregated exposure estimates31 prone to ecological biases, or the third study using a spatial model towards the end of study follow -up to estimate the NO x exposure in earlier years,36 which obscured the temporality of the reported association. Supported by the NIA R01 (AG033078), we conducted the first US-based prospective cohort study linking individual -level air pollution exposure estimates with increased ADRD risk ascertained by validated protocols. We found that regional PM 2.5 exposure increased the risk for all-cause dementia a nationwide cohort of older women from WHIMS. 3 Our preliminary data (section C9.1 ) also showed that high PM 2.5 exposure (exceeding the US EPA standard of 3-year average >12 \u00b5g/m3) in 1999 -2010 increased the clinical AD risk by 71%. Despite the growing epidemiologic evidence for the association between ambient air pollution and pathological brain aging, we identified several notable limitations to these published studies. First, there were no convincing prospective cohort data showing ADRD risks increase with individual -level TRAP exposure during the biologically -relevant period, despite the strong evidence for neurotoxicity of TRAP in animal models 18-23 (e.g., increased A deposit shown in Project -3). Second, previous studied failed to provide any insights for air pollution exposure effects on earlier biomarkers or neurobiological classification of AD.37-39 All published studies relied on claims data31-33 (which have questionable validity 40) or used clinical criteria (e.g., the DSM - IV41) to define dementia.34, 36 Third, no studies had examined TRAP effects on early cognitive changes predictive of AD. Of the five published longitudinal studies on ambient air pollution and cognitive decline,3, 28-30, 62, 64 only one included TRAP exposure data with non-significant associations.29 Fourth, previously studies included mostly older adults, with no data on whether/how TRAP before late life (e.g., aged < 55) affects AD risk. Project -1 will address these limitations, and the expected results will elucidate whether and how TRAP exposure affects the early biomarkers of AD and neuropsychological processes predisposing the affected individuals to increased risks for preclinical AD, MCI and AD, according to our current knowledge of the pathogenesis and clinical/neurobiological classification of AD. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 474 Research Strategy A2. Mechanistic Mediators Linking Air Pollution Exposures with Pathological Brain Aging [revised ] Only limited epidemiologic data are available to inform the mechanistic mediators underlying the neurotoxic effects of ambient air pollutants on brain aging. No previous studies had conducted mediation analyses linking brain atrophy or vascular brain injuries (VBI) with cognitive deficits predictive of AD. For this application (Aim 3a), we hypothesize that the adverse effects of TRAP on cognitive impairment are mediated through multiple pathways, including structural neurotoxicity to the medial temporal lobe and system and increased VBI. The temporal lobe -memory system 65 and the frontostriatal -executive system 66 are two vulnerable neural networks affected in both brain aging and neurodegenerative disease.67 The neurotoxic effects of air pollutants on these vulnerable neural systems had not been examined using longitudinal MRI data. Cortical thickness represents a better morphometric phenotype ,68 which so far had not been examined in the limited literature on air pollution and brain aging. The existing WHIMS -MRI protocols were based on volumetric measures, and did not allow fine-scale GM and WM segmentation in the medial temporal lobe and frontostriatal systems, which will be provided to Project -1 through the Neuroimaging Data Support Core B1. We and others had conducted ROI-based analyses,7, 8, 69 but found little evidence that PM 2.5 in late life exposure was associated with hippocampal volume in the elderly. These null findings should be better interpreted with the understanding of exposure characteristics and population context of the studied cohorts.7, 8 Because both studies relied on air pollution exposure models for PM 2.5 estimation after 1999, we cannot exclude the possibility that reduced hippocampal volume might be associated with higher exposures in 1990s or in older adults exposed TRAP, which will be investigated in Project -1. In the WHIMS -MRI cohort, we also discovered the novel association between PM 2.5 and small brain volume specifically in normal -appearing WM (of frontal and temporal lobes).7, 8 This novel neurotoxicity on WM was recently substantiated in experimental models exposed to small particles from regional background70 or TRAP.71 Using the voxel -based morphometry method,72 we further showed the associations between PM 2.5 exposure and patterns of smaller GM volumes primarily in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, regions associated with higher cognitive function such as working memory, episodic memory retrieval, and executive function. This observed adverse effect of PM 2.5 on smaller GM volumes was consistent with particle -induced synaptic neurotoxicity with decreased neurites in both wildtype23 or EFAD mice 3exposed to TRAP. The hypothesized VBI underlying air pollution -brain aging is receiving great attention,59 as extensive literature has documented that ambient air pollutants increase the risks of coronary heart disease and stroke 73-75 and elevate blood pressure,76-78 all contributing to cognitive decline and increased dementia risk.79-85 However, previous studies that examined VBI associated with PM exposures had yielded mixed results.8, 69, 86-89 One earlier small study in Boston showed that PM 2.5 was associated with diminished cerebral blood flow of the elderly.86 Two studies reported inconsistent associations between PM exposure and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) vs. silent cerebral infarcts.90, 91 In the WHIMS -MRI cohort, we also found regional PM 2.5 exposure was not associated with the volume of small -vessel -ischemic -disease in older women.8 Although several large cohort studies pointed to the role of TRAP in increased stroke risk and mortality,75, 92, 93 the effect of TRAP on VBI remained unclear . Importantly, none of these previous studies examined the putative adverse TRAP effects on VBI using longitudinal MRI data and their assessment was limited to the global measures of VBI disregarding the possibly different neuropathological correlates of WMHs present in periventricular space and deep subcortical area. These limitation s will be addressed in Project -1. A3. Biological Susceptibility to Neurotoxicity of TRAP Exposure [revised ] APOE is the most important known genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, with the APOE4 allele conferring dramatically increased risk in a dose -dependent manner and more profound impact on women.94 Although it was suggested that studying environmental factors should account for APOE,95 recent studies (including our new publication3) suggest air pollution on brain aging was not confounded by APOE.34, 36, 96 APOE4 status imparts an increased AD risk by both A-dependent97-99 and A-independent mechanisms (e.g., altered cholesterol metabolism; mitochondrial dysfunction; blood -brain barrier breakdown)100-102 that are all relevant to the reported toxic effects of exposure to airborne particles, supporting the hypothesized interaction with TRAP. For regional PM 2.5, we also observed much stronger adverse effects on clinically significant cognitive decline and increased dementia risk among older women with APOE4 .3 Cerebrovascular injuries may promote the exposure -induced neurodegeneration (Overall Program; Fig.1). Under this framework, we posit that adverse TRAP effects stronger in women with greater WM hyperintensities. This hypothesis was supported by our previous observation of greater WM loss associated with PM 2.5 among older women with cardiovascular disease (including stroke).8 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 475 Research Strategy B. Innovation The following features make this an innovative application for studying environmental risk for dementia/AD. (1) The proposed Aim 1 likely represents the first major attempt to assess the impact of TRAP on AD risk, susceptibility and mechanism, by drawing on state -of-the-sciences to better understand the pathogenesis and clinical/neurobiological categories of AD associated with air pollution exposure in women. (2) The design of Project -1 is highly cost-efficient, as it expands the use of several NIA-funded cohorts with comprehensive outcome data (annual neuropsychological assessments; longitudinal sMRI data; well- validated clinical ascertainment AD) and further leverages one NIEHS -funded R01 which employs state -of-the-art spatiotemporal modeling to assess TRAP exposure in WHIMS. (3) Project -1 benefits from the population neuroimaging approach taken by the Neuroimaging Data Support subcore (Core B1). This approach integrates the new knowledge from clinical neurosciences to better characterize the AD phenotype classification in community -based epidemiologic studies. Using the ADNI database provides us a sensitive, empirically derived, continuous measures of early biomarker for AD risk based on a well-characterized brain imaging database of cognitively normal subjects and AD patients. (4) Because of increased vulnerability during the postmenopausal period,103, 104 the WHIMS -Y cohort (Aim 2) offers a unique opportunity to investigate/compare the exposure effects before and during late life. (5) The proposed Aim 3 analyses for mechanistic mediation involving complex brain structures are innovative. The novel application (Aim 3a) of structural equation models (SEMs) offers several analytical advantages (e.g., accounting for measurement errors in characterizing latent biological intermediates/phenotypes; accommodating parsimonious models for multivariate outcome variables) to draw causal inference in ways not readily attainable by using conventional regression models.105 The high-dimensional mediation analyses (Aim 3b) coupled with causal inference testing methods offer a powerful approach to systematically and agnostically examining the specific brain structures mediating the TRAP neurotoxicity on brain aging. C. Approaches C1. Overview: This application aims to: (1) determine the impact of TRAP on early biomarkers predictive of increased risks for AD, MCI, and preclinical AD in older women; (2) examine the associations of cognitive decline reflecting early AD with TRAP exposure before/during late life; (3) elucidate the brain structure and neuropathology mediating the TRAP effects on pathological brain aging, using both targeted and agnostic approached with high-dimensional neurocomputation; and (4) evaluate the contribution of APOE4 and vascular brain injuries to the individual susceptibility to neurotoxic effects of TRAP exposure from 1990 -2016. To address these aims in a cost-efficient manner, Project -1 is built on a well-characterized, geographically -diverse cohort of mid-aged and older women in the WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS -Y; n=1346, inception age 50- 54) and WHIMS -MRI (n=1403, inception age 65-80) followed annually since 1996, both with comparable longitudinal assessments of neuropsychological functions. This project further leverages the NIEHS -funded ancillary study to WHI (R01ES025888; PIs: Chen & Kaufman) which employ the sophisticated spatiotemporal models developed by the MESA -Air (\"Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution\" ) team to estimate residential exposure to TRAP (NO 2; PM 2.5; sources/components). We capitalize the data support from Neuroimaging Core B, which takes the novel population neuroimaging approach to studying pathological brain aging in communities, drawing on the clinical and neuropathological classification of AD defined in well- characterized samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with biomarkers of A and neuronal injuries. Given the structural MRI (sMRI) matrices developed by Core B, we will examine whethwe TRAP exposure is associated with these biomarkers for increased early risks of AD (overall and neuropathological categories), MCI (overall and neuropathological categories), and preclinical AD in WHIMS - MRI, using multivariable -adjusted linear regression models (Aim 1), accounting for differential drop-out. Project -1 will provide the WHIMS data on incident MCI/ADRD (>180 cases in WHIMS -MRI by 2016, centrally - adjudicated) for the Core B1 team to prospectively evaluate the performance of ADNI -derived risk scores in predicting the clinical phenotype. Based on annual assessment of episodic memory and executive function, the putative adverse effects on the individual trajectories of early cognitive endophenotypes of AD (Aim 2) will be examined in latent curve models with TRAP exposures estimated starting at age of 50-54 (in WHIMS -Y) and continuing into later life (in both WHIMS and WHIMS -Y). Using a targeted approach with the Core B- harmonized measures of GM, normal -appearing WM, and WMH, we will employ structural equation models to test the hypothesized mediation involving the laten t construct of medial temporal lobe and frontostriatal systems (Aim 3a). We will also conduct agnostic high-dimensional whole -brain mediation analyses (Aim 3b) coupled with causal inference testing methods to systematically examine the specific brain structures mediatin g the TRAP neurotoxic effects on brain aging. Multivariable -adjusted analyses with statistical Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 476 Research Strategy interactions using linear regression and Cox models and latent curve models will be performed to assess whether the susceptibility to neurotoxicity of TRAP increases in subpopulations with APOE4 alleles and greater VBI (Aim 4). C2. Selection of Study Population The following facts support Project -1's rationale for selecting WHIMS: (1) WHIMS -MRI is one of the largest community -based, prospective cohorts with both longitudinal sMRI and well-validated clinical data on ADRD; (2) longitudinal data with annual assessment of episodic memory and executive function are available in both WHIMS -MRI and WHIMS -Y (Table C4.2), thus enabling a very cost -efficient design to examine whether the TRAP effects on the early cognitive endophenotypes of AD start during late mid-life (aged 50-54 in WHIMS -Y) and continue into later life (aged 65 in WHIMS+WHIMS -Y); (3) women are more susceptible to the APOE4 - associated brain aging including elevated AD risk and older women appear to be more sensitive to the adverse vascular effects of particulate air pollutants;106-110 and (4) the geographic diversity of WHI provides the optimal environmental context with a wide range of exposures for better statistical power and boarder generalizability. C3. Study Design and Population We propose a prospective cohort design that includes all participants in the WHIMS -MRI (n=1403, inception age 65-80) and the WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS -Y; n=1346, inception age 50-54), followed annually since 1996, both with comparable longitudinal assessments on episodic memory and executive function (see C4.2). The WHIMS - MRI, including MRI -1 (2005 -6)111, 112 and MRI -2 (2010 -11),113 is a structural neuroimaging follow -up study of older women participating in the WHIMS main trials (1996 -2005). 114-117 Both WHIMS (N=7479, aged 65-80 years) and WHIMS -Y (N=1346, aged 50-54 years)118, 119 were ancillary studies to the WHI trial in 40 clinical centers, which recruited community - dwelling post-menopausal and older women from 48 states (plus Washington, DC) 120 in 1996 -9 and all free of dementia, according to standardized study protocols involving neuropsychological testing, clinical evaluation, and central adjudication. Detailed information about the WHIMS Suite of Studies, including study design, population characteristics, recruitment methods, measurement protocols, and follow -up schedule has been published.111-114, 117, 121-125 Briefly, the WHIMS main trials and WHIMS -Y were conducted in 38 of the 40 WHI clinical centers and enrolled 4,532 (in WHIMS -MRI) +814 women from the WHI Progestin (E+P) WHI Estrogen -Alone (E-alone) trial. The WHIMS -MRI-1&2 was conducted in 14 of 38 active WHIMS sites selected to maximize both geographic and racial/ethnic diversities. As of March 2016, we had 1403 women's MRI-1 data certified for analyses, and both MRI-1 and MRI-2 data obtained by the same imaging protocols were also certified in 730 women. Approximately 4.7 years following the WHIMS MRI-1, MRI-2 will allow us to assess the brain structural change and progression of neuropathology. Table C3 presented the sociodemographic features and common clinical attributes of this joint sample included in Project -1. C4. Outcome Data in the WHIMS -MRI and WHIMS -Y The ongoing follow -up of WHIMS -MRI+WHIMS -Y cohort provides comprehensive data on clinical phenotypes (C4.1), neurocognitive functions (C4.2), and structural brain MRI (C4.3). C4.1 Data on Incident Dementia and Dementia Subtypes [revised ] Project -1 will provide to Core B1 with the WHIMS data on incident MCI/ADRD (>180 cases in WHIMS -MRI by 2016, centrally -adjudicated) to prospectively evaluate the performance of ADNI -derived risk scores in predicting the clinical phenotype. A detailed description and validity of the standardized outcome measurements used to ascertain incident MCI/ADRD for WHIMS+ WHIMS -Y has been published.116, 117 In brief, the standardized protocols consisted of annual screening of global cognitive function, neuropsychological and functional assessment, and collection of clinical data to rule out possible reversible causes of cognitive impairment, all concluded with central adjudication for final classification of normal, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia (vs. non-demented) with clinical phenotypes of possible etiologies (AD; vascular; and other subtypes). For annual screening, centrally -trained/ -certified and masked interviewers administered the Modified Mini -Mental State (3MS) Examination126 during each clinic visit. Women who screened positive Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 477 Research Strategy according to age-/education -adjusted 3MS cut-points proceeded to extensive neuropsychological testing (including the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD battery) 127 and behavioral symptoms/function assessment. These participants subsequently received a detailed neurological examination and neuropsychiatric evaluation by board -certified physicians with experience in diagnosing dementia. Each woman then suspected of dementia underwent cranial CAT scan and a series of laboratory tests to rule out possible reversible causes of cognitive decline and dementia. Beginning in 2008 -9 for both WHIMS -ECHO and WHIMS -Y, annual screening was conducted by telephone using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status - modified (TICSm),128 which was highly correlated (0.89) with 3MS in previous studies. For women screened positive (i.e., TICSm<31), a reliable and pre-identified informant was interviewed by telephone using the standardized Dementia Questionnaire (DQ)129 to assess the history of cognitive and behavioral changes, functional impairments, and health events that could have affected cognitive functioning (e.g., stroke). For participants no longer able to attend the clinic - or telephone -based assessments (e.g., becoming dependent or death), the WHIMS investigators developed Supplemental Case Ascertainment Protocol (SCAP), which consisted of DQ and was shown to reduce undercounting of clinic -based cases and better characterize the risk factor relationships.130 Data from all longitudinal assessments (screening; behavioral/functional; clinical; SCAP; DQ) and relevant supplemental information from the WHI (e.g., cardiovascular events) were then submitted to the central adjudication committee (of 3 board -certified neurologists/ geriatric psychiatrists with extensive experience in diagnosing dementias) for final outcome classification, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM -IV), which had been found to have substantial inter -rater reliability and good validity for AD (compared with post-mortem confirmation).131 Following the accepted criteria 117 at WHIMS baseline, MCI was defined as poor performance (10th percentile in CERAD norms) on at least one CERAD test, evidence of functional impairment (but not severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living), and absence of psychiatric or other medical disorders (including probable dementia) that could explain the cognitive impairment. The DQ interview of proxies was validated against the 'gold standard' of a clinical evaluation with sensitivities and specificities >90% and inter-rater (face to face vs. phone) agreement of >94%. 129, 132, 133 Others using telephone -based assessment and DQ plus prior clinical/neuropsychological data also report high diagnostic validity to identify dementia cases in ethnically -diverse populations.134 Among the WHIMS -MRI participants, we expect >180 cases of MCI/ADRD cases will be identified by December 2016 (including 152 with MCI not yet progressed to ADRD, as of December 2015). C4.2 Longitudinal Data on Cognitive Endophenotypes Aim 2 focused on episodic memory and executive functions, because functional declines in these domains represent the hallmark of early AD.135-139 In the WHIMS Suite of Studies, these domains were assessed by well-validated instruments. The episodic verbal memory was assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)140 and East Boston Memory Test (EBMT),141 whereas the executive functions (including attention/working memory) were assessed by the Digit Span (DigSP) 142 and Oral Trail Making Test (OTMT)5-attention (Part A) and executive function (Part B). For the WHIMS -MRI cohort (n=1403), the CVLT+DigSP data ( average#~6 repeated measures ) were available in 930 subjects enrolled in the WHI Study on Cognitive Aging (WHISCA, 1999 -2010). These WHISCA data (N=2302, aged 66 to 84 years) were collected by an annual battery during clinic visit. Detailed testing procedures of the WHISCA assessment,143-147 scoring scheme, and quality assurance had been reported elsewhere.124, 125, 148-151 After the extension of WHIMS ended in 2008, 896 WHIMS -MRI subjects participated in the WHIMS Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS -ECHO; n=2917, 2008 -onward ), which was initiated concurrently with WHIMS -Y to continue the annual neuropsychological assessment (including CVLT, DigSP, EBMT, and OTMT), based on the telephone -based cognitive batteries. We had reported the great reliability and test validity of these assessments,5 and also showed that using these batteries substantially increased enrollment/retention/data completeness, thereby improving study validity.6 These unique data will allow us to examine the putative adverse effects on these early neuropsychological processes associated with air pollution exposures estimated at age of 50-54 (in WHIMS -Y) and whether such exposure effects continue into later life in WHIMS -MRI (aged 66-84 years with WHISCA data and aged 75-93 years with WHIMS -ECHO data) and WHIMS -Y (aged 62-74).

Project -001 (987) Page 478 Research Strategy C4.3 Brain Structure Data from WHIMS -MRI The WHIMS MRI QC Center152-154 (Dept. of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania) developed 1.5T scan acquisition and processing protocols for both WHIMS MRI-1&-2. Standard T1-, T2-, proton density -weighted, and FLAIR scans were acquired. Briefly, the scans were obtained with a field of view=22 cm and a matrix of 256\u00d7256. Included were oblique axial spin density/T2 -weighted spin echo ms, TE=30/120 thickness=3 fluid -attenuated inversion (FLAIR) T2-weighted spin echo (TR=8000 ms, TI=2000 ms, TE=100 ms, slice thickness=3 mm), and oblique axial three - dimensional T1 -weighted gradient echo (flip angle=30 degrees, TR=21 ms, TE=8 ms, slice thickness=1.5 mm) images from the vertex to the skull base parallel to the anterior commissure - posterior commissure (AC-PC) plane. Following the optimized sMRI protocols developed in ANDI to reduce variability across scanners produced by different manufacturers, the Core B1 Data Support will perform post-acquisition corrections to minimize noise in the images, as well as monitoring protocols based on a standardized phantom to detect system errors.155, 156 To harmonize the sMRI measures between WHIMS and ANDI, these imaging data will be automatically processed with FreeSurfer (including the longitudinal stream157). In addition to the standard GM segmentation, automated WM parcellation158 in FreeSurfer will be performed to derive the subcortical WM volumes in MTL. Dr. Thompson (Core B Director) and other USC colleagues have recently developed the EPIC (Evolving Partitions to Improve Connectomics)159 method and apply this novel analytic framework to evaluate the brain connectivity represented by a cortical segmentation for an in a support vector machine (SVM) -based classifier of AD vs. controls. In brief, given the reprocessed sMRI data, the EPIC analyses combined the dilated cortical segmentation intersecting with the WM fibers to generate the whole -brain structural connectivity matrices. The representation of these complex sMRI networks was partitioned and mathematically refined to estimate the optimal parcellation differentiating AD vs. controls. Dimensiona lity of the resulting brain structural networks was reduced by principal components analysis (PCA). A support vector machine (SVM) -based supervised learning method was employed to optimize the classier. For this application , as noted in the Program Summary (Table C), Project -1 will contribute to testing the several hypothesized mechanistic mediation pathways (e.g., MTL-memory systems; front -striatal executive systems) by conducting the targeted region of interest (ROI) analyses (see section C9.3 ; Aim 3a), with each defined brain area assessed for GM+WM, and separately for GM and WM alone. For MTL-WM, we will focus on use the ADNI - defined signatures of cortical thinning that best differentiating AD from cognitive normal controls, to examine the hypothesized GM thinning associated with TRAP. The extant ADNI protocols160 for automated WMH detection will be used to derive the WMH volume, which represents the vascular brain injuries for the hypothesized mediation effect on declining episodic memory and executive functions. The harmonized whole - brain measures, including vertex -wise sMRI measures of normal -appearing structures include cortical thickness, surface area, GM volume, and WM volumes, will be submitted for the high-dimensional analyses (see section C9.3; Aim 3b). C5. Geocoded Residential Information Geocoded information of participants' addresses will be used to define the residential locations where air pollution exposures were estimated. Because address data were collected prospectively with annual updates starting approximately three years before WHI inception and continuing during follow -up, we will be able to account for the varying exposure levels due to relocation. The geocoded location data (longitudes and latitudes) in 1993 -2016 will be made available through (R01AG033078; R01ES025888) at no additional cost. Project -1 benefits from continuing efforts by WHI investigators to provide high-quality geocoded data, following the same standardized procedures,161-163 with very high matching reported (e.g., 99.8% in the 2012 update of WHI address records; 85.8% by street+14% by zipcode centroid). Detailed results of reliability and validation study with high level of accuracy in geocoding of WHI addresses have been published.161, 164 For the statistical analyses (C9), we will conduct sensitivity analyses excluding addresses geocoded at the zip-code levels. C6. Exposure Assessment Given the geocoded data (section C5) of all home addresses in 1993 -2016, we will conduct the individual -level, residence -specific estimation for ambient NO 2 (a gaseous surrogate), elemental carbon (EC) component of Fig.C4.3 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 479 Research Strategy Fig.C6 PM 2.5 (a marker of diesel exhaust particle),165-168 and predicted source profiles of PM 2.5, based on the methodological approaches to be harmonized across Projects 1& 2, through the Environmental Data Support Core C1. Dr. Chen (Project -1 PI) will lead this effort, through a subcontract with U. Washington where Dr. Joel Kaufman (subcontract PI) leads the MESA -AIR (Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution) team. Core C1 will support the proposed extension/implementation of a suite of MESA -AIR spatiotemporal modeling tools (see Core C1 for details). In brief, the MESA -AIR approach represents state -of-the-art in modeling air pollution exposures for large cohort studies, as it incorporates the methodological advances and environmental data resources developed from the EPA's long-term investment in MESA AIR (2006 -onward).169 The MES -AIR modeling framework integrates measurements from the U.S. EPA Air Quality System170 with comprehensive (n>800) spatiotemporal covariates assembled in the MESA Air Exposure Assessment Core Database.171 The MESA -AIR approach models pollutant concentrations as a linear combination of temporal basis functions with spatially varying coefficients and spatiotemporal residuals. The resulting exposure estimates therefore capture both regional - and local-scale variability.172 In the context of WHI, Chen and Kaufman have been working on the R01ES025888 (2016 -21) which supports the downscaling of yearly MESA -AIR models to estimate monthly outdoor concentrations between 1990 and 2016 for NO 2 and between 1999 and 2016 for PM 2.5 on the national -scale. Although downscaling of spatiotemporal models is very computationally intensive, we have previously shown that exposure estimation processes starting with shorter time-scales followed by temporal aggregation is more preferable than directly modeling yearly exposure.173 Figure C6 depicted the preliminary results of a downscaled MESA -AIR model of monthly PM 2.5 in one climatic zone (the Southeastern US) in 1999 -2013, with the model performance via 10-fold cross validation showing a high degree of estimation accuracy (RCV2 = 0.73). Also available to this PO1 is a new spatiotemporal model of historical annual PM 2.5 concentrations in the continental US from 1980 -1998 . These prediction model performed well when validated using IMPROVE Network and USC -based Children's Health Study data (R2=0.84 -0.91).174 Validated national spatial exposure models175 will also be implemented to estimate annual average concentrations of major PM 2.5 components, focused on EC (a marker of diesel exhaust particle). Recent advancement includes novel approaches to characterizing PM composition (and hence sources). For instance, MESA -AIR team recently developed new statistical methods (the \"predictive k- means and predictive sparse principal component analyses\") to identify profiles of PM 2.5 composition from the EPA's Chemical Speciation Network (see details in Core C1). This novel approach, already successfully implemented to predict profile labels at the residential locations of the nationwide cohort of Sister Study,176 will be available to this P01 program to separate the TRAP -PM 2.5 from other identified sources. C7. APOE Alleles The proposed Aim 4 analyses will be conducted on WHIMS -MRI subjects (n=952) with APOE genotype data (4 carriers=~20%, comparable to the prevalence in a national representative sample177, 178). These data came from a WHI core study (W63) resource derived from the genome -wide association study sample, which included WHI participants with European ancestry (primarily non-Hispanic whites). APOE genotypes of 4504 WHIMS participants were assigned, based on rs429358 and rs7412 genotype results from imputation and harmonization. The imputation was conducted using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel and the MaCH algorithm as implemented in Minimac (R2 = 0.98 for each SNP in the study population).179 Although these data were missing in a subset of WHIMS -MRI, we did not find evidence that APOE4 alleles confound the adverse PM 2.5 effects on brain volumes8, 72 and cognitive impairment3 (see section C9.1). C8. Other Pertinent Covariate Data [revised ] The comprehensive WHI covariates data offer the unique opportunity to assess the potential confounding and other sources of biases. To adjust for/assess the potential confounding, we took a more conservative approach which accounts for both prior knowledge and empirical data to select two sets of covariates.180 First, we will use the directed acyclic graph (DAG) 181 to identify a list of important confounders a priori (section C.8.1 ) for the putative associations. These covariates have established causal relationships with cognitive impairments, and they often determine where the people live (and thus the estimated exposure levels). These DAG -identified confounders will be included in the fully adjusted analyses. Second, we used the change -in- estimate (10%) as the analytic criteria for evaluating the potential confounding introduced by other covariates (section C.8.2 ), i.e., those personal factors or environmental characteristics that are likely predictive Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 480 Research Strategy Fig.C9.1 of cognitive decline and dementia/AD risk in WHIMS+WHIMS -Y participants, but they may not confound the associations unless these covariates also empirically correlate with the estimated exposures. C8.1 Covariate Data for Confounders : These variables include: (1) sociodemographics: age and race/ethnicity; (2) individual socioeconomic position (SES): education, family income, employme nt status, occupation (Managerial/Professional, Technical/Sales/ Administrative, Service, Operators/Fabricators/ Laborers, Homemaker only); and (3) lifestyle factors: smoking, physical activities, and alcohol consumption. C8.2 Other Covariates : These include: (1) assigned intervention (E+P or E-Alone; Placebos); (2) prior medications: hormone replacement (never vs. past vs. current hormone user), statin, aspirin, hypnotics/ sedatives and anti-depressants; (3) physical attributes: body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure; (4) medical conditions: histories of CVD, stroke, DM, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and depression; (5) other comorbidities (e.g., Parkinson's; lung, liver and kidney diseases; cancers); (6) psychosocial factors: stressful life events (as measures in the Alameda County Study); 182 and social support (9-item measure from Medical Outcomes Study social support questionnaire);183 (7) urban/rural categorization for the residential neighborhoods (per U.S. census 1990 and 2000 Urban/Rural Classification); (8) census tract-level contextual socioeconomic characteristics of residential neighborhoods defined for the WHI cohort;184-186 (9) meteorological variables (including averages of dew point and temperature), using distance -weighted k -nearest -neighbor average within 50 km buffers based on daily data from the National Climatic Data Center Network;187 (10) censoring status during follow -up (mortality; incident CVD); and (11) indicators for subcohort membership and cognitive testing methods (clinics - vs. phone -based). Possibility of time -varying confounding by these covariates (except for those in [1] and [2]) will be evaluated in the statistical analyses (section C9). C9. Specific Analytic Approaches to the Proposed Aims [revised ] C9.1 (Aim 1) To assess the TRAP effects on early biomarkers of AD/MCI /preclinical AD risk [revised ] We will construct hierarchical/multilevel models188 for continuous outcome data (sMRI -derived risk scores), adjusting for relevant covariates (section C8). The exposure variables will include both long-term cumulative estimates determined at baseline preceding the outcome measures (e.g., NO 2 exposure in 1993 -2005/2006 before MRI -1) and time-varying exposures estimated at each follow -up time (e.g.,3 -y moving average preceding MRI-1 and -2), adjusting for potential confounding by time-varying or time-independent covariates (section C8). Sensitivity Analyses [new]: Study participation and/or longitudinal dropout may depend on cognitive function at WHIMS baseline189 or brain structure at WHIMS MRI -1. Air pollution exposures increase overall mortalities and risks of chronic diseases including CVD74and dementia.3 These together raise the legitimate concern with the possibility of selection biases, which may result from selective enrollment or differential loss to follow -up. We will plan to use pattern -mixture and propensity scores approaches 190, 191 to examine the sensitivity of our results to missing data or differential dropout. It was interesting to note that our previous analyses in WHIMS using propensity scores showed very little impact of missing data on the HT results.154 Our team members 192are also familiar with the inverse probability -weighted estimation 193, 194 estimation which could be applied to correct such biases. Preliminary results [revised ]: Supported by the completed R01AG033078, we recently showed that elevated PM 2.5 (3-year average >12 \u00b5g/m3) was associated with 1.65 -fold higher risk of accelerated cognitive decline and 1.92-fold increased risk of dementia, with potentially greater impact in 4 carriers in older women (Fig.C9.1). We employed a conventional spatiotemporal modeling approach173, 195 to estimating PM 2.5 and examined its adverse effects using Cox models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs; 95% confidence intervals) for clinically -significant global cognitive decline (>8- point loss in 3MS) and dementia risk among non-Hispanic white women (N=3647 with 3 or 4; aged 70.3\u00b13.7) in 1999 -2010. Our results showed that residing in high PM 2.5 locations (exceeding the US EPA standard of 3-year average >12 \u00b5g/m3) increased the incidence of global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia, and these observed adverse PM 2.5 effects were exacerbated among women of 4/4. The overall incidence rate of accelerated global cognitive decline increased by 81% (hazard ratio or HR=1.81; 1.42-2.32), comparing older women residing at locations with high versus low PM 2.5 (Fig.C9.1A). The incidence of all-cause dementia in older women with high PM 2.5 exposure was 92% higher (HR=1.92; 1.32- 2.80) than the incidence with low exposure (Fig.C9.1B). Incidence rate for all-cause dementia associated with high PM 2.5 exposure increased 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4 carriers. High PM 2.5 exposure was also associated with greater incidence of global cognitive decline by 65% (HR=1.65; 1.23-2.23), 93% (HR=1.93; 1.29 Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 481 Research Strategy k (HR=3.64; 1.36-9.69) in women of 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4 alleles. In addition to the covariates in 3.3.8.1, all these estimates had adjusted for geographic region, spatial random effect, and clinical characteristics (use of hormone treatment; depression; BMI; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension, DM and CVD histories). We found PM 2.5 accelerated cognitive decline even before progressing to dementia. For both neurocognitive endpoints (clinically -significant global cognitive decline; all-cause dementia), very similar pattern of gene -environment interactions involving PM 2.5 and APOE, and the neurotoxic effects were present even in women with only background genetic risk women (of APOE 3/3). These important observations implied that the underlying neurodegenerative processes affected by PM 2.5 likely have started at the preclinical stage. The additional exposure with PM 2.5 clustering analyses and source estimates will allow us to more specifically examine the effect of TRAP -PM 2.5 on early biomarkers predictive of increased risks for AD, MCI, and preclinical AD in older women. We had recently expanded the analyses to examining the association of regional PM 2.5 and clinical AD. Although the relatively small number of AD cases prohibited the test of interaction with APOE alleles, incidence rate of AD increased by 71% (HR=1.71; 1.18 -2.48) associated with residing in location with high PM 2.5 exposure in the full sample (n=134 AD in the final adjusted model; N=6128). C9.2 (Aim 2) The associations of cognitive decline of early AD with TRAP before/during late life For Aim 2, latent curve models (LCMs)196 will be constructed to test the hypothesis that TRAP adversely influences the decline in episodic memory and executive function, starting with exposures estimated during middle age and continuing into later life. We will start with the standard non-linear mixed -effects models using the latent curve technique (Equations 1-3).197-200 Let Xr,Si,0 be the estimated long-term exposures at baseline and Xr, Si,j-t be the estimated level of TRAP aggregated over 1-year to 3-year period for the jth year at the residential location si. To illustrate the latent structural analyses linking exposure with the trajectories of cognitive function, we start by defining the first-order latent curve model: Y[T]i= y0,i +B[T]*y1,i +e[T]i........................................(Equation 1), where y0, i (in lower case) represents unobserved or latent scores for the initial level of each subject i; B[T] denotes a set of coefficients describing the average group change as a fixed -effect non -linear function of the timing of observations (e.g., B[T] = 0 or 1 or B[T ] =Age[T]); y1,i (in lower case) is the latent slope , representing unobserved individual -specific latent score change over time (e.g., per year); and e[T] represents unobserved but independent errors of measurement at each time T. We then proceed with the second -order model: e1,i......(Equations 2&3), where both the latent initial level (with the expected initial score, \u00b50, e.g., at the centered age 70) and latent slope (with the expected average change per year, \u00b51) are influenced by long- and intermediate -term exposures (Xr,Si,0 and Xr,Si,j-t), with corresponding effect estimates .o and .1, adjusting for other covariates and 2 2 random residuals (e0,i, e1,i) assumed to have variances (0 ,1 ) with a correlation= 01. In addition to the non-linear mixed -effects models, the LCMs encompass other variants of latent structural analyses that we will explore. For instance, the growth mixture models201, 202 can be used to identify subgroups with different cognitive trajectories that may be linked to increased dementia risk and/or exposure to air pollution. We may also construct LCMs with changepoints,203, 204 explicitly modeling the time of accelerated decline as the random changepoint that may be affected by TRAP. C9.3 (Aim 3) To elucidate the brain structure and neuropathology mediating the TRAP effects Conceptually speaking, Aim-3a employed ROI-based approach to mediation analyses involving the hypothesized target brain regions, whereas Aim-3b took an agnostic approach to examining the topologies of the hypothesized mediators (e.g., cortical thinning) in high-dimensional space. The proposed Aim-3a analyses will be performed by structural equation models (SEMs)205 in Mplus, 206 whereas the Aim-3b high-dimensional analyses conducted within the EPIC framework.159 SEMs205 will be used as primary analytic tool for Aim-3a, because of several desirable features noted in Section B. In the conceptual diagram below (Figure C9.3), we used MTL and episodic memory (EM) to illustrate their structural relationships in mediating the putative TRAPearly cognitive decline predictive of AD, although the other pathways (blue - and red-colored) will be also examined separately in the full analyses. We follow the conventional symbols of path diagrams,105, 207, 208 using ovals to represent latent variables and boxes to specify the observed variables. The structural relationships between variables are described by directed (single -direction) arrows for linear effects regressing dependent variables on independent variables. Although double -headed arrows were given to illustrate the correlation of AP with covariate vector (Zi ), certain covariates will be treated as common causes of TRAP and AD (Section C8.1). For clarity of presentation, we omitted residual errors in the variables and also avoided the other possibly complex correlation structures involving TRAP, WM, GM, EM, and vascular brain injuries (VBI), which will be explored in the final SEMs. In analytic terms, these variables of mediators could be defined either as a \"latent construct\" (with its assumed errors in measurement) or as \"classifiable measures\" (e.g., the Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 482 Research Strategy Framingham stroke risk score209, 210 to represent VBI211) for the pertinent hypotheses to be tested. The use of these classifiable measures may reduce the dimensionality of SEM parameters in case of computational difficulties. Let TRAP and the path to early AD share a vector of common causes or correlates specified as a fixed covariate matrix Zik=( Zi1, Bentler -Weeks model, 212 all the observable variables (TRAP) and latent factors (e.g., MTL or HC) in a structural equation model can be specified as either dependent variables, , (e.g., MTL; EM) or independent variables , , (e.g., TRAP; Zik). The putative mediators are considered as dependent variables in the Bentler -Weeks model. The structural relationships can be expressed with a matrix equation: = +, where and are vectors of dependent and independent variables, respectively; and are matrices of unknown regression weights; and is the covariance matrix representing the associations among the independent variables in . Evaluation of the SEMs will be carried out using Mplus.206 In Aim 3b, we will employ mediation analysis in an agnostic strategy to identify regions of the brain that mediate effects of TRAP on brain aging. The causal inference test (CIT),213, 214 developed by Dr. Millstein, has played an important role in 'post GWAS' analyses that seek to identify biological mediators of high-dimensional genetic influence disease phenotypes. It is the unique approach of the CIT, based on component statistical tests of evidence in support of measurable conditions consistent with causality that confers advantages over other causal inference approaches, such as the ability to distinguish causality from reverse causality. A growing number of groups have used the CIT to identify mediators such as methylation215-222 and gene expression215, 217, 223-227 but the CIT is also applicable to the problem of identifying molecular mediators of environmental exposures, such as air pollution. A recent modification of the CIT213 accommodates a computationally efficient non -parametric permutation -based FDR estimator, resulting in a statistically powerful approach when multiple null hypotheses are false. Suppose WM in a particular region of the brain represented by multiple voxels is affected by TRAP, resulting in cognitive decline. Then WM would mediate the effect of TRAP on cognitive decline in this region. Each voxel in the region would correspond to a false null hypothesis, reducing the overall proportion of true null hypothesis, thereby increasing statistical power228 when the FDR approach is applied. We will identify localized regions of the brain that correspond to clusters of low values of FDR. Dr. Millstein's FDR approach provides confidence intervals that quantify uncertainty in the estimate, even in the presence of weak effects, i.e., when FDR is greater than 0.05. Clusters will be identified using a convex clustering approach that employs the proximal distance algorithm.229 By adjusting penalty parameters such that there are no clusters under a uniform distribution, we can identify clusters that significantly depart from that condition. If multiple regions are found with suggestive evidence of mediating TRAP effects, we will increase our power by jointly testing those regions. To reduce the search space of mediators, we will incorporate prior knowledge, for example, using the ADNI -defined signatures of cortical thinning that best differentiates AD from cognitive normal controls (section C4.3). The CIT is currently designed to accommodate a single candidate mediator, but we will extend the software to simultaneously handle a set of mediators by leveraging such approaches as partial sparse canonical correlation analysis230, 231, which will be used to generate CIT component tests. This software extension will be freely provided to the research community through the CRAN project website (https://cran.r -project.org/web/packages/ ). Two published studies 232, 233 on the mediation analyses of environmental neurotoxicity followed approaches closely related to the 30-year old Sobel test 234 that was not designed to distinguish causality from reverse causality. The CIT is uniquely suited to address this challenge, as has been demonstrated in simulation studies.213, 214 Preliminary results [revised ]: We conducted voxel -based morphometry (VBM) analyses to examine the local- scale variation in cortical GM and WM volumes associated with PM 2.5 exposure.7 Our results demonstrated that agnostic approach may be more powerful to detect spatial patterns not readily seen in ROI-based analyses. We found statistically significant associations of smaller GM volumes with increased PM 2.5. The identified local areas were primarily in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, regions associated with higher cognitive function such as working memory, episodic memory retrieval, and executive functions. In our previous ROI analyses, regionally -defined GM volumes did not vary by PM 2.5 exposure.8 In the VBM analyses, we used the lower levels of exposure estimates in the middle of WHIMS follow -up (2005 -6), but the observed effect of 3-y average PM 2.5 on smaller WM volumes involves the same regions (frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes) as found the ROI analyses using the long -term cumulative exposure since 1999 .8 In repeating the ROI Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 483 Research Strategy analyses with 3-y PM 2.5 <12\u00b5g/m3, we found the adverse PM 2.5 effect on MW volumes remained (data not shown). C9.4 (Aim 4) To test the genetic and cerebrovascular susceptibility to neurotoxicity of TRAP We will use the multi -level mixed -models and LCMs to examine whether the adverse TRAP effects are stronger in women with APOE4 or greater WMH. For instance, let Yr,ij denotes the continuous response variable (e.g., A(+)MCI risk score) for subject i measured at jth year and living in residential area r; and Yr,ij is assumed to have a normal distribution after log- or logit-transformation if needed. To evaluate the potential effect modification by APOE4 for the hypothesized TRAP effect on sMRI biomarkers, we will construct the following model: Yr,ij = Ur + Vi + 2iXr,Si,j -t + f(Zr,ij ,) + and \"i.i.d.\" standing for 'independent and identically distributed, for the overall intercept, Ur for the random -area effect (e.g., MRI clinic -specific intercept), Vi for the random -subject effect (to account for within -subject correlation), Zr,ij for all relevant covariates with corresponding effects specified by a vector of coefficients , and IAPOE, i is the indicator variable for APOE4 status (=1 if carriers; 0=otherwise). The overall TRAP effect estimate of interest is given by 2i and APOE4 quantifies how much the effect of TRAP on sMRI biomarkers is changed in carriers vs. non-carriers ( 2,0). C10. Statistical Power Analyses In this section, we estimate the statistical power for our main analyses. In Figure C10(1) , we depict our sample size and statistical power analyses for the proposed aims. For Aim -1 relating various predicted risk scores to TRAP in multiple regression models, 235 we used the empirical distribution derived from the AD-PS (AD Pattern Similarity) score defined in an ADNI study contributed by Dr. Espeland (subcontract PI at WFU). The AD-PS computation was based a high-dimensional machine learning algorithm of high- dimensional volumetric analyses, with higher scores indicating increasing AD risks. We assume our AD risk scores calculated for WHIMS MRI participants (aged 71-89) using the EPIC matrices will follow a similar distribution as shown for the observed AD-PS (mean \u00b1 SD: 0.26\u00b10.21) among cognitively normal controls (aged 75.9\u00b15.0) in ADNI.236 These power analyses were conditioned on a set of 20 covariates that jointly accounted for 50% of TRAP Figure C10(1) variability (i.e., R2(C)=0.50). These results were presented with varying statistical power as a function of sample size (N) for a range of effect size (i.e., R2(T)=0.01 -0.05) reflecting the % of outcome variance attributable to TRAP. Our analyses showed that sample sizes of 1000 and 700 will provide >95% and >99% power to detect 1 -2% difference in the conditional probability for AD, with better power for stronger effects (3-5% difference). We consider the assumed 1% difference as clinically significant, because in ADNI it was equivalent to 1-2 years of pathological brain aging.236 Because our targeted approach (Aim 3a) to defining mechanistic mediation was based on well-established pathways (e.g., MTLEM), the success of proposed SEM analyses involving brain MRI data will be largely determined by the effects regressing TRAP on brain structures in the subpopulations with cognitive endophenotypes (CEP, e.g., EM), including 930 for the mediation involving the differences in MRI-1 and 582 in the mediation analyses involving the changes across MRI-1 and-2. As shown In Fig. C10(1) , our proposed analyses with a study size of N>900 (N>550) may have >97% (>90%) power to detect 1% difference (change) in sMRI measures linked to CEP. Power calculations are not straightforward for SEMs with interactions. To illustrate the statistical power of Aim 4 analyses (Fig. C10(2) ) for joint effects on sMRI biomarkers (Aim 1) or CEP (e.g., EM in Aim 2), we adapted the method by Borm et al.237 using ANCOVA with various sizes of subsamples (N=400 -500), model - adjusted R2 (0.5-0.6), and a range of standardized effect estimates (equivalent to several years of brain aging) comparing different groups of the highest vs. lowest levels/categories. For comparison Figure. C10(2) Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 484 Research Strategy of two groups defined by median of the putative \"moderator\" (e.g., WMH), a sample with N>1000 in WHIMS - MRI will have 83% power to detect 20% differences in effect sizes (2.5 vs. 3.0 years of brain aging by TRAP) affecting CEP with assumed model -R2=0.5. Such differences could separately be measurable in both WHIMS - Y (N>1200), with better power expected for larger model -adjusted R2=0.6. These analyses also illustrated that Aim 2 analyses will have sufficient statistical power (all > 90%) to detect early cognitive decline (>2.5 years of brain aging) associated with TRAP during late life (n=896 -930 with an average of 6 repeated measures in WHIMS MRI) or before late life (n=1346 in WHIMS -Y with annual assessment 2008 -2016). C.11: Study Organization and Research Management: This multi -center project is built on the PI's existing collaboration with WHI/WHIMS investigators. We leverage the research team and infrastructure/resources already developed by an NIA-funded R01 (see the comparison table in Budget Justification) based in the WHIMS cohort. It further draws on faculty scientists from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Department of Psychology with expertise in neuropsychology (Gatz; Nation; Petkus), clinical neurology (Liu) and neuroimaging epidemiology of AD (Gatz), latent structure modeling (Petkus) and high- dimensional data analyses (Millstein). The proposed research timeline is summarized in Table C11. C.12. Study Limitations and Strengths C.12.1 Limitations [revised ] (1) Exposure Estimation Errors : Although the proposed exposure models represent state -of-the-art approaches with dramatically reduced exposure misclassification compared to prior research, the estimated exposures are still prone to measurement error. We will not have estimates of all participant micro -environments, which are nearly impossible in a large population -based study, nor time -activity information in the cohort. Collecting time- activity information is not feasible in a retrospective study in which cognitive impairment has occurred. Several novel approaches to account for classical and Berkson -like measurement error in exposures, are being refined for R01ES025888, and we will apply these statistical tools as appropriate in our analyses. 238-240 (2) Other Exposure Sources and Characterization : We will not characterize other sources of air pollutants (e.g., indoor; occupational exposure; commuting ), because our P01 focuses on ubiquitous ambient environment, and there is very little or no correlation between ambient a ir pollution and exposure from indoor sources. 241-244 Previous studies have also found very little or no confounding by other sources of environmental pollutants.27, 245-249 Because AQS did not monitor particles smaller than PM 2.5, we could not characterise nPM or ultrafine fraction of PM. Our pre-1999 TRAP exposure estimation primarily replies on the spatiotemporal NO 2 model, because there was very limited information available regarding size distribution of PM and TRAP in the 1990s or before. (3) Generalizability : We could not generalize our findings to younger women or men of any age. However, selecting the post-menopausal and older women is well justified to address the Project -1 aims (Section C3). Studying early -life/adulthood exposures to ambient air pollution and the dementia risks in contemporary cohorts remains a great challenge, because good -quality air exposure data and models only became available after the 1990s. An ideal population will be a nationwide sample of middle -aged women and men with gender - specific analyses, but no such cohorts exist with comprehensive data available as in WHIMS -MRI+WHIMS -Y. It is noteworthy that WHIMS+WHIMS -Y was a multi -ethnic population (see enrollment table) with its biracial (Black and White) distribution representative of US older women in 1990s.250 C.12.2 Strengths This application has the following major strengths: (1) the study design is very cost -efficient, as it builds on two large, unusually well-characterized, geographically diverse cohorts with unique clinical, neuropsychological, and structural brain MRI data plus comprehensive covariates; (2) this collaborative project brings the novel population neuroimaging approaches to marry with state -of-the-art air pollution neuroepidemiology to advance our knowledge in population neurosciences of TRAP and brain aging; (3) this application is the translational product of an outstanding collaboration by expert investigators representing diverse disciplines and taking a true \"team science\" approach; (4) there is great potential to further leverage WHI biological and other data resources (e.g., GWAS and Biomarker Studies https://cleo.whi.org/data/Pages/GWAS -Data.aspx ; dietary/nutrition/ psychosocial) to pursue future studies on biological mechanisms/interactions; and (5) the strong preliminary data indicate a high probability that new knowledge gained from this Project -1 will greatly improve our understanding of the role of TRAP in contributing to the risk, heterogeneity, and mechanisms of AD in late life.

Project -001 (987) Page 485 Protection of Human Subjects HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION Risks to Subjects The proposed research project is part of a WHI/WHIMS ancillary study nested within the completed Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and WHIMS in Younger Women (WHIMS -Y). Specifically, Project -1 sample was drawn from two well-characterized and geographically -diverse cohorts of mid-aged and older women in the WHIMS -Y (n=1351, inception age 50-54) and a subset of WHIMS participants who were enrolled in WHIMS -MRI (n=1403, inception age 65-80), followed annually since 1996. The proposed research activities involve no direct contact with the original participants and no use of biological samples from participants enrolled in WHIMS+WHIMS -Y. Since there is no direct interaction with subjects, the resulting risk is minimal and limited to breach of confidentiality. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics The proposed research involves no primary data collection from the study participants. There is no proposed contact with the original participants. The project has been reviewed and approved by the WHI Ancillary Studies Committee and the NHLBI -WHI Project Office. The data are not publicly available. Confidentiality of the WHI data will be ensured. No personal identifiers will be used. All WHI data will be kept on password - protected computers in offices restricted to authorized personnel on keypad -protected floors. All investigators and personnel with access to WHI data will sign a Data Distribution Agreement (DDA) and will abide by WHI rules for publications and presentations. Key personnel with access to geocoded data will follow the existing procedures for special Data and Materials Distribution Agreement (DMDA), including the use of legally binding DDA data securoty provisions for data containing personal identifiers, that conforms to the specifications by the USC IRB& HIPAA regulations, the UW IRB& HIPAA regulations and UNC IRB and submitted for clearance by the WHI CCC (Clinical Coordination Center). Adequacy of Protection Against Risks Recruitment and Informed Consent WHI participants provided informed consent at all examinations using a form approved by the Institutional Review Board at participating academic centers and by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB 0925 - 0414). Protection Against Risk To ensure the confidentiality of the WHI data, all derived data will be linked to the main WHI/WHIMS database by the unique WHI identification number for each participant and no other personal identifiers will be used. All WHI data will be kept on password -protected computers in offices restricted to authorized personnel on keypad -protected floors. All investigators with access to WHI data will sign a DDA, and will abide by WHI and the USC, University of Washington, and Wake Forest University IRBs and protocols related to human subject protection. This risk of breaching confidentiality will be minimized, as the processing of geocoded information has been incorporated into the management and analysis of data, with tested procedures designed to safequard confidentiality. These procedures are based on our experience accrued in several prior studies of this kind that also involve access geocoded information and apply the data linkage to derive air pollution exposure estimates for large -scale epidemiologic studies. In the process of extensive spatiotemporal modeling of exposure to ambient air pollution, the UW investigators will use two server systems to separate the environmental data from geocoded data. This approach will further strengthen the security of confidential residential information and allow all researchers to access and evaluate environmental data until it is suitable for data fusion with geocoded data. The fully evaluated and processed environmental data would then be transferred to the second data server, which will follow all confidentiality protocols. Also, the purposeful compartmentalization of data management and analysis, as set in place by the WHI CCC, only provides data without personal identifiers for parent and ancillary study analyses at the performance site, as in the case for the proposed project. Other important elements in this process are the use of legally binding data use agreements that stipulate how our academic collaborators and commercial geocoders must operate. The required education on human subject protection of human subjects has been documented by each collaborating institution for all involved investigators in this application. The data with personal identifiers will be contained exclusively within a secure data management and computing environment established for Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 486 Protection of Human Subjects confidential data and not accessible to other programmers, investigators, or data managers. All ancillary study data will be provided to the WHI CCC when the final data set is compiled. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others The proposed ancillary study offers no directly tangible benefits to individual WHIMS or WHIMS -Y participants. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained The long-term goal of this project is to understand the influence of ambient air pollution exposures on the neuropsychological processes and mechanistic pathways leading to dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 2015, one in 9 Americans over age 65 is living with AD at a cost of $226 billion annually. Of these more than 5 million people with AD in the US, two -thirds are women. However, scientific evidence remains elusive for the modifiable factors associated with Alzheimer's risk. The proposed hypotheses, if substantiated, will greatly strengthen the potential causal role that traffic -related air pollution plays in the development of Alzheimer's disease. This project holds the promise to improve our understanding of novel and modifiable environmental risk factors for dementia/AD that is relevant to millions of aging Americans and their families. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -001 (987) Page 487 Inclusion of Women and Minorities Inclusion of Women and Minorities Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) imposes a greater burden on women, because two-thirds of the 5 million affected by AD in the US are women, and women are two to three times as likely as men to have AD across the lifetime. This Project -1 study is designed to investigate the contribution of traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) to the risk, susceptibility and mechanisms of AD and related dementias (ADRD) in older women. To this end, the sample for the proposed analysis is 100% female. The women sample came from the WHIMS & WHIMS -Y cohorts, both based in the larger WHI Clinical Trials which were designed to test the hypothesis that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) reduces the incidence of all-cause dementia and also to assess the efficacy of HT on age-related changes in specific cognitive functions in postmenopausal women including older (aged 65-80 years in WHIMS) and younger (aged 50-54 in WHIMS -Y) women. The WHIMS & WHIMS -Y is a multi -ethnic cohort including both older and younger postmenopausal women of racial/ethnic minorities and its biracial (Black and White) distribution was well representative of US older women in mid-1990s (See Table 2-2: http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p23 -190/p23 -190.pdf ).

Project -002 (634) Page 519 Project Summary/Abstract Substantial evidence indicates that exposure to outdoor air pollutants may accelerate cognitive aging. Emerging data from animal models also point to a possible increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias with exposure to traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP ). Animal models of TRAP show strong evidence of neurotoxicity, but existing studies of neurotoxic effects of TRAP on human brain aging have important knowledge gaps: 1) little long-term address history data; 2) little data on exposure effects before late life; 3) limited data on cognition, particularly mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD; 4) limited neuroimaging measures; 5) no examination of potential confounding early -life factors: 6) studies of older adults mostly on women; and 7) need for better understanding of gene -environment interactions. Project 2, built on the NIA- funded longitudinal Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA ; R01 AG018386 & AG022381), is ideal for addressing these gaps. It includes male twins ages 51-60 at VETSA 1 (n=1291) and 55-66 at VETSA 2 (n=1205). VETSA is a geographically -diverse cohort from 49 states, offering great variability in TRAP exposure. Subjects have 10-12 hours of neuropsychological, psychosocial, and health/medical data at each timepoint; 545 and 447 have structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at VETSA 1 and 2, respectively. We will address gap #1 by collecting and geocoding residential history data back to 1993, and in conjunction with Environmental Exposures Core C, create cumulative indices of TRAP. We will then be able to directly address gaps 2-7. TRAP will be characterized by the estimated ambient levels of NO2 (a gaseous surrogate), elemental carbon (EC) component of PM 2.5 (a marker of diesel exhaust particle), and predicted source profiles of PM 2.5. The age of VETSA subjects is ideal for examining TRAP effects before late life. We examine the following aims: Aim 1. Assess TRAP effects on brain structure/function: Main effects. We predict TRAP exposure will be associated with higher AD -related brain signature scores, cerebral hypoperfusion (paralleling Mouse Project 4), and white matter hyperintensities. TRAP exposure will be associated with poorer cognitive function and greater cognitive decline over time. Aim 2. Assess the impact of TRAP on cognitive and brain aging: Mediation. We will examine associations between TRAP and specific measures of cognition with a focus on episodic memory, executive function, and processing speed, as well its mediation by specific brain measures. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices of brain microstructure have not been examined in prior studies. We will examine mean diffusivity in both grey and white matter in medial temporal and frontal regions. Aim 3. Examine gene -environment (GE) interaction. 3a) We hypothesize that adverse TRAP effects on brain and cognitive decline will differ as a function of APOE -4, and polygenic risk scores for AD, inflammatory processing, and tau metabolism/processing. 3b) We will use MZ within -pair difference analysis as another approach to shed light on how genetic and environmental influences work in tandem.

Project -002 (634) Page 520 Project Narrative Chronic traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) exposure effects are an important public health issue, but they have been understudied in midlife, particularly as they relate to risk for MCI and AD. Better understanding the effects of TRAP exposure on brain structure/function in middle -aged adults is a first step in understanding the mechanisms by which TRAP may lead to cognitive decline. This may provide a focus for future interventional research in at-risk individuals. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 565 Funding Opportunity Number: PAR -16-359 .

Appendix Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) INTRODUCTION We thank the reviewers for helpful critiques that substantially strengthened the project. Changes are in italics . R1 Lack history of air pollution interests; consideration for air pollution largely off-loaded to Exposure Core. We added Co-I, Dr. Jennifer Vanos (see biosketch)1-3. She brings an extensive background in effects of air pollution to the study; she will be an effective liaison between Project 2 and Core C (Exposures Core). We will hire a postdoc with a background in pollution effects. We added considerable detail on TRAP to the text. R1/R2 Not all subjects will have same degree of TRAP data quality. How will exposure uncertainty be addressed? R2 Time for primary hypotheses about exposure periods not clear how will time-varying exposures be dealt with? Exposure data will be available in contiguous 48 states; time period is 1993 to 2013 (see 4.2.1 ). State -of-the art spatiotemporal historical prediction model techniques developed by MESA -Air (part of Core C) provide finely resolved TRAP exposure estimates with national coverage. Although the long-term models (1993+) do not have the same effectiveness as the post-1999 models due to lack of monitoring data, to an unprecedented extent the long-term models allow for meaningful assessment of long-term concentrations for epidemiological analyses4-7. The majority of VETSA participants live near major cities where monitoring was continuous and intensive; <0.1% live outside the contiguous states. Measurement error will be higher in subjects from less monitored areas and will be accounted for in data analyses5,8. Detailed address histories combined with yearly temporal TRAP resolutions will allow for analysis of time-varying exposures. Core C members have statistically validated algorithms to examine time-varying exposures and error estimation4,6-13. R2 If they believe that long-term exposure affects baseline cognition function, adjustment is not appropriate. Exposure affects brain and cognition, but cognitive ability is also positively correlated with brain volume. There is no simple solution, so we will compare analyses with and without adjusting for early adult cognitive ability. R1 Details for the AD risk score based on allelic variants is a bit hazy; use of two forms of AD risk scores (genetic and pupil/tau -derived) is confusing; genetic risk scores are a potential modifier of TRAP effects, while ADNI -derived risk scores may be impacted by TRAP, but this language detracts from the description . To avoid confusion we now use \"risk score\" only for polygenic risk scores (4.2.2.e ); these are always risk factors. Other measures (e.g., ADNI -derived brain signatures) may be risk/predictive factors (i.e., relative to cognitive decline), but it is also a major idea of the proposal that they can be outcomes (i.e., relative to TRAP exposure). R2 Success hinges on willingness/ability of subjects to supply residential history. How long a history? R1.It is unknown how many participants will return address history questionnaires, and how complete this information will be. Address histories will be from 1993 to 2013. We and the twin registry already have some address history info. Addresses were most recently updated in 2016 -2017. We will also use proven techniques developed by Core C based on the MESA -Air study (details in 4.2.1 ). At ages 61-71, most will be cognitively competent; for others we have informants. We use a multi -method approach (e.g., letters, phone follow -ups, informants, computer searches for non-responders) and a participation incentive. We anticipate a 90% response rate given our prior return rate of 82% and residential history being a small burden relative to the 10- 12 hours of assessments our twins completed at each study wave. R1 Range of data for various cognitive domains and health measures would be good to consider power calculations; power section could a more thorough for all endpoints. R2 Power may be an issue; stable MCI cases with imaging data is <50. Do not know the range of exposures, so not clear if power is sufficient. We added Co -I, Xin Tu, a senior biostatistician to enhance analysis and power sections14-17. Analyses have adequate power for continuous cognitive measures with MRI, and for TRAP -cognition associations for the full sample. Due to the smaller N the MCI analyses in the MRI analyses will be exploratory. Health and cognitive data were collected on all subjects. Rates of health conditions and general cognitive ability are similar to American men in their age range18,19. Many studies focus only on urban centers. VETSA subjects live across the US with a full range of rural, suburban, and urban exposures. R2 Lack of new data collection specifically for the Project. Address history and geocoding are new data. R2 No discussion of potential selection bias. Agreeing to participate results in some selection bias in all epidemiologic studies; bias appears to both under - and over-estimate relationships20. At baseline, VETSA subjects were unselected except for age (51-60), with only 18% attrition at follow -up. The sample is similar to American men in their age range on health and lifestyle factors based on CDC data18,21. We have an \"attrition replacement\" subsample at VETSA 2, so we can compare attrition and practice effects. Health and survivor bias are less than if we began when subjects were older, as in many studies of aging (see 4.1 & 4.3.8). R3 Pupillary hypothesis is plainly exploratory and not well-integrated . A midlife sample enables us to identify early risk indicators. Pupillometry can detect risk for decline very early, providing an objective measure of the effort needed on a task before performance declines22-25. Greater effort is consistent with increased need for compensation, hence, increased risk for decline. Biological indications of its links to early risk for MCI and AD are that the pupil response being largely driven by the locus coeruleus (LC), and Braak et al.'s finding that the LC is the earliest site of tau deposition. Pupil dilation responses do tend to be greater with age as cognitive efficiency declines, but we have only a 10-year age range and our analyses controlled for age (see 4.2.2.d ). Introduction to Application Page 568 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) 1. SPECIFIC AIMS \u2014PROJECT 2 (Franz, Kremen) Substantial evidence indicates that exposure to outdoor air pollutants may accelerate cognitive aging26- 28. Emerging data also point to increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias associated with ambient air pollutants29-46. The overarching theme of this P01 is to examine neural pathways in cognitive responses to air pollution. Animal models of traffic -related air pollutants (TRAP ) show strong evidence of neurotoxicity, but there are still important knowledge gaps in prior studies of neurotoxic effects of TRAP on human cognitive and brain aging: 1) little long-term address history data; 2) little data on exposure effects before late life; 3) limited data on cognitive effects, particularly mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD; 4) limited neuroimaging measures; 5) limited examination of potential confounding early -life factors; 6) studies of older adults mostly on women; and 7) need for better understanding of gene -environment interactions. Project 2's use of the longitudinal Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA ; R01s AG018386, AG018384, AG022381) is ideal for addressing these gaps21,47,48. It includes male twins ages 51-60 at VETSA 1 (n=1291) and 55-66 at VETSA 2 (n=1205). VETSA is a geographically -diverse cohort from 49 states, offering great variability in TRAP exposure. Subjects have 10-12 hours of neuropsychological, psychosocial, and health/ medical data at each time point; 545 and 447 have structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at VETSA 1 and 2, respectively. We will address knowledge gap #1 by geocoding residential history data back to 1993. Geocodes will be used by the Environmental Exposures and Neurotoxicology Core C to derive individual long-term TRAP exposure indices with state -of-the art methods developed by MESA -Air (Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis & Air Pollution) . These TRAP indices, in conjunction with innovative AD-related brain signature scores developed by Neuroimaging Core B based on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, will then allow us to examine the neurotoxic effects of TRAP on brain and cognitive aging in midlife, directly addressing knowledge gaps 2-749. NIH50 and the NIA-Alzheimer's Association51,52 consensus statements stress the urgency of early identification beginning in midlife to predict AD and cognitive decline. As with cardiovascular disease, early detection and intervention is key. The age and detailed characterization of VETSA subjects is ideal for examining effects of long-term TRAP exposure before late life in people who are cognitively normal or have early mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using monozygotic (MZ) twin within -pair analyses, we will also examine effects of exposure controlling for genetic background and rearing environment. Our Overarching Hypothesis is that TRAP exposure promotes the convergence of vascular and inflammation -based pathology and neurodegenerative processes resulting in reduced structural brain integrity, which, in turn, accelerates cognitive decline and risk for MCI and AD. In VETSA, we showed that we can identify MCI in late midlife53. In addition, we showed that we can objectively measure compensatory effort required to perform a cognitive task even before cognitive deficits emerge using task-evoked pupil dilation, an innovative biomarker of early risk for MCI and AD23. Our basic model focuses on mediation effects; their omission in prior studies is likely to have missed key aspects of TRAP -related effects. Complementing and expanding Project 1 's study of women, Project 2 contributes to the overall P01's scientific theme of risk, heterogeneity and mechanisms of long-term TRAP exposure on brain and cognitive aging. Aim 1. Assess TRAP effects on brain structure/function: Main effects. Hypotheses: 1a) TRAP exposure will be associated with higher AD-related brain signature scores. 1b) TRAP exposure will be associated with cerebral hypoperfusion measured via arterial spin labeling (paralleling Mouse Project 4) and increased WM hyperintensities. These are likely to be associated with vascular -related medical conditions. 1c) Higher TRAP exposure will be associated with poorer cognitive function and greater cognitive decline over time . Aim 2. Assess the impact of TRAP on cognitive and brain aging: Mediation. Hypotheses: 2a) TRAP exposure will negatively impact episodic memory; this association will be mediated by medial temporal system abnormalities including perforant path abnormalities, i.e., volume reductions in white matter ( WM) associated ) (paralleling Mouse Project 3), and gray matter (GM) abnormalities in ERC, PHG, and hippocampus. 2b) TRAP exposure will be inversely associated with executive function and processing speed; this association will be mediated by mean prefrontal thickness and frontal WM volume. We will also examine GM and WM mean diffusivity (MD) in these regions. 2c) Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which provides indices of brain microstructure, may be more sensitive than volume or thickness measures, but has not been examined in prior studies. We will examine MD in both WM and GM mediators of memory in the medial temporal regions, and executive function and processing speed in the frontal regions. We will also examine TRAP effects on WM tracts, predicting increased axial or radial diffusivity in tracts connecting frontal regions, thereby indicating axonal loss or demyelination, respectively, as underlying mechanisms. 2d) Task -evoked pupil dilation indicates need for compensatory effort and is likely associated with tau deposition23,54 -61. We hypothesize that TRAP exposure will be associated with increased task-evoked pupil dilation, which will be mediated by the AD-related brain signature score linked to elevated tau. Aim 3. Examine gene -environment (GE) interaction. 3a) We hypothesize that adverse TRAP effects on brain and cognitive decline will differ as a function of APOE -4 as well as polygenic risk scores for AD, inflammatory processing, and tau metabolism/processing. 3b) We will use MZ within -pair difference analysis as another approach to shed light on how genetic and environmental influences work in tandem. Specific Aims Page 569 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 570 Research Strategy 2. SIGNIFICANCE 2.1 Ambient Air Pollution: An Environmental Risk Factor for Cognitive and Brain Aging Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders are extremely costly at personal, social, and institutional levels. Few successful individual -level interventions for modifiable risk factors (e.g., cardiovascular disease, physical activity, diabetes) have emerged. Existing studies suggest that exposure to ambient air pollutants, in particular TRAP, contributes to accelerated cognitive decline and brain aging, as well as increased risk for MCI and AD42. Improved knowledge of these associations could enhance efforts to curb fine particulate matter emissions, thereby affecting potential outcomes at a population level. With widespread recognition that neuropathologic changes take place long before the onset of clinical dementia, there is also recognition that early identification of risk for MCI and AD is a most important research goal52,62,63. AD has jumped from the 32nd ranked disease for years of life lost in 1990 to 9th in 2010 (largest increase of any disease), and from 17th to 12th for years lived with disability64. Expenditures for Americans 65 and older for AD and other dementias were estimated at $214 billion in 2014 alone65. Taken together, these factors argue for the need to study the impact of pollutant exposure on cognition and brain longitudinally in middle -aged adults. Long -term exposure to air pollutants, especially fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 (PM 2.5), increase risks for cardiovascular disease and stroke27. Animal and human studies show that ozone or PM exposure leads to neurotoxic reactions, including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, in multiple brain regions34,38,66 -74. Animal and human studies suggest that poor air quality may also accelerate brain aging indicative of increased risk for AD (accumulation of A34,69,70,75 and tau/neurofibrillary tangles34,75 -77), but many of the human studies were conducted in children and young adults. Recent studies by the Project 1 team and others report associations between increased PM 2.5 exposure and smaller total brain and white matter volumes78-80, and more silent brain infarcts79 in older adults. PM 2.5 exposures have also been associated with poorer cognitive function, although results of pollutant exposure have been inconsistent with respect to which cognitive functions are affected40-46,81,82. A study of older women also found that pollutant exposure increased risk for MCI42. Traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) is a major source of PM 2.5 and other pollutants. Thus, these findings suggest a key role of TRAP exposure in brain aging and cognitive function, including risk for MCI/AD. Braak stages of neurofibrillary tangles show the neuroanatomical progression AD including neurodegeneration ), includes perforant path, and recent MRI studies have shown PWM reductions in AD and more moderately in amnestic MCI84-86, and accelerated memory decline and increased AD risk in cognitively normal older adults85,87. TRAP exposure has neurotoxic inflammation and oxidative stress effects. Vascular and inflammatory processes increase the risk of neurodegeneration and AD. And the hippocampal complex and AD are vulnerable to cerebral ischemia. Thus, we hypothesize that TRAP exposure promotes the convergence of vascular - and inflammatory -based neurodegenerative processes. We will focus on this overarching hypothesis in multiple ways: examination of entorhrinal and parahippocampal white matter (paralleling Mouse Project 3); extended examination of white matter with DTI; extending DTI to include axial and radial diffusion as indices of possible mechanisms; extending the study of gray matter volumes to DTI- based mean diffusivity to examine microstructural cytoarchitecture disruptions; and examining cerebral perfusion via arterial spin labeling (paralleling Project 4). In addition, we will conduct cognitive analyses focusing on episodic memory, executive function, and processing speed. After briefly describing the Project 2 sample, we address 6 significant knowledge gaps (KG) below. 2.2 The Sample: Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA; AG018386, AG018384, AG022381) In Project 2, we will study participants in VETSA (Kremen PI; Franz Co-Director), a set of longitudinal projects on cognitive and brain aging ongoing since 2002. VETSA has 3 key design features: 1) a midlife baseline before substantial age- and AD-related declines have taken place; 2) a large sample with a narrow age range to enhance power to examine within individual differences in change; and 3) a twin design to elucidate genetic and environmental influences. Our baseline assessment extensively characterized a twin cohort of men at ages 51-60 (mean=56 at VETSA 1) and followed them longitudinally six years later (see Table 1 in Approach section). We administered an extensive neuropsychological test battery to avoid ceiling effects in midlife adults and address the heterogeneity of cognitive abilities and trajectories21,53,88 -93. We identified subjects with MCI and will compare the association of TRAP and AD-related brain signatures in cognitively normal versus MCI subjects. We also collect detailed health, medical, and psychosocial data on all participants. We genotyped APOE and now have newly acquired genome -wide genotyping data, allowing for the identification of polygenic risk scores for AD and other phenotypes. VETSA subjects reside in 49 of 50 states. We build on this rich, stable study for the present proposal by also capitalizing on its geographically diverse sample that is perfect for a study of the impact of TRAP on risk factors for MCI and AD. These features make VETSA uniquely positioned to address the knowledge gaps and the aims of this proposal. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 571 Research Strategy 2.3 Addressing Significant Knowledge Gaps (KGs) KG1: Limited Data on Long -Term Address Histories It is important to account for cumulative exposure over time, but studies of dementia risk have used aggregated exposure94 or exposure shortly before or after dementia95. Using addresses updated in 2016 - 2017, we will contact VETSA participants to obtain detailed residential histories from 1993 to current time covering a period of approximately 20 years. These data are particularly important to be able to examine exposure variability for individuals who have resided at more than one address (see section 4.2.1) and create measures of long-term chronic TRAP exposure. KG2: Little is Known About Exposure Effects on Brain Before Late Life Most neuroimaging studies on air pollutants have included older adults, but studies of middle -aged adults and the transition from middle to early old age are crucial for advancing knowledge about the impact on risk factors and biomarkers for MCI or AD. It is exactly this transitional period that the VETSA sample covers. KG3: Limited Data on Cognitive Effects, Particularly Cognitive Functions Associated with MCI or AD Almost all extant studies of pollution and cognition employed screening instruments or just 2-3 brief individual cognitive tests, which creates problems regarding possible ceiling effects, low reliability, and inadequate coverage of cognitive domains. Coverage is also too limited to draw firm conclusions regarding specificity of effects for MCI- or AD-relevant cognitive domains. Our work in VETSA has demonstrated the value of extensive neurocognitive batteries90,96,97. Episodic memory was weakly covered in prior studies. Assessment of executive function was barely present and often confounded with processing speed. These are important considerations as several studies show that there are both dysexecutive and amnestic subgroups of adults with MCI or mild AD; indeed, a meaningful proportion (20-25%) has executive deficits greater than their memory deficits98-105. These studies have also shown evidence suggesting that the dysexecutive subgroup has more prefrontal abnormalities and is less likely to carry an APOE -4 allele. Interestingly, the Project 1 team has recently shown negative TRAP exposure -prefrontal volume associations based on voxel -based morphometry106. The VETSA neurocognitive battery was specifically designed to be extensive and taxing enough to have the necessary breadth and depth of coverage needed for a middle -aged sample. KG4: Measures Examined in Neuroimaging Studies of Air Pollutant Exposure Have Been Very Limited Studies to date (in 2.1) have primarily examined total cerebral volume, gray and white matter volumes of major cortical lobes, and one study of white matter hyperintensities ( WMHs ). However, the first voxel -based morphometry study by the Project 1 team showed smaller cortical gray and subcortical white matter volumes associated with PM 2.5 in older women106. Neuroimaging findings are still too limited to draw firm conclusions. Complementing Project 1, we will examine men and extend neuroimaging modalities (See Approach & Fig. 6). Structural MRI. In Project 2, we will expand on prior studies of structural MRI to include cortical surface area and thickness. We have conducted many analyses of thickness and surface area in both region -of-interest -based and map-based vertex -wise studies, as well as white matter, subcortical gray matter and ventricular volumes47,107 -123 (e.g., Figs. 1 & 2). VETSA was the first to show that cortical thickness and surface area are phenotypically and genetically independent at the global level47,108. We expect TRAP exposure effects on cortical volumes to be primarily accounted for by effects on thickness, not surface area. WMHs. WMHs in VETSA subjects are predominantly in periventricular and deep parietal and frontal regions, and associated with age and hypertension124. WMHs were greater in those with uncontrolled hypertension124. To improve understanding of WMH -TRAP exposure associations, we will examine whether those associations differ as a function of key factors such as genetic risks. DTI. VETSA subjects with longstanding hypertension had reduced fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity \u2014indices of white matter integrity \u2014in most of 9 white matter tracts measured125. Longstanding hypertension was defined as having hypertension at both VETSA 1 and 2; shorter duration was defined as hypertension at VETSA 2 but not VETSA 1. Unlike WMHs, DTI effects were stronger in 4 carriers for 2 tracts connecting frontal regions with other brain areas (uncinate & inferior fronto -occipital fasciculi). Results held up after control for lifestyle and cardio -vascular risk factors. DTI results were unaffected by shorter duration of hypertension or better blood pressure control, indicating differences from WMHs. Thus, microstructural white matter alterations appear early in the course of hypertension and may persist despite adequate treatment. TRAP exposure seems like a likely additional contributing factor. The Project 1 team found reduced white matter volume associated with PM 2.5 78. In preadolescent children, there is evidence of a TRAP exposure association with frontal connectivity, but not with cortical thickness or fractional anisotropy126. Their DTI protocol was conducted on a 1.5T scanner with 25 directions. With 3T scanners and 51 directions, our VETSA Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 572 Research Strategy 2 DTI may be more sensitive. Also, effects on aging and developing brains may differ. With DTI, we can also make stronger inferences about possible underlying mechanisms affecting white matter (e.g., demyelination indexed by radial diffusivity127-129 or axonal loss or injury indexed by axial diffusivity127,130,131). Based on our results, and the voxel -based morphometry results of the Project 1 team, we hypothesize an interaction such that TRAP exposure -diffusivity associations will be stronger in 4 carriers in tracts linked to frontal regions. We also recently published 2 papers on cortical and subcortical gray matter mean diffusivity showing that they are phenotypically and genetically different from volume132,133. Hippocampal mean diffusivity has been found to differentiate cognitively normal and MCI adults134-136 and to predict memory decline137 and progression to AD, often with greater accuracy than gray matter volume137-141. In addition to white matter DTI, we will examine the relationship of pollutant exposure and gray matter mean diffusivity. Hippocampal volume was not associated with exposure in the Project 1 team's study78, but there could still be disruption at the microstructural level as indexed by hippocampal mean diffusivity. We have these DTI data in VETSA. Arterial Spin Labeling/Resting Cerebral Perfusion. Animal models and human studies strongly suggest reduced cerebral perfusion as a biomarker for progression to MCI and AD142-146. Hypoperfusion has been observed in MCI compared with cognitively normal adults in several AD-related brain regions (e.g., inferior temporal and parietal, precuneus, posterior cingulate, entorhinal cortex)142-144,146, and it dissociated with structural differences (e.g., hippocampal volume146). Given the expected association between pollution exposure and vascular risk factors, we expect pollutant exposure to be associated with cerebral hypoperfusion in these AD-related regions. In VETSA 2, we collected arterial spin labeling data on 123 individuals, allowing us to conduct the first examination of the association between TRAP exposure and cerebral perfusion. Moreover, this exploratory substudy provides a synergy with Mouse Project 4's hypothesis about chronic hypoperfusion, and is consistent with the overarching hypothesis that TRAP exposure promotes vascular - and inflammatory -based neurodegenerative processes. KG5: More Studies on Air Pollutant Exposure and Risk for MCI or AD Were Conducted on Women Our Project 2 study of men complements the Project 1 study of women. KG6: Need for Genetically -Informative Designs to Understand Genetic and Environmental Influences . Because the APOE -4 allele is the major risk allele for AD, we will examine APOE status as a moderator. In VETSA, we found, for example, no main effect of APOE status on hippocampal volume, but as predicted from animal models, there were APOE x testosterone interactions; only men with both an 4 allele and low testosterone had smaller hippocampal volumes and poorer episodic memory110,119,147. Polygenic risk scores are of interest for cognitive and brain aging and MCI/AD, but also related phenotypes such as inflammation that affect relevant MRI measures (See Approach for details). These have not been examined in studies of TRAP exposure. We will examine moderator effects of polygenic risk scores based on externally -validated SNP-based polygenic scores from large -scale genome -wide association studies. We will also capitalize on our twin data to implement MZ within -pair analyses , a powerful design because each pair is perfectly matched for genetic background, age, and rearing environment. MZ pair differences reflect nonshared environment. Fisher's test of heterogeneity148,149 (see Approach) indicates the presence of GxE interaction, i.e., differential sensitivity of particular genotypes to particular environments (in this case, TRAP). We have summarized multiple studies using this approach, including our own, that show such GxE interactions47,150. Measured genes (e.g., APOE or polygenic scores) can also be included in MZ within -pair models, which can be more powerful than studies of unrelated individuals151. This tests for \"variability genes\" that are associated with trait variation rather than just trait mean152,153. In particular, evidence by our group and others shows that effects of environmental risk differs as a function of APOE genoytpe110,119,147,150,154 -158. Finally, a postmortem study based on samples of convenience from Mexican cities found that the effects of pollutant exposure (including PM 2.5 & O3) were much more strongly associated with hyperphosphorylated tau and A even in children and young adults75. We will examine whether effects consistent with elevated tau are present in VETSA subjects and if they differ as a function of APOE genotype. We are uniquely positioned to address these knowledge gaps . 2.4 Early Identification of Risk for Cognitive Decline in VETSA: A Key Component of Project 2 There is now a consensus on the urgent need for early identification of AD because the pathological process begins decades before onset of dementia52. Toward that end, early identification of MCI\u2014a transitional phase in the progression to AD\u2014and even identification of individuals at risk before onset of MCI are both critically important. The VETSA project (Project 2) will enable us to examine whether TRAP exposure is associated with risk of cognitive decline prior to MCI and/or with MCI itself. Early Identification of MCI. We showed that we could identify MCI in VETSA subjects who were only in their 50s\u2014to our knowledge, the youngest demonstration of MCI to date and the first evidence of MCI Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 573 Research Strategy heritability53,159. Details of our approach to diagnosing MCI, including our unique use of general cognitive ability (GCA ) scores from age 20160, as well as the number of MCI cases are provided in Approach section 4.2.2.b . We hypothesize that greater TRAP exposure will be associated with poorer cognitive performance and MCI. Earlier Identification of Risk for Decline with Task -Evoked Pupil Dilation (TEPD). In VETSA 2 we introduced pupillometry measure TEPD, a validated psychophysiological biomarker of cognitive effort23. Even in the absence of deficit, if 2 people have the same cognitive score, the one requiring more effort to attain that score is likely to be at higher risk for cognitive decline or MCI because they are closer to the point at which they can no longer compensate with increased effort161. Two well-known TEPD phenomena highlight its usefulness in assessing risk for decline23,56 -61: 1) increased cognitive load requires greater effortful resource allocation, indicated by increased pupil dilation; 2) when beyond cognitive capacity or ability to compensate, system breakdown is reflected by drop-off in pupil dilation. In VETSA 2, we assessed TEPD by measuring pupil size increase from baseline during digit span tasks at low, moderate, and high cognitive loads (3, 6 & 9 digits)23. We compared MCI and cognitively normal (CN) groups ( Fig. 3). Normal performance (max span) but increased TEPD in amnestic single -domain MCI indicated compensation capacity remaining. The use of digit span is not to focus on that specific cognitive ability. Indeed, digit span differentiated amnestic single -domain MCI and CN groups even though it was not impaired in amnestic MCI. Consistent with their apparent inadequate compensatory capacity to generate enough effort, non-amnestic single -domain -MCI subjects had worse performance than the CN group, but they had lower cognitive reserve (age 20 general cognitive ability). Lack of adaptation to cognitive load in the multi-domain MCI group suggests compensatory functions becoming exhausted with advancing disease. The CN group has a normal distribution of TEPD. Thus, we predict that even in the CN group, greater TRAP exposure will be associated with greater TEPD, indicating need for greater compensatory effort even before cognitive deficits become manifest. Pupillary responses reflect activation in the locus coeruleus (LC) and related brain systems that modulate cognitive effort allocation56-60,162,163. Degenerative LC changes take place in the earliest stages of AD54,83. In Braak et al.'s study of >2300 brains, LC was the earliest site of tau deposition with tau misfolding appearing before tau spread to the cortex in successive Braak stages (predating A\u00df)164,165. The ventral attention network is strongly linked to the LC166, and we recently found that ventral attention network activations during resting state fMRI were associated with TEPD patterns (submitted ms.). In sum, key to the goal of early identification of risk, TEPD objectively indexes cognitive effort, providing an innovative means to detect risk for decline, even before observable performance deficits167-169. We hypothesize that greater TRAP exposure will be associated with greater TEPD, after accounting for differences in general cognitive ability. Because TEPD also reflects the function of the AD-tau-related LC attention network162, we also predict that TEPD will be associated with the brain signature associated with tau pathology derived from ADNI data by Neuroimaging Core B. Significance Summary. After accounting for different brain pathologies, Boyle et al concluded: \"Identification of the mechanisms that contribute to the large unexplained proportion of cognitive decline is urgently needed to prevent late life cognitive decline\"170. Here, we address the infrequently studied contribution of TRAP exposure's neurotoxic effects on brain and cognitive aging in midlife. The transition from midlife to early old age has still received insufficient attention, even though early identification is now recognized as critical for addressing modifiable risk factors. Our richly characterized, large longitudinal community -based cohort allows for consideration of how TRAP may drive neurodegeneration, addresses an important transitional period with respect to exposure in men, and complements Project 1's study of women, as well as Project 3 and 4 mouse studies' examination of DTI and perfusion. Our wealth of high quality cognitive, neuroimaging, medical and psychosocial data at 2 timepoints is a strength and allows for multilevel modeling. In addition, the use of GWAS and twin data has the capacity to yield new findings about biological effects of exposure to air pollution. 3. INNOVATION There are multiple features that make this proposal innovative: 1. To our knowledge, this is the first study of the impact of TRAP on early indicators of risk for MCI and AD before late life, including risk for cognitive decline. 2. We will utilize state -of-the-art indices of cumulative long- and short term TRAP exposure indices created by Environmental Exposures Core C. 3. We will examine mediator/moderator models \u2014 something that has not been done in prior studies of TRAP. 4. We will utilize newly derived AD/MC/tau brain signatures created via state -of the art methods developed by the Neuroimaging Core B. In particular, we focus Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 574 Research Strategy on GM and WM DTI, indices of brain microstructure that are not captured by standard thickness or volume measures, and may be more sensitive than the latter measures. We will also examine cerebral perfusion in a subset of subjects (n=123). No other studies of the impact of TRAP have examined DTI or perfusion. 5. We have more extensive neuropsychological assessments than prior studies. This is important for obtaining robust measures that are not based on single tests, and it is particularly important for adults who are only in middle -age in order to have good sensitivity and avoid ceiling effects. Uniquely, we also have a general cognitive ability score from age 20, which provides additional insight into cognitive change and the impact of cognitive reserve. 6. Our all-male, national sample will extend prior studies of the impact of TRAP in older adults because most have most have been based on female samples. 7. The twin nature of the sample means that we can perform MZ within -pair analyses that are uniquely able to provide information about gene - environment interplay. To our knowledge, this is the first twin study of effects of TRAP exposure on cognitive and brain aging in adults. 8. Polygenic risk scores and APOE genotype will be assessed as moderators. Genome -wide genotyping data on VETSA subjects provides an additional source of innovation. This has never been examined. Genetic moderators will be incorporated into state -of-the-art mediation models using structural equation modeling and latent variable analysis. 4. APPROACH This will be a very cost-efficient project because of all of the cognitive, neuroimaging, demographic, clinical, and genotyping data that is already collected. Prior assessments in the VETSA Parent Projects provide the majority of data for Project 2. The major time and expense is related to collection of residential histories, geocoding, and data analyses by Project 2. The Project 2 team will work closely with the Environmental Exposures Core C which will create individual time-varying long-term TRAP indices and with Neuroimaging Core B for re-processing and harmonizing MRI data to create brain signature measures. 4.1 Participants: Ascertainment and Representativeness VETSA 1 subjects were randomly recruited from a large, prior Vietnam Era Twin Registry (VETR) study conducted in 1992171. Subjects were age 51-60 (mean age 56) in VETSA 1 and 56-67 (mean age 62) in the VETSA 2 follow -up (Fig. 4). VETSA is a geographically diverse, national sample with subjects residing in 49 of 50 states. Indeed, it is a reasonably representative epidemiological sample with strong demographic and health similarities to census/CDC data for similarly aged men (e.g., education, income, diabetes, obesity, hypertension)48,172 -176. Mean GCA is near average (IQ=104 -5)177-180. Most of the major AD studies (e.g., ADNI) have highly educated samples; VETSA is more representative with mean education of 13.8 years (SD=2.1). This community -dwelling sample comprises twins who were in the military sometime between 1965 -1975; nearly 80% were not in combat or in Vietnam . Actually, 20% of men over 60 in the U.S. are Vietnam era veterans181, but that is ignored in almost all studies. Although VETSA is an all-male sample, it complements the all-female Project 1. We had an 82% retention rate in VETSA 2; the mean time to follow -up was 5.6 years. An additional 243 attrition replacement subjects were enrolled into the study at VETSA 221,182. Thus, there is a total of 1480 individuals in either or both waves of the study (see Fig. 4 ). Sample sizes corresponding to different VETSA assessments are shown in Fig. 4. At VETSA 2, 391 individuals have structural MRI, DTI, and WMH data, 55 of whom have MCI (Ns for MCI are detailed in 4.2.2.b). All participants have cognitive, health/medical, genetic, and psychosocial data. For MZ within -pair analyses, there are 330 MZ pairs at VETSA 2, and 108 pairs with all 3 of these imaging modalities. 4.2 Measures 4.2.1 New Data Collection Residential Histories. The VETR maintains updated, but not historic, address and contact information for the twins; addresses were last updated in 2016 -2017. This information will be used for re -contacting VETSA subjects by VETR staff who are in regular contact with twins in order to maintain enthusiasm for research activities. The VETR does not allow investigators to make initial contact with potential subjects for new studies. Using procedures validated by members of Environmental Exposures Core C to obtain as accurate histories as possible, the VETR will mail letters that explain the present study and ask twins to complete and return residential history questionnaires. Additionally, we will use multiple telephone follow -ups, informants, and electronic database searches for non-responders. Address histories will be from 1993 to current date. Existing VETSA address data will serve as a reliability check. Subjects will receive $25 for participation. We expect a high rate of participation because this request requires little time or burden. Subjects are committed to Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 575 Research Strategy VETSA and have already participated in multiple waves with full-day assessments involving higher burden. Subjects will be approximately 66 (range 61-71) years old when contacted for address histories and will have multiple modalities (i.e., verbal, written) in which to provide addresses, increasingly the likelihood of participation and reliability of reports. With national distribution comparable to Project 1 and the MESA projects38,183, TRAP exposure measures will be obtainable from the 48 contiguous U.S. and will represent a wide range of exposures to air pollutants. Fewer than 0.1% of participants live outside the contiguous states. Geocoding Residential Data. Residential history data will be entered into a database by the Project 2 team. Advised by Environmental Exposures Core C, we will use standardized geocoding procedures184-186. Geocoding can be conducted at high levels of reliability, validity and confidentiality186. We focus on residential history because even middle -aged adults are likely to spend a higher proportion of their time near their residences. Residential instability will be tracked and examined in data analyses. Traffic -Related Air Pollution (TRAP) Indices . Recent state -of-the art spatiotemporal historical prediction model techniques developed by members of Environmental Exposures Core C (e.g., MESA -Air) provide precise and finely resolved exposure estimates with national coverage in 48 contiguous states4-6,183. TRAP will be characterized by estimated ambient levels of NO 2 (a gaseous surrogate), elemental carbon component of PM 2.5 (a marker of diesel exhaust particles)187-190, and predicted source profiles of PM 2.5. Using geocoded VETSA data, Core C will create individual -level, residence - specific time-varying exposure estimations of these TRAP exposures from 1993 to current. The innovative approaches to estimate TRAP exposures developed by Core C's team integrate measurements from the EPA Air Quality environmental data resources with spatiotemporal covariates assembled in the MESA -Air Exposure Assessment Core Database (http://depts.washington.edu/ mesaair).This approach models pollutant concentrations as a linear combination of temporal basis functions with spatially time-varying coefficients and spatiotemporal residuals with a universal Kriging framework produced across the contiguous U.S. at fine resolution6,10-13,191 -194. The resulting exposure estimates therefore capture both regional - and local -scale variability5,7,9,13. Yearly temporal resolutions will be provided. The MESA -Air database includes over 150 geographical/spatiotemporal variables that may be of use as covariates in the current study192,193. The same TRAP indices will be developed for Projects 1 and 2 (details in Core C). The historical MESA -Air model for 1999 -2013 has high levels of cross -validated accuracy of prediction (R2 values >= 0.85) and well-calibrated prediction intervals4,183. Due to fewer air monitoring sites prior to 1999, the models starting with 1993 data cannot perform with the same effectiveness as the 1999+ models. However, to an unprecedented extent the new models allow for meaningful assessment of long-term concentrations for epidemiological analyses4-6,183. The majority of VETSA participants live near major population areas where monitoring was continuous and intensive. Measurement error will be higher in participants who live in less monitored areas or outside of the contiguous US8. Data analyses will be conducted with and without participants in less monitored areas. Detailed address histories combined with yearly temporal TRAP resolutions will allow for analysis of time-varying exposures. The MESA - Air team has developed and statistically validated algorithms for examining time-varying exposures and estimation error which will be included in data analyses5-7(see also Core C). We will also include covariates reflecting participants' residential history (e.g., moving), regional characteristics, and exposure uncertainty. Our collaborators in Environmental Exposures Core C have made significant contributions to understanding the sources and impacts of measurement error on estimation of health effects of air pollution in epidemiologic cohort studies; to designing exposure models to minimize the impact of this error and correct for it using post hoc bootstrap and asymptotic calculations as well as methods for selecting and combining data from multiple sources, exposure estimation, choice of exposure prediction models, and reduced -rank spatiotemporal modeling, and adjusting for unmeasured temporal confounding in estimating acute air pollution health effects as well as actively compared the reliability and validity of different models for TRAP indicators and developed efficient pre-adjustment methods that use all available exposure data5-10,195. These resources will be available to VETSA investigators throughout data cleaning/preparation and data analysis. Long -term (1993 to current) and shorter -term (3 years prior to each VETSA data collection) air pollution concentration measures will be created and used in data analysis. ADNI -Derived AD-Related Brain Signatures. Based on ADNI data, Neuroimaging Core B will create 6 AD-related \"signatures\" based on cortical patterns that best characterize cases versus controls196,197. As detailed in Core B, \"Evolving Partitions to Improve Connectomics\" (EPIC)198 is a data-driven approach that clusters or subdivides regions to partition the cortex so as to optimize the classification of disease based on brain connectivity or cortical thickness199. Beginning with vertex -wise cortical thickness measurements derived from FreeSurfer, it will use ADNI data to arrive at thickness patterns that best separate high- and low-risk subjects. EPIC uses logistic regression as a classifier and leave -one-out validation within ADNI. Predicted scores will indicate the probability of being in the high-risk category based on the patterns for each analysis. Thus, higher scores mean the person is more \"case -like.\" Mean thickness values within the AD-related Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 576 Research Strategy signatures will be included in analyses. We will also use TRAP exposure cortical thickness signatures created by Neuroimaging Core B, based on the highest and lowest quartiles of TRAP exposure for training sets. EPIC will provide the mean cortical thickness within that signature pattern for every subject. This mean value can then be included in structural equation models to evaluate a mediation effect between TRAP and cognition. The 6 AD-related brain signature measures are: 1) AD; 2) incident MCI, i.e., cognitively normal who progress to MCI within 2 years; 3) pre-clinical AD, i.e., cognitively normal A positivity (A+); 4) tau, i.e., signature associated tau positivity; 5) MCI; 6) A+ vs. A-. These will allow for early identification of brain disease patterns; we hypothesize that TRAP exposure and MCI will be associated with higher, more case -like, scores . 4.2.2 Previously Collected Measures (from the VETSA Parent Project) 4.2.2.a Neuroimaging (MRI) Measures The Neuroimaging Core B will harmonize MRI measures across Projects 1 and 2, accounting for scanner differences, and will assist in extending Project 2 measures to include FreeSurfer automated white matter parcellations200-202 and voxel -wise DTI measures within those white matter parcellations. Resting cerebral perfusion is in VETSA only, and will not be handled by Neuroimaging Core B. The imaging methods provided here delineate the acquisition and post-processing that has already been completed. VETSA Original Image Acquisition. Imaging data were acquired on Siemens 1.5T scanners at VETSA 1 and on 3T GE and Siemens scanners at VETSA 2 with 8-channel phased array head coils. Three sequences were acquired, including a 3D T1-weighted volume and 2D proton density(PD) - and T2- weighted images. The full multi-channel dataset was employed in a complementary processing path for precise measurement of cerebral white matter and abnormalities within the white matter (i.e., hyperintense regions on T2) along with definition of CSF in subarachnoid spaces and measurement of intracranial volume (ICV). T1 sequences FOV=24cm and frequency encoding in the S/I direction. Diffusion data were acquired using single -shot EPI with isotropic 2.5 mm voxels and 51 directions with a b-value of 1000 s/mm2 (matrix size=96x96, FOV=24 cm, 47 axial slices, slice thickness=2.5 mm), covering the entire cerebrum and brainstem without gaps. Two brief EPI scans were also acquired to correct distortion caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities. T1 images were rigidly resampled into alignment with an atlas brain for a common, standard orientation across participants. Diffusion -weighted images were corrected for eddy current distortion203, head motion204, B0-susceptibility distortions205, and gradient nonlinearity distortions206. These images were registered to T1 images and rigidly resampled into the standard T1-based orientation at a 2x2x2mm resolution207. Cubic interpolation was used for all resampling steps. Conventional DTI methods modeled the tensor as an ellipsoid where eigenvalues Cortical Reconstruction and Parcellation200,201,206,213 -221. T1 were corrected for gradient nonlinearities220 and image intensity non-uniformity222 that significantly improve detection of subtle changes206. The semi-automated 3D segmentation procedure delineates 11 \"subcortical\" structures including hippocampus, cerebellum, and probabilistic atlas and Bayesian classification rules223,224. Cortical surface reconstruction allows whole neocortex surface -based analyses for cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), and regional parcellations213-219. The Desikan parcellation atlas is particularly relevant to aging and AD, and has high reliability with manual parcellations221. FreeSurfer also parcellates white matter regions underlying specific cortical regions200,201. Segmentation and CT measures213-219 have high correlations with manual measures in vivo and ex vivo215,225, and many reports shows their sensitivity to subtle brain changes in aging, AD and other conditions223,225 -237. Structural White Matter Abnormalities. We used validated methods for measuring white matter hyperintensities, which also necessitated defining CSF in subarachnoid spaces and measurement of ICV238-242. This included re-slicing to a standard space; intra-subject mutual information registration243; bias-correction with N3222; skull-stripping; gray matter, white matter, and CSF segmentation; and semi -automated white matter hyperintensity designation based on location and geometric rules. DTI: Indices of White and Gray Matter Microstructure. DTI measures may reflect greater axonal coherence, density or myelination (fractional anisotropy)210,244,245 and myelin changes and variations in intra/extra cellular spaces (mean diffusivity; MD)246. We also obtain axial and radial diffusivity, which are thought to reflect axonal loss or injury127,130,131 and demyelination127-129, respectively. Measures of cortical and subcortical MD add additional useful information. For example, our new findings indicate that gray matter mean diffusivity is more strongly related to age than gray matter volume132. Atlas -based tract analysis247 of white matter DTI was based on a manually -constructed probabilistic diffusion tensor atlas with information about locations and orientations of 23 fiber tracts247. T1-weighted images are used to map into a common space. Based on the T1 FreeSurfer -based anatomical stream, cortical, basal ganglia, and thalamic gray matter and all CSF are excluded during the fiber tract atlas application to ensure that tracts course only Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 577 Research Strategy through white matter regions. Average fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity are calculated for each tract, weighted by the fiber probability at each voxel. Fibers and arcuate fasciculus). The protocol also allows estimation of fiber orientation density to capture more complex fiber architecture248. Arterial Spin Labeling/Resting Cerebral Perfusion. By magnetically labeling water, an endogenous contrast agent is formed that can trace the flow of blood into an imaging plane, and a quantitative measure of perfusion can be calculated by region. ASL was conducted at VETSA 2 with a FAIR QUIPSS II method (TI1/TI2=600/1600ms; 1 cm tag-slice gap; 10 cm tag width; TR ms) covering 4mm thick with 1mm gap)249,250. Arterial spin labeling raw image data are converted into calibrated cerebral blood flow maps, segmenting high-resolution anatomical images to identify voxels primarily of CSF. Image inhomogeneities are corrected for with a smoothed version of the minimum contrast calibration image251. CSF voxel selection is applied to the CSF calibration image to obtain an estimate of the average CSF signal intensity, which is in turn used to estimate the equilibrium magnetization of arterial blood250,252. Use of this estimate, along with literature values for blood magnetic relaxation times, provides a scaling term that is applied to the average difference of the control and tag images to form a cerebral blood flow image in units of ml/(100g -min). FreeSurfer regions of interest can create masks at the resolution of the quantitative cerebral blood flow maps in order to calculate mean cerebral blood flow in each region. 4.2.2.b Neurocognitive Battery (Table 1) General Description. We use an extensive and taxing cognitive battery to avoid floor and ceiling effects in middle -aged adults, and because change is neither monotonic nor uniform96. Our battery, with the same measures at VETSA 1 and 2, covers a broad range of cognitive functions with emphasis on executive functions, processing speed and episodic memory. Cognitive reserve is also an important construct in cognitive aging and risk for MCI or AD285-287 . We are in the rare situation of having a direct reserve measure \u2014 Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)160\u2014 from age 20 that is more sensitive than a proxy measure such as education288. In 35- and 42- year follow -ups we found that the AFQT had high reliability and test-retest correlations of .73-.8519,160. MCI. VETSA MCI criteria are based on the Jak/Bondi actuarial -neuropsychological approach , which has been validated in multiple independent samples289-294. In ADNI subjects, the Jak/Bondi definition outperformed the traditional clinical ADNI diagnosis on all validators: more converted to AD; fewer reverted to normal; higher proportion had APOE -4 alleles; and more abnormal levels of CSF A\u00df 42, tau, and p-tau compared to cognitively normal subjects289. Also prevalence based on Jak/Bondi criteria was lower, consistent with increased false positives with a \"one-test\" approach. Clinical diagnostic criteria for MCI or preclinical AD by the NIA-Alzheimer's Association51,52 require limited \"one-test\" cognitive assessment or clinical judgment. ADNI took this approach, using only a single Wechsler Memory story. This approach overlooks the possibility of impairment in other memory tests or other cognitive domains, reduces reliability compared with multiple tests, and increases false positives289,292,294,295. For example, over 20% of healthy older adults have one impaired score in 2 different cognitive domains; less than 5% have 2 or more impaired within a domain296. The Jak/Bondi approach emphasizes more thorough neuropsychological assessment, which is important for a disorder marked by cognitive impairment. In our approach, the diagnosis requires 2 tests within a domain that are below the impairment cutoff as this has been shown to have the best balance between sensitivity and specificity289.

Project -002 (634) Page 578 Research Strategy be subdivided by amnestic/non -amnestic, single/multiple -domain, or specific domains. We employ 18 neuropsychological measures covering 6 cognitive domains53,297. Uniquely, we adjust for age 20 AFQT, ensuring that MCI reflects decline rather than just low ability. We determine consensus diagnoses based on all current and prior test, interview, and questionnaire data, including concerns abou t or changes in function298. Some researchers might consider our VETSA 1 classifications to be pre-MCI, but pre-MCI adults are still at increased risk for progression to MCI and dementia; cognitive deficits can predict progression in those cases even in the absence of observed clinical impairment299. Within VETSA, our MCI diagnosis has been validated in subjects who were only in their 50s by: 1) showing greater hippocampal atrophy amnestic MCI compared with CN subjects159; and 2) new data (Logue et al. under review) showing that higher AD polygenic risk scores, based on the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) data, were associated with significantly greater odds of having amnestic MCI than being CN even after excluding APOE -related SNPs (best differentiation: odds [OR]=1.43; OR=3.22 for upper vs. lower quartile of polygenic risk score distribution). MCI Stability. In VETSA 2, a total of 162 people had MCI. Of 967 with data at both timepoints, 107 (11%) had MCI at VETSA 1; 148 (15%) had MCI at VETSA 2. Additional cases are from replacement subjects. For those with MRI data, 66/518 (12.7%) had MCI in VETSA 1; 69/422 (16.4%) in VETSA 2. Given the age of the sample, there are few incident cases. However, it is well known that any diagnosis of MCI may change over time. The optimal approach in VETSA is to focus on stable cases (diagnosis at both timepoints). These are most likely to be valid MCI cases: 120/148 (86%) were stable MCI; 61 of those had MRIs at both times. 4.2.2.c Health/Medical and Psychosocial Measures (Table 1) VETSA has detailed psychosocial and lifestyle questionnaires completed by all subjects at VETSA 1 and 2 that assess demographics, marital history, types of activities, religious involvement, living arrangements, exercise frequency270,271, subjective health272, memory complaints, health utilization, depression273, anxiety274, well-being and life satisfaction275,300,301, stress and posttraumatic stress symptoms276,277,302, social engagement, attachment and social support279-281, and personality281-284. Medical history interviews, functional tests at both times, and blood chemistries at VETSA 2 provide information on vascular -related conditions, pulmonary function, APOE load, fitness, hormonal levels, physical health, head injury, and impaired motor and sensory capacities that may affect brain and cognitive aging88,303 -314. Blood pressure and pulmonary function are associated with white matter abnormalities and/or cerebral volume decreases315-318. Some data also indicate that controlling for vision and hearing can be as effective as controlling for processing speed in explaining age- related variance in several cognitive abilities319. These measures, collected from all subjects , reflect major moderating/mediating influences on cognitive aging outcomes. 4.2.2.d Pupillometry Pupillometry is conducted with a NeurOptics PLR-2000 portable pupillometer that records pupil responses for up to 15 sec. at 13 samples hand -held per sec. Spans of 3, 6, and, 9 digits (low, moderate, high loads) are presented aurally at 1 digit per 1.5 sec. while subjects view a gray dot on a white background (~200 lux) in a viewing cone. The cone covers 1 eye; the subject covers the other with his hand, avoiding confounds of external light or head movement. Resolution is superb: mean error=.052mm (99% CI=.048 -.056; NeurOptics for artifacts; a MATLAB algorithm also removes blinks and minor artifacts. A smoothing filter is used, and average pupil areas are calculated. We measure: 1) digit recall; 2) baseline pupil size; and 3) effortful resource allocation (change in pupil diameter relative to baseline pupil size). Pupillometry was collected on all subjects at VETSA 2. 4.2.2.e Genotyping and Polygenic Risk Scores Genome -wide VETSA twins was done with the Illumina OmniExpress -24 chip by deCODE. Imputation based on is completed . APOE been genotyped separately320. Using all SNPs in our genotyping data, we have also calculated an AD polygenic risk score based on the largest meta -analysis of AD risk genes and the full International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) data321-324. The meta - analysis322 also denoted subsets of AD risk genes that were related to different functions. There are 2 of these subsets that are clearly related to the present proposal, so we will focus on them as additional relevant polygenic risk scores. The 2 functions and the genes that will comprise the respective polygenic risk scores are: inflammation and immune response DRB5 -DBR1,INPP5D,TREM2); and tau metabolism/processing (BIN1,CASS4,FERMT2, MAPT). boost the power of polygenic risk score in VETSA, we will utilize recently developed gene enrichment and genetic -pleiotropy -informed methods325-335. Details of the fitting algorithm are in Bioinformatics335. By incorporating auxiliary information (functional annotations of the genome and pleiot ropic relationships), information from test statistics are up- or down -weighted depending on level of 'enrichment'. The estimation methods are empirical, i.e., the resulting conditional false discovery rate (FDR) is allowed to depend on the auxiliary information, but if the information is not helpful the resulting estimates are not biased toward Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 579 Research Strategy any given solution329. This novel conditional FDR incorporates prior information about gene element -based functional annotations of SNPs, so SNPs from categories enriched for non-null associations have a lower FDR for a given test statistic than SNPs in unenriched categories. This readjustment of FDR is based on functional annotations by fitting a covariate -modulated parametric 2-group mixture model. In a test with Crohn's disease, the result was dramatically increased power; the number of loci declared significant at an FDR of .05 increased by a factor of 5.4335. Also, SNPs declared significant replicated in much higher numbers than with usual FDR, yet there were similar replication rates for a given FDR cutoff in de novo samples335. 4.2.2.f Data Collected Prior to VETSA We also have data on all twins extending back to age 2048: a) age 20 AFQT, height, weight, BMI, blood pressure; b) 1986, 1992 height, weight, BMI, health, health history, social support, combat history172,174, posttraumatic stress symptoms336 and c) 1992 lifetime DSM -III-R diagnoses/symptoms171. 4.3 Data Analysis 4.3.1 General Analysis Approach . The proposed study involves two time-points of data for the primary outcomes. To effectively address missing data under the general missing at random (MAR) mechanism, longitudinal regression and mediation models will be employed for examining the proposed hypotheses337,338. These models also readily address correlated outcomes within each twin pair. Unless indicated otherwise, data from both VETSA 1 and 2 will be included in all analyses in which data at time 1 for attrition replacement subjects will be treated as missing completely at random (MCAR)338-340. Also, the correction for correlated observations is not needed for MZ within -pair analyses. For regression analysis (main and moderation analyses), both the (parametric) generalized linear mixed -effects models (GLMM) and (semi -parametric) augmented weighted generalized estimating equations (AWGEE) will be used16,339. Unlike GLMM, which posits distribution models, AWGEE requires no such assumption, yielding valid inference for a broader class of data distributions under the most popular MAR mechanism in real studies. Thus, if discrepancies arise between the two, AWGEE results will be reported. Mechanistic hypotheses concerning mediation (main and moderation analyses) will be examined using both parametric and semi-parame tric structural equation models (SEM)15,341. As in regression analysis, the semi - parametric SEM -based mediation models require no distribution assumption, providing valid inference for a broader class of data distributions. Thus, results from the semi-parametric models will be reported if discrepancy arises between the two approaches. Model fit will be assessed by chi-square test, the comparative fit index (CFI), the index of Tucker and Lewis (TLI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)341-343. We set =0.05 for hypothesis testing, procedure for 10-100 tests, and FDR methods (an inherently exploratory hypothesis -testing context) for >100 tests. 4.3.2 Covariates. Other covariates may include : AFQT score at age 20 , demographics (age, race/ethnicity, education, occupation); health/medical variables (body mass index, blood pressure, metabolic syndrome components, cardiovascular diseases, depression, alcohol, PTSD, neurologic conditions, head injury, cancers, medications); and psychosocial factors (SF-36, stressful life events, including combat exposure), residential instability. These measures are listed and referenced in Table 1. TRAP exposure -related covariates derived by Environmental Exposures Core C include: exposure uncertainty , urban/rural categorization for residential neighborhoods based on 1990 and 2000 U.S. census classification; census tract-level contextual SES characteristics of residential neighborhoods; and meteorological variables (e.g., dew point and temperature averages) based on distance -weighted k-nearest - neighbor average within 50 km buffers based on daily data from the National Climatic Data Center Network346. 4.3.3 TRAP Exposure. As described in section 4.2.1 and in Environmental Exposures Core C, time-varying, exposure -related TRAP indices will be created by Core C for Project 2. They will include ambient -predicted spatiotemporal concentration for ambient -source PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants from 1993 to 2013 for each subject's address (which may change over time due to relocation) modeled in universal Kriging frameworks. For analyses, long-term (1993 to 2013) and shorter -term (3 years prior to VETSA 1 and 2) exposures, variables will be created by averaging the time-varying TRAP measure(s) over time. Pollutant concentration may vary due to a number of characteristics (e.g., time, distance to monitoring station, availability of different types of air quality indicators, mobility, changes in geography) which will be evaluated, operationalized and included in data analyses. A number of these issues have already been addressed by members of Core C5-10. 4.3.4 Aim 1. Assess TRAP effects on brain structure/function: Main effects. Hypotheses: 1a) TRAP exposure will be associated with higher AD -related brain signature scores. 1b) TRAP exposure will be associated with cerebral hypoperfusion measured via arterial spin labeling (paralleling Mouse Project 4) and Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 580 Research Strategy increased WM hyperintensities. These are likely to be associated with vascular -related medical conditions. 1c) Higher TRAP exposure will be associated with poorer cognitive function and greater cognitive decline over time. Analytic Strategy for Aim 1a-c) The longitudinal methods discussed in 4.3.1 will be applied to examine both the hypothesized long-and short -term effects of TRAP on brain signature scores, where the AD- related brain signature score or cognitive measures will be the response (dependent variable) and TRAP exposure will be the predictor, controlling for covariates (both TRAP and non-TRAP related). The hypotheses will be supported by a significant predictor main effect. 4.3.5 Aim 2. Assess the impact of TRAP on cognitive and brain aging: Mediation models. Hypotheses: 2a) TRAP exposure will negatively impact episodic memory; this association will be mediated by medial temporal system abnormalities including perforant path abnormalities, i.e., volume reductions in white matter (WM) associated with entorhinal cortex (ERC) and parahippocampal gyrus (paralleling Mouse Project 3), and gray ( GM) abnormalities in ERC, PHG, and hippocampus. 2b) TRAP exposure will be inversely associated with executive function and processing speed; this association will be mediated by mean prefrontal thickness and frontal WM volume. We will also examine GM and WM mean diffusivity (MD) in these regions. 2c) Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which provides indices of brain microstructure, may be more sensitive than volume or thickness measures, but has not been examined in prior studies. We will examine MD in both WM and GM mediators of memory in the medial temporal regions, and executive function and processing speed in the frontal regions. We will also examine TRAP effects on WM tracts, predicting increased axial or radial diffusivity in tracts connecting frontal regions, thereby indicating axonal loss or demyelination, respectively, as underlying mechanisms. 2d) Task -evoked pupil dilation indicates need for compensatory effort and is likely associated with tau deposition23,54 -61. We hypothesize that TRAP exposure will be associated with increased task-evoked pupil dilation, which will be mediated by the AD-related brain signature score linked to elevated tau. Analytic Strategy for Aim 2a-d) Shown in Fig. 5 is an example of a path diagram for mediation analysis (excluding moderators [in red]) with TRAP exposure's influence on cognition taking place through its effect on brain structure. Ellipses represent latent variables and rectangles represent measured variables; errors of measurement are not shown but will be estimated. The mediation approach discussed in 4.3.1 will be applied, with each measure of medial temporal system abnormalities as the mediator and episodic memory as the outcome. If the null hypothesis of full mediation is rejected, direct and indirect intervention effects, and percent of mediation will be reported. Both long- and short -term TRAP effects will be examined. The same basic model is applicable to Aim 2b-d. The mediators may be assessed at time 1 (or, if not available, at time 2) for causal interpretation. Additionally, we can test models with AD- related brain signature scores as mediators; these could be measured variables or latent brain signature variables created using the regions of interest comprising those scores. 4.3.6 Aim 3. Examine gene -environment (GE) interaction. 3a) We hypothesize that adverse TRAP effects on brain and cognitive decline will differ as a function of APOE genotype (4+ vs. 4 -) as well as polygenic risk scores for AD, inflammatory processing, and tau metabolism/processing. 3b) We will use MZ within -pair difference analysis as another approach to shed light on how genetic and environmental influences work in tandem. Analytic strategy for Aim 3a & b. 3a) The same longitudinal methods in Aim 2 will be applied to test a series of moderation hypotheses (see Fig 5, red rectangle). For each outcome measure of brain or cognition, TRAP exposure and a moderator variable under consideration and their interactions will serve as predictors of the model, controlling for covariates. Depending on the analysis, moderators (see Fig. 5) will be APOE genotype or a particular polygenic risk score. The hypothesis will be supported by a significant TRAP -by- moderator interaction. 3b) We will use MZ within -pair difference analysis as another approach to shed light on how genetic and environmental influences work in tandem. We can evaluate the extent to which individual differences in change are accounted for directly and indirectly from TRAP exposure. Regarding Aim 3b, examinations of within -twin pair differences among MZ twins are potent tools to consider environmental factors and G-E interplay. We will implement within -pair MZ difference approaches to evaluate the presence of GxE148,149,347 -349. These approaches are variants of the co-twin control method350 but have increased power because continuous measures can be used. In the within -pair difference approach, differences within MZ pairs Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 581 Research Strategy indicate unique person -specific environmental influences, as genes contribute to between -pair but not within - pair MZ differences. There is, of course, some measurement error contained in within -pair differences as well. If, for example, APOE genotype or polygenic risk scores contribute to heterogeneity in within -pair differences, it suggests that genetic factors contribute to differential sensitivity to environments (GxE). Our strategy will include: 1) testing for mixture distributions of MZ within -pair differences for continuous traits (e.g., cognitive domains, MRI measures); 2) evaluating whether particular genotypes or polygenic risk scores explain heterogeneity in MZ within -pair differences; 3) evaluating whether MZ within -pair differences in brain and cognitive decline correlate with differences in TRAP exposures dependent on genotype or polygenic risk scores. We are mindful of work suggesting the importance of considering and adjusting for measurement error, non -shared confounders, and non-normality in the application of the described within -twin pair methods351,352. 4.3.7 Power Analysis. The various MRI-based, cognitive, and polygenic risk score measures are all continuous variables. The only dichotomous variables that are the focus of the analyses are MCI and APOE genotype. With respect to aim 1, phenotypic power estimates are based on sample sizes n=125 for ASL and from n=255 (highly conservative adjustment for correlated observations) to n=1200 for other outcomes for a two-sided =.05. For main effects in Aim 1, we have >80% power to detect small effect sizes (Cohen's d=0.19 [n=255] or d=0.04 [n=1200]) in mean level change in continuous measures from time 1 to time 2 (assuming a within -subject correlation 0.5) for 1a and 1c, and medium effect size d=0.43 for 1b. For mediation hypotheses in Aim 2, we have >80% power to detect small indirect mediation (r2=0.02 -0.04) for n=1200 and medium indirect mediation (r2 = 0.09) for n=255. For moderated mediation via APOE or polygenic risk scores in Aim 3a, we have >80% power to detect differential mediation comparing small to medium indirect effects (e.g., APOE 4+ vs 4 in contrast to cognitive measures). For MZ within -pair differences in Aim 3b, we have >80% power to test for mixture distributions, with within -pair variance ratios ranging from 1.2 to 2.6 across genotypes (e.g., APOE ). Ns are smaller for MCI comparisons with respect to a few MRI-based measures; therefore, we consider those particular analyses to be exploratory. We have power >80% to detect small mean, d=0.27 (n=1200) or medium to large, d=0.68 (n=255), effect size differences between MCI vs non-MC assuming a 13% rate of MCI. For testing moderation of bivariate associations by MCI status, e.g., TRAP and brain risk signatures, we have >80% power to detect medium to large effects assuming a 13% MCI rate. 4.3.8 Limitations and Strengths Limitations. Measurement error will be higher in participants who live in less monitored areas or outside of the contiguous US8. The majority of VETSA participants, however, live near cities with continuous and intensive monitoring. Analyses will be conducted with and without participants in less monitored areas. We will also include covariates reflecting participants' residential history and will be able to analyze whether mobility is due to cognitive status (or other measures). Further, some measurement error due to the inability to estimate time-activity information or micro -environments is inevitable. However, members of Environmental Exposures Core C have developed innovative methods of accounting for such error and residential mobility affects PM2.5 less than NO28.353-355. Other pollutants will not be estimated, but prior studies find little or no confounding due to other pollution sources41,356 -360. It is not possible for us to examine conversion to MCI prospectively in this proposal because there are too few subjects in the VETSA sample who convert from cognitively normal at VETSA 1 to MCI at VETSA 2. Strengths. Air pollution exposure effects are an important public health issue, but they have been understudied in midlife, particularly as they relate to risk for MCI and AD, and particularly in men. The well- characterized, geographically diverse VETSA sample is ideal for addressing these gaps. Starting data collection from a younger age (age 51-60) also helps reduce selection bias. To our knowledge, no human study has examined effects of air pollutants on brain microstructure or cerebral perfusion, but VETSA DTI and ASL data make these advances possible. Although we cannot examine conversion to MCI, we do have a large proportion of MCI subjects who were stable, i.e., they met criteria for MCI on both occasions. This is a strength that is different from the ability to examine conversion. A fair amount of people diagnosed with MCI revert to normal on follow -up, but those diagnosed with MCI at 2 timepoints are more likely to be \"true\" MCI cases. The enormous amount of already collected VETSA data also make this project extremely cost-efficient. As part of a thematic program project, the proposed study capitalizes on collaboration among multiple teams that provide state -of-the-art methods for measuring TRAP exposures, early identification of cognitive decline, and analysis of neuroimaging data. It will also contribute to translational science with aims that are synergistic with the two animal model proposals within the proposed program project. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 582 Protection of Human Subjects Withdrew from Registry 156 V1 Non -participants (V1:NP) 247 Attrition Replacements (V2:AR) Recruitment Flow Chart VETSA TRAP Recruitment Sample 1014 V2:Follow -Up of V1 Replacement 156 V1:Non -Participants at V2 TOTAL N=1417 Recruitment Sample ESTIMATED FINAL SAMPLE N=1262 (82% retention) PROTECTION OF HUMAN PARTICIPANTS 1. Risks to the Subjects A. Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design. a) Selection of Participants and Eligibility: All twins in this study (VETSA -TRAP) were participants in either the baseline VETSA study (2002 -2008; R01 AG018384; AG018386 PIs Kremen & Lyons), participants in the VETSA 2 follow -up and/or are attrition replacement subjects added in VETSA 2 (2008 \u20142014): N=1417. The participants. VETSA 2 followed up the 1237 VETSA 1 and VETSA 1 MRI participants with an 82% retention rate and an additional 243 attrition replacement twins were added. Attrition replacement subjects were randomly recruited from remaining VETR twin pairs in the same age range (51-66 years old). Of the men who did not participate in VETSA 2, 56 (4.5%) had died. Twins are all members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry (VETR) at the Puget Sound VA Healthcare System in Seattle, WA, and signed agreements with the VETR to be contacted to participate voluntarily in research studies. The VETR, created in 1986, is a registry of same sex male twin pairs who both were in the U.S. military between 1965 and 1975 (the \"Vietnam Era\"). Original ascertainment. In brief, the VETSA 1 participants were randomly recruited from 3322 male - male twin pairs that were assessed in the VETR 1992 Harvard Drug Study. The Harvard study, which did not select on the basis of any participant characteristics , recruited from 7500+ twin pairs in the VETR. It attempted to enroll as many twins from the VETR as possible. The majority of twins did not serve in Vietnam or Southeast Asia (78%). The VETR maintains regular contact with all of the twins in the Registry through newsletters and the twins' participation in research studies; thus their database has current addresses (so as to expedite mailings). The VETR also has authority to use Lexus Nexus to assess status of non- responding twins. Eligibility. Our proposal will collect detailed address information from all participants from VETSA 1 and/or 2. Average age was 56 (range 51-60) at VETSA 1 and age 62 (range 56-66) at VETSA 2. Addresses were most recently updated in 2016 \u20142017 when participants were on average 66 years old. Characteristics. The sample comprises a relatively representative epidemiological sample of community -based men in regards to marital, work, income, and health characteristics of American men in their age range based on the United States (U.S.) Census and Center for Disease Control data (CDC). In VETSA 2, for instance, 79% of participants were married; 4.6% never married; 2010 U.S. census figures show 72% of men age 50-59 currently married and 10% never married. Median income for households 55-59 years old in the U.S. was $65,571 while for the VETSA 2 men household median income was $60,000 -$69,000. Many health characteristics were very parallel for men in this age group. Because this is a study of the long term effects of air pollution on brain and cognitive aging building on previously collected data, children are not included in our proposal. No other vulnerable populations (i.e. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 583 Protection of Human Subjects fetuses, neonates, prisoners, institutionalized individuals) are part of the targeted sample. b) Overview of Measurement : Participants will be mailed a consent and a form requesting information on address history since 1994; up to 3 mailings will be sent, with reminder calls following the second mailing. c) Collaborating sites and roles of collaborating investigators. 1. VET Registry (Smith, site PI): Mail questionnaires and consent to collect address history. Nicholas Smith, PhD (Director VET Registry and PI, VETR subaward) is responsible for overseeing address collection and providing historic data to VETSA investigators. d) Data protection. The VETR protects the identity of participants in the twin registry by creating identification numbers that are only accessible to the registry. Dr. Franz and Kremen, and VETR staff will have restricted access to the name -to-number lists. All faculty and staff are required to have training in protections of human subjects and follow internal guidelines (e.g., data cannot be left unattended on desks; computers need to be locked when not in active use, data cannot leave premises, etc.). Only de-identified data sets are provided to co-investigators, students, or post-doctoral fellows conducting data analysis; these are given to the user as encrypted password protected files and\u2014if mailed \u2014 are mailed via trackable mail. All investigators, staff, and students associated with the VETSA must be compliant at all times with university and VA human subjects' protections certifications. All personnel sign \"access agreement forms\" on which they acknowledge the need for confidentiality as well as the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior. B. Sources of Research Material. New data to be collected are residential address histories from 1994 to present which will then be geocoded. Other VETSA data includes interview responses, results of neuropsychological tasks, questionnaires, interviews and sequencing data from previous data collections. Participants will be mailed a consent form, and a letter describing the study along with a standardized residential address history form. a) Sources 1) Address history (new) \u2014collected by mailed questionnaire. Data analyses will include previously collected data/phenotypes from VETSA participants: 2) Previously collected data from VETSA 1 & 2 (cognitive, psychosocial, psychological, blood chemistry); VETSA 1 & 2 MRI studies: raw images plus cortical and subcortical brain structures, diffusion tensor imaging. DHEAS. For APOE and GWAS data. 3) Previously collected archived data from the VETR includes data gathered at induction (~age 20), health surveys administered at ages 37 (Survey of Health) and 40 (NHLBI study), and diagnostic psychiatric interviews (\"Harvard Drug Study\") in 1992 (~age 42). b. How specimens, records, and/or data are collected, managed, and protected . VETSA TRAP participants will be informed about the nature of the study and invited to participate by letter. They will be provided with an address history form, which they will complete and return to the VET Registry. The VETR will then provide that form to the VETSA staff for geocoding. Data are protected by assigning new IDs, limiting access to data on a need -to-know basis, and keeping entered data in password protected files. Only de-identified data sets are shared. c. Who will have access to individually identifiable private information and how is it protected? The staff at the VETR, Drs. Franz and Kremen are the only persons who will have access to individually identifiable private information. Geocoded location data will not be linked with any PHI. There is a very remote possibility someone could be identified by their genetic information, this is addressed in the section on adequacy of protection against risks. Electronic data are protected by password -protected computers and electronic files that are additionally protected by university firewalls and virus protection. All UCSD servers and network access are encrypted. File cabinets and rooms housing computers are locked when not in use by project staff. Codes that link project IDs and personal information necessary to contact and schedu le twins are kept in locked databases on separate protected computers from the ones with data collected as part of the VETSA. C. Potential Risks. a. Potential risks, likelihood, and seriousness to human subjects. The main risks are risks due to breach of privacy and confidentiality. To circumvent this, confidentiality is protected by using ID numbers, rather than names, on study documents and in any analyses. Hard copies and computer -based data are identified only by code. Hard copies of data are and will contin ue to be maintained in locked file cabinets, and computer -based data are and will be stored in password -protected files. The code -book that links ID numbers to participants is and will be maintained in a locked cabinet accessible on Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 584 Protection of Human Subjects a \"need -to-know\" basis to the UCSD Principal Investigators only. Geocoded data provided to Core C for creation of TRAP indices will be blind to any other identifying information. Any MRI data provided to Core B will be de-identified. b. Alternative procedures. The alternative procedure(s) are to not provide cumulative address histories (addresses at VETSA 1 and VETSA 2 were already provided, so some address data is present) or to not participate. 2. Adequacy of Protection against Risks A. Recruitment and Informed Consent. The participation of every subject in this research is voluntary. All participants will be asked to sign a consent form; previous consents allow for use of their previously collected data in ongoing research. a. Recruitment . Recruitment will take place through letters mailed by the VETR. b. Informed Consent . An informed consent is part of the mailed recruitment letter packet which also includes the address history form. During the consent process, per UCSD policies, the participant is informed of the following information about the test protocol. He will be: a) asked to provide as much information about his address history from 1994 to present; b) informed that the data will be rendered anonymous and distributed only to qualified investigators; c) informed that all efforts will be made to maximize his confidentiality; d) informed that there will be no cost to participants; e) informed that there are no treatments associated with the study; f) informed that there are generally low risks associated with tests being conducted; g) informed that all information we collect will remain confidential, and names will not be attached to any data at any time; h) reminded that their previously collected data will be used in the course of data analysis, at no cost to them; i) informed that the de-identified data collected in the course of this study may be made available to other researchers who have access to the (unidentifiable) data collected in this study, and may have commercial interests; j) informed that under circumstances of unique genotypes (if previously collected DNA is examined), there is a very remote possibility that enough information might be developed to allow individuals to be identified and consequently become subject to any risk(s) that might arise as a result of that identification; k) assured that genetic material and the genetic information will not be shared with any health maintenance or health insurance companies; l) informed that the researchers will not give participants specific information about what is found out about their genes; m) informed that non-participation is an alternative to participating in this study, and if the subject decides not to participate, there will be no penalty or loss of any benefits to which the participant is entitled. B. Protection against Risk. a. Procedures to protect from risks: The other risks to human participants relate to the privacy and confidentiality of names and addresses, interview, genotype, and test data. The names of participants who are unwilling to participate in the proposed study will not be released to investigators. Although the names and addresses of Registry members who do participate are released to specified investigators, the unique Registry identification number that links individual Registry data currently in the possession of the investigators with specific names will not be included. Only a unique project ID is included. To protect identity, geocoded location will be kept separate from other data and will never appear in any master data set; geocodes will only be used to create cumulative air pollution indices and will not be available to personnel outside of an internal core group of investigators. Only measures of cumulative TRAP (this measure is non-identifying) will be given to other researchers or will be included in the master database. Staff who work on linking the geocoded data with air pollution data will not have access to any other information/data about the participant. To reinforce the absolute requirement for strict confidentiality, all project investigators and staff will sign a confidentiality agreement. Violation of confidentiality will be sufficient grounds for immediate suspension from employment. Risks of participation are minimal. b. Privacy/Confidentiality of study reports: Using procedures already in place as part of currently funded projects, staff and investigators will be trained extensively on the importance of confidentiality. In terms of data management and data sharing, the sample participant data is given a unique identification number that is separated from personally identifying information. This ID number is used not only for data entry, but also for communication between sites. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 585 Protection of Human Subjects Any data provided by VETSA to collaborators will be stripped of identifiers, and will be transmitted via access to password protected firewalled servers at each site. These data will then be merged with other data at UCSD. After merging, these data will be collated and posted on a secure server at UCSD for examination and analysis by study investigators. All data will be reported as aggregates and never identified by individuals' names. These procedures have been shown to be effective in reducing potential risks to confidentiality. We constantly monitor best practices to maximize confidentiality/privacy. 3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others Participants do not receive any direct benefit. The importance of the results to the fields of neuropsychology, and cognitive impairment is due to the potential for prediction and early intervention for those affected by MCI. If risk and protective factors as well as genetic and environmental influences on cognitive aging can be identified early, the information may be useful for developing intervent ions for modifiable risk factors. Prevention of loss of cognitive function by even a few years can have a major impact on the personal, financial, social, and societal burden of cognitive decline. Thus we believe the risks to the participants are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to research participants and others. 4. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained The development of mild cognitive impairment is an important indicator of Alzheimer's and has potentially severe consequences for the individual and their family. Further, the economic cost of Alzheimer's far surpasses other disorders of similar prevalence. The findings from this proposed study will contribute to the improved identification of individuals at risk for MCI and AD, and could potentially improve outcomes. The procedures in the proposed study all involve minimal risk, and are therefore reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may be expected from this study. An improved understanding of genetic and environmental (and interactive) causes of MCI and cognitive decline will make significant contributions to the potential for developing effective interventions to mitigate or slow cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are extremely costly diseases in terms of years of life-lost, years of disability, as well as their social burden on families (see US Burden of Disease Collaborators. The state of US health, 1990 -2010: Burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors. JAMA. Aug 14 2013;310(6):591 -60812). The project is a unique and valuable resource for studying aging in the US population as well as in veterans. It is unique among other twin studies in its focus on middle -aged adults and use of cutting edge detailed biomarkers, cognitive assessments, brain measures, environmental measures, and its broad array of important psychosocial and health phenotypes collected at multiple time points. 5. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) The procedures in this study involve minimal risk and we therefore anticipate a very low level of adverse events. If, however, an adverse event does occur, we will immediately notify the UCSD University Office of Responsible Research Practices and the NIH. The risks of participation in this study are minimal and we believe we have developed protocols that successfully minimize existing risks. Thus, the benefits of conducting this research program far outweigh the risks. The project provides information with great public health relevance regarding traffic related air pollution as risk factors for AD, MCI, cognitive aging or brain age-related declines. Thus the risks to participants are reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 586 Inclusion of Women and Minorities INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES No new participants will be added to Project 2. Project 2 new data includes collection of address histories from previous VETSA participants so as to create longitudinal TRAP exposure scores for the sample thus the characteristics are those of the parent study. However, within the P01, Project 1 studies only women so the all- male Project 2 counterbalances that. A. GENDER Only male twins will participate. Women are not included for several reasons \u2014first, this study is built primarily on use of previously collected data from the VETSA studies which only included men from the VET Registry. The VET Registry includes only male -male pairs who both served in the military between 1965 --1975. The absence of women in the Registry is not the result of an arbitrary decision during the construction of the Registry; rather, it reflects the sex differences in the likelihood of serving in the military during the Vietnam era. Finally, this is a longitudinal study so the participants will focus on those people previously enrolled in the VETSA studies (all men). With regard to the original construction of the VET twin registry in 1986 and ascertainment of women. During the Vietnam era approximately 5,500,000 men served in the US military. During the same period, 187,381 women served in the military and very few of these women were twins (this indicates that approximately 3.4% of veterans from this era are women). Given that we are able to obtain data from approximately 3,200 male twin pairs from that era, one interpolation would suggest that we might have been able to include 112 female pairs maximum. However, this number is predicated on a number of assumptions that are probably overly favorable. For example, if the percentage of men from the entire population who served in the military was 40%, then the joint probability of both members of a male pair serving in the military if the service of each twin is independent of his co-twin's service would be the joint probability of two men both serving together (0.4 x 0.4 = .16). If the percentage of women from the population who served in the military was 1%, then the probability of both members of a female twin pair serving in the military would be significantly lower than for men (0.01 x 0.01 = .0001). Thus, for every 1,600 pairs of male -male twins there would be one female -female pair. This analysis suggests that the expected number of female pairs would be two. The actual number probably lies somewhere between these most and least favorable estimates, but closer to the latter. Another concern in including female pairs in the Registry was the bias against locating married women when the registry was constructed. Because the identification of twins in the Registry depended upon both twins having the same last name, any pair in which either or both twins changed her last name could not have been identified. We do not have information about the number of female veterans who were married or the proportion of those who changed their last name, but this factor would have systematically eliminated a proportion of female twins. B. MINORITY GROUPS In regard to inclusion of minority individuals in our study, based on VETSA data collection from previous years, the expected distribution of ethnicity is 88% non -Hispanic white, 4.3% African -American, 2.9% Hispanic, 0.6% Native American/Alaskan. The remaining participants describe themselves as more than one race or declined to answer. This distribution is very close to the ethnic and racial distribution of the VET Registry.

Received Date: Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) INCLUSION OF CHILDREN Children and adolescents will not be included as research participants. First this is a longitudinal study of cognitive aging, beginning at mid-life, thus by definition the study is of older adults. This proposal focuses on early identification of mild cognitive impairment as well as mid- to late-middle age change in cognitive and other functioning. Therefore, although a lifelong study of children and/or adolescents would be immensely valuable, it is not feasible at this time. 1 Inclusion of Children Page 588 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 589 Multiple PD/PI Leadership Plan MULTIPLE PD/PI LEADERSHIP PLAN Rationale for choosing a multiple -PD/PI approach Drs. Kremen and Franz have collaborated as co-Directors of the joint VETSA projects (2002 --ongoing), starting with co-writing the first VETSA grant. Given that Project 2 relies on VETSA data, it makes sense to continue this as a collaboration. The long history of collaboration between these two PIs has been very productive and free of problems. Roles and administrative, technical, and scientific responsibilities for the project for each of the PDs/PIs and other collaborators. Dr. Franz at UCSD will provide oversight of the entire research project and implementation of all policies, procedures and processes. Dr. Franz and Kremen will be responsible for the implementation of the Scientific Agenda and the specific aims and ensure that systems are in place to guarantee institutional compliance with US laws, DHHS and NIH policies including biosafety, human research, data and facilities. Dr. Franz will serve as contact PI and will assume overall fiscal and administrative management including maintaining communication among investigators and key personnel through monthly meetings. She will be responsible for communication with NIH and submission of annual reports. Dr. Franz will supervise the data collection activities of the address histories. The PIs will share responsibility for overseeing each of the specific aims. There are some differences in the expertise of each PI. Dr. Kremen has a long history conducting cognitive neuroscience -oriented research, initially with schizophrenia and for well over a decade with cognitive aging research. His expertise has allowed him to integrate experimental neuroscience methods with imaging data and the twin method to address critical issues in the domain of cognitive and brain aging in novel ways. Dr. Franz brings an extensive background in risk and protective factors (environmental, medical, health, and psychosocial) for cognitive and brain aging. Fiscal and management coordination Dr. Franz will be responsible for fiscal and research administration at UCSD. Process for making decisions on scientific direction and allocation of resources The two PIs will have equal responsibility for making decisions on scientific direction and the allocation of resources. As mentioned above, they have been close collaborators for over 15 years. During that entire period there has never been an issue that resulted in conflict or an important decision that was not reached quickly with complete agreement. Data sharing and communication among investigators The PIs and investigators will meet weekly to discuss experimental design, data analysis, and all administrative responsibilities. The PIs and co-investigators share their respective research results with each other. They discuss any changes in the direction of the research projects and the reprogramming of funds, if necessary. A very important function for the leadership structure of Project 2 is facilitating the efficient attainment of the project's goals. To this end, we have multiple meetings where priorities for papers and analyses are discussed. Priorities are set out according to the central aims of the grant and the core issues. We use people with different expertise to weigh in on the papers and analyses in their areas. Anyone wishing to undertake data analyses and prepare a paper or conference presentation submits an abstract explaining the research question to be addressed along with the main variables, required resources, etc. A key consideration is always determining the fit of any proposed analysis with the major study goals. Publication and intellectual property (if needed) policies Publication authorship will be based on the relative scientific contributions of the PIs and key personnel. Proposals for data analysis and manuscript preparation will be submitted to the EC to prevent duplication of effort. We do not foresee any issues regarding intellectual property resulting from the proposed study. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 590 Multiple PD/PI Leadership Plan Procedures for resolving conflicts If a potential conflict develops, the PIs will meet and attempt to resolve the dispute. If they fail to resolve the dispute, the disagreement will be referred to the VETSA Executive Committee. If either PI moves to a new institution, attempts will be made to transfer the relevant portion of the grant to the new institution. In the event that a PI cannot carry out his duties, a new PI will be recruited as a replacement at one of the participating institutions. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

The institutional agreements is attached. INSTITUTION PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR Vietnam Era Twin Registry (Seattle VA) Nicholas Smith, PhD Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 610 Consortium/Contractual Arrangements SCOPE OF WORK VETR16C02: Urban Air Pollution and Increased Risk for Pathological Brain Aging: A Nationwide Twin Study in Men. Vietnam -Era Twin (VET) Registry staff, under the direction of Registry Director, will work with Dr. Kremen from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) to create study -specific data sets for the project entitled \"Urban Air Pollution and Increased Risk for Pathological Brain Aging: A Nationwide Twin Study in Men.\" VET Registry staff, in accordance with the VET Registry policies and procedures, will coordinate initial recruitment efforts for this study; this includes mailing written study questionnaires and telephone follow up for non-responders to this effort. Over the specified recruitment period, the VET Registry will obtain and gather the names and most recent addresses and telephone numbers of about 1,500 twins. VET Registry staff will attempt to locate and recruit every twin to complete the questionnaire from the sample requested by UCSD. The location efforts for both current mailing addresses and telephone numbers will include: National Change of Address searches; Post Office address correction requested on all correspondence; directory assistance; manual searches of electronic directories; Lexis Nexis searches; and telephone contact location efforts. VET Registry staff will print and mail introductory letters, written questionnaires, consent forms, addendums, and provide business reply envelopes (BRE). In an effort to achieve a high response rate among twins, VET Registry staff will send each twin as many as three mailings (more, if requested by a twin). In addition, twins who do not respond either positively or negatively to the mailings will be called to determine whether we have located the right individual and whether they would be willing to participate in the study. Additional questionnaires will be mailed with BRE as required. VET Registry staff will forward all completed questionnaires from twins to VETSA on a bi monthly basis along with a count of all cases in final disposition: deceased, incapacitated; refused; and study (survey) completion. VET Registry staff will also mail compensation to twins who return a completed questionnaire. VET Registry staff will send progress reports to the investigators on a weekly or biweekly basis throughout the course of their involvement in the study. VET Registry staff will update its database with members' updated contact information obtained during data collection. Throughout the duration of the study, the VET Registry manager, research coordinators, and research assistants will track and monitor the use of Registry data, Registry members, and maintain institutional approvals. When the study is complete, Dr. Kremen will transfer any new study data to the VET Registry Data Manager who will prepare data collected and generated as part of this study for archiving into the VET Registry data repository.

Project -002 (634) Page 614 Resource Sharing Plan(s) OTHER RESEARCH PLAN SECTION 13. RESOURCE SHARING PLAN(S) A. Resource and data sharing plan: General. Intellectual property and data generated under this project will be administered in accordance with both University and NIH policies, including the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance of March 5, 2003. Ownership of sole or joint inventions developed under the project will be owned by the institution(s) employing the inventor(s). Inventors shall be determined by U.S. Patent law, Title 35 SC. University and Participating investigators/institutions will disclose any inventions developed under the project and such inventions will be reported and managed as provided by NIH policies. Sole inventions will be administered by the institution employing the inventor. Joint inventions shall be administered based on mutual consultation between the parties. Similar procedures will be followed for copyrights. Materials generated under the project will be disseminated in accordance with University/Participating institutional and NIH policies. Depending on such policies, materials may be transferred to others under the terms of a material transfer agreement. Access to databases and associated software tools generated under the project will be available for educational, research and non-profit purposes. Such acce ss will be provided using web-based applications, as appropriate. Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with normal scientific practices. Research data which documents, supports and validates research findings will be made available after the main findings from the final research data set have been accepted for publication. Such research data will be redacted to prevent the disclosure of personal identifiers. B. Resource and data sharing plan: Specific. Sharing of data generated by this project is an essential part of our proposed activities and will be carried out in several different ways. We would wish to make our results available to the community of scientists interested in genetic and environmental influences on successful aging or age-related decline in the following domains --cognition; brain; personality -psychosocial; and health -medical. We also wish to communicate our results to a general (lay) audience of persons interested in or concerned about aging. Conversely, we would welcome collaboration with others who could make use of the assessment protocols developed in the project. Our data sharing plan includes the following activities: Presentations at National Scientific Meetings. Presentations of our findings at national and international meetings is an ongoing activity (e.g., such as the Gerontological Society of American, Cognitive Aging Association, World Congress on Psychiatric Genetics, International Twin Studies meeting, Behavior Genetics Association, Brain Imaging meetings; American Psychological Association; American Psychiatric Association, to name a few). These meetings are key sources of new information for other researchers on a variety of topics related to genetic and environmental influences on aging. Dissemination at meetings will also include providing information about how to access the data. All VETSA personnel are asked to put access information on their business cards and on their university faculty websites and acknowledgements. Information on public access will be disseminated at meetings, at ICPSR/NACDA, at the VETSA and VET Registry websites, and on list servers such as those for Twin Research, Behavior Genetics Association (BGA), Geriatric Society of America (GSA) and American Psychological Association. Newsletter. The Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry publishes an annual newsletter for registry twins. The VET Registry is within the Department of Veterans Affairs, and it controls all access to registry participants and to data derived from them. The newsletter's intent is to disseminate new information regarding twin research. The activities and discoveries of the VETSA research project will be provided regularly to the Registry for dissemination. The VET Registry newsletter will be asked to advertise information on access to the archived data in the newsletter. This newsletter is also distributed widely throughout the VA. Web Site. A description of the VETSA project has already been submitted to the NIA website (\"Publicly Available Databases for Aging -Related Secondary Analyses in the Behavioral and Social Sciences\"). http://www.nia.nih.gov/bsr, under the heading of \"Databases Under Development.\" We have a university supported website where summaries of the scientific presentations and a bibliography of publications is posted, written primarily for a general audience as well as information about access to the VETSA data. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -002 (634) Page 615 Resource Sharing Plan(s) Collaborations with Consortia. A number of consortia have come into existence that seek to harmonize data across studies in order to increase sample sizes and power. VETSA investigators currently belong to the Consortium on Interplay of Genes and Environment across Multiple Studies (IGEMS), the goal of which is to examine gene and environmental interplay of social contexts and aging through combining data from multiple studi es. We have been invited to work with the International Network of Twin Registries Harmonization Consortium. All of these interdisciplinary collaborative efforts disseminate and distribute the VETSA data to other researchers and enlarge its impact far beyond its original goals. Access to Data. We will release data to other investigators through multiple mechanisms in accordance with UCSD, NIH, and VET Registry policies (after the main findings from the final research data set have been accepted for publication). We avoid publication of partial data because of the risk of misleading findings; therefore, it is our view that data should be made publicly available only for the completed datasets for each wave of the study. We actively pursued the goal of creating a state -of-the-art system for maximizing public access and availability of all VETSA data. Data will be released through contact with the principal investigators, and through requests to the VET Registry at the Puget Sound VA. Dissemination will also occur through the PIs and/or the VET Registry. It should be noted here that previously collected data on these participants from 1986, induction to the military, 1990, 1992 are already housed at the VET Registry. Researchers who wish to use these older data need to work with the VET Registry. The cross -walk between the Registry ID numbers and the VETSA ID numbers is controlled by the VET Registry. VETSA biospecimen data (DNA; frozen plasma) are stored at the VET Registry in keeping with Registry/VA rules to protect the privacy of the participants. Access to biospecimen data is through the VET Registry. One of the tasks of the data management team will be to distribute data to eligible PIs requesting data; data can only be used for research purposes and not identify any individual research participant and, per UCSD policy, PIs will need to provide evidence of IRB approval for their project. We acknowledge the intellectual property and scientific publication elements of the NIH data-sharing policies. We will ask that all researchers using the data for publications or presentations credit NIA/NIH by adding acknowledgements of the NIH grants that generated the data as well as the VET Registy.

Project -003 (425) Page 619 Project Summary/Abstract Project 3 Abstract: Caleb Finch, with Todd Morgan and Christian Pike Age-Sex-ApoE Allele Interactions in White Matter Vulnerability to Air Pollution . To reviewers: new text is italicized . Accelerated cognitive aging is strongly associated with air pollution fine- sized particulate matter (PM 2.5u) in two recent reports of community -living elderly 1, 2). Besides cognitive deficits and loss of white matter, the WHIMS cohort incurred higher risk of dementia (Project 1). In mouse models, nano -sized PM (nPM) from traffic -related air pollution (TRAP -nPM) is pro- amyloidogenic. In our experimental model, mice receive whole body exposure to TRAP -nPM for 150 hours intermittently during 10 weeks (Core C2). Besides brain -wide inflammatory responses , TRAP -nPM causes selective damage to hippocampal CA1 myelinated neurons (Fig. 4) that are most vulnerable in AD and to cerebrovascular ischemia. Because AD risk is elevated in women, particularly in apoE4 carriers, we propose to study age-sex-ApoE allele interactions in the vulnerability of myelinated pathways to nPM using EFAD mice. We also examine the blood -brain barrier (BBB), which shows greater age-related leakiness in human ApoE4 carriers. New data show that nPM increases activity in a TLR4 inflammatory pathway that mediates post- ischaemic neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that TRAP increases AD -related inflammatory processes that synergize with CA1-specific hippocampal neurodegenerative mechanisms . Aim 1 (refocused ): Age and sex in brain susceptibility of C57BL/6 (B6) mice to nPM. Both sexes of B6 mice will be exposed to nPM at ages 2 mo, 10, and 18 mo, spanning reproductive senescence. We will assay hippocampus mediated learning and hippocampal subregional and neuron atrophy. Microglial and TLR4 -TNF pathway responses will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blots. Cerebrovascular and white matter tract responses to nPM exposure is assessed in Core B2 by in vivo multiphoton imaging for regional at 80\u00b5m isotropic spatial resolution will provide fractional anisotropy maps for white matter connectivity. BBB cellular integrity is assessed by confocal microscopy. Collaboration with Project 4 examines B6 brains for synergies of nPM with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Aim 2: Age-Sex-ApoE allele interactions in EFAD mouse responses to nPM. The Aim 1 parameters of age and sex for hippocampal -mediated learning and neurodegeneration in hippocampal subfields are examined in EFAD mice. Cerebrovascular amyloid and microbleeds will be evaluated in EFAD mice. We hypothesize that nPM will show female bias in accelerating AD changes. Aim 3 (major revisions): Role of TLR4. A new mouse model with inducible macrophage/microglial - specificTLR4 myelin degeneration and neurite atrophy. This new model will identify targets of TLR4 pathway components in the effects of TRAP on myelinated pathways . Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Preliminary data (Fig 6) shows in vivo TLR4 pathway responses to nPM (including TNFa) and cites our new bioinformatics analysis of TLF4 pathways relevant to neurodegeneration (Ref 4 above, Woodward 2017). The TLR4 pathways mediate pulmonary edema responses to air pollution and show effects on Abeta levels in a whole genome TLR4 -ko (references cited). Moreover, TLR4 is involved in post -ischemic neural damage (references cited). Aim 1 is refocused on TLR4 inflammatory pathways and includes other TLR4 components: TLR4, CD36, MyD88, and the complement system C5, C5a, C5 receptor, which are also studied in Proj 4, e.g. C5a is increased by in vivo exposure to nPM (Project 4, Fig. 1). 9.

We replaced the TNFR1 new i-mTLR4 -ko will be available to Project 4 to study the hypothesis that adult deletion of microglial TLR4 will lessen post -ischemic neurodegeneration, as suggested by TLR4 targeted drugs.

Project -003 (425) Specific Aims Accelerated cognitive aging is associated with traffic -related air pollution (TRAP), particularly for the PM 2.5u which is monitored by the EPA for a primary standard of 12 ug/m3 annual average. Recent studies of community -living elderly from the WHIMS cohort show deficits of cognition 3 and white matter 4 in association with for residence in PM2.5 above the EPA standard elevated residential levels of PM2.5 (Project 1). Moreover, the WHIMS cohort showed a 70% higher risk of dementia which was enhanced further in ApoE4/4 homozygotes (P01 Overview, Section A2 and Project 1). In the same report, we showed that air pollution nano - sized particles increased brain amyloid deposits preferentially in AD mice carrying human ApoE4. For experimental studies of brain responses to TRAP, mice are given whole body exposure to a neurotoxic nano -sized subfraction of TRAP, designated as nPM, in distinction from the broader ultrafine class of PM0.2u. The TRAP -nPM is pro-amyloidogenic in vivo and in vitro 1. The TRAP -nPM represents a continuous sample of urban air pollution and are extensively characterized for chemical composition and cytotoxicity (Cores C2, C3). After exposure to nPM for defined dose -duration, pilot data show inflammatory responses of TNF and damage to neurites and myelin with selectivity CA1 subfields (Supporting Data ). Given the CA1 vulnerability in AD and cerebral ischemia, we hypothesize that nPM and other components of PM.2.5 synergizes with basic neurodegenerative mechanisms in AD that impact CA1 neurons though mechanisms involving the TLR4 pathway, which also elevates TNF (Fig. 6). Because AD risk is elevated in women, particularly in ApoE4 carriers, we propose studies of age-sex interactions (Aim 1) and interactions with ApoE4 (Aim 2). Aims 1 and 2 also examine the blood -brain barrier (BBB), which shows greater age-related leakiness in ApoE4 carriers. With Project 4 (Wm Mack), we will analyze interactions of nPM with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) for effects on myelinated pathways in hippocampus. Aim 1 (refocused ): Age and sex in brain susceptibility of C57BL/6N (B6) mice to nPM. Both sexes of B6 mice will be exposed to nPM for 3 months, starting at age 2 mo, 10, and 18 mo; the later ages encompass female reproductive senescence for synergies with Project 1 (WHIMS). Ovarian cycling status during nPM exposure will be monitored by vaginal cytology to identify nPM impact on the peri-menopausal transitions, which begin by 6 mo and are complete by 20 mo in B6 mice 5, 6. Hippocampal subregions are examined by histochemistry assayed. Cerebrovascular and white matter tract responses to nPM exposure will be assessed by Core B2 by in vivo multiphoton imaging for regional DTI-MRI, at 80\u00b5m isotropic spatial resolution, will assess white matter connectivity in fractional anisotropy maps. BBB cellular integrity will be assessed by confocal microscopy. Collaboration with Project 4 examines nPM-CCH interactions in mice for hippocampal myelinated pathways. Aim in nPM. EFAD mice carrying apoE alleles and familial AD genes (EFAD) will examine the Aim 1 parameters of age and sex for neurodegenerative changes in hippocampal subfields and for hippocampus -mediated learning. These studies will also define the peri-menopause in EFAD mice, a gap in knowledge, which is relevant to older ages in the expanding use of EFAD mice . Our prior studies with B6 aging females showed strong correspondence to human peri-menopausal stages by the clinical STRAW classification 5. Because EFAD mice show female excess of cerebral arterial amyloidosis (CAA) and microbleeds 7, nPM exposure effects on the BBB will be examined by Imaging Core B2 (Aim 1). We hypothesize that E4FAD females will be most vulnerable to BBB disruption with ensuing microbleeds, and CA1 neuron and myelin damage. It is premature to anticipate age- sex interactions. Collaboration with Project 4 examines nPM-CCH interactions in EFAD mice for hippocampal myelinated pathways. Aim 3 (revised): Role with inducible -specific TLR4 -induced myelin degeneration and neurite atrophy. This new model will identify new mechanistic targets of TLR4 pathway components in the effects of TRAP on myelinated pathways. After careful characterization, the new i-mTLR4 -ko will be provided to Project 4 for study of TLR4 pathway responses to CCH, followed by CCH -nPM interactions. Specific Aims Page 650 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 651 Research Strategy Research Design A. Significance: The search for environmental neurotoxic factors in AD and related disorders (ADRD) has recently considered traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) and the fine-size class of air pollution particles, PM2.5. Two recent human population studies showed strong associations of ambient PM2.5 with increased dementia: the Womens' Health Initiative Mental Study (WHIMS) in our recent publication with JC Chen, Cacciottolo et al 1and in a major population study from Canada2 (P01 Overview). ApoE4 carriers showed the greatest cognitive deficits in WHIMS and the most amyloid deposits in E4FAD mice Cacciottolo et al1. This is the first evidence for gene -environment interactions in a widely distributed AD-risk gene. Nano -sized particulate matter from TRAP (nPM) Cacciottolo al1, confirming other rodent models has neuronal specificity for the hippocampal CA1 myelinated neurons (Fig. 4) that are most vulnerable in AD. We hypothesize that TRAP increases AD risk by brain wide inflammatory processes that synergize with AD-pathway specific neurodegenerative mechanisms . This hypothesis adds specificity to analysis of environmental factors in AD by linking TRAP exposure to amyloidogenic mechanisms and hippocampal targets in AD memory loss. Specifically, we propose that TRAP components accelerate cognitive decline and increase AD risk by exacerbating neurodegenerative pathways from the entorhinal path (the Braak progression of neurofibrillary tangles). These classic findings were extended by MR of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus white matter (PWM) which includes the perforant path. Clinical AD had smaller PWM volumes, while anamnestic MCI had intermediate PWM loss 11, 12. Moreover, cognitively normal elderly with initially smaller PWM volumes incurred accelerated memory decline and increased AD risk 11, 13. Vascular targets are included in this hypothesis because hippocampal CA1 neurons are also vulnerable to cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the rate of carotid artery thickening is strongly associated with ambient PM2.5 in several human populations 14, 15. The blood -brain barrier (BBB) may also be compromised. For example, mice exposed to mixed vehicle exhaust had increased BBB permeability, with altered tight junction proteins (occludin and claudins) and increased metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which degrade tight junctions of the BBB 16. In vitro, macrophages exposed to PM2.5 impaired tight junctions of endothelia, with increased permeability transmigration15. These findings concur with Calderon -Garciduenas' postmortem findings from a highly polluted Mexican mega -city, which showed extravascular lipids in frontal cortex; nano - PM and, serum to occludin and with impaired BBB 17. Although ApoE alleles remain to be studied for TRAP -interactions with BBB, the ApoE4 allele itself increases BBB leakage studies from Zlokovic18. Moreover , ApoE4 controls nPM exposure -NFkB -MMP9 pathway in vascular pericytes. Thus TRAP promotes at least two of the major pathological processes associated with ADRD. Vascular changes also involve the ApoE4 allele risk factor of AD, which also increases BBB leakage 18. Pilot data suggest gene -environment interactions of ApoE4 in WHIMS and in EFAD mice with human ApoE genes (P01 overview, Fig. 1&2). These findings are consistent with postmortem samples from highly polluted Mexican megacities which show myelin damage, diffuse amyloid deposits, and inflammatory changes in young brains19, further exacerbated in ApoE4 carriers20. Human imaging findings further show regionally selective loss of white matter volume in association with high PM2.5 exposure for the WHIMS cohort4; recent MR analysis shows grey matter volume loss in frontal cortex gyri21 (Project 1). On the cell level, chronic nPM exposure decreased levels of glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 in the hippocampus of wildtype B622 and EFAD mice, which is relevant to the hippocampal - mediated spatial learning impairments of aging and AD. In B6 mice exposed for 8 months exposure to concentrated TRAP PM2.5, Fonken23 showed loss of dendritic spines in CA1 neurons, and impaired spatial learning in the Barnes maze. We also found CA1 vulnerability in B6 or EFAD mice after a much shorter nPM exposure 1, 24: Fig. 4B, neurite atrophy in CA1 gyrus; Fig 4D, in CA1. This regional specificity parallels the CA1 neuronal vulnerability during AD and post-ischemia. We recently reported 24 a possible ceiling effect of response in middle -aged mice. While young male B6 mice (3 mo) responded to nPM with CA1 -aged female B6 mice (18-20 mo) had minimal responses to nPM, suggesting ceiling effects (not shown) . These blunted responses match the lack of nPM induction at 18 mo of Nrf2 and HOX -1, basic xenobiotic detoxification responses 25 in collaboration with Forman's lab. The generalizability of this ceiling Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 652 Research Strategy effect will be examined with the additional endpoints in aging male and female B6 and EFAD. The proposed studies with Project 4 for nPM plus cerebral hypoperfusion will further explore this finding. Rodent brains show complex inflammatory responses to TRAP components that are remarkably consistent across multiple genotypes and exposure models26,27. Microglia are robustly activated , with induction of TNF throughout the brain . Further studies on TNFa led us to consider the TLR4 (Toll-like Receptor 4), which controls several pathways in AD post -ischemic neurodegeneration28. Whole genome TLR4 -ko in ADtg mice increased fibrillary and soluble amyloid levels 29-31, with varying effects on microglial activation 29, 30. In vitro, microglial TLR4 is activated by the A peptide via the scavenger receptor CD36 32. In vivo and in vitro, nPM induced TLR4 and MyD88 on the NFkB pathway (Fig 6), consistent with known TLR4 pathways 32, 33. We hypothesize thatTLR4 -dependent pathways in microglia mediate the synergies of cerebral ischemic damage with air pollution that are observed clinically, and in a mouse model in collaboration with W Mack of Proj 4 34. This hypothesis will be tested by i-mTLR4 -ko targeted to microglia (revised Aim 3). Because whole genomeTLR4 -ko protected mice from airway inflammation35, we anticipate that a microglial targeted i-mTLR4 -ko will have less myelin damage and CA1 neurite associated with hippocampal CA1 subfield microglial activity (Fig. 4). B. Innovation These studies innovate in developing mouse models for neurodegenerative responses to TRAP. 1. Our exposure model uses continuously collected nanosized/ultrafinePM from an urban near-freeway site; the nPM subfraction is well characterized for chemistry, particle size, and neurotoxicity 22, 36-39 2. This is the first comparison of response to air pollution of ages across phases of reproductive senescence, in both sexes of wildtype mice, and in EFAD mice carrying human FAD genes and ApoE alleles. 3.

Sex differences in E4FAD levels of TNFa and IL6 (unpublished) . We extended published results in EFAD mice to show female and apoE4 bias in brain TNFa and IL6. Prior studies showed similar E4 female excess of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and cerebral microbleeds7. Fig. 1. Sex and ApoE differences in brain TNFa and IL6.

Hippocampus mediated behavioral deficits are greatest in E4FAD female mice (unpublished) . Our primary behavioral measure is contextual fear conditioning, which is hippocampus mediated and involves the CA1 subregion during retrieval 40, 41. In female EFAD mice, the freezing behavior during retrieval testing for context was weaker in E4FAD vs E3FAD (left panel). Similarly, novel object recognition was weaker in E4FAD vs E3FAD females (right panel) in a task mediated by hippocampal -parahippocampal regions, including entorhinal cortex42.

The higher level of baseline A\u00df load in E4FAD versus E3FAD parallels human AD 7. Fig. 3.

The 'novel object in context' test (NOIC) assesses hippocampal mediated object and context recognition43 and showed significant deficits from nPM exposure of B6 male mice. Fig 5: Novel Object in Context Recognition (NOIC): Male B6 mice were tested for hippocampal mediated object and context recognition after exposure to nPM or filtered air. Discrimination index was analyzed on day 5 and reported as time of exploration of novel object divided by total time of exploration. nPM exposed mice showed a decreased score to nPM toxicity in the brain The TLR4 pathway (Fig. 6) was identified by RNAseq analysis of corpus callosum from nPM exposed mice (Project 4, unpublished). TLR4 was further implicated by PCR of hippocampal tissue from nPM exposed young male 6E), recently published24. Additionally, CD36 was elevated in an independent cohort nPM exposure (Fig. 6C, unpublished), This cohort also verified the TLR4, MyD88 and TNFa increases shown here. TNFR1 was also increased (not shown). Notabl y, the nPM had no detectible endotoxin activity (LPS), confirmed by lack of response to nPM in the MyD88 -independent endocytosis pathway, which is LPS-mediated. A Fig. 6. Chronic nPM exposure induced components of the TLR4 pathway. Young male B6 exposed to nPM responses in -SEM, *p<0.05; < 0.01. Mouse exposures (Core C2) use a nanoscale fraction of TRAP which is sampled continuously by state -of-the-art aerosol samplers 22, 44. The continuous sampling of TRAP in our paradigm is important because air pollution components that vary widely between sites, season, and by time of day. Thus, PM emitted in the morning by traffic are transformed during the day by photo -chemical reactions involving ozone and hydroxyl radicals, with further seasonal variations across the PM size classes 45. Three distinct PM size classes are recognized, with different chemistry and bioactivity: coarse PM, 2.5-10\u00b5 in diameter (PM 2.5-10); fine (PM2.5); ultrafine PM, <0.20\u00b5. The bioactivity in vivo and in vitro varies differs by PM size and chemical composition. Coarse PM are mostly trapped in the upper airways, whereas smaller PM penetrate deeply into the bronchi and the alveolar region of the lung 46. The smaller, and currently unregulated ultrafine % C o n t r o l % C o n t r o l Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 655 Research Strategy PM are more bioactive than PM2.5 in promoting atherosclerosis in mice 47 and in macrophage responses in vitro 48. Core C2 collects ultrafine PM on Teflon filters, for elution by sonication into an aqueous suspension. This fraction was designated as nanoscale PM (nPM) to distinguish it from the total ultrafine TRAP -PM0.2. The nPM are enriched in water -soluble organic carbon, as well as transition elements and metals (e.g. Fe, Cu, V, Ni), but is depleted in black carbon 22 (CoreC2, Fig. 3). At low levels in vitro (1-10 \u00b5g/ml), nPM increases production of free radicals and oxidants (NO, O2.-, H2O2) in glia and neurons 36. For mouse exposures, suspended nPM are re-aerosolized, retaining the same size distribution as their airborne state 22. Aim 1 (refocused) : Age and sex in brain susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice ('B6', wildtype) to nPM. We propose to analyze sex differences in response to chronic nPM exposure for ages that span reproductive senescence: young (2-4 mo), middle -age (10-12 mo) and older (18-20 mo) B6 mice and that are relevant to peri-and postmenopausal women (Project 1). Young male B6 mice (3 mo) responded to nPM with CA1 (Fig. 4B) and reduced CA1 (Fig. We recently reported that aging female B6 mice (18-20 mo) had minimal responses to nPM, suggesting ceiling effects24, which match the lack of nPM induction at 18 mo of Nrf2 and HOX -1 25 (Section A). Because of logistic issues (workload and restricted availability of mice from the NIA Aging Colony), we will first compare sexes at each age in separate exposures (Expt. 1: 3 mo; Expt. 2: 10 mo; Expt. 3: mo). examine hippocampal subregional selectivity by histochemistry and Westerns (details below). Ovarian activity will be documented with daily vaginal cytology for two 3-week periods: 1 week prior and 2 weeks during initial nPM exposure and the final 3-weeks of nPM exposure. Initial age comparisons will not examine behavioral differences. See Chart at end of Methods for the scheduling of experiments. Once we determine the earliest age of vulnerability for nPM effects on myelinated pathways, we will expose that age/sex group to nPM (Expt. 4) for imaging by Core B2 (Y2).: Expt. 4 examines nPM effects on cerebral blood flow and BBB integrity, and on white matter tracts using advanced techniques. Measurement of cerebral blood flow responses to chronic nPM is of high interest for two reasons: (1) the age-decreases in basal blood flow in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus of rat hippocampus 49 and (2) the strong association of carotid thickening with PM2.5 in human populations 14. Core B2 will receive each mouse from Exp 4 to examine in sequence on the same brain: i) in vivo BBB permeability using dynamic contrast enhanced -MRI; vivo cerebral blood flow, tensor (DTI) detect connectivity changes through various diffusivity and tractography (fiber tracking) maps and immunohistochemistry of white matter tracks and BBB integrity using confocal microscopy. The (DTI) -MRI technologies will give expected resolution of white matter tracts at 80u, e.g. Fig. 2 of Core B2 50, 51. Logistics and costs limit us to examining 2 groups of N=10 per year for these complex and labor - intensive analyses. Thus, we must alternate imaging resources between Proj 3 (Y2&5) and Proj 4 (Y3&4). Tissue Preparation and Processing : After whole body saline perfusion, brains are rapidly removed from the skull and hemisected at bregma for frontal and posterior portions. The entire frontal portion is post-fixed in 4%- paraformaldehye and prepared for Kl\u00fcver -Barrera (Project 4). The remaining posterior portion is hemisected: one hemisphere for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and DG-enriched) and the entorhinal cortex (Project 3). The hemisphere side is alternated by individual within experimental groups to minimize contributions from hemisphere asymmetries. nPM effects on AD-relevant regions will be characterized by IHC. i) neurite silver staining neuronal selectivity as we recently reported24; ii) white matter changes by IHC for myelin degeneration in perforant path and Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 656 Research Strategy iii) microglial activation by IHC (Iba-1and CD68). While we appreciate the importance of microglial -astrocyte interactions, our focus we will not include astrocytes. iv) microbleeds in cerebral cortex by hemosiderin; v) plasma protein leakage in cerebral be evaluated for i) APP (sAPPb:sAPPa, Western) and A\u00df pepides blots. Core C3 Table 2 lists responses of these proteins to nPM and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. We include complement C5 components, which was increased in nPM exposed mice used for controls in experimental cerebral ischemia (Project 4, Fig.1 and34) The 300 \u00b5g total soluble protein (RIPA buffer extract) for each microdissected region per brain suffices for multiple Western blots. Expt. 5 will compare the three ages for the sex showing greatest vulnerability; this direct comparison (Expt. 5) is not redundant because it controls for intangible seasonal and other variations between exposures. The Pike Lab (coPI) will examine hippocampal -mediated learning and memory in mice of Expt. 5 (Y3). Because behavioral tests cause stress, which could alter TNF and other stress -sensitive proteins, we prefer to use this group exclusively for cognitive studies. Collaboration with Project 4: Mice with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH; sub-ischemic arterial wall constriction by spiral collar) will be simultaneously exposed to nPM in parallel with our mice. Since many of our endpoints are shared across both projects (e.g., TNF, C5a, IBA-1), we will directly compare our age-matched mice ('intact', no surgery) with Project 4 sham constricted (neck opened but no arterial collar) and CCH - mice. Brain sections are shared by both projects to match aims of each project: Project 3, CA1 neurons, entorhinal perforant path projections; Project 4: white matter, corpus callosum is examined by both Projects 3 & 4. Expected Results : We must confront an apparent contradiction from the presence of FAD genes. The new EFAD data show more amyloid increase by nPM in female than male E4FAD (Fig 3). This finding is consistent with the greater amyloid load in female ADtg mice and postmortem AD brains52, 53. However, estrogen is neuroprotective in FAD mice by reducing A production 54. In wildtype rodents show clear female advantage in experimental stroke, which cause smaller infarcts in young female rats, with diminished sex differences by 10-12 mo 55. Moreover, in wildtypes without FAD genes, estrogen is neuroprotective by reducing A production 54 ; by attenuating neuron damage in CA1 from seizures 55; and by decreasing post - ischemic white matter damage and neurocognitive deficits (Project 4, Fig. 4). Thus, we expect young female vs male B6 mice to show less CA1 neurite atrophy, less loss of myelin basic protein, and less microglial activation from nPM exposure, with subregional specificities. Further, we predict the possible loss of female advantage with age with estrogen deficits in acyclic mice. Studies on middle -aged mice at 10 and 18 mo will define this transition (Section C, Ovarian activity). Despite the rarity of microbleeds in wildtype B6 mice 7, their low baseline of <5 microbleeds/cortex might favor detection of response to nPM in association with the BBB leakage, as observed in rats with a different TRAP model (see above). For Project 4 collaboration on CCH interaction with nPM, we anticipate synergy of nPM and CCH with greater attrition of CA1 neurites and CA1 myelin, because of the CA1 vulnerability to ischemia. From above, we anticipate the 'young female advantage' because of estrogen neuroprotection to ischemia. Based on previous results showing an age-ceiling effect on the nPM response (discussed above), we do not expect to observe greater effects of nPM at advanced age; however, this may not translate to nPM/CCH -exposed mice as a result of diminished vascular reserve and microvascular failure secondary to CCH (discussed in Project 4, A4). We anticipate that mice showing behavioral impairments will also show more neuronal damage, e.g. in CA1 neurite atrophy or myelin degeneration. Caveats : Aging females have complex individual patterns of estrogen loss that may increase experimental variance. We do not propose expensive assays for estradiol of individual mice, but serum will be stored. If we do not see effects of nPM exposure on the novel object in context and fear conditioning tests (Fig. 5), we may consider the Barnes maze and other behavioral tests for hippocampus mediated cognition. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 657 Research Strategy Future Directions: Our focus on brain regional effects of nPM exposure in association with age, sex and genotype will guide our analysis of potential drug interventions, e.g. by sex, age, ApoE allele, and brain region specific vulnerability. Ongoing studies (R01AG051521, Finch PI) and R21 AG05020, Finch PI) examine potential protection from nPM according to the hypothesis that TRAP is proamyloidogenic. Several drugs are being tested for neuroprotection to TRAP in our nPM model: a novel soluble GSM (gamma secretase modulator) which lowers brain A42 in B6 males, without altering Notch proteolysis 56, 57; and memantine, which shows cognitive benefits to AD in humans and mice, in association with lowering A oligomers 58-60. Aim 2: Sex-ApoE allele interactions in EFAD mouse responses to nPM. Studies on EFAD mice employ Aim 1 parameters for neurodegenerative changes in hippocampal subfields and for hippocampal -mediated learning. Based on the female excess of A in EFAD mice from our recent report 18, we hypothesize that nPM will show female bias in accelerating AD changes. These studies in Y2-Y5 will define the peri-menopause in EFAD mice by vaginal smears at older ages relevant to those examined in the expanding use of EFAD mice. As in Aim 1, we first examine E3FAD and E4FAD male and female mice at each age in separate Expt. mo. Expt. 5 will compare the three ages for the sex and genotype showing the most vulnerability. See above for schematic of experiment timeline. As in Aim 1 we will first determine the most critical age of vulnerability for nPM effects on the BBB (CAA, microbleeds, plasma protein leakage). Then, we will expose that age/sex group to nPM (Expt. 4) for imaging (Y5). Collaboration with Project 4: Brain sections from nPM exposed EFAD mice will be provided to Project 4 for analyses of hippocampal These baseline results will guide future Project 4 experiments on examining the synergies of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) and nPM in EFAD mice. Our nPM exposed EFAD mice will serve as controls for CCH mice in Project 4. Our collaboration with the William Mack Lab is well established, see co-authored34. Expected Results : Because female EFAD vs male EFAD have higher TNF (Fig. 1), together with more A deposits (Fig. 3) and more microbleeds 18, we hypothesize that EFAD will show female excess of BBB disruption by nPM exposure with ensuing microbleeds, and CA1 neuron and myelin damage. With the ApoE4 exacerbation of progressive BBB leakiness during normal human aging 61, E4FAD mice are predicted to accumulate more microbleeds and show more BBB leakage than E3FAD. Hippocampal subregions show different ApoE allele effects by sex. Hippocampal -mediated behaviors differ between control female E4- and E3FAD (Fig. 2). Based on these findings, the most vulnerable sex and ApoE allele of EFAD based on myelin and neuritic damage will be examined by Core B2 (Exp 4) for effects of chronic nPM on in vivo cerebral blood flow and postmortem for BBB leakage and tractography by ultra-highfield (DTI) -MRI. Little is known about aging of EFAD mice beyond 8 months. Because APP (Tg2576) mice have 20% shorter lifespans) and develop hydrocephalus not found in wildtype B6 62, we anticipate that EFAD will also die prematurely. Also, other APPtgs show sex differences in lifespan 63. The postmortem diagnosis of hydrocephalus in 15% in Tg2576 was not described in detail (sex not stated) and could involve complications of cerebral microbleeds which show female excess (+). Reproductive organs will also be characterized: females for vaginal cytology and uterine wet weight, which become atrophic at later ages 53; males for weight of testes and seminal vesicles. Despite the increasing use of EFAD mice, little is known about interactions of reproductive aging with AD phenotypes at ages 6-10 months. Because of the strong impact of sex steroids on brain amyloid shown by the Pike Lab 36, this is a critical gap. For brains from Project 4, we anticipate that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) will increase microbleed frequency. However, we predict female excess, because of female excess of microbleeds in EFAD mice. Caveats : If EFAD have poor survival to 18 mo, paralleling the shorter lifespans of APP (Tg2576)62, aging studies will be restricted to 10 mo. We also note a major divergence of mouse and human for sex differences in cerebrovascular pathology. In contrast to mice, humans have male excess of microbleeds in AD samples from ADNI and KIDS 18 and male excess of CAA (Mayo Clinic) 64. These species differences could establish the EFAD mouse as a model for sex-ApoE interactions with cerebrovascular pathology. Future Directions : In breeding of EFAD, the crosses yield similar numbers of non-FAD transgenic ApoE carriers, which could be valuable comparisons for ApoE allele different response to nPM on hippocampal subregions independent of human A.

Project -003 (425) Page 658 Research Strategy Aim 3 (Major revision): We replaced TNFR1 -ko studies in Y3-5 with new studies of the TLR4 pathway in TRAP, which were based on bioinformatics analysis of nPM RNA responses33. New data (Fig 6) shows that nPM exposure increased mRNA of TLR4, CD36 and MyD88, a key TLR adapter as TNFa. The nPM induced -dependent pathway induction TNFa and other cytokines24. We propose studies of TLR4 with a new i-mTLR4 -ko model targeted for microglia made by CJ Pike, co-Investigator of this Proj 3, The CX 3CR1CreER mouse provides cell-specificity as Cre expression is under control of the CX 3CR1 promoter. CX 3CR1-expressing cells in adult mice are limited to microglia in brain and macrophages in gut, kidney 65, 66. Cre is inducible by its linkage to an estrogen receptor mutant that is activated by treatment with tamoxifen. The TRL4loxP/loxP mouse has TLR4 flanked with two loxP sequences (TLR4 (F1) mice are 100% heterozygous (mCre+/-, fl+/-) and are currently breeding. F2 mice composed of 25% experimental animals (mCre+/-, fl+/+), 25% control group (mCre-/-, fl+/+) will be characterized for expression and functional efficacy of the TLR4 deletion, 3 months after tamoxifen treatment (75 mg/Kg, i.p. for 5 days or vehicle). The characterization will be completed in early 2018. We will chose the age and sex from Aim 1 that gives maximum wildtype B6 response to nPM (Aim 1). After tamoxifen treatment both genotypes of mice will be exposed to our standard 150 hours of nPM: 2 filtered air (eight groups of N=10; 80 mice). We will prepare and process the brain as described in Aim 1. Our initial targets include myelin integrity and corpus atrophy and or myelin degeneration, the next experiment will examine cognitive behaviors that are sensitive to nPM (Fig. 5). Unless the control genotype (mCre-/-, fl+/+) show different responses to nPM than wildtype B6 from Aim 1, we will only examine the mCre+/-, fl+/+ mice (+/- tamoxifen). We do not have sufficient budget to examine these mice for Imaging by Core B2. We will evaluate relationships between myelin and neurite atrophy in the attenuates neurite atrophy and or myelin degeneration, the next experiment will examine cognitive behaviors that are sensitive to nPM (Fig. 5). Collaboration with Project 4: We will also provide i-mTLR4 -ko to test the hypothesis that microglial TLR4 post -ischemic neurodegeneration. Our nPM i-mTLR4 -ko mice will serve as controls for CCH mice in Project 4. Expected Results : We predict that microglial TLR4 -ko will decrease myelin degeneration and neuroinflammation based on our data showing TLR4 involvement in the nPM response (Fig. 6 above and 33) and because airway inflammation was attenuated by whole genome TLR4 -ko35. Furthermore, we atrophy is dependent on microglial TLR4 pathways. Because APP processing is largely intra - neuronal, we do not anticipate that i-mTLR4 will alter nPM effects on sAPPa:b, which we showed in wildtype B6 1. Caveats Because we do not know how the genetic makeup of these transgenic mice will alter brain responses to nPM exposure, therefore, we must perform careful analyses of the brains from control mice (mCre-/-, fl+/+ ) to ascertain whether they respond similar to wildtype B6. The stimulation of TLR4 inflammatory pathways in the brain by TRAP components may be mediated by systemic influences emanating from the lung 67. The wide range of ligands that stimulate TLR4 include oxidized lipids32 which we showed are increased in blood during nPM exposure68. Although there may be some direct entry from olfactory neurons, we argue that this cannot reasonably explain the brain -wide inflammatory responses to nPM 69. Future Directions : If the microglial deletion of TLR4 results in smaller nPM -induced myelin degeneration and neuroinflammation, we will consider crossing these mice with hAPP transgenics. These experiments are complicated by the fact that lifelong, systemic TLR4 -ko show increased fibrillary and soluble amyloid levels in two ADtg mice 29-31. Because nPM induces A\u00df deposition (Fig. 3 and 1), these studies could identify unique and shared A\u00df regulating pathways of TLR4 and nPM. We could also time the tamoxifen excision of microglial TLR4 before or after the nPM exposure to address possible prevention versus treatment questions. These studies would give a basis for considering the TLR4 pathway in neuroprotection for air pollution. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 659 Research Strategy C3. Detailed Methods nPM exposure (Core C2): The paradigm for rodent exposure to air pollution was developed by Prof Constantinos Sioutas, who is a leader in analysis of air pollution. Briefly, ultrafine PM are continuously collected on filters at a typical urban site in Los Angeles, 150 m east of I-110 freeway. The ultrafine PM (<0.2 \u00b5m) are transferred into aqueous suspension by vortexing and sonication. Because this re-suspension is enriched in water -soluble organic carbon, but depleted in black carbon, it is designated as nPM to distinguish it from the total ultrafine PM 22. The nPM are re-aerosolized for rodent exposure at 300 \u00b5g/m3 for 5 h/d, 3 d/wk to simulate intermittent exposure to high-density urban traffic. The mouse exposure to PM0.2 at 300 ug/m3 for 150 h (1% of the lifespan) delivers 2.25 mg/kg. For humans, exposure to PM0.2 at 30 ug/m3 for 1% of lifespan yields 2.5 mg/kg, assuming inhalation rates: mouse, 0.025 L/min; human, 12 L/min. cages particle -free filtered air, nPM <1 \u00b5g/m3. For nPM exposure, rodents are transferred from home cages into whole -body exposure chambers allowing free movement. All procedures comply with animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policy, approved by USC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. EFAD mice: EFAD mice were generously given by Mary Jo LaDu (Univ. Illinois at Chicago). E3FAD and E4FAD mice were generated by crossing 5XFAD APOE3 -, and APOE4 -TR (non-FAD carriers) 5xFAD mice are transgenic for 5 FAD mutations (APP K670N/M671L+ I716V+ V717I and PS1 M146L+L286V) controlled by the neuron -specific mouse Thy-1 promoter 70. Ovarian activity during nPM exposure will be monitored by vaginal cytology (daily vaginal smears). The comparison of females aged 3, 10, and 18 mo for 12 weeks of nPM exposure spans major changes in ovarian steroids that could interact with brain inflammatory responses to nPM exposure. Lab rodents are good models for corresponding STRAW Stages of human menopause5. Project Investigators (Finch, Pike, Morgan, Wendy Mack) have published on middle -aged mice as models for the human peri-menopause 71-73. As we showed in detail for B6 mice, after 7 mo, fertility declines sharply and ovarian cycles become irregular during complex transitions to acyclicity with major decline of plasma estrogens: between 18 and 21 mo mice reach the rodent equivalent of menopause, with total follicular depletion and ovariectomy levels of plasma estradiol 5, 74. The timing of these transitions shown in vaginal cytology varies widely between individuals 6, 75, 76. At 10 mo, mice of both sexes are routinely discarded as retired breeders, because of reduced fecundity at ages arising far below the 28-30-mo lifespan. We will not include mice older than 22 mo, when pituitary tumors (sommatotropes, mammotropes) become prevalent 76, 77; the individual variations in plasma GH would introduce additional heterogeneity; moreover, expanding adenomas can distort deeper structures including the hippocampus) 78. In contrast to females, B6 males maintain gonadal function and plasma testosterone into later ages 79, 80 and pituitary tumors are absent at later ages 81. After 10 week nPM exposure, the youngest female group, now aged 6 mo, should still be actively cycling; the 10 mo group, initially chosen for constant estrus (prolonged cycles) will be 13 mo; and the 18 mo group will be 21 mo, when >90% will be anestrus (menopause equivalent with few epithelial cells in the smear). The expected ovarian aging heterogeneity will be tracked by daily vaginal smears for one week at the onset and end of the 10 week nPM. The 10 & 18 mo groups will be selected for constant estrus smears before exposure. At necropsy, uterus wet weights will confirm the vaginal cytology for low levels of estradiol (menopausal) 74 to exclude any mice with residual ovarian steroids; necropsy will also exclude mice with early onset gross pituitary tumors. EFAD mice will also be characterized by vaginal cytology (Aim 2). Although aging studies of EFAD are not proposed, the 6-9 mo ages studied here and by others are at the onset of ovarian senescence. Because ovarian steroids strongly alter brain amyloid, as shown by coPI CJ Pike and others, it is important to know if female EFAD differ from B6 in basic patterns of ovarian aging. Hippocampal -mediated cognitive function (Pike Lab): Object recognition in context (NOIC) and contextual fear conditioning (CFC) will use computer -assisted video tracking and analysis. The NOR and CFC tests were chosen because of their hippocampal dependence 82, 83. nPM exposure impaired NOIC performance (Fig. 5). Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is assessed by the Contextual NIR Video Fear Conditioning System (Med Associates, St Albans, VT) with video recordings 30 frames/sec of freezing response complex, including whisker twitch, tail flick, and lack of movement except respiration. The delay fear-conditioning task measures hippocampus -dependent memory. The fear conditioning setup consists of 4 sound -proofed chambers (Ugo Basile) and a video tracking system using Noldus EthoVision software. During the training protocol on day 1, mice are exposed to 5 trials of pairing the conditioned stimulus (CS) with the unconditioned stimulus (US). Each trial is composed of 120 sec of habituation to the chamber/ inter-trial-interval, followed by 20 sec CS (tone, 75dB) and 2 sec of US (shock, 0.5mA). Freezing behavior is defined by the absence of movement other Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 660 Research Strategy than respiration, and is scored during a baseline period of 120 sec to account for differences in locomotor and exploratory activities between groups. The learning rate is determined by comparing freezing behavior between groups during each trial. On day 2, the mice are tested for freezing to the CS in an altered context with different chamber walls, floor, and smell. The CS is presented 3 times during day 2; freezing behavior is scored to test for classical conditioning. On day 3, the mice are tested for contextual memory by placing them into the same chamber as in day 1, but without a tone or shock, and quantifying freezing behavior for 480 sec. Novel Object in Context Recognition (NOIC): NOIC is used to assess hippocampal -mediated object and context recognition 43. Mice are habituated to novel object recognition chambers with no objects, in two separate locations, on days one and two, for five min./day. On day three, mice are exposed to two distinct objects (A and B) for five min. in the first location. Mice show no preference between objects on day three, and objects A and B are counterbalanced between trials. 24 hr later, mice are placed in location two, with duplicates of object A, again for five min. The following day mice are again placed in location two, this time with objects A and B, again for five min. Time spent investigating the object is recorded, with blinded experiments evaluating behavior on a live video feed. Discrimination index is calculated by exploration time of object B on the final day, divided by total time spent exploring both objects. A discrimination index of 0.5 shows no preference for novel object, with higher than 0.5 indicating novel object preference. See Fig. 5. Cerebrovascular A (Pike Lab) is assessed by two measures (I), number of A-IR blood vessels quantified per area in cerebral cortex. (II) A-IR sections collected at high magnification for image analysis by video capture system (Olympus DP73 camera). Brain images span the cerebral cortex, from 8 brain sections spaced equidistantly across the horizontal plane. In a regular pattern, 6 non-overlapping pictures are captured per section. Using NIH ImageJ 1.48 software, the ROI is outlined to include all cortical layers and exclude underlying white matter. The gray scale pictures are thresholded to create a binary separation between positive and negative IHC. This allows for calculation of the percentage of a section area occupied by the immunoreactive label. From the total load value for the entire cortex in each picture, a separate ROI is outlined around each A-immunopositive blood vessel to calculate the Abeta associated with cerebrovasculature. A Immunohistochemistry (Finch Lab): of EFAD 0.5-2 mm from midline (25 um), sections are immunostained for A amyloid with 4G8 (residues 17-24 at N-terminal of APP; Covance, Princeton, NJ) immersed in 70% acid/5 min. Endogenous peroxidases Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Sections are permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X- 100/15 min, blocked by 30 min incubation in TBS with 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton, followed by primary and then biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:250), and stained by ABC peroxidase and DAB substrate (Vector, Burlingame, CA). For plaque quantification, the bright field images are thresholded to highlight plaques and to diminish background by visual inspection to confirm plaque identity. Cortex sections are evaluated for total plaque number and % area covered (A load) by NIH ImageJ software. Immunohistochemistry: Myelin degeneration is assessed with antibodies for IgG and albumin. Core B2 lists additional antigens for to are assayed 7. Sections are immersed in 5% KCN/5% HCl, rinsed, and counterstained with 2% Nuclear Fast Red. ELISA (A 38,-40,-42 peptides) Cerebral half-cortexes are homogenized in DEA buffer (0.2% diethylamine, 50 with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) Supernates (20,800g x 30 min) are neutralized with Tris-HCl pH (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, Md). Western Blots (Core C3): We estimate 120 brains/ year for 3 to 5 experiments per Aim, which will yield about 360 samples (3 regions, 120 brains) for CoreC3. Tissues are homogenized in RIPA buffer by a teflon pestle on ice. See Core C3 for details of Western blot analysis of 10 \u00b5g protein with infrared detection (Licor system). We estimate a yield of 300 \u00b5g total protein for each of the 2 hippocampal regions -enriched Biosciences) and IRDye 800 (mouse, LI-COR). Silver staining (Finch Lab) adapted from 86. Sections are dried overnight at room temperature and impregnated in 1 M AgNO 3, washed, and incubated in ammoniacal silver, and developed. Bright field images are thresholded to highlight neurites and cell bodies and to diminish background by NIH ImageJ software. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 661 Research Strategy Imaging methods (see Core B2 for further details) DCE -MRI. The DCE -MRI imaging protocol includes measurement of pre-contrast T1-values followed by a dynamic series of T1-weighted images with identical geometry and a temporal resolution of <5 seconds. A bolus dose of Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium -diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, Magnevist\u00ae) is injected via the tail vein and DCE images are collected. Blood -to-brain transfer Ktrans constant maps will be constructed. Laser -doppler flowmetry (LDF). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to hind limb stimulation is measured in anesthetized mice using laser -Doppler flowmetry measured through a cranial window. CBF will be measured and averaged from 3 trials per mouse. BBB permeability. Cortical cerebrovascular permeability is determined with rapid microscopy imaging a custom Zeiss 5MP multiphoton microscope. In vivo time-lapse images will be acquired every 2 min for a total of 30 min after i.v. injection left femoral vein or retroorbitally and multiphoton Z stack images are taken through the cranial window starting at 50 mm below the cortical brain surface and continuing to 500 mm deep through cortical layers II and III, at 1 \u00b5m intervals between each image. Z stacks are reconstructed with ZEN software. Capillary length is analyzed by NIH ImageJ software. DTI-MRI. Diffusion -weighted images (DWI) are obtained from fixed brains using a conventional pulsed -gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence. An optimized six point icosahedral encoding scheme is used for diffusion weighted acquisitions with a single un-weighted reference image for a total imaging time of ~24 hours. Imaging is performed on the entire brain, with emphasis on white matter changes in corpus callosum. Tissue immunofluorescent and fluorescent lectin staining. Fixed brain sections are processed by standard immunofluorescence or lectin staining protocols. Images are taken on a confocal microscope (LSM 510) coupled to a Mai Tai DeepSee Ti:Sapphire, Argon 488, HeNe 543, and HeNe 633 lasers for up to four-color imaging. Regional quantification of stained cells in hippocampus and cortex uses NIH ImageJ software. Statistical analysis (in consultation with Prof. Wendy Mack): Sample size: Our preliminary data (Figs 3-6) show large size effects of nPM exposure: mean difference in nPM vs. control, divided by pooled SD): 1.66 (A in females), 0.50 (A in combined males and females), 2.50 (A in ApoE4 females), 1.73 (sAPP), 1.19 (neurite density in SO), 1.19 (myelin base protein in SO), 1.25 (microglia in SO), 1.51 (NOIC cognitive task),1.71 (TLR4), 1.38 (myd88), and 2.16 (TNF). With samples of 10 mice per group, we can detect nPM effect sizes of 1.32 and larger (80% power, 2-sided alpha=0.05), which are well within the range of effect sizes in preliminary data. Note that many of our analyses will involve nPM main effects with even larger sample sizes, e.g., combined sex, combined age groups. For such nPM main effects (assessed over the levels of another experimental factor), we will have the following minimum detectable effect sizes: 0.91 and higher (n=20 per nPM group, e.g., combined sex); 0.74 and higher (n=30 per nPM group, e.g., combined age groups); 0.63 and higher (n=40 per nPM group, e.g., combined sex/genotype groups). Analysis: Because the majority of our dependent outcome measures are evaluated at one time point per animal, the primary modeling approaches will use general linear models (or rank -based non-parametric analogues) for independent observations. Normalizing transformations will be done as needed. In all experiments, the primary independent variable is nPM vs. control. Other model factors, depending on experiment, include sex, age group (3 levels), genotype, and i-m TRL4 -kockout. Interaction terms will test for differences in nPM effects (by sex, genotype, etc.). For outcomes that are evaluated multiple times within animal (e.g., Aim 1,Exp1,2,3; Aim 2, Exp1,2,3; Aim 3, Exp1; KB, IHC, Western), mixed effects linear models will be used. Besides the main effects specified above (nPM, sex, etc.), we will include additional indicator variables for measurement time; random intercept terms will be specified at the mouse level to model individual deviations from the overall population average. Depending on the distribution of each outcome, results will be presented as mean (SD, SEM) or median (IQR). To consider the multiple hypothesis testing (from multiple types of outcome variables) within experiment, multiple comparisons will be controlled at a 5% experiment - wise false discovery rate (FDR). Dr. Wendy Mack (Division of Biostatistics, Dept of Preventive Medicine) will provide statistical oversight and analytic support; she will recruit a graduate student with appropriate expertise for part -time statistical support. Shared data management and analysis: Projects 3 and 4. Shared data analysis will be done in Experimental Projects 3 and 4, which employ the same mouse models, nPM exposure paradigms, and common analysis of brain imaging by Core B2 and of Western blot proteins by Core C3. As part of study planning, a common REDCap database will be developed in Y1 for data entry and management. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a web-based data application specifically developed for the data entry and management of research data; institutional support for REDCap is provided through the USC Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). REDCap data are seamlessly exported for use in all major statistical Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 662 Research Strategy software applications. Specific to this P01, the REDCap database will use common variable naming and coding for common outcomes across the two projects. Data for each project can be entered in the same database, using the same data structures, by adding a \"study arm\" (one arm for each Project's data), that allows Project data to be maintained as separate entities (by arm), but that still can be exportable as a single database. Databases for statistical analyses of data common to the two projects can be efficiently developed. Table 1.

EFAD (E3FAD and E4FAD) mice were generated by homozygous APOE3 -, and APOE4 -TR. 5xFAD mice are transgenic for 5 distinct FAD mutations (APP K670N/M671L+ I716V+ V717I and PS1 M146L+L286V). They are provided by University of Illinois at Chicago (Mary Jo LaDu, PhD). i-mTLR4 knockout (TLR4 The CX 3CR1CreER mouse provides cell-specificity as Cre expression is under control of the CX 3CR1 promoter.

All animals will be euthanized at end of experiment. Genotyping : Tissue for genetic analysis of EFAD and i-mTLR4 -KO mice will be obtained by tail biopsy (tail snip). Tail biopsies are obtained using clean and sterile procedures, by cutting the tip of the tail perpendicular to the long axis with very sharp scissors about 5mm in length. Alternatively, using a scalpel or razor blade. In mice <3 weeks, hemostasis is easily achieved by light or direct digital pressure around the tip of the tail. When necessary, hemorrhage can be controlled with the use of silver nitrate sticks, applied pressure, or Kwik Stop\u00ae. Vaginal Cytology : Adult female mice are characterized by daily vaginal cytology obtained from lavage with a drip of saline from a firepolished glass pipette at 11am. Mice are manually restrained by gently holding at the scruff of the neck during procedure. Examination of vaginal lavage under microscope reveals the cellular composition present at each day which indicates the cycle stage: estrus, metestrus, diestrus, proestrus. Air Pollution (nPM) Exposure : In each experimental cohort, mice are randomized into either of 2 exposure groups: 1) filtered air or 2) nanoscale particulate matter (nPM). Exposures are performed 3 days per week, 5 hours per day, for 10 weeks (150 cumulative hours). Animals are placed into exposure cages in an exhaust hood that is vented to the outside. Temperature and airflow are controlled to ensure adequate ventilation, Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 664 Vertebrate Animals minimize buildup of contaminants, and to avoid thermal stresses. During each exposure, nPM suspension is aerosolized and delivered to whole -body animal exposure chambers. Filtered air animals are treated identically, but exposed to filtered air without nPM added. Between exposures, animals are returned to standard cages. Novel Object in Context Recognition (NOIC): NOIC is used to assess hippocampal -mediated object and context recognition (Balderas 2008). Mice are habituated to novel object recognition chambers with no objects, in two separate locations, on days one and two, for five min./day. On day three, mice are exposed to two distinct objects (A and B) for five min. in the first location. Mice show no preference between objects on day three, and objects A and B are counterbalanced between trials. 24 hr later, mice are placed in location two, with duplicates of object A, again for five min. The following day mice are again placed in location two, this time with objects A and B, again for five min. Time spent investigating the object is recorded, with blinded experiments evaluating behavior on a live video feed. Discrimination index is calculated by exploration time of object B on the final day, divided by total time spent exploring both objects. A discrimination index of 0.5 shows no preference for novel object, with higher than 0.5 indicating novel object preference. Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is assessed by the Contextual NIR Video Fear Conditioning System (Med Associates Inc, St Albans, VT) with video recordings 30 frames/sec of freezing response complex, including whisker twitch, tail flick, and lack of movement except respiration. The delay fear-conditioning task measures hippocampus -dependent memory. The fear conditioning setup consists of 4 sound -proofed chambers (Ugo Basile) and a video tracking system using Noldus EthoVision software. During the training protocol on day 1, mice are exposed to 5 trials of pairing the conditioned stimulus (CS) with the unconditioned stimulus (US). Each trial is composed of 120s of habituation to the chamber/ inter-trial-interval, followed by 20s CS (tone, 75dB) and 2s of US (shock, 0.5mA). Freezing behavior is defined by the absence of movement other than respiration, and is scored during a baseline period of 120 s to account for differences in locomotor and exploratory activities between groups. The learning rate is determined by comparing freezing behavior between groups during each trial. On day 2, the mice are tested for freezing to the CS in an altered context in which the walls, floor, and smell of the chamber have been changed. The CS is presented 3 times during day 2 and freezing behavior is scored to test for classical conditioning. On day 3, the mice are tested for contextual memory by placing them into the same chamber as in day 1, but without a tone or shock, and quantifying freezing behavior for 480s. Novel object recognition is a measure of cognition in learning and memory that involves parahippocampal regions. Mice are habituated to the apparatus without objects for 5 minutes. Sixty minutes later, 2 identical objects are placed into the box and allowed to explore for 5 minutes (training). Either 1 hour (short -term memory) or 24 hr later (long -term memory), mice are placed again in the chamber with one familiar object and one novel object for 5 min. The time spent exploring the objects is recorded. Imaging (Core B2): DCE -MRI. The DCE -MRI imaging protocol includes measurement of pre-contrast T1- values followed by a dynamic series of T1-weighted images with identical geometry and a temporal resolution of <5 seconds. A bolus dose of Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium -diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, Magnevist\u00ae) is injected via the tail vein and DCE images are collected. Blood -to-brain transfer Ktrans constant maps will be constructed. Laser -doppler flowmetry (LDF). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to hind limb stimulation is measured in anesthetized mice using laser -Doppler flowmetry measured through a cranial window. CBF will be measured and averaged from 3 trials per mouse. BBB permeability. Cortical cerebrovascular permeability is determined with rapid microscopy imaging a custom Zeiss 5MP multiphoton microscope. In vivo time-lapse images will be acquired every 2 min for a total of 30 min after i.v. injection left femoral vein or retroorbitally and multiphoton Z stack images are taken through the cranial window starting at 50 mm below the cortical brain surface and continuing to 500 mm deep through cortical layers II and III, at 1 \u00b5m intervals between each image. Z stacks are reconstructed with ZEN software. Capillary length is analyzed by NIH ImageJ software. DTI-MRI. Diffusion -weighted images (DWI) are obtained from fixed brains using a conventional pulsed -gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence. An optimized six point icosahedral encoding scheme is used for diffusion weighted acquisitions with a single un-weighted reference image for a total imaging time of ~24 hours. Imaging is performed on the entire brain, with emphasis on white matter changes in corpus callosum. Tissue Collection : At the end of the experiment, animals will be anesthetized by the inhalant isoflurane and blood collected through cardiac puncture using heparinized tubes. Animals will then be perfused with phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brain will be removed. Depending on the requirements for each particular experiment, the brain will be dissected (hippocampus, cortex) and immediately frozen or the whole brains will be immersion -fixed. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -003 (425) Page 665 Vertebrate Animals 2. Justifications: Provide justification that the species are appropriate for the proposed research. Explain why the research goals cannot be accomplished using an alternative model (e.g. computational, human, invertebrate, in vitro). In vitro studies or computer/ mathematical models cannot satisfactorily reproduce the white matter/ neuronal injury and functional deficits resulting from nPM/ CCH exposures. Due to cost, ethical concerns, and reproducibility, mice are most appropriate for these studies. We choose mice because of our experience in the models being tested, availability of applicable antibodies/ assays, and potential for future investigations. C57BL/6 mice are the standard murine strain used by most aging researchers and are available through the NIA Aging Mouse Colony. Further, all previous nPM data has been collected using C57BL/6J mice. Altering background strains for the study would likely introduce strain specific differences in exposure responses and outcomes. This variation would increase sample sizes. Male and female mice are selected to study sex influences and comply with recent NIH initiatives to balance sex in animal studies. EFAD -tg and TNFR1 -KO mice are chosen (in conjunction with project 4) to study specific mechanisms (TNF - mediated inflammation/ APOE susceptibility) relevant to nPM and AD. Power analyses are designed to limit sample size. 3. Minimization of Pain and Distress. Describe the interventions including analgesia, anesthesia, sedation, palliative care and humane endpoints to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury. Discomfort, distress, pain, and injury will be minimized in all phases of the experiment. No pain or distress is expected based on our past nPM exposure studies using the same dose of nPM. We have detected subtle learning and memory deficits, mild systemic and neuroinflammation which do not appear to affect the well being of the mouse. We will monitor behavioral changes, e.g., loss of appetite, grooming and activity. Moribund criteria include one or a combination of the following: >20% weight loss, sustained hunched posture, respiratory difficulty, hypo/hyperthermia, inability of access food/water, inability to ambulate or make normal postural adjustments. Mice will be monitored for any signs of stress or pain as well as general criteria outlined by IACUC (Body Condition Score 2, BC2) and will be euthanized. 4. Euthanasia. State whether the method of euthanasia is consistent with the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. After completion of experimental procedures, all rodents will be euthanized by methods approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals.

Soto St., SSB202Y Los Angeles, 442 2993 May 20, 2017 Dear Committee, Caleb Finch and William Mack, I am pleased to confirm my commitment to serve as a collaborator on the experimental research proposed in Projects 3 & 4 for the P01 entitled \"Urban Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease: Risk, Heterogeneity, and Mechanisms\". I have reviewed and collaborated with your teams on the study design and statistical approaches, and will be actively involved in data analysis and interpretation. I have a long-standing collaboration with Professor Finch in P01 AG026572 -011 Brinton (PI) 09/21/16 -09/20/20, Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and we have co-authored several articles, e.g., Yin et al 2015, PMID25921624. I have also worked with Dr. Bill Mack extensively as a co-investigator on your ongoing study (Mack; R01ES024936 Neurotoxicity of Airborne Particles: Role of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion) that utilizes similar analysis methods. In addition, I will advise P01 Projects 3 and 4 in year 1 on the development of a common REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database for data entry and management. I will provide statistical consultation in project years 2 -5 for analysis and reporting of the common dataset. As you know, I am the director of the Biostatistics Resources core of the Southern California CTSI (of which Dr. Bill Mack is a KL2 scholar) as well as the Biostatistics and Data Management Core of the USC Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (of which Professor Finch is a Co-Director and Dr. Bill Mack is a pilot grant awardee). Your work is highly relevant to both of these institutes and biostatistics and data resources from these institutes will be available. Your pilot data demonstrate a female and apoE4 bias in amyloid -beta load in response to air pollution exposure (project 3) and pilot data from Project 4 suggests a role for air pollution in white matter injury and the progression of acute ischemic stroke. I have worked with you in developing the analysis sections of the current grant proposal; the proposed research is very exciting. It incorporates a well-designed study plan to assess the influence of age and sex on the joint influence of particulate matter and underlying cerebrovascular disease. I look forward to working with you to address this topic, and heartily express my support for and commitment to collaborate with you on this research.

Project -004 (437) Page 678 Project Summary/Abstract Joint Effects of Air Pollution and Cerebral Hypoperfusion: Age and Sex Influence Emerging evidence suggests a strong association between traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) and cognitive aging. Clinical and experimental studies demonstrate white matter toxicity and hippocampal neuronal atrophy in the setting of particulate matter (PM) exposure. Little is known, however, about the underlying pathophysiology and selective vulnerabilities. Evidence supports a critical role for cerebral vascular dysfunction in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with cortical hypoperfusion implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Studies have demonstrated increased memory impairment, hippocampal neuronal loss, and altered A metabolism in APPSwInd and APP overexpressing mice exposed to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Individuals with AD or cognitive impairment may demonstrate increased susceptibility to deleterious effects of TRAP exposure through vascular mechanisms. This program leverages experimental models focused exclusively on the cerebrovascular contributions to AD/ cognitive decline. We hypothesize that nanoparticulate matter (nPM) exposure and CCH the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus including the perforant pathway and diffuse white matter tracts. Age and sex variances are evident in AD prevalence, with older women most affected. These factors also impact cerebrovascular reserve, ischemic injury response, and BBB permeability. The proposed project seeks to determine age and sex influences on nPM and CCH exposure alone, and in combination, through the following specific aims: 1) Examine age dependence for the individual/ joint effects of nPM exposure and CCH on white matter toxicity, hippocampal / entorhinal cortex neuronal injury, and neurocognition, 2) Examine sex differences in the independent/ joint effects of nPM and CCH on the above outcomes and, 3) Examine mechanistic pathways by which nPM promotes neurodegenerative processes in the setting of CCH. The nPM exposure model has been used in our group's prior studies. Near roadside urban nPM is collected by means of innovative particle samplers developed by the USC Aerosol group (Sioutas). Whole body exposures are administered. The CCH model has been refined and leveraged to examine inflammatory mediators and BBB. A factorial design will assess independent and combined effects of nPM and CCH on white matter toxicity, hippocampal/ entorhinal cortex injury, and neurocognition. When administered together, we expect these exposures to exhibit synergy. Consistent with AD pathologies, we expect older female mice to demonstrate greatest vulnerability. We hypothesize that effects are associated with inflammatory upregulation and BBB permeability. Baseline interactions established in wild type mice and data from Project 3 will be leveraged to study mechanism in EFAD -Transgenic and inducible macrophage/ microglial specific TLR4 knockout mice. Expected knowledge will advance our understanding of age and sex impact on neurotoxicity secondary to air pollution and vascular mechanisms of cognitive decline evident in AD.

Project -004 (437) Page 680 Facilities & Other Resources FACILITIES AND RESOURCES The University of Southern California provides a rich scientific environment that offers both an intellectual community and infrastructure that will contribute to the success of the proposed research project. The work will be completed at the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute and in the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California. The applicant is a member of institutional groups that provides robust resource support to the project described in this grant proposal: The AirPollBrain Group at USC is an organized research group of scholars who do research on ways to promote optimal neurodevelopment in humans and healthy brain aging by better understanding environmental effects of urban air pollution and gene -environment interactions. The APB group developed from a core of USC's leadership in urban environmental health research in the Los Angeles Basin, with collaborating institutions. Taking a multi -disciplinary research, APB addresses effects of environmental pollution on the brain across the lifespan. Bimonthly meetings convene faculty and trainees on specific topics with a focus on developing new research projects and consortia. The Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center: SCEHSC was established in 1996 to promote environmental health research in Southern California. The Center aims to more fully characterize environmental health hazards, understand the basis for personal vulnerability, and translate research into preventive action to reduce the burden of environmentally -related diseases. This Center has played an important role in the development of the air pollution and cognition initiative, which is a focus of a significant program of research at USC. USC Animal Facility : These facilities are maintained by the Department of Animal Resources under the supervision of Don Casebolt, DVM. The Department employs 2 additional veterinarians, a manager of animal husbandry, 2 facility supervisors and a staff of 12 trained animal care workers (certified by the American Association of Laboratory Animal Science). USC has been accredited under the American Association for Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, since 1966. An Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) reviews all applications to ensure ethical and humane treatment of animals. The Ray R Irani Hall Animal Facility was completed in 2007. The facility has a total capacity of 10,000 rodent cages within the 14,770 net square feet consisting of 20 animal holding rooms, 10 procedure rooms, 2 quarantine rooms, additional rooms for cage processing, bulk autoclave & storage, and office, locker & break rooms. The facility features a \"suite\" design concept of grouping 4 animal holding rooms with 2 procedure rooms into an individual security -controlled suite. Our group has exclusive use of 1 of these suites. The individually -ventilated rodent cages ensures consistent air exchange rates of 50-80 air changes per hour within each cage to reduce ammonia and carbon dioxide levels. Incoming air is high-efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filtered for control of airborne particles. All components of the cages and racks are autoclaved and changed weekly. Wall- mounted supply air blowers and central exhaust plenums reduce noise and vibration. Automatic watering system is supplied to each cage. The exposures for the studies will occur in these facilities.

Stroke Damage is exacerbated by Nano -Size Particulate Matter in a Mouse Model. PloS One 2016. (2) Babadjouni R, et al. Clinical effects of air pollution on the central nervous system: review; J Clin Neurosci 2017. (3) Liu Q et al. Experimental Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Results in Decreased Pericyte Coverage and Increased Blood Brain Barrier Permeability in the Corpus Callosum. Accepted with revisions J Cereb Blood Flow Metab Following the reviewers suggestions, Project 4 R1 presents new pilot data showing synergy between nPM/ CCH exposures; develops a strengthened mechanistic approach, highlights similarities/ differences with Project 3 and concurrent work (R01ES024936); and attends to methodological suggestions. Major text changes are italicized in the proposal. Reviewers suggested that preliminary data made leaps regarding potential interactions between nPM and CCH . Since the prior submission, our lab generated strong preliminary data that establishes synergistic effects of nPM and CCH on white matter degeneration with impact on working memory (C1, Fig. 4). These findings demonstrate a novel synergy, in which the combined influences of the two exposures exceed those expected by an additive model. Our new RNA seq data suggests that CCH may amplify inflammatory responses secondary to nPM toxicity (C1, Fig. 5). Reviewers felt the study would benefit from further mechanistic development. Vascular outcome assessments (capillary density, pericyte coverage, inflammatory markers relevant to complement) are incorporated into Aims 1 and 2 to advance the hypothesis that the age \"ceiling effect\" (older mice do not demonstrate nPM effects beyond their younger counterparts) may not translate to nPM/CCH exposed mice as a result of diminished vascular reserve and microvascular failure secondary to CCH (A3, C3K, C4D). Studies are now designed to examine the TLR4 pathway and interplay with complement C5, a positive feedback loop that has been shown to influence other models of ischemia reperfusion injury. Our gene set enrichment analysis (corpus callosum RNA Seq) data suggests a role for TLR4 pathways/ inflammation following nPM/ CCH exposures (C1, Figure 5). Our pilot studies suggest each exposure (nPM, CCH) incites a microglial - mediated inflammatory response and C5 upregulation (C1). Aim 3 is redesigned. TNFR -1-ko experiments (for which the reviewers lacked enthusiasm) were eliminated and replaced by studies of an inducible macrophage/ microglial TLR4 -ko mouse (i-mTLR4 -ko). Reviewers raised questions about the similarities/ differences between projects 4 and 3. We have clarified project differences and collaborations throughout the proposal; see sections C3, C4E, and C5E. To maximize connections between the projects and increase the overall interaction of the program grant, project 4 employs similar exposure paradigms (nPM, age, mouse strain) and outcome assessments as project 3. Project 4 is designed to assess the effects of nPM in an experimental paradigm that isolates an exclusively vascular influence/ risk factor for AD and cognitive decline (CCH). Although many of the outcomes and experimental parameters are shared with project 3, the scientific questions are independent and different. The study examines synergistic relationships between exposures in a susceptible population with unique pathophysiology (cerebral hypoperfusion; C1). As stated, critical vascular endpoints have been incorporated into project 4 to examine effects of age in nPM/ CCH exposed mice. We hypothesize that findings may be contrary to the \"ceiling effect\" seen in mice exposed to only nPM and described in project 3. Additionally, Project 4 Aim 3 now examines TLR4 and C5 interplay as a central mechanism of injury in nPM/CCH mice. Reviewers questioned similarities with the PI's funded work (R01ES024936). The current study builds on the framework from R01ES024936, but examines mice of different age, sex, and strain to address distinct scientific questions. R01ES024936 establishes a time course for nPM associated white matter toxicity (no CCH) and studies joint effect of nPM/ CCH in young male mice. The current P01 proposal investigates age dependence (old males) and sex differences (young/old females) for individual and joint effects of NPM/ CCH and explores mechanisms of synergism through genetically modified mice (EFAD -Tg and i-mTLR4 -ko). To limit total number of mice/ avoid data duplication, the current project leverages a small \"control/comparison group\" of young male mice from R01ES024936. Differences are clearly outlined in section C1 and described throughout the proposal Concerns regarding methodological details were advanced . In the original stenosis model publication (Shibata, 2004), the 0.18 microcoil was associated with 20% mortality. We have performed 195 refined BCAS procedures with aggregate mortality of about 10%. We have accounted for this in sample size calculations. To address multiple statistical testing/ interactions, we have specified white matter toxicity as our primary outcome, and will test hypotheses related to this outcome at an experiment -wise alpha of 0.05.The remaining outcome measures will adjust for experiment -wise false discovery rate (FDR). A graduate assistant has been budgeted to assist Professor Wendy Mack with statistical analyses. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 708 Specific Aims SPECIFIC AIMS Exposure to traffic -related air pollution (TRAP) may differentially affect susceptible individuals with pre- existing or concomitant neurological disease. Persons with AD or vascular dementia could be exquisitely sensitive to TRAP neurotoxicity secondary to combined effects and shared molecular pathways with cerebral hypoperfusion. This proposal examines individual and joint effects of: 1) nanoparticulate matter (nPM, PM< 0.2 m, nanosize subfraction 2) chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) on endpoints germane to AD pathology in a murine model. Experiments assess effects of nPM in a system isolating an exclusively vascular influence/ risk factor for AD and cognitive decline (CCH). Studies examine age and sex impact and explore putative mechanisms related to BBB permeability and inflammation involving TLR4 and complement C5 pathways. Our group has demonstrated inflammatory changes (reactive microglia, C5 deposition) in the corpus callosum following 10-week exposures in young, male C57BL/6 mice. Our murine CCH model produces consistent white matter degeneration, neurocognitive decline, BBB permeability, and neuroinflammation. Older ages and longer exposure durations result in hippocampal CA1 pathology. We have previously demonstrated C5 upregulation and ischemic protection of C5 deficiency in the setting of CCH. Increased BBB permeability and decreased pericyte coverage are evident. [Recent data suggests synergistic effects of nPM and CCH on white matter injury/ neurocognition in young male mice (Mack; R01ES024936) . Gene set enrichment analysis of corpus callosum by RNA Seq supports a role for TLR4 pathways in neuro - inflammation following nPM/ CCH. We injury mechanism leveraging and C5 pathways. In experimental ischemia/ reperfusion models, this positive feedback loop causes tissue damage through microvascular failure. Loss of BBB/ pericyte integrity may contribute to injury severity.] Age and sex are known to impact AD. Advanced age also influences hemodynamic compromise and collateral outgrowth in the setting of cerebral hypoperfusion. Our pilot data suggests that estradiol mitigates deleterious effects of CCH. Vascular outcome assessments (capillary density, pericyte coverage, inflammatory markers) are utilized to evaluate interactions of nPM age \"ceiling effects\" (older mice do not demonstrate greater nPM effects, project 3) with CCH, as a result of diminished vascular reserve and microvascular failure secondary to CCH. This project leverages data from male C57BL/6 mice exposed to 10 weeks of nPM/ CCH in our ongoing study. Ages of mice (2 and 18 month) are identical to Project 3 for comparison of controls (Project 3) with CCH/ nPM exposed mice across ages and sex. Studies assess joint effects of nPM and genetic alterations relevant to AD (EFAD; new inducible macrophage -microglia TLR4 -ko) in further dissect neuroinflammatory and BBB-related mechanisms. Biomarkers relevant to AD pathology are examined. The following Aims and hypotheses are studied: Specific Aim 1: Examine age dependence for independent and joint effects of nPM and CCH on white matter toxicity, hippocampal CA1/ entorhinal cortex neuronal injury, and neurocognition. This aim will establish main effects and joint influence of nPM and CCH on white matter neurotoxicity and hippocampal/ entorhinal neuronal injury in late middle age (18-month) male C57BL/6 mice. Findings will be compared to young (2-month) male mice from our ongoing study and control/ nPM exposed mice from Project 3. We hypothesize that nPM exposure and CCH will each result in white matter damage, hippocampal CA1/ entorhinal cortex injury, decreased capillary density When co -administered, we expect nPM and CCH to exhibit synergy. We hypothesize that older mice will show greater vulnerability . Specific Aim 2: Examine sex differences for independent and joint effects of nPM and CCH on white matter toxicity, hippocampal CA1/ entorhinal cortex neuronal injury, and neurocognition. This aim will establish main effects and joint influence of nPM and CCH on white matter neurotoxicity and hippocampal/entorhinal neuronal injury in young and late middle age female C57BL/6 mice. Findings will be compared to Project 3 control mice. We hypothesize that nPM and CCH will each result in white matter damage, hippocampal CA1/ entorhinal cortex injury and neurocognitive deficits. When co-administered we expect the exposures to exhibit synergy. We hypothesize that older females will show greatest vulnerability. Specific Aim 3: Examine mechanistic pathways by which nPM promotes neurodegenerative processes in the setting of CCH (major revision) . This aim will study mechanisms contributing to the independent/ joint neurotoxic effects of nPM and CCH in the most vulnerable age/ sex mice (white matter injury) in Aims 1 and 2, and early aims of Project 3. We hypothesize joint effects of nPM exposure and CCH are associated with increases in TLR4/ complement C5 associated inflammatory markers and BBB permeability. BBB assessed through immunofluorescent/ lectin staining (Core B2). Ultra MRI will examine tractography, connectivity, and BBB permeability. The interactions between nPM deletion of macrophage - microglia specific TLR4 will be tested in the setting of CCH during the later years of the program. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 709 Research Strategy RESEARCH STRATEGY A. Significance A1. Traffic Related Air Pollution (TRAP) exposure effects on cognition, white matter and hippocampal pathology: Epidemiologic studies have established strong links between TRAP exposure, cognitive deficits, and accelerated brain aging1-7. These data are reviewed in projects 1 and 2. A recent population -based cohort study revealed that living in close proximity to heavy traffic is associated with higher dementia incidence8. Moreover, J.C. Chen et al. showed associations between greater PM 2.5 exposures and decreased regional white matter volumes in the corpus callosum and frontal/ temporal lobes of community dwelling older women9. Relationships between particulate matter at fine-sized or smaller scales, cognitive decline, and white matter injury have also been recognized in experimental models. Fonken et al. found that long-term exposure to concentrated fine particles impairs spatial memory, upregulates hippocampal inflammatory cytokines, and decreases dendritic spine density in the CA1 hippocampal subregion in mice 10. Allen et al. recently demonstrated that concentrated ambient ultrafine particle exposure in the early postnatal period is associated with microglial activation, white matter hypomyelination, and corpus callosum size reduction11. A2. Effects of cerebral hypoperfusion: Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and white matter injury: Data supports a critical role for cerebral vascular dysfunction in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similarly, cortical hypoperfusion is implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Radiographic studies have revealed diminished resting cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's patients12 and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) has been linked with cognitive impairment and white matter hyperintensities on MR imaging13-17. Investigations have demonstrated that severe atherosclerotic disease is associated with a three -fold increase in AD/ dementia18. Murine models of CCH secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) consistently yield selective white matter injury and neurocognitive deficits19-24. Older ages and longer exposure durations result in hippocampal CA1 pathology25, 26. CCH accelerates memory impairment and hippocampal neuronal loss in transgenic AD mouse models27-29. A3. Potential synergies of TRAP and CCH - inflammation and BBB permeability (revised) : Evidence suggests that TRAP and CCH both modulate inflammatory processes and BBB permeability. Neuroinflammation: Inhalation of ambient air pollution30-33 and diesel exhaust have been shown to elicit inflammatory changes within the brain34, 35. The Finch laboratory (Co-PI) has previously demonstrated a decrease in hippocampal neuronal glutamate subunits following nanoparticulate matter (nPM) exposure36. They a for activation and TNF -induction in nPM-mediated neuroinflammation37. Our group's pilot data reveals that young male mice exposed to 150 cumulative hours of nPM exhibit nearly 50 and 100 percent increases in complement C5, (C5 and C5a) deposition and reactive microglia (IBA-1), respectively, corpus callosum (Section C1, Fig. 1). In vivo nPM exposure of mice induced TLR4 and downstream genes in the hippocampus (Project 3, Fig 6). Further, TLR4 knockdown in mixed glia attenuated the neuroinflammatory response to nPM38. These findings suggest a microglia -mediated inflammatory response involving the TLR4 and complement pathways (C5 component). Candidate gene association studies have suggested that cytokines and inflammation may play a critical role in the progression of cognitive decline in the elderly 39. Tahara et al. demonstrated that an AD mouse model homozygous for a TLR4 loss-of-function mutation demonstrated increased diffuse and fibrillar A deposits and buffer -soluble/ insoluble A in the brain when compared with a TLR4 wild type AD mouse model40. Studies have demonstrated that TLR4 is induced after cerebral ischemia and that genetic TLR4 deficiency is protective in the setting of murine stroke41, 42. In an APP mouse model, complement C5 inhibition results in decreased A plaque load and improved neurological function43, 44. Our findings indicate C5 upregulation after stroke and ischemic protection of C5 deficiency in the setting of CCH (section C1). As two components of the innate immune response, functional interplay between TLRs and C5 activation has been described. 45-47. In the absence of decay accelerating factor, C5a receptor activation up- regulates production48. Mesenteric demonstrate significant complement activation, which is attenuated in the absence of TLR449. As the TLR4 pathways and complement C5 are both induced by nPM and are implicated in cerebral ischemia/ AD, they represent a logical target for neuroprotection in the setting of joint nPM/ CCH exposures.] BBB Permeability: In vitro studies reveal increased permeability of cultured brain endothelial cells and reduced tight junction proteins following diesel exhaust (DE) particulate exposure50. A recent investigation showed that mice exposed to DE had elevated extravascular IgG in the brain parenchyma, indicating BBB compromise 51. Similarly, CCH has been shown to disrupt BBB integrity. In a study of cognitively normal elderly individuals, the presence of incidental cortical microbleeds was associated with significant and pervasive reductions in resting -state cerebral blood flow52. In a murine CCH model, Nakaji et al. demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 710 Research Strategy (MMPs) play a critical role in BBB breakdown, glial cell activation, and white matter injury in the corpus callosum. Genetic knockout and selective inhibition of MMP -2 diminished these responses23. Our group has demonstrated an 18-fold increase in BBB permeability (Evans Blue integrate density) with a concordant endothelial pericyte coverage decrease (40%) in the corpus callosum following experimental CCH in mice (section C1). Studies have demonstrated a critical role for cyclophilin -A (CypA)/ MMP -9 mediated BBB permeability in the setting of AD and mild cognitive impairment. Carriers of the APOE e4 allele with AD and mild cognitive deficits exhibit accumulation of cytokine CypA and MMP -9 in both Using APOE transgenic mice, the Zlokovic laboratory (Core B) has shown that expression of APOE e4 is associated with exposure and CCH are independently associated with neurocognitive decline. When co-administered, the two factors may function synergistically through complementary mechanisms and shared pathways involving neuroinflammation (TLR4/C5) and BBB permeability . Models exist for this type of interaction in the setting of AD. Using microdialysis, Takeda et al. demonstrated that peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in significantly elevated brain IL-6 levels and decreased locomotor activity/ impaired social behavior in an ADtg (APP) mouse vs wild type controls55. Studies have demonstrated greater reference memory impairment, hippocampal neuronal loss, and altered A metabolism in APPSwInd and APP overexpressing mice exposed to experimental CCH27, 28. These findings suggest that AD-related and/or vascular pathways impacting inflammation and BBB permeability could potentiate the neurotoxicity of inhaled nPM. Similarly, our preliminary data suggest synergistic effects of nPM and CCH on white matter injury and working memory in a murine model (Section C1). A4. Neuroinflammation and BBB cognitive changes (revised): [In elderly humans, Wellenius et al. 56 demonstrated associations between PM 2.5 exposure and higher resting cerebrovascular resistance and lower cerebral blood flow velocities . Older stroke patients have increased mortality and more -severe disability compared to their younger counterparts for similar spectrums of stroke severity 57, 58. The lower restorative brain capacity in older patients implies a decreased ischemia threshold from which clinical recovery is possible. Advanced age influences hemodynamic compromise and collateral outgrowth in the setting of cerebral hypoperfusion59. These processes may limit vascular reserve, regional perfusion, and salvage of \"at risk\" tissue following joint nPM/CCH exposures. Vascular outcomes of CCH will examine interactions with an apparent ceiling effect during aging, in which neuroinflammatory responses of middle -aged mice to nPM did not increase above baseline aging elevations60, 61. If aging mice also have the age-decreased vascular reserve shown in elderly humans, the combination of nPM and CCH should have intensified glial hyperactivity and myelin degeneration in aging mice, this would suggest a new neurodegenerative synergy in the aging brain. Cognitive outcomes and brain susceptibilities may demonstrate age and sex interactions in the setting of nPM and CCH. Neuroinflammation and BBB breakdown appear to contribute to sex-related differences in cognition. A distinct male prevalence for inflammatory cerebrovascular diseases exists, with relative protection in younger females62. While physiologic 17-estradiol concentrations generate significant anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous systems of young mice, a majority of studies suggest that these effects do not persist in older females 63. Stroke models reveal that 17-estradiol inhibits transcription of numerous pro- inflammatory cytokines including TNF and IL-6 64 Systemic 17-estradiol administration prevents microglial activation and peripheral monocyte recruitment in response to intraventricular LPS injection64. Estradiol treatment is associated with decreased expression of MMP -9 and complement C3 receptor, and a phenotypic shift in the microglial response. Maggioli et al. examined BBB responses to peripheral LPS administration in male and female mice. Inflammation provoked acute increases in BBB permeability in males and senescent females that were not present in younger females62. In studies of EFAD mice, Cacciottolo et al. demonstrated a female APOE e4 excess of microbleeds, with higher CAA and A levels65. That these strong correlations do not generalize to human AD (older females have fewer microbleeds) suggests potential APOE -sex specificity for divergent causes of cognitive decline. The P01 PIs (Finch/ Chen) recently examined neurodegenerative effects of particulate air pollutants in older women from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and experimental mouse models. Residing in high PM 2.5 locations was associated with increased risks of global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia. Female EFAD transgenic mice exposed to urban nPM over 15 weeks (225 hours) showed increased cerebral -amyloid (fibrillary amyloid and A deposits), both exacerbated by APOE 466. A5. Summary: Significance of the Current Proposal: The Project 4 proposal leverages shared themes and pooled data with the other P01 projects to address several existing research gaps: 1. Isolate and characterize the vascular contributions to cognitive decline and AD in an experimental model. 2. Understand the joint effects Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 711 Research Strategy ne IBA-1 positive cell count (mm2) of nPM and CCH on well-characterized AD biomarkers and outcome measures. 3. Determine the age dependence and sex differences for the individual and joint effects of nPM and CCH. 4. Examine putative mechanisms by which air pollution may accelerate cerebrovascular damage in AD. We hypothesize that nPM increases AD risk/ pathology by neuroinflammatory pathways with CCH . As BBB breakdown can augment toxic effects of neuroinflammation, we also expect that joint nPM/CCH effects will be amplified in carriers of the APOE4 allele, and that effects will be most pronounced in older females. We hypothesize that the age \"ceiling effect\" of nPM (older mice do not demonstrate increased nPM effects61; see Project 3) may not translate to nPM/CCH -exposed mice as a result of diminished vascular reserve and microvascular failure secondary to CCH. The significance and impact of AD and cognitive impairment are profound. Findings from this study can generate a foundation for clinical and translational studies of specific targets relevant to vascular mechanisms that influence progression of AD and cognitive impairment. Dissecting the underlying age and gender interactions may provide additional insight into individual risk assessment and stratification. B. Innovation Within the scope of the larger urban air pollution and AD program, Project 4 isolates and studies the vascular component of white matter/ neuronal injury and cognitive decline. Few investigations focus on this critical aspect of brain aging and AD pathology. Leveraging an innovative approach, experiments employ a refined surgical model of CCH that recapitulates the pathological/ behavioral deficits seen in vascular cognitive impairment. Cerebral hypoperfusion is tested alone and in conjunction with a well-established and innovative ultrafine (nPM) collection/ exposure methodology to study outcomes and biomarkers relevant to AD. This is the first investigation to examine the joint effects/ synergy of these two exposures in at-risk populations (older females, APOE e4 carriers). Further, the study considers putative mechanisms related to BBB permeability and inflammatory mediators involving interplay between the TLR4 and complement C5 pathways. The comprehensive statistical analysis plan (tests for synergy, multivariable analysis) examines interactions relevant to real-world exposures in a multifactorial disease process. Advanced approaches incorporating exposures known to impact pathological processes through similar mechanisms will ultimately help to characterize individuals risk profiles for accelerated cognitive decline and AD. C. Approach C1. Preliminary Studies (revised): Our laboratory has devoted significant effort to studying the independent effects of both PM and CCH (BCAS model) on white matter neurotoxicity and 250 200 * cognitive function. The previously acquired data will serve as the foundation for the aims of the current study, which examine joint 150 100 50 influences of these exposures. We have demonstrated inflammatory changes (activated microglia; complement C5, C5a) in the corpus callosum of young 1.5 Perirhinal Cortex * 0 Filter nPM 20 15 10 5 0 Filter nPM exposure (Fig 1). We have established clear interactions between nPM exposure and cerebrovascular disease. Our group utilized a mouse model to demonstrate a detrimental effect of urban airbor nPM exposure in the setting of acute ischemic stroke67. Following ischemia/ reperfusion, mice exposed to nPM exhibited larger infarct volumes and greater neurological deficits than those exposed to filtered air. Further, the mice exposed to nPM demonstrated increases in markers of inflammation (C5/C5a, C5a receptor) and reactive oxygen species (NADPH oxidase, gp91PHOX) within the region of ischemia67. Our 1.0 0.5 0.0 SHAM BCAS group and others have established that experimental murine CCH results in selective white matter injury and behavioral deficits (8 arm radial maze)19-21. This is accompanied by increased densities of reactive astrocytes and microglia in the region of injury (medial corpus callosum)19. We have also demonstrated evidence of neuronal damage in the perirhinal cortex with associated deficits in novel object recognition (NOR, Fig 2). Our data suggests that inflammation plays a prominent role in CCH -medicated white matter injury. Complement C5 protein deposition increases in the corpus callosum with a time course NOR - Short Term Memory 0.8 0.6 * 0.4 0.2 0.0 SHAM BCAS Fig 2: Top: Perirhinal neuronal Histology Score Discrimination Index * Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Significant differences in revisiting errors between CCH mice exposed to filtered air and nPM (bottom, p<0.05, n=12,13/ group, median, IQR) Number revisiting consistent with white matter injury. Following CCH, C5 deficiency is protective against white matter ischemia and associated with fewer reactive astrocytes/ microglia in the corpus callosum19. Our pilot data also demonstrates decreases in BBB integrity and pericyte coverage in the white matter of CCH -exposed mice. Decreased pericyte coverage and increased BBB permeability are most pronounced on postoperative day 3 following CCH. This precedes any notable white matter injury or behavioral deficits (Fig 3). An ongoing investigation has established the joint effects of nPM and CCH exposures in young male mice (Mack; R01ES024936). New data indicates that, when administered together, nPM and CCH exhibit synergistic effects on white matter injury. Further, nPM/CCH exposed mice show significant working memory deficits on 8 arm radial maze testing when compared to filtered air/CCH exposed mice Normal Cortex 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Post -Procedural Days (Fig 4). RNA seq was performed on white matter (corpus callosum) of mice exposed to nPM and CCH. Reads were assembled and aligned to the mouse reference genome. The analysis model consisted of nPM, CCH and their interaction as independent variables. Gene set enrichment analysis of the preliminary transcriptome suggests that nPM may upregulate inflammatory pathways such as TLR4 (p<0.001). Findings imply that CCH exposure may amplify inflammatory responses secondary to nPM toxicity. The heatmap demonstrates that the number and scope of gene expression is increased most in the setting of joint nPM/ CCH exposure (red bar, left Fig 5). The TLR4 pathway was one of the amplified upstream signals (Fig 5).

Our collaborators have demonstrated a lack of induction of phase II enzymes in older mice exposed to particulate matter60. Our studies suggest that sex may impact susceptibility to CCH through effects of estradiol . Pilot data demonstrates that, following experimental CCH, both male and ovariectomized female mice treated with oral 17-estradiol (1.12 \u00b5g/day for 32 days) appear to demonstrate less white matter ischemic damage and neurocognitive deficits (NOR) than do placebo treated mice (Fig 6). The current study builds on the framework of R01ES024936, but examines entirely distinct scientific questions. R01ES024936 establishes a time course for nPM (alone) associated white matter toxicity and studies joint effects of nPM and CCH in young male mice. This P01 investigates age dependence and sex differences for individual and joint effects of NPM and CCH and explores mechanisms of synergism.

Overall Strategy: This project is designed to assess effects of nPM exposure in a system that isolates an exclusively vascular influence/ risk factor for AD and cognitive decline (CCH). We hypothesize that nPM exposure accelerates cerebrovascular damage underlying memory decline in AD and the effects are influenced by age and sex. Aims 1 and 2 will examine independent and joint effects of nPM and CCH exposures on white matter toxicity, hippocampal/ entorhinal neuronal injury, and neurocognition. Aim 1 will explore age dependence and Aim 2 sex differences. A factorial design will assess independent and combined effects of nPM exposure and CCH in each aim. The primary hypothesis: synergy of the nPM and CCH will be evaluated with an interaction term. Consistency of mouse strain (C57BL/6) and exposure duration (150 cumulative hours nPM; 30 days CCH) will allow for delineation of factors affecting outcome (nPM, CCH, age, sex) in a combined, multivariable model. To limit total number of mice/ avoid duplication of available data, the current project leverages a small subset of experiments from an ongoing study that examines individual and joint effects of nPM and CCH in young male mice (Mack; R01ES024936). The experimental parameters of the current project are chosen to match the ongoing study so that the young male mice can be used as a reference group. Aim 1 will examine older (18-month) male C57BL/6 mice. Findings will be compared to those of young (8-week) male mice. Aim 2 will study young (8 week) and older (18-month) female C57BL/6 mice. Results will be compared across age and sex in the first two aims. All mice will undergo either BCAS or sham surgery. Parallel comparison cohorts of control mice (no surgeries) will be performed for each of the aforementioned groups in Project 3 (Finch) . Corresponding outcome measures are selected for projects 3 and 4. White matter tracts will be evaluated for myelin degeneration and hippocampal subfields/ entorhinal cortex for neurite atrophy. Neurocognition will be assessed across cohorts. One hundred ten and 220 mice will be used for Aim 1 and 2, respectively. Aim 3 investigates mechanistic pathways. Neuroinflammation and BBB permeability will be assessed in the matter tracts and hippocampus/ entorhinal cortex. Cortical cerebral microbleeds and APP processing will be examined. Aim 3 will build upon findings generated from Project 3 and the first two aims of this project. Studies will examine independent and joint effects of nPM and CCH exposures in two groups of mice at the most vulnerable age and sex (white matter injury) from Aims 1 and 2: (1) EFAD -Tg, 2) factorial design will be used; 170 mice will be used for Aim 3. Treatment groups are outlined according to Aim in Table 1.

As C57BL/6 mice were used in the previous nPM/ CCH studies (R01ES024936), the strain was selected to maintain consistency among exposures in wild type experiments. Circle of Willis anatomy could modify the impact of CCH across mouse strains19, 68. Older (18 month) male and female mice will be obtained directly from NIA colonies. Female EFAD -Tg and the new i-mTLR4 -ko mice will be used in Aim 3 to study APOE alleles and TLR4 deletion.

C3.B. nPM Collection: The nPM collection protocol is described in detail in Environment -Neurotoxicology Core C2 and is collected and administered according to standard methodology previously detailed36. Composite analysis of the particulate has been previously documented69. C3.C. nPM Exposure: Mice are transferred to whole -body exposure chambers (20 mice/ chamber) consistent with our group's previous descriptions 36 70-72. We maintain average concentration of 300 ug/m3- roughly twice that of busy roadways 67, 73. Temperature and airflow are controlled for adequate ventilation and to minimize Fig 6: Effects of estradiol on male (left) and OVX female (right) mice in the setting of CCH.

Re-aerosolized nPM or filtered air is delivered to the sealed exposure chambers for 5 hours/day, three -days/ week36. Total exposure duration is 10 weeks (150 cumulative hours) for each aim. Blood pressures are recorded at 7-day intervals throughout the exposure. In prior studies, mice have not lost weight or shown signs of respiratory distress36. The BCAS surgery is performed 4 weeks into the exposure period for a total of 30 days (final 30 days of nPM exposure). Per protocol, neurobehavioral assessments are performed during the final 19 days of the combined exposure. C3.D. Bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model of CCH: Surgery is adapted/modified from a protocol described by Shibata and colleagues.20. Mice are deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal Ketamine/ Xylazine and turned prone. A rectal temperature monitor is placed and temperature maintained at 36.5\u00b0C - 37.5\u00b0C throughout the procedure. A Laser Doppler probe is affixed to the bone over the left cerebral hemisphere 1mm posterior and 5mm lateral to bregma. The mouse is then laid supine and both common carotid arteries are exposed through a midline cervical incision. A microcoil (diameter 0.18 mm) is placed around each common carotid artery (Sawane, Japan) and the skin incision is closed. A PF 5010 laser Doppler Perfusion Monitoring Unit (Perimed AB, Sweden) is used to record CBF values in the supine/ prone positions prior to surgery, and following placement of each microcoil. Mice that do not demonstrate greater than 15 percent blood flow reduction are excluded from analysis. In sham -operated mice, bilateral common carotid arteries are exposed (as above), but no microcoils are applied. Blood pressure/arterial blood gasses are recorded during the procedure and blood pressure is measured at seven -day intervals and prior to euthanasia. C3.E. Brain Harvesting: Mice are deeply anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine and perfused transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PH 7.4) to clear the vasculature of blood. The brains are rapidly removed from the skull. Using an Adult Mouse Brain Slicer Matrix (Zivicinstruments), brains are divided at bregma into frontal and posterior portions. The frontal portion is post-fixed and stored for an additional 24 hours in paraformaldehyde at 4C, then in 70% alcohol, and prepared/ microsectioned paraffin KB staining. posterior portion is hemisected. One posterior hemisphere is post-fixed first as above, then in 20% sucrose 0.1 mol/L PBS (PH 7.4). Next it is frozen, embedded with O.C.T, cryosectioned, and prepared for IHC. The other posterior hemisphere is microdissected (Finch Laboratory) cortex. five microdissected regions are provided fresh to Core C3 for Kl\u00fcver -barrera (KB) staining (primary outcome): Using the paraffin - embedded brain samples, a brain section from bregma to 3mm anterior to bregma (adjusted to mouse atlas) is sliced into 10 serial 3\u00b5m-thick coronal sections. KB staining is performed on the slice located at bregma and the slice just anterior to bregma. White matter integrity is evaluated in the medial region of the corpus callosum according to a previously described four point scale20, 21, 74 (0: normal; 1: fiber disarrangement; 2: marked vacuoles; 3: disappearance of myelin fibers). Analysis is performed by two, blinded -to-exposure, independent observers. Each observer scores the right and left hemisphere (medial corpus callosum) separately. Scores from each observer and each side are averaged to generate a combined score for each slice. The scores from the two slices are then averaged, generating a final score. Immunohistochemistry: Using the frozen brain samples, a section of the brain located from bregma to 3 mm posterior to bregma (adjusted to mouse atlas) is then sliced into 10 serial 20\u00b5m -thick coronal sections. Immunohistochemistry is performed on the regions of slices corresponding to those used for KB staining (just posterior). Antigen is retrieved by microwave, dipped in 3% H2O2 for 10 min, and blocked with serum. overnight sections are treated with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Photographs of immunostained slices are captured by a LAS AF microscope (Leica, Germany). Myelin integrity is assessed (anti-myelin -associated glycoprotein) by the presence of disorganized white matter fibers/ myelin debris (graded 0-3). Degraded myelin is assessed (anti-dMBP slides) by presence of irregular myelin sheaths (0- 3).White matter injury is assessed in corpus callosum, external/ internal capsule, fimbria hippocampus, optic tract, and the fibers of the caudate nucleus in accordance with previous studies75. entorhinal cortex is described in detail in Project 3 methods section (Finch laboratory). C3.H Western Blotting: See Core C3 description for full details. A total 5 per section for Western blot analysis in Core C3. The following inflammatory proteins implicated in the TLR4 715 Research Strategy C3.I. Neurobehavioral Analysis: In the BCAS model utilized for this study, 8-arm radial maze 21, 26, 75 and NOR (section C1) tests have demonstrated strong correlations with white matter ischemic change. A battery of other neurobehavioral tests have not demonstrated differences between BCAS and sham mice 21. 8-arm radial maze and NOR testing have also been performed on mice exposed to both nPM and CCH (section C1). 8 Arm Radial Maze Test: This test evaluates spatial working memory. The apparatus consists of an octagonal platform (20 cm diameter) with 8 radiating Plexiglas arms (47 x 7 cm). A plastic food well is located at the distal end of each arm. SMART software (Panlab, Spain) is used to control doors at the proximal end of each arm and record behavior. The maze is elevated 1 m from the floor. A camera connected to a computer is fixed on the ceiling above the central maze platform. A food deprivation protocol is used to reduce the mouse's initial body weight by 10-15% and is maintained throughout behavioral testing. The mice undergo two pre-training days to familiarize with the apparatus/ task. At the beginning of every trial (one /day) the animal is placed on the central platform with all arm doors open and allowed to make an arm choice. Once the mouse has entered one arm, the other 7 doors are closed. When the animal exits the visited arm it is confined on the central platform for 5 sec by closing the remaining door. After the delay, it is allowed to make a new choice. A trial ends when the mouse retrieves all 8 pellets or 25 minutes elapses. The testing lasts 16 days (one trial/day). For each trial, the number of correct arm entries within first 8 visits, the number of revisited arms, and time taken to complete the task are recorded. Testing is administered on 16 of the final 19 days of the nPM/ BCAS exposure (final 3 days: NOR testing). Novel Object Recognition Test: NOR test evaluates declarative memory. The protocol is based on 3 phases: 1) Habituation: mice are placed in an open -field black Plexiglas arena (40 x 40 x 40 cm). Each mouse is allowed to explore for 15 min. 2) Sample trial: twenty -four hours later, mice are permitted (for 15 min) to explore two identical plastic -made objects (O1 and O2). 3) Object recognition trial: mice are returned to the arena 24 h after the sample trial, and observed under equivalent conditions, in the presence of one familiar object (O3, identical to sample trial), and one novel object (N1). Location of the objects is counterbalanced across the trial. Exploration is defined as sniffing/ touching the object. Analysis of object exploration includes frequency, duration, and latency. Object recognition is calculated for each animal as novelty exploration index, with the formula: TN1 / (TN1 +TO3), with T indicating duration of object exploration76, 77. The three testing phases are administered on the final three days of the exposure (nPM, CCH). C3.J. Quantitative immunohistochemistry: neuroinflammation: Using the frozen brain samples, a section of the brain located from bregma to 3 mm posterior to bregma (adjusted according to mouse atlas) is then sliced into 10 serial 20\u00b5m -thick coronal sections. Immunohistochemistry is performed on the regions of corpus callosum slices corresponding to those used for KB staining and in the hippocampal and entorhinal cortex slices as described in Project 3. Antigen is retrieved by microwave, dipped in 3% H2O2 for 10 min, and blocked with serum. Slides are incubated overnight with Interleukin -10 (IL-10) antibody (1:50; R&D, MN). Subsequently, sections are treated with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) and visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Photos of the immunostained slices are captured by a LAS AF microscope (Leica, Germany). Optical DAB signal density is analyzed and quantified using NIH Image J software (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Images are converted to 8 bit and adjusted to threshold to count the positive cells per 0.1mm square. Protocols follow the NIH Image J user guide. C3.K. Capillary density : Density of CD31 -stained capillaries will be measured from multiple slices adjacent to the immunohistochemistry slices (C3.J) in identify regional microvessels78, 79. Using stereology, capillary density will be quantified as length of blood vessels less than 10 \u00b5m diameter per volume tissue. Total length of capillaries (mm) is divided by the volume of brain tissue scanned (mm3) to obtain capillary density (length per tissue volume). C3.L. Blood -brain barrier permeability : In vivo cerebral blood flow, BBB permeability, and angiography measurements will be obtained by multi -photon microscopy. Confocal microscopy will be used to perform coverage, staining. In later project years, ultra-highfield MRI will be leveraged to detect connectivity changes in the white matter through diffusivity and tractography maps and quantification of BBB permeability using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) -MRI. See Core B2 for methods description. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 716 Research Strategy C3.M. Microbleeds: Hemosiderin is assayed histochemically by Prussian Blue. are immersed in solution of 5% KCN/5% HCl, rinsed with water, and counterstained with 2% Nuclear Fast Red. This will be performed in conjunction with the Finch lab (see details Project 3) C3.N. Cerebrovascular A: In EFAD mice, cortical A-IR blood vessel density will be measured by the Finch laboratory (See Project 3 methods). Total A and A associated with vasculature will be quantified. Cortical sections will be stained for fibrillar A, total A, and microglia associated with fibrillar plaques. C3.N. Shared data management and analysis: Projects 3 and 4: We will capitalize on the harmonization of the experimental Projects 3 and 4, which share mouse strains, nPM exposures, and common analysis of proteins by Core C3. As part of study planning, a common REDCap database will be developed in Y1 for data entry and management. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a web-based data application specifically developed for data entry/ management of research data; institutional support for REDCap is provided through the USC Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). REDCap data are seamlessly exported for use in all major statistical software applications. Specific to this P01, the REDCap database will use common variable naming and coding for common outcomes across the two projects. Data for each project can be entered in the same database, using the same data structures, by adding a \"study arm\" (one for each Project's data), that allows Project data to be maintained as separate entities (by arm), but that still can be exportable as a single database. Databases for statistical analyses of data common to the two projects can be efficiently developed (click of a button). Dr. Wendy Mack will advise Projects 3 and 4 in Y1 on development of this database, and will provide statistical consultation in Y2-5 for analysis and reporting of the common dataset. C4. Specific Aims 1 and 2 (refocused outcomes): Specific Aims 1 (age dependence) and 2 (sex differences) each investigate individual and joint effects of nPM and CCH exposure on outcomes relevant to AD pathology. Immunohistochemical and behavioral analyses examine neurodegenerative pathways from the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus including the perforant pathway and global white matter tracts. We hypothesize that nPM exposure and experimental induction of CCH will each produce ischemic damage in white matter tracts and neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and entorhinal cortex. We expect that this injury will correlate with neurocognitive deficits in working memory and NOR. When administered together, we expect these exposures (nPM/CCH) to exhibit synergy. Preliminary evidence of this synergy has been demonstrated in our young, male mice (see section C1). Specific Aims 1 and 2 share common exposure sources (nPM/CCH), experimental designs, and outcome analyses. Therefore, following independent rationale sections, shared experimental exposure and outcome analysis sections are outlined. C4.A. Specific Aim 1: Examine age dependence for independent and joint effects of nPM and CCH on white matter toxicity, hippocampal CA1/ entorhinal cortex neuronal injury, and neurocognition Based studies of inflammation and BBB permeability, we hypothesize greater effects in older male mice (lack of ceiling nPM ceiling effect, see A4, and Project 3). 18 month C57BL/6 male mice will be used for this aim. A randomized study of 4 groups will be employed to assess effects of nPM exposure and CCH. These exposures will be tested independently and together (for joint effects) in a factorial design. Outcomes of the 18- month mice (individual and combined exposures) will be compared to 8-week mice from an ongoing study with the same experimental parameters (Mack; R01ES024936). C4.B. Specific Aim 2: Examine sex differences independent and joint effects of nPM and CCH on white matter toxicity, hippocampal CA1/ entorhinal cortex neuronal injury, and neurocognition. Based on literature supporting the impact of estrogen on inflammation and BBB permeability, we hypothesize a young female advantage. A) Young (8-week) and B) Older (18-month) female C57BL/6 mice will be used for this aim. For each of the two age cohorts, a randomized study of 4 groups will be employed to assess the effects of nPM exposure and CCH. These exposures will be tested independently and together (for joint effects) in a factorial design. Outcomes of the 8-week and 18-month female mice (individual and combined exposures) will be compared to one another and to the 8-week and 18-month male mice in aim 1. This will allow for testing of both age dependence and gender influence on the independent and joint effects of the exposures. C4.C. Experimental Exposures for Specific Aims 1 & 2 (Fig 7): Each cohort of C57BL/6 mice (Aim 1: 18- month male; Aim 2A: 8-week female, Aim 2B: 18-month female) will be randomized to 1 of 4 study groups: 1) filtered air/ sham surgery or 2) filtered air/ CCH or 3) nPM/ sham surgery or 4) nPM/ CCH. The mice will be exposed to nPM or filtered air for 5 hours/day, 3-days/ week for 10 weeks. Thirty days from the end of the exposure, mice will undergo either CCH or sham surgery. This will allow for outcome assessments at previously validated time points (30 days CCH). Control mice that have not undergone CCH or sham surgery are prescribed an identical nPM/ filtered air exposure paradigm in Project 3. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 717 Research Strategy Filtered Air Control (no surgery) Pathology (n=16) CCH Behavior (n=10) Pathology (n=16) SHAM CCH Behavior (n=10) Pathology (n=16) SHAM Behavior (n=10) 8 arm maze 18 days NOR 3 days nPM/ Filtered Air (10 week) CCH/ Sham 30 days C4.D. Outcome analysis for Specific Aims 1 and 2: Following completion of the exposures, white matter tract damage, hippocampal/ entorhinal cortical neuronal injury, capillary densities, and neurobehavioral outcome will be assessed. Two parallel, identically exposed, subgroups will be included for outcome analysis in each exposure group: 1) Pathology subgroup : white matter/ immunohistochemistry/ western analysis (n=16 mice); 2) Behavioral testing subgroup : 8-arm radial maze, NOR (n=10 mice, Fig 7). Pathology subgroups: 1) White matter ischemic injury will be determined by KB staining (primary outcome). MAG and dMBP staining will be performed to further characterize the white matter damage in the corpus callosum, perforant pathway, fimbria hippocampus, internal capsule, optic tract, and fiber bundles of the caudate nucleus, 2) Neurite atrophy will be quantified in the hippocampus/ entorhinal cortex silver staining subregion and dentate gyrus. 3) Capillary densities the callosum and entorhinal/ hippocampal cortex. Behavioral subgroup: 1) Neurobehavioral outcome will be assessed by 8 arm radial maze and NOR testing. C4.E. Statistical Analysis: Specific Aims 1 & 2: For each cohort of mice (older males, young females, older females) outcomes will be analyzed with a 2x2 ANOVA (nPM X CCH, Fig 8). Comparison data will be generated for young males as part of the existing (R01ES02493) study. Main effects of each exposure (nPM/CCH) will be tested. The primary hypothesis related to synergy of the nPM and CCH exposures on outcomes will be tested with the interaction term (testing hypothesis that mean outcome in the combined nPM+/CCH+ group will be greater than that predicted from summed main effects of CCH+ and nPM+). Null hypothesis: C1/C4= C2/C4+C3/C4. Post hoc analyses will perform pairwise group comparisons with adjustment for multiple testing. Perioperative blood pressures/ physiologic parameters will be compared between groups (mean, SD) to help differentiate vascular from direct toxic nPM effects. Next, combining all 4 groups (young males, old males, young females, old females), a general linear model will be analyzed, with white matter score (or biomarker values, see Aim3) as the dependent variable. Independent variables will include sex, age group, CCH, and nPM exposure. Association tests will include tests for main effects of each of these variables; product terms will be used to test for interactions (e.g., sex-nPM to test for sex differences in nPM effects, age-nPM to test for age differences in nPM effects). Collaboration with Project 3: Surgically intact mice of the same ages/ sex are studied in Project 3 Aim 1. Shared outcomes enable comparisons between these and our CCH/ sham mice. Direct collaboration will allow processing of brain sections from each project for all relevant outcomes. For reliability, each outcome will be performed in a single laboratory (Finch: CA1/ entorhinal neurons, perforant path projections; Mack: corpus callosum, white matter tracts). Specific behavioral outcome measures are unique to Project 4 (8 arm maze, NOR) as these are the only validated tests demonstrating injury in the CCH model. C5. Specific Aim 3: To examine the mechanistic pathways by which nPM promotes neurodegenerative processes in the setting of CCH (major revision). We hypothesize that neuroinflammation and BBB permeability play critical roles in the individual and combined effects of nPM exposure and CCH. We expect that administration of nPM and CCH together substantially increase levels of biomarkers of inflammation/BBB breakdown compared to those predicted for either exposure alone. Further, we hypothesize that, in the setting of nPM exposure, the APOE4 allele (EFAD -Tg) will exacerbates CCH attenuating the inflammatory TLR4/ TNF pathway (i-mTLR4 from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion . C5.A. Rationale : Aim 3 concentrates on putative mechanism of injury in the most vulnerable (white matter injury) age/ sex mice from the first two aims and Project 3. We expect the largest effect size for both the independent and joint influences of nPM/ CCH in older female mice. This focus would enhance synergies with Projects 1 and 3. The brain specimens from Specific Aims 1 or 2 (most vulnerable group) will be leveraged for the first part of this aim and each relevant biomarker (see below) assessed for independent and joint exposure effects. Planned analyses concentrate on biomarkers of inflammation and increased BBB permeability that are impacted by aging and regulated by estradiol/ estrogen receptors. Additional exposure groups will be required for BBB analysis (multiphoton microscopy), as the cranial window procedures could impact KB staining and immunohistochemical analysis. The second part of the aim explores mechanism through the use of genetically Fig 8: Analysis table for synergy between particulate matter/ CCH within each cohort Fig 7: Exposure paradigm Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 718 Research Strategy modified mice. EFAD transgenic mice will be used to determine the susceptibility of hypoperfused mice with the APOE e4 allele to nPM exposure. i-mTLR4 -ko mice will be studied to examine/ characterize the inflammatory response to nPM in the setting of CCH. The transgenic mouse strains are the same as those investigated for nPM effects in Project 3. Therefore, all mice will be subjected to CCH. A randomized study of 4 groups will be used to assess the effects of nPM exposure and each specific genetic alteration (TLR4 deletion or APOE allele). AD associated biomarkers will be compared in a factorial design similar to that described in Aims 1 and 2. Cerebral amyloid and cortical microbleeds will be quantified in EFAD mice. C5.B. Inflammation : Immunohistochemistry will be performed on brain sections from 32 mice (n=8, each of 4 pathology subgroups) from the vulnerable group in Aim 2. Cells will be counted and densities quantified in the same regions of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, corpus callosum and white matter tracts assessed for white matter/ neuronal injury in Aim 2. Numbers of reactive microglia (IBA-1) and astrocytes (GFAP) will be quantified as previously described 19, 20, 22, 80, 81. Deposition/ density of the following pro- inflammatory mediators will be determined: TNF, IL-6, C5/C5a/C5a receptor, and IL-10. Prior studies have demonstrated that each of these TLR4 or complement pathway -related markers are influenced by PM and/or cerebral ischemia in brain tissue34, 35, 82-84. Outcomes will be analyzed with a 2x2 ANOVA (nPM X CCH) for each biomarker. Main effects of each exposure (nPM, CCH) and joint influence will be tested (see C4.E) C5.C. Microbleeds : On the 32 mice studied for inflammation, cerebral cortex will be assessed for microbleeds. Although rare/ sporadic in C57BL/6J mice, the presence of cortical microbleeds is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow in the elderly52. C5.D. Blood Brain Barrier Permeability (Core B2): Confocal microscopy utilized lectin staining in the same 32 mice studied for inflammation (C5.B). Cells will be counted and densities quantified in the regions listed above. In vivo cerebral blood flow, BBB permeability, and angiography measurements will be performed in year 3 and 4 of the project by multi -photon microscopy on an additional cohort of 32 group; 1)-nPM/ -CCH, 2)-nPM/+CCH, 3)+nPM/ These assessments characterize alterations in cortical tissue blood flow and BBB integrity. Ultra -highfield MRI will be performed to detect connectivity changes in the white matter through diffusivity and tractography maps and quantification of BBB permeability using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) in 8 additional mice per group from Specific Aim 2 (32 total mice). Regions of interest will include corpus callosum and other white matter tracts, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. New generation CCH microcoils (Sawane, Japan) are MRI compatible. C5.E. Exploratory studies of inflammation and BBB in genetically engineered mice: Genetically engineered (EFAD -Tg or i-mTLR4 -ko) mice will be exposed to nPM or filtered air for 5 hours/day, 3 days/week for 10 weeks. Thirty days from the end of the exposure all mice will undergo CCH surgery . They will be compared to control mice that have not undergone CCH surgery in Project 3. The experimental paradigm is similar to that described in Aims 1 and 2 except that a single cohort (n=16/ group) will be used for pathology studies only. EFAD -Tg studies : Seventy, EFAD mice (most vulnerable age/ sex) exposed to CCH will be randomized to one of four study groups: 1) filtered air/ APOE e3; Mice will be induced for TLR4 -ko prior to exposures (see details Project 3). Seventy mice (most vulnerable age/ sex) exposed to CCH will be randomized to one of four study groups: 1) filtered air/ control; or 2) filtered or 4) -ko. Outcome Analysis : Following exposure, pathology endpoints used in Aims 1 and 2 will be measured (white matter, hippocampal CA1/ entorhinal injury, capillary densities) as described in section C4.D. Additionally, cerebrovascular amyloid deposition and microbleeds will be quantified in the EFAD -Tg study. Studies suggest impaired vascular reactivity and resting -state cerebral blood flow is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cortical microbleeds52, 85-88. Inflammatory markers (C5.B) will be measured in the i-mTLR4 -ko experiments. Primary outcomes will be analyzed with a 2x2 ANOVA (nPM exposure by strain type) in each section of the aim (EFAD -Tg or i-mTLR4 -ko). Main effects of each exposure (nPM, strain type) and joint influence will be tested. We expect the APOE e4 allele to accelerate the deleterious effects of nPM exposure through increased BBB permeability and microhemorrhages. We anticipate these findings to be more pronounced in the CCH mice (Project 4) than controls (Project 3). We also expect that inducible TLR4 deletion will diminish the nPM-incited inflammatory response and result in injury reduction (relative neuroprotection). Collaboration with Project 3: Transgenic experiments in the second part of this aim will be guided by the immunohistochemical studies in the first part of the aim and the results of Project 3 (EFAD -Tg; i-mTLR4 -ko). Further, each group of surgically intact mice from Project 3 will serve as control comparators for the corresponding exploratory transgenic experiments described above. C6. Limitations and alternative approaches Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 719 Research Strategy C6.A. nPM exposure composition : This study utilizes re-aerosolized nPM as opposed to a direct exposure. As described in our group's publications utilizing this paradigm 36, 60, 70, 72, the exposure is an aerosol with size and chemical composition characteristic of a typical urban area. The aerosol constituents are present at highly increased, yet environmentally realistic, levels. Our overall effects seen in vivo/ in vitro, at representative exposure scenarios, are well-defined. Our laboratory has demonstrated the effects of this exposure in the setting of cerebral ischemia67. An advantage of this approach, over particle concentrators, is maintenance of consistent aerosol size and composition across an entire exposure period. This consistency is not possible when working with real world PM, which varies diurnally, seasonally, and spatially. C6.B. nPM mechanism of brain entry : Mechanisms and pathways by which TRAP enters the brain are not clearly defined. Potential routes include direct olfactory nerve transport, indirect influence through systemic inflammation, infiltration of peripheral monocytes, and ingestion. Our proposed studies are not constructed to directly answer these questions/ characterize portal of brain entry. Experimental design assesses end organ impact of nPM exposure (irrespective of entry route) on white matter, hippocampal/ entorhinal cortex, and neurocognition in the setting of CCH. Perioperative physiologic parameters will be compared between groups in each aim to help differentiate vascular from direct toxic PM effects. If blood pressure differences are found, carotid and peripheral arterial specimens will be examined for biomarkers of inflammation listed in Aim 3. C6.C. Selection of age cohorts : The human epidemiology P01 studies examine both females (Project 1) and males (Project 2). Our older (late middle age) mice are of similar age to the individuals in the WHIMS -MRI study (Project 1) and the VETSA 1 and 2 cohorts (Project 2). Although ages of our young mice do not directly translate to the human study cohorts, they were chosen to establish baseline data for novel exposures. The mouse ages selected for investigation are identical to those in Project 3. We chose the extremes (2-3 months, 18 months) of the age range employed in project 3 (rather than 10 months) to maximize potential outcome differences among cohorts. If the 10-month mice demonstrate the greatest injury in Aim 1 of Project 3, we will substitute this age for the older mice in our aims. Likewise, we will study the age and sex that demonstrates the most significant effects in the early aims of Project 3 and 4 for our Aim 3 mechanistic studies. C.6.D. Estrogen Cycling : As aging females have complex/ variable patterns of menopause, estrogen cycling will be considered in female experiments. Full rationale and protocol descriptions are reviewed in Project 3. Briefly, older (18-month) mice typically exhibit ovariectomy levels of plasma estradiol levels (menopause). Female mice will be monitored for vaginal cytology during exposures (see Project 3). At the end of the 10-week exposure, the young mice (start 8, end 18 weeks) will be actively cycling. The older group (start 18, end 21 months) will be predominantly anestrus, but younger than the typical age of pituitary tumor growth (22 months). Ovarian heterogeneity will be tracked by vaginal smear during nPM exposure. Eighteen -month mice will be selected for constant estrus smears prior to exposure. Serum will be stored for hormonal analysis. C6.D. Modeling exposure interactions : nPM and CCH exposures are co-administered, with CCH/ sham procedures occurring 30 days prior to culmination of the nPM/ filtered air in each aim. Although the exposures do not always occur in this temporal pattern clinically, the sequence was chosen to optimize technical feasibility/ translational generalizability and represent the most common paradigm. Relevant outcome measures (white matter injury, neurocognitive testing) have been validated in the CCH model at 30 days. Generally, individuals are exposed to air pollution at younger ages and develop cerebrovascular disease later. The air pollution exposure often remains throughout the onset and progression of cerebrovascular disease. There are implicit assumptions: 1) Those with the exposure could only acquire the susceptibility factor after an extended period. From a translational standpoint, individuals could have significant white matter injury from other causes, regardless of prior air pollution exposure. 2) For the proposed biological/outcome measures, this design assumes mechanistic interactions only take place when CCH follows air pollution exposure chronologically (precluding mechanistic insights for populations who move from low to high exposures in late- life). Although assumptions limit generalizability with regards to lifetime exposure sequence, the design allows for assessment of nPM/CCH exposures in early/ later life and maximizes synergies with Project 3. C6.E. Selection of mice for mechanistic studies (Aim3 ): To study mechanisms of a joint exposure across age ranges and sex would require a very time-intensive study with prohibitively large sample sizes. We will select the age and sex that is most vulnerable in Aims 1 and 2 and Project 3 for use in Project 4 Aim 3. We expect the effect size of the joint influences (nPM/CCH) to be greatest in older females (Aims 1 and 2). In the EFAD and i-mTLR4 -ko experiments, we expose all mice to CCH and maintain a single age and sex. This avoids incorporating up to 5 exposure variables into the study cohort (nPM, transgenic, CCH, age, sex), and rendering individual/ joint effects challenging to determine in a multivariable analysis without large sample sizes. However, we do incorporate a control cohort (no CCH) from Project 3 for comparison in each study. Although genetic models may have less direct translational relevance than pharmacologic inhibition, the Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 Page 720 Research Strategy inducible macrophage/ microglia i-mTLR4 -ko mouse enables temporally relevant induction, and restriction of genetic alteration to cell lines most relevant to nPM associated brain injury. The inducible model helps mitigate compensatory effects of longstanding TLR4 deletion. C6.F. Behavioral testing: In Aims 1 and 2, parallel (separate) subgroups are used for pathology analysis and behavioral assessment to eliminate the possibility that food deprivation/ behavioral testing will impact white matter toxicity and protein expression. If older mice are not cooperative with the complex 8-arm radial maze, alternative tests used in our laboratory (nesting, burrowing, less complex y-maze testing) will be pursued. C7. Power and Sample Size Calculations C7.A. Specific Aim 1 and 2: We base sample size calculations on estimates of primary outcome (white matter toxicity) from our CCH and nPM studies in young males. We expect effect sizes for the older males/ females to be larger. Based on previous/ pilot studies, the white matter injury effect size for CCH is 1.5 (mean difference=0.6, SD=0.4) and for nPM exposure is 0.42 (mean difference=0.29, SD=0.695). We expect a white matter ischemia score of 1.86 in the mice exposed to both nPM/ CCH. This yields an effect size for nPM exposure in the CCH+ cohort that is 3-times larger than the nPM effect = 1.86). To demonstrate expected mean group differences of a synergistic effect between nPM and CCH (two-sided alpha= 0.05, power=80%), roughly 16 animals will be needed per cell. A total sample size of 64 mice is therefore required for KB staining (pathology subgroup). These same mice will be used for neuronal injury quantification. Eight mice in each pathology subgroup will also undergo immunohistochemistry/ western blot protein analysis (see C7.B). An additional 10-mice/ group (behavior subgroup) will be included for neurocognitive assessment. This yields a total of 104 mice/ cohort (64 pathology, 40 behavioral subgroup). Accounting for a roughly 10% surgical mortality (half mice undergo surgery), 110 mice are required for each individual age/ sex cohort in these aims (Table 2). Three hundred -thirty total mice are required for Specific Aims 1 and 2. Multivariable analysis: In the combined white matter injury analysis using 16 animals per group, each experiment (young/ old males, young/ old females) includes 64 animals, yielding 256 animals. We calculated minimum detectable correlation (min r) for a single variable in a multivariate model, testing at 2- sided alpha=0.05 and 80% power. The min r depends on amount of variability (R2) in the outcome explained by other independent variables in the model; for 256 animals, min r ranges from 0.12-0.16 for R2 from 15%-50%. We will be able to statistically detect correlations of this magnitude and larger. C7.B. Specific Aim 3: We expect to use tissue obtained from the mice in Specific Aim 1 or 2 (most vulnerable age/ sex) for quantitative immunohistochemistry (8 mice/ pathology group). Prior CCH and nPM experiments have suggested adequate power to detect a significant difference in reactive microglia (IBA-1) between CCH and sham mice at sample sizes calculated in Aim 2. Specifically, the CCH effect sizes of 2.53 (mean difference=49.55, SD=19.57) in these experiments are large. nPM effect size is 2.01 (mean difference=68.99, SD=34.3). We calculated the power to detect such group differences, given 8 animals per group. Power to detect main effects of nPM and CCH will be greater than 99%. We will have sufficient power to detect synergistic relationships between CCH and nPM. We will have 86% power to detect differences in nPM effects that are 1.75 times higher in CCH+ groups vs. CCH - groups and 98% power to detect nPM effects that are 2 times greater. We believe differences and effect size will be similar for the other biomarkers. In vivo cerebral blood flow, BBB permeability, and angiography will require additional brain specimens. Based on prior experience, we believe that 8 mice per group should be sufficient to provide statistical power. As we expect a roughly 10% surgical mortality, 34 total mice will be required for BBB studies. Multivariable analysis: For combined biomarker analysis, each experiment will include 32 mice (8 per group), yielding 128 mice. Testing at 2-sided alpha=0.05; 80% power, min r will range from 0.17-0.22 for R2 from 15%-50%. For EFAD/ i-mTLR4 -ko studies, we assume sample size requirements similar to Aims 1 and 2 (n=16 per exposure) and roughly 10% mortality. Therefore, 174 additional mice will be required for this aim (34 BBB analysis; 70 each transgenic, Table 3). C7.C. Multiple testing: We specify white matter toxicity as our primary outcome and will test related hypotheses at an experiment -wise alpha 0.05. The remaining outcome measures (neurite density, behavior, inflammation, etc.) will adjust for experiment -wise false discovery rate (FDR); raw and FDR-adjusted p-values will be reported.

Identify the species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers of animals to be used in the proposed work. C57 Black 6 mice (both male and female), EFAD transgenic (tg) mice knockout) used in this proposal. EFAD (E3FAD and E4FAD) mice were generated by homozygous APOE3 -, and APOE4 -TR. 5xFAD mice are transgenic for 5 distinct FAD mutations (APP K670N/M671L+ I716V+ V717I and PS1 M146L+L286V). They are provided by University of Illinois at Chicago. i-mTLR4 -ko mice are generated by targeted deletion of the TLR4 gene from macrophages/ microglia. A transgenic mouse carrying an excision enzyme (Cre recombinase) in a specific cell-line (CX 3CR1 promoter, JAX020940) and a transgenic mouse expressing TLR4 flanked with two loxP sequences (JAX024872) are crossed. In order to achieve cell-specificity, Cre expression is controlled by the CX 3CR1 promoter and is inducible via linkage to an estrogen receptor mutant activated by tamoxifen. First generation (F1) litters are 100% heterozygous (mCre+/-, Fl+/-). heterozygous mice are crossed mice (Fl+/+). Second is (mCre+/-, fl+/+), 25% control (mCre-/-, fl+/+). Transgenic mice will be validated by genotyping. The strains, ages, sex and numbers used in each aim are listed below: Specific Aim 1: n=110, male, 18 month C57BL/6 mice Specific Aim 2: n=110, female, 8 week C57BL/6 mice and 110, female18 month C57BL/6 mice Specific Aim 3: n=34, most vulnerable age/ sex C57BL/6 mice Specific Aim 3: n=70, most vulnerable age/ sex EFAD (35 E3FAD, 35 E4FAD) mice Specific n=70, most vulnerable age/ sex i-mTLR4 -ko/ WT, (35 ko, 35 WT) mice By the above calculations, a total of roughly 500 mice will be used for this project Animals will be kept on a 12-hour light/ dark cycle with water available at all times and food ad libitum (except during deprivation for behavioral group). All animals will be euthanized at end of experiment. In Aims 1 and 2 of the study, main effects of each exposure (nPM, CCH) and joint effects will be tested. One hundred ten male, 18 month old, C57BL/6 mice will be used for Specific Aim 1. One hundred ten, 8 week old, and one hundred ten, 18 month old, female C57BL/6 mice will be used for Specific Aim 2. In Specific aim 3, thirty -four, C57BL/6 mice (most vulnerable age/ sex) will be used for in-vivo blood brain barrier analysis studies. The other thirty -two, C57BL/6 mice (most vulnerable age/ sex) mice used in Aim 3 will be the same mice used in Aim 1 or 2 (most vulnerable age/ sex). Also used in Aim 3 will be seventy (most vulnerable age/ sex) EFAD mice (35 E3FAD, 35 E4FAD) and seventy (most vulnerable age/ sex) i-mTLR4 -ko mice (35 i- mTLR4 -ko, 35 wild type). In each of these transgenic experiments, the independent and joint influences of nPM exposure and strain type will be assessed in the setting of CCH (all mice exposed to CCH). Neurocognitive assessment will be performed 30 days after the CCH/ sham procedure (in 10 mice from each group in Specific Aims 1 and 2). Animals will be euthanized on the same day for tissue analysis. Air Pollution Exposure In each experimental cohort, mice are randomized into either of 2 exposure groups: 1) filtered air or 2) nanoscale particulate matter (nPM). Exposures are performed 3 days per week, 5 hours per day, for 10 weeks (150 cumulative hours). Animals are placed into exposure cages in an exhaust hood that is vented to the outside. Temperature and airflow are controlled to ensure adequate ventilation, minimize buildup of contaminants, and to avoid thermal stresses. During each exposure, nPM suspension is delivered to whole - body animal exposure chambers. Filtered air animals are treated identically, but exposed to filtered air without nPM added. Between exposures, animals are returned to standard cages. Bilateral Carotid Artery Stenosis (BCAS) BCAS surgery is adapted/modified from a protocol described by Shibata and colleagues. Mice are deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal 80-100 mg/kg Ketamine and 5-10 mg/kg Xylazine, using a 27.5 gauge needle. Paralube is applied to the eyes to prevent corneal abrasion. The mouse is turned prone. A rectal Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 722 Vertebrate Animals temperature monitor is placed and temperature maintained at 36.5\u00b0C - 37.5\u00b0C throughout the procedure. A Laser Doppler probe is affixed to the bone over the left cerebral hemisphere 1mm posterior and 2mm lateral to bregma. The mouse is then laid supine. The surgical site is shaved, prepped with antiseptic, and draped. Both common carotid arteries are exposed through a midline cervical incision. A microcoil (diameter 0.18 mm) is placed around each common carotid artery (Sawane Spring Co, Japan) and the skin incision is closed. A PF 5010 laser Doppler Perfusion Monitoring Unit (Perimed AB, Sweden) is used to record CBF values in the supine/ prone positions prior to surgery, and following placement of each microcoil. Mice that do not demonstrate greater than 15 percent blood flow reduction are excluded from analysis. In sham -operated mice, bilateral common carotid arteries are exposed (as above), but no microcoils are applied. Blood pressure/arterial blood gasses are recorded during the procedure and blood pressure is measured at seven - day intervals and prior to euthanasia. Neurocognitive Testing In the BCAS model utilized for this study, 8-arm radial maze and NOR (unpublished data, see section C1 of research strategy) tests have demonstrated strong correlations with white matter ischemic change. An extensive battery of other neurobehavioral tests has demonstrated no differences between BCAS and sham - operated mice. The behavioral testing is performed on the final 19 days of the exposure (nPM/ CCH). 8-arm maze test is performed on 16 of the final 19 exposure days and the NOR testing is performed over the final three days. 8-Arm Radial Maze Test: 8-arm radial maze test evaluates spatial working memory. A food deprivation protocol is used to reduce the mouse's initial body weight by 10-15% and maintained throughout the behavioral testing. The mice undergo two pretraining days to familiarize with the apparatus and the task. On pretraining day one, food pellets are scattered around the maze and each animal is left to explore freely for 5 min. On pretraining day 2, a single food pellet is placed at the end of each arm. The mouse is placed in the central platform and allowed access to each arm in turn (controlled using the doors), and allowed to retrieve the food pellet. A trial ends when the mouse retrieves all 8 pellets or 25 minutes elapses. The testing lasts 16 days (one trial/day). For each trial, the number of correct arm entries within the first eight visits, the number of revisited arms (working memory errors) and the time taken to complete the task are recorded. The testing is administered on sixteen of the final nineteen days of the nPM/ BCAS exposure interval (the final 3 days are used for NOR testing). Novel Object Recognition Test: NOR test evaluates declarative memory. The protocol is based on 3 phases: 1) Habituation: mice are placed in an open -field black Plexiglas arena (20 x 20 x 20 cm). Each mouse is allowed to explore for 15 min. 2) Sample trial: twenty -four hours later, mice are permitted (for 15 min) to explore two identical plastic -made objects (O1 and O2). 3) Object recognition trial: mice are returned to the arena 24 h after the sample trial, and observed under equivalent conditions, in the presence of one familiar object (O3, identical to those in sample trial), and one novel object (N1). Location of the objects is counterbalanced across the trial. Exploration is defined as sniffing/ touching the object. Analysis of object exploration includes frequency, duration, and latency. Object recognition is calculated for each animal as novelty exploration index, with the formulas: TN1 / (TN1 +TO3), with T indicating duration of object exploration. The three testing phases are administered on the final three days of the exposure (nPM, CCH) in the behavior cohort. Tissue Collection At the end of the ten-week exposure (postoperative day 30 from the CCH/ sham surgery), the mice are humanely euthanized. The mice are deeply anesthetized with Ketamine and Xylazine 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally and perfused transcardially to clear the vasculature of blood. The brains are excised, and prepared/ stored for further analysis. 2. Justify the use of animals, the choice of species, and the numbers to be used. If animals are in short supply, costly, or to be used in large numbers, provide an additional rationale for their selection and numbers. In vitro studies or computer/ mathematical models cannot satisfactorily reproduce the white matter/ neuronal injury and functional deficits resulting from nPM/ CCH exposures. Due to cost, ethical concerns, and reproducibility, mice are most appropriate for these studies. We choose mice because of our experience in the Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 723 Vertebrate Animals models being tested, availability of applicable antibodies/ assays, and potential for future investigations. The bilateral carotid artery stenosis model (microcoil application) that we use has been validated only in mice. To limit total number of mice, and avoid duplication of available data, the current project uses a subset of data from an ongoing study that examines the individual and joint effects of nPM exposure and CCH in young male mice (Mack; R01ES024936). The experimental parameters of the current project are chosen to match the ongoing study so that the young male mice can be used as a reference group for the older males. Further, the strains and exposure paradigms of Project 4 have been chosen to match those of Project 3 so that parallel, control groups of mice (no surgery) from Project 3 can serve as comparator cohorts for each aim of Project 4. C57BL/ 6 mice will be used for baseline experiments in each aim. As the CCH model has been validated and used in multiple studies on C57BL/ 6 mice by the investigators, the strain was selected to maintain consistency across aims and exposures. Further, preliminary nPM data has been collected using C57BL/6 mice. Altering background strains for the study would likely introduce strain specific differences in exposure responses and outcomes. This variation would increase sample sizes. Male and female mice are selected to study sex influences and comply with recent NIH initiatives to balance sex in animal studies. Although older mice are more expensive and challenging to test/ maintain, incorporation is necessary to evaluate age dependent effects of the exposures. EFAD -tg and i-mTLR4 -ko mice are chosen (in conjunction with project 3) to study specific mechanisms (TLR4 inflammation/ APOE susceptibility) relevant to nPM/CCH and AD. All transgenic mice are exposed to CCH (using control animals for Project 3 with identical nPM/ strain exposure parameters) to limit sample size of expensive, transgenic mice. Power analyses are designed to limit sample size. 3. Provide information on the veterinary care of the animals involved. Use of laboratory animals will comply with the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. S 2131 et. seq.) and the guidelines set forth in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The following excerpt is borrowed from the USC Department of Animal Resources: \"The University of Southern California (USC) is a leader in the ethical and humane use of animals for research and teaching. USC is fully accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC) and has an animal welfare assurance (number A3518 -01) on file with the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee review all applications to ensure ethical and humane treatment of animals. This body follows the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and all applicable government regulations including those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the State of California. A primary mission of the USC DAR is to provide for adequate veterinary care for our laboratory animals as required by regulatory and accrediting agencies including the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Public Health Services (PHS) Policy, and the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.\" In addition to the animal care provided by the Dr. Mack's team, the animals are assessed daily by veterinary staff. Food and water is provided. If an animal appears sick, the principal investigator is notified immediately. The staff discusses the case with the principal investigator. The veterinary staff makes the ultimate decision regarding the disposition of sick animals. The following excerpt is also borrowed from the USC Department of Animal Resources website: \"DAR (Department of Animal Resources) veterinarians have access to all animals in order to evaluate their health and well-being on a daily basis. In addition, the DAR veterinarians rely upon the research staff and laboratory animal technicians to report occurrences of injury or illness after their daily observations of animals. Should an animal be reported sick or injured by a laboratory animal technician, the responsible PI will be notified prior to initiation of treatment or diagnostic tests. If a veterinarian determines that immediate action is necessary, as in the case of a life threatening situation or where significant pain and distress for the animal exist, action will be taken and the PI will be notified as soon as possible. A veterinarian is on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide veterinary services to animals involved in research projects.\" 4. Describe the procedures for ensuring that discomfort, distress, pain, and injury will be limited to that which is Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 724 Vertebrate Animals unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research. Describe the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices, where appropriate, to minimize discomfort, distress, pain, and injury. Animal discomfort, distress, pain, and injury will be minimized in all phases of the experiment. Specifically, during each procedure, mice will be anesthetized with 80-100 mg/kg Ketamine intraperitoneally (IP) and 5-10 mg/kg xylazine, IP, as described above. 5. Describe any method of euthanasia to be used and the reasons for its selection. State whether this method is consistent with the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines on Euthanasia. If not, include a scientific justification for not following the recommendations. Animals will be humanely euthanized by performing a cardiotomy with exasanguination and perfusion while under ketamine (80 mg/kg IP) and xylazine (5 mg/kg IP). Decapitation will then be performed. This sequence of methods, chemical method followed by physical method is consistent with the recommendations of the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association). Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Soto St., SSB202Y Los Angeles, 442 2993 May 20, 2017 Dear Committee, Caleb Finch and William Mack, I am pleased to confirm my commitment to serve as a collaborator on the experimental research proposed in Projects 3 & 4 for the P01 entitled \"Urban Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease: Risk, Heterogeneity, and Mechanisms\". I have reviewed and collaborated with your teams on the study design and statistical approaches, and will be actively involved in data analysis and interpretation. I have a long-standing collaboration with Professor Finch in P01 AG026572 -011 Brinton (PI) 09/21/16 -09/20/20, Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and we have co-authored several articles, e.g., Yin et al 2015, PMID25921624. I have also worked with Dr. Bill Mack extensively as a co-investigator on your ongoing study (Mack; R01ES024936 Neurotoxicity of Airborne Particles: Role of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion) that utilizes similar analysis methods. In addition, I will advise P01 Projects 3 and 4 in year 1 on the development of a common REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database for data entry and management. I will provide statistical consultation in project years 2 -5 for analysis and reporting of the common dataset. As you know, I am the director of the Biostatistics Resources core of the Southern California CTSI (of which Dr. Bill Mack is a KL2 scholar) as well as the Biostatistics and Data Management Core of the USC Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (of which Professor Finch is a Co-Director and Dr. Bill Mack is a pilot grant awardee). Your work is highly relevant to both of these institutes and biostatistics and data resources from these institutes will be available. Your pilot data demonstrate a female and apoE4 bias in amyloid -beta load in response to air pollution exposure (project 3) and pilot data from Project 4 suggests a role for air pollution in white matter injury and the progression of acute ischemic stroke. I have worked with you in developing the analysis sections of the current grant proposal; the proposed research is very exciting. It incorporates a well-designed study plan to assess the influence of age and sex on the joint influence of particulate matter and underlying cerebrovascular disease. I look forward to working with you to address this topic, and heartily express my support for and commitment to collaborate with you on this research. Sincerely, Wendy Mack, PhD Professor Department of Preventive Medicine Keck School of Medicine University of Southern California Letters of Support Page 730 Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E.

Along with presentations and publications, processed data will be made public and distributed through supplementary materials or on our available website. Sharing Model Organisms : not applicable. Genome Wide Association Studies : not applicable. Contact PD/PI: Finch, Caleb E. Project -004 (437) Page 732 Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical Resources All key resources for this proposal will be authenticated to enhance the reproducibility of our results, as appropriate and according to NIH policy. Key Biological Resources that will be utilized and validated in this proposal include: Transgenic mouse strains: were homozygous APOE3 -, and APOE4 -TR. 5xFAD mice are transgenic for 5 distinct FAD mutations (APP K670N/M671L+ I716V+ V717I and PS1 M146L+L286V). They are provided by University of Illinois at Chicago (Mary Jo LaDu, PhD). i-mTLR4 -ko mice are generated by targeted deletion of the TLR4 gene from macrophages/ microglia. A transgenic mouse carrying an excision enzyme (Cre recombinase) in a specific cell-line (CX 3CR1 promoter, JAX020940) and a transgenic mouse expressing TLR4 flanked with two loxP sequences (JAX024872) are crossed. In order to achieve cell-specificity, Cre expression is controlled by the CX 3CR1 promoter and is inducible via linkage to an estrogen receptor mutant activated by tamoxifen. First generation (F1) litters are 100% heterozygous (mCre+/-, Fl+/-). heterozygous mice are crossed mice (Fl+/+). Second is (mCre+/-, fl+/+), 25% control mice will be validated by genotyping. Antibodies: Only commercially available antibodies will be used. Air Pollution particles: Collected, characterized and validated by Core C2 (Prof C. Sioutas, Director). These nPM characteristics are reported in recent publications by members of this P01 (Liu et al 2016; Morgan et al 2011) and are used in other studies supported by our NIA grants to CE Finch (AG040753; AG040683; AG051521) and NIEHS grant to WJ Mack (ES024936). Other resources used in this proposal will be standard laboratory reagents. Should we need to generate or obtain additional unique resources in the course of this proposal, they will be authenticated using methods similar to those described above, as appropriate. "}
