Given the documented short- and long-term med- ical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding, infant nu- trition should be considered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice. The American Academy of Pediatrics reaf rms its recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, fol-lowed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are intro-duced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. Infant growth should be monitored with the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Curve Standards to avoid mis- labeling infants as underweight or failing to thrive. Hospital routines to encourage and support the initiation and sustaining of exclu- sive breastfeeding should be based on the American Academy of Pediatrics-endorsed WHO/UNICEF \"Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeed- ing.\"National strategies supported by the US Surgeon General 's Call to Action, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and TheJoint Commission are involved to facilitate breastfeeding practices in US hospitals and communities. Pediatricians play a critical role in their practices and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and thus should be knowledgeable about the health risks of not breast- feeding, the economic bene ts to society of breastfeeding, and the techniques for managing and supporting the breastfeeding dyad. The\"Business Case for Breastfeeding \"details how mothers can maintain lactation in the workplace and the bene ts to employers who facili- tate this practice. Pediatrics 2012;129:e827- e841 INTRODUCTION Six years have transpired since publication of the last policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) regarding breastfeeding.1 Recently published research and systematic reviews have reinforcedthe conclusion that breastfeeding and human milk are the reference normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. The current statement updates the evidence for this conclusion and serves as a basis for AAP publications that detail breastfeeding management and infant nutrition, including the AAP Breastfeeding Handbook for Physicians , 2AAP Sample Hospital Breastfeeding Policy for Newborns ,3 AAP Breastfeeding Residency Curriculum ,4and the AAP Safe and Healthy Beginnings Toolkit.5The AAP reaf rms its recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continuedbreastfeeding as complementary food s are introduced, with continuationSECTION ON BREASTFEEDING KEY WORDS breastfeeding, complementary foods, infant nutrition, lactation, human milk, nursing ABBREVIATIONS AAP\u2014American Academy of Pediatrics AHRQ \u2014Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality CDC\u2014Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CI\u2014condence infant death syndrome WHO\u2014World Health Organization This document is copyrighted and is property of the American Academy of Pediatrics and its Board of Directors.

EPIDEMIOLOGY Information regarding breastfeeding rates and practices in the United States is available from a variety of govern- ment data sets, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Immunization Survey,6the NHANES,7and Maternity Practices and Infant Nutrition and Care.8Drawing on these data and others, the CDC has published the \"Breastfeeding Report Card, \"which highlights the degree of progress in achieving the breastfeed- ing goals of the Healthy People 2010 targets as well as the 2020 targets (Table 1).9-11 The rate of initiation of breastfeeding for the total US population based on the latest National Immunization Sur- vey data are 75%.11This overall rate, however, obscures clinically signi - cant sociodemographic and cultural differences. For example, the breast- feeding initiation rate for the Hispanicor Latino population was 80.6%, but for the non-Hispanic black or African American population, it was 58.1%. Among low-income mothers (partic- ipants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]), the breastfeeding initiation rate was 67.5%, but in thosewith a higher income ineligible for WIC, it was 84.6%. 12Breastfeeding initiation rate was 37% for low-incomenon-Hispanic black mothers. 7Similar disparities are age-related; mothersyounger than 20 years initiated breast- feeding at a rate of 59.7% compared with the rate of 79.3% in mothers older than 30 years. The lowest ratesof initiation were seen among non- Hispanic black mothers younger than 20 years, in whom the breastfeeding initiation rate was 30%. 7 Although over the past decade, there has been a modest increase in the rate of\"any breastfeeding \"at 3 and 6 months, in none of the subgroups have the Healthy People 2010 targets been reached. For example, the 6- month \"any breastfeeding \"rate for the total US population was 43%, therate for the Hispanic or Latino sub- group was 46%, and the rate for the non-Hispanic black or African Ameri- can subgroup was only 27.5%. Ratesof exclusive breastfeeding are further from Healthy People 2010 targets, with only 13% of the US population meeting the recommendation to breastfeed ex- clusively for 6 months. Thus, it appears that although the breastfeeding ini- tiation rates have approached the 2010 Healthy People targets, the tar- gets for duration of any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding have not been met. Furthermore, 24% of maternity serv- ices provide supplements of com- mercial infant formula as a general practice in the rst 48 hours after birth. These observations have led tothe conclusion that the disparities in breastfeeding rates are also associ- ated with variations in hospital rou- tines, independent of the populationsserved. As such, it is clear that greater emphasis needs to be placed on im- proving and standardizing hospital- based practices to realize the newer 2020 targets (Table 1).INFANT OUTCOMES Methodologic Issues Breastfeeding results in improved in- fant and maternal health outcomes in both the industrialized and developing world. Major methodologic issues have been raised as to the quality of some of these studies, especially as to the size of the study populations, quality of the data set, inadequate adjustment for confounders, absence of distin-guishing between \"any\"or\"exclusive \" breastfeeding, and lack of a de ned causal relationship between breast- feeding and the speci c outcome. In addition, there are inherent practicaland ethical issues that have precluded prospective randomized interventional trials of different feeding regimens. As such, the majority of publishedreports are observational cohort studies and systematic reviews/meta- analyses. To date, the most comprehensive publication that reviews and analyzesthe published scienti c literature that compares breastfeeding and com-mercial infant formula feeding as to health outcomes is the report pre- pared by the Evidence-based Practice Centers of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the US Department of Health Human Services titled Breastfeeding and Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes in DevelopedCountries . 13The following sections summarize and update the AHRQ meta- analyses and provide an expanded analysis regarding health outcomes. Table 2 summarizes the dose-response relationship between the duration of breastfeeding and its protective effect. Respiratory Tract Infections and Otitis Media The risk of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections in the rst year is reduced 72% if infants breastfedexclusively for more than 4 months. 13,14 Infants who exclusively breastfed for 4TABLE 1 Healthy People Targets 2010 and 2020(%) 2007a2010 Target2020 Target Any breastfeeding Ever 75.0 75 81.9 6 mo 43.8 50 60.5 1 y 22.4 25 34.1 Exclusive breastfeeding To 3 mo 33.5 40 44.3To 6 mo 13.8 17 23.7 Worksite lactation support 25 \u2014 38.0 Formula use in rst 2 d 25.6 \u2014 15.6 a2007 data reported in 2011. 10 e828 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from to 6 months had a fourfold increase in the risk of pneumonia compared with infants who exclusively breastfed for more than 6 months.15The severity (duration of hospitalization and oxygenrequirements) of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is reduced by 74% in infants who breastfed exclusively for 4 months compared with infants who never or only partially breastfed. 16 Any breastfeeding compared with ex- clusive commercial infant formula feeding will reduce the incidence of otitis media (OM) by 23%.13Exclusive breastfeeding for more than 3 months reduces the risk of otitis media by 50%. Serious colds and ear and throat infections were reduced by 63% ininfants who exclusively breastfed for 6months. 17 Gastrointestinal Tract Infections Any breastfeeding is associated with a 64% reduction in the incidence of nonspeci c gastrointestinal tract infec- tions, and this effect breastfeeding. 13,14,17,18 Necrotizing Enterocolitis Meta-analyses of 4 randomized clinical trials performed over the period 1983 to 2005 support the conclusion that feeding preterm infants human milk isassociated with a signi cant reduction (58%) in the incidence of necrotizingenterocolitis (NEC). 13A more recentstudy of preterm infants fed an exclu- sive human milk diet compared with those fed human milk supplementedwith cow-milk-based infant formula pro- ducts noted a 77% reduction in NEC. 19 O n ec a s eo fN E Cc o u l db ep r e v e n t e di f10 infants received an exclusive human milk diet, and 1 case of NEC requiring surgery or resulting in death could be prevented if 8 infants received an ex- clusive human milk diet. 19 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Infant Mortality Meta-analyses with a clear de nition of degree of breastfeeding and adjusted for confounders and other known risks for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) note that breastfeeding is as- sociated with a 36% reduced risk of SIDS.13Latest data comparing any ver- sus exclusive breastfeeding reveal that for any breastfeeding, the multivariate odds ratio is 0.55 0.44 -0.69). is 0.27 (95% CI, 0.27 -0.31).20Ap r o - portion (21%) of the US infant mortalityhas been attributed, in part, to the in- creased rate of SIDS in infants whowere never breastfed. 21That the posi- tive effect of breastfeeding on SIDSrates is independent of sleep position was con rmed in a large case-control study of supine-sleeping infants. 22,23 It has been calculated that more than900 infant lives per year may be saved in the United States if 90% of mothers exclusively breastfed for 6 months. 24In the 42 developing countries in which90% of the world 's childhood deaths oc- cur, exclusive breastfeeding for 6 monthsand weaning after 1 year is the most effective intervention, with the potential of preventing more than 1 million infant deaths per year, equal to preventing 13%of the world 's childhood mortality. 25 Allergic Disease There is a protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding for 3 to 4 months inTABLE 2 Dose-Response Bene ts of Breastfeedinga 0.64 -0.91 Otitis media13 3 or BF 0.50 0.36 -0.70 Recurrent otitis media15 77 Exclusive BF BF 4 <6m od1.95 1.06 -3.59 tract infection1763 >6 BF 0.30 0.18 -0.74 Lower respiratory tract infection1372 4 mo Exclusive BF 0.28 0.14 -0.54 Lower respiratory tract infection1577 Exclusive BF 6m odCompared with BF 4 to <6m od4.27 1.27 -14.35 Asthma13 40 3 mo Atopic family history 0.60 0.43 -0.82 Asthma13 26 3 mo atopic family history0.74 30 mo Exclusive BF 0.71 0.54 -0.93 Type diabetes13,43 Any \u2014 syncytial virus. aPooled data. b% lower risk refers to lower risk while BF compared with feeding commercial infant formula or referent group speci ed. cOR expressed as increase risk for commercial formula feeding. dReferent group is exclusive BF 6 months. PEDIATRICS Volume 129, Number 3, March 2012 e829FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from reducing the incidence of clinical asthma, atopic dermatitis, and eczema by 27% in a low-risk population andup to 42% in infants with positive family history. 13,26 There are con flict- ing studies that examine the timing ofadding complementary foods after 4 months and the risk of allergy, including food allergies, atopic dermatitis, and asthma, in either the allergy-prone or nonatopic individual. 26Similarly, there are no convincing data that delayingintroduction of potentially allergenic foods after 6 months has any protectiveeffect. 27-30One problem in analyzing this research is the low prevalence ofexclusive breastfeeding at 6 months in the study populations. Thus, research outcomes in studies that examine the development of atopy and the timing of introducing solid foods in partially breastfed infants may not be applica- ble to exclusively breastfed infants. Celiac Disease There is a reduction of 52% in the risk of developing celiac disease in infants who were breastfed at the time of gluten exposure. 31Overall, there is an association between increased dura-tion of breastfeeding and reduced risk of celiac disease when measured as the presence of celiac antibodies. The critical protective factor appears tobe not the timing of the gluten expo- sure but the overlap of breastfeeding at the time of the initial gluten in- gestion. Thus, gluten-containing foods should be introduced while the infant is receiving only breast milk and not infant formula or other bovine milk products. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Breastfeeding is associated with a 31% reduction in the risk of child- hood infl ammatory bowel disease. 32 T h ep r o t e c t i v ee f f e c ti sh y p o t h e s i z e dto result from the interaction of the immunomodulating effect of human milk and the underlying geneticsusceptibility of the infant. Differentpatterns of intestinal colonization in breastfed versus commercial infantformula -fed infants may add to the preventive effect of human milk. 33 Obesity Because rates of obesity are signi - cantly lower in breastfed infants, na- tional campaigns to prevent obesity begin with breastfeeding support.34,35 Although complex factors confoundstudies of obesity, there is a 15% to30% reduction in adolescent and adult obesity rates if any breastfeeding oc- curred in infancy compared with no breastfeeding. 13,36 The Framingham Offspring study noted a relationship ofbreastfeeding and a lower BMI and higher in study noted that thebreastfed sibling weighed 14 pounds less than the sibling fed commercialinfant formula and was less likely to reach BMI obesity threshold. 38The duration of breastfeeding also is in-versely related to the risk of over- weight; each month of breastfeeding being associated with a 4% reduction in risk. 14 The interpretation of these data is confounded by the lack of a de nition in many studies of whether humanmilk was given by breastfeeding or by bottle. This is of particular importance, because breastfed infants self-regulate intake volume irrespective of maneu-vers that increase available milk vol- ume, and the early programming of self-regulation, in turn, affects adult weight gain. 39This concept is further supported by the observations thatinfants who are fed by bottle, formula, or expressed breast milk will have increased bottle emptying, poorer self- regulation, and excessive weight gainin late infancy (older than 6 months) compared with infants who only nurse from the breast. 40,41Diabetes Up to a 30% reduction in the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus is reported for infants who exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months, thus avoiding expo- sure to cow milk protein.13,42It has been postulated that the putative mechanismin the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus is the infant 's exposure to cow milk-lactoglobulin, which stimulates an immune-mediated process cross-reacting with pancreatic cells. A re- duction of 40% in the incidence of type2 diabetes mellitus is reported, possi- bly re flecting the long-term positive effect of breastfeeding on weight con-trol and feeding self-regulation. 43 Childhood Leukemia and Lymphoma There is a reduction in leukemia that is correlated with the duration ofbreastfeeding. 14,44 A reduction of 20% in the risk of acute lymphocytic leuke-mia and 15% in the risk of acute my- eloid leukemia in infants breastfed for 6 months or longer. 45,46 Breastfeeding for less than 6 months is protective butof less magnitude (approximately 12% and 10%, respectively). The question of whether the protective effect of breast-feeding is a direct mechanism of human milk on malignancies or secondarily mediated by its reduction of early child- hood infections has yet to be answered. Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Consistent differences in neurodevel- opmental outcome between breastfed and commercial infant formula -fed infants have been reported, but the outcomes are confounded by differences in parental education, intelligence, home environment, and socioeconomic sta- tus. 13,47 The large, randomized Pro- motion of Breastfeeding InterventionTrial provided evidence that adjusted outcomes of intelligence scores and teacher 's ratings are signi cantly greater in breastfed infants. 48-50In e830 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from addition, higher intelligence scores are noted in infants who exclusively breastfed for 3 months or longer, andhigher teacher ratings were observed if exclusive breastfeeding was practiced for 3 months or longer. Signi cantly positive effects of human milk feedingon long-term neurodevelopment are ob- served in preterm infants, the pop- ulation more at risk for these adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. 51-54 PRETERM INFANTS There are several signi cant short- and long-term bene cial effects of feeding preterm infants human milk.Lower rates of sepsis and NEC indicate that human milk contributes to the development of the preterm infant 's immature host defense. 19,55 -59The ben- ets of feeding human milk to preterm infants are realized not only in the NICU but also in the fewer hospital read- missions for illness in the year after NICU discharge.51,52 Furthermore, the implications for a reduction in incid-ence of NEC include not only lower mortality rates but also lower long-term growth failure and neurodevelopmental disabilities. 60,61 Clinical feeding toler- ance is improved, and the attainment of full enteral feeding is hastened by a diet of human milk.51,52,59 Neurodevelopmental outcomes are im-proved by the feeding of human milk. Long-term studies at 8 years of agethrough adolescence suggest that in- telligence test results and white matter and total brain volumes are greater in subjects who had received human milk as infants in the NICU. 53,54 Extremely preterm infants receiving the greatestproportion of human milk in the NICU had signi cantly greater scores for mental, motor, and behavior ratings at ages 18 months and 30 months. 51,52 These data remain signi cant after adjustment for confounding factors, such as maternal age, education, mar- ital status, race, and infant morbidities.These neurodevelopmental outcomes are associated with predominant and not necessarily exclusive human milkfeeding. Human milk feeding in the NICU also is associated with lower rates of severe retinopathy of prematurity. 62,63 Long-term studies of preterm infantsalso suggest that human milk feeding is associated with lower rates of met- abolic syndrome, and in adolescents, it is associated with lower blood pres- sures and low-density lipoprotein con- centrations and insulin metabolism. 64,65 The potent bene ts of human milk are such that all preterm infants shouldreceive human milk (Table 3). Mother 's own milk, fresh or frozen, should bethe primary diet, and it should befortied appropriately for the infant born weighing less than 1.5 kg. Ifmother 's own milk is unavailable de- spite signi cant lactation support, pas- teurized donor milk should be used. 19,66 Quality control of pasteurized donormilk is important and should be moni- tored. New data suggest that mother 's o w nm i l kc a nb es t o r e da tr e f r i g e r a t o r temperature (4\u00b0C) in the NICU for as long as 96 hours. 67Data on thawing, warming, and prolonged storage needupdating. Practices should involve pro- tocols that prevent misadministration of milk. MATERNAL OUTCOMES Both short- and long-term health ben-ets accrue to mothers who breast- feed. Such mothers have decreasedpostpartum blood loss and more rapid involution of the uterus. Continued breastfeeding leads to increased child spacing secondary to lactational amen- orrhea. Prospective cohort studies have noted an increase in postpartumdepression in mothers who do not breastfeed or who wean early. 68A large prospective study on child abuseand neglect perpetuated by mothers found, after correcting for potentialconfounders, that the rate of abuse/ neglect was signi cantly increased for mothers who did not breastfeed those who did (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.7- 3.9). 69 Studies of the overall effect of breast- feeding on the return of the mothers to their pre-pregnancy weight are in- conclusive, given the large numbers of confounding factors on weight loss (diet, activity, baseline BMI, ethnicity).13 In a covariate-adjusted study of morethan 14 000 women postpartum, moth- ers who exclusively breastfed for lon-ger than 6 months weighed 1.38 kg less than those who did not breastfeed. 70 In mothers without a history of gesta-tional diabetes, breastfeeding duration was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus; for each year of breastfeeding, there was a risk 71,72No ben- ecial for breastfeeding was n o t e di nm o t h e r sw h ow e r ed i a g n o s e d with gestational diabetes. The longitudinal Nurses Health Study noted an inverse relationship between the cumulative lifetime duration ofbreastfeeding and the development of rheumatoid arthritis. 73If cumulative duration of breastfeeding exceeded 12TABLE 3 Recommendations on Breastfeeding Management forPreterm Infants 1.

Neonatal intensive care units should prevent the misadministration of human milk (http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/recommendations/other_mothers_milk.htm). 5. There are no data to support routinely culturing human milk for bacterial or other organisms. 151 PEDIATRICS Volume 129, Number 3, March 2012 e831FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from months, the relative risk of rheuma- toid arthritis was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.8 -1.0), and if the cumulative duration of breastfeeding was longer than 24 months, the relative risk of rheu- matoid arthritis was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3- 0.8).73An association between cumulative lactation experience andthe incidence of adult cardiovascular disease was reported by the Women' s Health Initiative in a longitudinal studyof more than 139 000 postmenopausal women. 74Women with a cumulative lactation history of 12 to 23 months had a signi cant reduction lactation experience alsocorrelates with a reduction in both breast (primarily premenopausal) and ovarian cancer. 13,14,75 Cumulative du- ration of breastfeeding of longer than12 months is associated with a 28% decrease in breast cancer (OR: 0.72; year of breastfeeding has been calcu-l a t e dt or e s u l ti na4 . 3 %r e d u c t i o ni n breast cancer. 76,77 ECONOMIC BENEFITS A detailed pediatric cost analysisbased on the AHRQ report concluded that if 90% of US mothers would comply with the recommendation to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, there would be a savings of $13 billion per year. 24The savings do not include those related toa reduction in parental absenteeism from work or adult deaths from dis-eases acquired in childhood, such as asthma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or obesity-related conditions. Strategies that increase the number of mothers who breastfeed exclusively for about 6 months would be of great economic bene t on a national level.DURATION OF EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING The AAP recommends exclusive breast- feeding for about 6 months, with con-tinuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant, a recommendation con-curred to by the WHO 78and the In- stitute of Medicine.79 Support for this recommendation ofexclusive breastfeeding is found in thed i f f e r e n c e si nh e a l t ho u t c o m e so fi n - fants breastfed exclusively for 4 vs 6 months, for gastrointestinal disease,otitis media, respiratory illnesses, a n da t o p i cd i s e a s e ,a sw e l la sd i f - ferences in maternal outcomes of delayed menses and postpartumweight loss. 15,18,80 Compared with infants who never breastfed, infants who were exclu- sively breastfed for 4 months hadsignicantly greater incidence of lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis me- dia, and diarrheal disease than infants exclusively breastfed for 6 months orlonger. 15,18 When compared with in- fants who exclusively breastfed for lon-ger than 6 months, those exclusivelybreastfed for 4 to 6 months had a four-fold increase in the risk of pneumonia. 15 Furthermore, exclusively breastfeedingfor 6 months extends the period oflactational amenorrhea and thus im-proves child spacing, which reduces the risk of birth of a preterm infant. 81 The AAP is cognizant that for some infants, because of family and medicalhistory, individual developmental status, and/or social and cultural dynamics, complementary feeding, including gluten-containing grains, begins earlier than 6m o n t h so fa g e . 82,83 Because breast- feeding is immunoprotective, when such complementary foods are introduced, itis advised that this be done while the infant is feeding only breastmilk. 82 Mothers should be encouraged to con- tinue breastfeeding through the rstyear and beyond as more and varied complementary foods are introduced. CONTRAINDICATIONS TO BREASTFEEDING There are a limited number of medical conditions in which breastfeeding is contraindicated, including an infant with the metabolic disorder of classic ga- lactosemia. Alternating breastfeeding with special protein-free or modi ed formulas can be used in feeding in-fants with other metabolic diseases(such as phenylketonuria), provided that appropriate blood monitoring is available. Mothers who are positive for human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type Io rI I 84or untreated brucellosis85 should not breastfeed nor provide ex-pressed milk to their infants Breast- feeding should not occur if the mother has active (infectious) untreated tu- berculosis or has active herpes sim- plex lesions on her breast; however,expressed milk can be used because there is no concern about these in- fectious organisms passing through the milk. Breastfeeding can be re- sumed when a mother with tubercu- losis is treated for a minimum of 2 weeks and is documented that she is no longer infectious. 86Mothers who develop varicella 5 days before through 2 days after delivery should be sepa- rated from their infants, but their expressed milk can be used for feed- ing.87In 2009, the CDC recommended that mothers acutely infected withH1N1 in fluenza should temporarily be isolated from their infants until theyare afebrile, but they can provide expressed milk for feeding. 88 In the industrialized world, it is not re- commended that HIV-positive mothers breastfeed. However, in the developing world, where mortality is increased in non-breastfeeding infants from a com-bination of malnutrition and infectious diseases, breastfeeding may outweighthe risk of the acquiring HIV infection e832 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from from human milk. Infants in areas with endemic HIV who are exclusively breastfed for the rst 3 months are at a lower risk of acquiring HIV infection than are those who received a mixeddiet of human milk and other foodsand/or commercial infant formula. 89 Recent studies document that com- bining exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months with 6 months of antiretroviraltherapy signi cantly decreases the postnatal acquisition of HIV-1. 90,91 There is no contraindication to breast-feeding for a full-term infant whose mother is for cytomega- lovirus (CMV). There is a possibilitythat CMV acquired from mother 's milk may be associated with a late-onsetsepsis-like syndrome in the extremely low birth weight (birth weight <1500 g) preterm infant. Although not asso- ciated with long-term abnormalities,such a syndrome may warrant antivi-ral therapy. 92The value of routinely feeding human milk from seropositive mothers to preterm infants outweighs the risks of clinical disease, especiallybecause no long-term neurodevelop-mental abnormalities have been repor-ted. 93Freezing of milk reduces but does not eliminate CMV.94Heating, ei- ther as Holder pasteurization (heatingat 62.5\u00b0C for 30 minutes) or high-temperature short pasteurization(72\u00b0C for 5 -10 seconds) eliminates the viral load from the milk but also affects bioactive factors and nutrients. 95 Thus, fresh mother 's own milk is pref- erable for routinely feeding all preterm infants. Maternal substance abuse is not a categorical contraindication to breast- feeding. Adequately nourished narcotic-dependent mothers can be encouragedto breastfeed if they are enrolled ina supervised methadone maintenanceprogram and have negative screening for HIV and illicit drugs. 96Street drugs such as PCP (phencyclidine), cocaine, and cannabis can be detected in humanmilk, and their use by breastfeeding mothers is of concern, particularly with regard to the infant 's long-term neurobehavioral development and thus are contraindicated.97Alcohol is not a galactogogue; it may blunt prolactinresponse to suckling and negatively affects infant motor development. 98,99 Thus, ingestion of alcoholic beveragesshould be minimized and limited to an occasional intake but no more than 0.5 g alcohol per kg body weight, which for a 60 kg mother is approxi- mately 2 oz liquor, 8 oz wine, or 2beers. 100Nursing should take place 2 hours or longer after the alcoholintake to minimize its concentration in the ingested milk. 101Maternal smok- ing is not an absolute contraindica-tion to breastfeeding but should be strongly discouraged, because it is as- sociated with an increased incidence in infant respiratory allergy 102and SIDS.103Smoking should not occur in the presence of the infant so as tominimize the negative effect of sec- ondary passive smoke inhalation. 104 Smoking is also a risk factor for lowmilk supply and poor weight gain. 105,106 MATERNAL DIET Well-nourished lactating mothers have an increased daily energy need of 450to 500 kcal/day that can be met by a modest increase in a normally balanced varied diet. 107- 109Although dietary ref- erence intakes for breastfeeding moth-ers are similar to or greater than those during pregnancy, there is no routine recommendation for maternal supple- ments during lactation. 108,109,110 Many clinicians recommend the continueduse of prenatal vitamin supplements during lactation. 109 The mother 's diet should include an average daily intake of 200 to 300 mgof the -3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid guarantee con- centration of preformed DHA in themilk. 111,112 Consumption of 1 to 2 por- tions of sh (eg, herring, canned light tuna, salmon) per week will meet this need. The concern regarding the possible risk from intake of excessive mercury or other contaminants is offset by the neurobehavioral bene ts of an adequate DHA intake and can beminimized by avoiding the intake of predatory sh (eg, pike, marlin, mack- erel, tile sh, sword sh). 113 Poorly nourished mothers or those on selec- tive vegan diets may require a supple- ment of DHA as well as multivitamins. MATERNAL MEDICATIONS Recommendations regarding breast-feeding in situations in which the mother is undergoing either diagnostic procedures or pharmacologic therapy must balance the bene ts to the infant and the mother against the potentialrisk of drug exposure to the infant. There are only a limited number ofagents that are contraindicated, and an appropriate substitute usually can be found. The most comprehensive, up- to-date source of information regard- ing the safety of maternal medications when the mother is breastfeeding is LactMed, an Internet-accessed source published by the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health. 114 A forthcoming AAP policy statement on the transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human milk will pro- vide additional recommendations, with particular focus on psychotropic drugs, herbal products, galactagogues, nar- cotics, and pain medications.115In general, breastfeeding is not recom-mended when mothers are receiving medication from the following classes of drugs: amphetamines, chemother-apy agents, ergotamines, and statins. There are a wide variety of maternally administered psychotropic agents forwhich there are inadequate pharma- cologic data with regard to human milk and/or nursing infant 's blood PEDIATRICS Volume 129, Number 3, March 2012 e833FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from concentrations. In addition, data re- garding the long-term neurobehavioral effects from exposure to these agentsduring the critical developmental pe- riod of early infancy are lacking. A recent comprehensive review noted that of the 96 psychotropic drugs available, pharmacologic and clinical information was only available for 62 (65%) of the drugs. 116In only 19 was there adequate information to allowfor de ning a safety protocol and thus qualifying to be compatible for use bylactating mothers. Among the agentsconsidered to be least problematic were the tricyclic antidepressants am- itriptyline and clomipramine and the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline. Detailed guidelines regarding the ne- cessity for and duration of temporary cessation of breastfeeding after ma- ternal exposure to diagnostic radio- active compounds are provided by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in medical reviews. 117-119Special precaution should be followed in thesituation of phenazopyridine shouldbe avoided by the mother to minimize the risk of hemolysis in the infant. 120 HOSPITAL ROUTINES The Sections on Breastfeeding and Perinatal Pediatrics have published the Sample Hospital BreastfeedingPolicy that is available from the AAP Safe and Healthy Beginnings Web site. 3,5 This sample hospital policy is basedon the detailed recommendations of the previous AAP policy statement \"Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk\" 1as well as the principles of the 1991 WHO/UNICEF publication \"Tens Steps to Successful Breastfeeding \" (Table 4)121and provides a template for developing a uniform hospital policy forsupport of breastfeeding. 122In particular,emphasis is placed on the need to revise or discontinue disruptive hospital policies that interfere with early skin- to-skin contact, that provide water,glucose water, or commercial infantformula without a medical indication, that restrict the amount of time the infant can be with the mother, thatlimit feeding duration, or that provideunlimited paci er use. In 2009, the AAP endorsed the Ten Steps program (see Table 4). Adherence to these 10 steps has been demonstratedto increase rates of breastfeeding ini-tiation, duration, and exclusivity. 122,123 Implementation of the following 5 post-partum hospital practices has beendemonstrated to increase breastfeedingduration, irrespective of socioeconomic status: breastfeeding in the rst hour after birth, exclusive breastfeeding, rooming-in, avoidance of paci ers, and receipt of telephone number for sup- port after discharge from the hospi- tal. 124 The CDC National Survey of MaternityPractices in Infant Nutrition and Carehas assessed the lactation practices in more than 80% of US hospitals and noted that the mean score for imple-mentation of the Ten Steps was only65%. 34,125 Fifty-eight percent of hospi- tals erroneously advised mothers tolimit suckling at the breast to a spec-ied length of time, and 41% of the hospitals gave paci ers to more than some of their newborns \u2014both prac- tices that have been documentedto lower breastfeeding rates and du-ration. 126The survey noted that in 30% of all birth centers, more thanhalf of all newborns received supple-mentation commercial infant formula,a practice associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding and less exclusivity. 34,125 As indicated in the bene ts section, this early supple- mentation may affect morbidity out- comes in this population. The survey also reported that 66% of hospitalsreported that they distributed tobreastfeeding mothers discharge packs that contained commercial infant for- mula, a practice that has been docu- mented to negatively affect exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding. 127Few birth centers have model hospital pol- icies (14%) and support breastfeeding mothers after hospital discharge (27%). Only 37% of centers practice more than 5 of the 10 Steps and only 3.5% practice 9 to 10 Steps.34 There is, thus, a need for a major conceptual change in the organization of the hospital services for the mother and infant dyad (Table 5). This re- quires that medical and nursing rou- tines and practices adjust to the principle that breastfeeding should begin within the rst hour after birth (even for Cesarean deliveries) and that infants must be continuously ac- cessible to the mother by rooming-inTABLE 4 WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant women about the bene ts and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within the rst hour of birth. 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation even if they are separated from their infants. 6. Give newborn infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practice rooming-in (allow mothers and infants to remain together) 24 h a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 9. Give no arti cial nipples or paci ers to breastfeeding infants.a 10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them ondischarge from hospital. aThe AAP does not support a categorical ban on paci ers because of their role in SIDS risk reduction and their analgesic bene t during painful procedures when breast- feeding cannot provide the analgesia. Paci er use in the hospital in the neonatal period should be limited to spe- cic medical indications such as pain reduction and calming in a drug-exposed infant, for example. Mothers of healthy term breastfed infants should be instructed to delay paci er use until breastfeeding is well-established, usually about 3 to 4 wk after birth. e834 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from arrangements that facilitate around- the-clock, on-demand feeding for the healthy infant. Formal staff trainingshould not only focus on updating knowledge and techniques for breast- feeding support but also should ac- knowledge the need to change attitudes and eradicate unsubstantiated beliefs about the supposed equivalency of breastfeeding and commercial infant formula feeding. Emphasis should be placed on the numerous bene ts of exclusive breastfeeding. The importanceof addressing the issue of the impactof hospital practices and policies on breastfeeding outcomes is highlighted by the decision of The Joint Commission to adopt the rate of exclusive breast milk feeding as a Perinatal Care Core Measure. 127As such, the rate of exclu- sive breastfeeding during the hospitalstay has been con rmed as a critical variable when measuring the quality of care provided by a medical facility. Paci er Use Given the documentation that early use of paci ers may be associated with less successful breastfeeding, paci er use in the neonatal period should belimited to speci c medical situations. 128 These include uses for pain relief, asa calming agent, or as part of struc- tured program for enhancing oral motor function. Because paci er use has been associated with a reductionin SIDS incidence, mothers of healthy term infants should be instructed touse paci ers at infant nap or sleep time after breastfeeding is well es-tablished, at approximately 3 to 4 weeks of age. 129-131 Vitamins and Mineral Supplements Intramuscular vitamin K 1(phytona- dione) at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg should routinely be administered to all infants on the rst day to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic disease of thenewborn. 132A delay of administrationuntil after the rst feeding at the breast but not later than 6 hours ofage is recommended. A single oraldose of vitamin K should not be used, because the oral dose is variably absorbed and does not provide ade- quate concentrations or stores for the breastfed infant. 132 Vitamin D de ciency/insuf ciency and rickets has increased in all infants asa result of decreased sunlight expo- sure secondary to changes in lifestyle, dress habits, and use of topical sun- screen preparations. To maintain an adequate serum vitamin D concen- tration, all breastfed infants routinely should receive an oral supplement of vitamin D, 400 U per day, beginning at hospital discharge. 133 Supplementary fluoride should not be provided during the rst 6 months. From age 6 months to 3 years, fluoride supplementation should be limited to infants residing in communities where thefluoride concentration in the water is<0.3 ppm.134Complementary food rich in iron and zinc should be in- troduced at about 6 months of age. Supplementation of oral iron drops before 6 months may be needed to support iron stores. Premature infants should receive both a multivitamin preparation and an oral iron supplement until they are ingesting a completely mixed diet and their growth and hematologic status are normalized. GROWTH The growth pattern of healthy term breastfed infants differs from the existing CDC \"reference \"growth curves, which are primarily based on datafrom few breastfeeding infants. The WHO multicenter curves are based on combined longitudinal data from healthy breastfed infants from birth to 24 months and cross-sectional data from 2 to 5 years of the same childrenfrom 6 diverse geographical areasTABLE 5 Recommendations on Breastfeeding Management forHealthy Term Infants 1. Exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 mo \u0081Breastfeeding preferred; alternatively expressed mother 's milk, or donor milk \u0081To continue for at least the rst year and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child\u0081Complementary foods rich in iron and other micronutrients should be introduced at about 6mo of age 2. Peripartum policies and practices that optimize breastfeeding initiation and maintenanceshould be compatible with the AAP andAcademy of Breastfeeding Medicine ModelHospital Policy and include the following: \u0081Direct skin-to-skin contact with mothers immediately after delivery until the rst feeding is accomplished and encouraged throughout the postpartum period \u0081Delay in routine procedures (weighing, measuring, bathing, blood tests, vaccines, and eye prophylaxis) until after the rst feeding is completed\u0081Delay in administration of intramuscular vitamin K until after the rst feeding is completed but within 6 h of birth \u0081Ensure 8 to 12 feedings at the breast every 24 h \u0081Ensure formal evaluation and documentation of breastfeeding by trained caregivers (including position, latch, milk transfer, examination) at least for each nursing shift\u0081Give no supplements (water, glucose water, commercial infant formula, or other fluids) to breastfeeding newborn infants unless medicallyindicated using standard evidence-basedguidelines for the management of hyperbilirubinemia and hypoglycemia \u0081Avoid routine paci er use in the postpartum period\u0081Begin daily oral vitamin D drops (400 IU) at hospital discharge 3. All breastfeeding newborn infants should be seen by a pediatrician at 3 to 5 d of age, whichis within 48 to 72 h after discharge from the hospital \u0081Evaluate hydration (elimination patterns) \u0081Evaluate body wt gain (body wt loss no more than 7%from birth and no further wt loss by day 5:assess feeding and consider more frequentfollow-up) \u0081Discuss maternal/infant issues \u0081Observe feeding 4. Mother and infant should sleep in proximity to each other to facilitate breastfeeding 5. Paci er should be offered, while placing infant in back-to-sleep-position, no earlier than 3 to 4 wk of age and after breastfeeding has been established PEDIATRICS Volume 129, Number 3, March 2012 e835FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States).135As such, the WHO curves are \"standards \"and are the normative model for growth anddevelopment irrespective of infant ethnicity or geography re flecting the optimal growth of the breastfed in-fant. 136Use of the WHO curves for the rst 2 years allows for more accurate monitoring of weight and height for age and, in comparison with use of the CDC reference curves, results in more accurate (lower) rates of un- dernutrition and short stature and(higher) rates of overweight. Fur- thermore, birth to 6-month growth charts are available where the curves are magni ed to permit monitoring of weight trajectories. As such, the WHOcurves serve as the best guide for assessing lactation performance because they minimize mislabeling clinical sit- uations as inadequate breastfeeding andidentify more accurately and promptly overweight and obese infants. As of Sep- tember 2010, the CDC, with the concur- rence of the AAP , recommended the use of the WHO curves for all children younger than 24 months. 137,138 ROLE OF THE PEDIATRICIAN Pediatricians have a critical role intheir individual practices, communi- ties, and society at large to serve as advocates and supporters of suc- cessful breastfeeding (Table 6). 139De- spite this critical role, studies havedemonstrated lack of preparation andknowledge and declining attitudes regarding the feasibility of breast- feeding. 140The AAP Web site141pro- vides a wealth of breastfeeding-relatedmaterial and resources to assist and support pediatricians in their critical role as advocates of infant well-being. This includes the Safe and Healthy Beginnings toolkit, 5which includes re- sources for physician 'so fce for pro- motion of breastfeeding in a busypediatric practice setting, a pocketguide for coding to facilitate appropri-ate payment, suggested guidelines for telephone triage of maternal breast- feeding concerns, and information regarding employer support for breastfeeding in the workplace.Evidence-based protocols from organ- izations such as the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine provide de- tailed clinical guidance for manage- ment of speci c issues, including the recommendations for frequent andunrestricted time for breastfeeding so as to minimize hyperbilirubinemia and hypoglycemia. 4,142,143 The critical role that pediatricians play is high- lighted by the recommended health supervision visit at 3 to 5 days of age, which is within 48 to 72 hours after discharge from the hospital, as well as pediatricians support of practices that avoid non -medically indicated supplementation with commercial in-fant formula. 144 Pediatricians also should serve as breastfeeding advocates and educa- tors and not solely delegate this role to staff or nonmedical/lay volunteers. Communicating with families thatbreastfeeding is a medical priority that is enthusiastically recommended by their personal pediatrician will buildsupport for mothers in the early weeks postpartum. To assist in the educa- tion of future physicians, the AAP rec-ommends using the evidence-based Breastfeeding Residency Curriculum, 4 which has been demonstrated to im-prove knowledge, con dence, practice patterns, and breastfeeding rates. Thepediatrician 's own of ce-based prac- tice should serve as a model for howto support breastfeeding in the work- place. The pediatrician should also take the lead in encouraging the hospitals with which he or she is af liated to provide proper support and facilities for their employees who choose to continue to breastfeed. BUSINESS CASE FOR BREASTFEEDING A mother/baby-friendly worksite pro- vides bene ts to employers, including a reduction in company health carecosts, lower employee absenteeism, reduction in employee turnover, and increased employee morale and pro- ductivity. 145,146 The return on invest- ment has been calculated that for every $1 invested in creating and supporting a lactation support pro- gram (including a designated pump site that guarantees privacy, avail- ability of refrigeration and a hand- washing facility, and appropriate mother break time) there is a $2 to $3 dollar return.147The Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the US De-partment of Health and Human Serv-ices, with support from the Of ce of Women' s Health, has created a pro- gram, \"The Business Case for Breast- feeding, \"that provides details of economic bene ts to the employer and toolkits for the creation of suchprograms. 148The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed byCongress in March 2010 mandatesthat employers provide \"reasonable break time \"for nursing mothers and private non-bathroom areas to expressTABLE 6 Role of the Pediatrician 1. Promote breastfeeding as the norm for infant feeding. 2. Become knowledgeable in the principles and management of lactation and breastfeeding. 3. Develop skills necessary for assessing the adequacy of breastfeeding. 4. Support training and education for medical students, residents and postgraduate physicians in breastfeeding and lactation. 5. Promote hospital policies that are compatible with the AAP and Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Model Hospital Policy and the WHO/ UNICEF \"Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. \" 6. Collaborate with the obstetric community to develop optimal breastfeeding supportprograms. 7. Coordinate with community-based health care professionals and certi ed breastfeeding counselors to ensure uniform andcomprehensive breastfeeding support. e836 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on February 2, 2020 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from breast milk during their workday.149 The establishment of these initiatives as the standard workplace environ-ment will support mothers in their goal of supplying only breast milk to their infants beyond the immediate postpartum period. CONCLUSIONS Research and practice in the 5 yearssince publication of the last AAP policy statement have reinforced the conclu- sion that breastfeeding and the use of human milk confer unique nutritional and nonnutritional bene ts to the infantand the mother and, in turn, optimizeinfant, child, and adult health as well as child growth and development. Re-cently, published evidence-based stud- ies have con rmed and quantitated the risks of not breastfeeding. Thus, infantfeeding should not be considered as a lifestyle choice but rather as a basic health issue. As such, the pediatrician 's role in advocating and supportingproper breastfeeding practices is es- sential and vital for the achievement of this preferred public health goal. 35 LEAD AUTHORS Arthur I.
