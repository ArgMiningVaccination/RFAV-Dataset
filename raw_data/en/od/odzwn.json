Patient Safety Officer 2009 Annual Report Under the direction of the Board of Managers, the Parkland Patient Safety Program is designed to identify and manage risks to patient safety with the ultimate goal of eliminating preventable deaths and preventable harm that are the result of medical care. Though the Department of Patient Safety and Risk facilitates the creation of this annual evaluation, the responsibility of pat ient safety belongs with every employee and every department. Many of the accomplishments outlined are the result of clinical and operational le adership from across Parkland Health & Hospital System as well as the daily efforts of the clinicians who directly care for the patients we serve. The 2009 Program Evaluation includes both the results of overarching metrics regarding safe outcomes of care along with metrics associated with implementation of the processes associ ated with the National Quality Forum (NQF) Safe Practices.

List of Serious Reportable Events (NQF 2009) 2. List of Safe Practices fo r Better Healthcare (NQF 2009) *There are 34 NQF Safe Practices. 20 Safe Practice s are highlighted in the 2009 Patient Safety Program Evaluation. Those selected for inclusi on are those in which significant impr ovement activity occurred this past year and data exists to evaluate performance. 2 Part 1: Safe Outcomes 3 National Quality Forum Serious Reportable Events (NQF SRE) Why is this important? The NQF first developed this list in 2003 and subsequently updated it in 2006. The list of events is based on the best evidence that they are almost always preventable and should never occur in health care. In the most recent legislative session, Texas joined a growing number of states requiring mandatory reporting of never events. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has also adopted many of its Hospital Acquired Conditions (conditions for which they will deny payment) from this list. How is Parkland doing? For the past several years, the Patient Safety and Risk department has built an infrastructure to capture internal knowledge of all NQF SRE occurrences at Pa rkland. Activities included: Ongoing education for all st aff including physicians regar ding the need to report these types of events 24/7 Availability of both an internet based reporting system and a risk analyst on- call available through the pager system Surveillance of certain billing codes, patient complaints, and record reviews Although, the rate of occurrence has remained steady over the past year, it is anticipated that with the learnings from these past events and the structural and process improvement efforts outlined in this report a measurable decline in t he occurrence of SRE will be visible over the next year. 4 Analysis of the NQF events that occurred last year indicates that our greatest improvement opportunities are with pressure ulcers, retai ned foreign objects, and medication errors. (Though healthcare associated infections as noted elsewhere in this r eport are a significant proportion of our safety events they are not on the NQF SRE list because not all are preventable.) Each of these events has under gone a formal review process and many of them have had a root cause analysis in an effort to best learn what hap pened, why it happened and how we can prevent it from happening again. Analysis by patient care process indicates that our opportunity lie s within the assessment phase - assessment was the primary root cause of the hospital acquired pressure ulcer cases. 5 Agency for Healthcare Research on Quality (AHRQ) - Patient Safety Indicators Why is this important? The AHRQ Patient Safety Indicato rs (PSIs) utilize readily avail able administrative claims data such as coding information to better understand pat ient safety performance at hospitals. CMS has adopted a number of the PSIs for inclusion in its 2010 Value-Based Purchasing Initiative, with the intent to publicly r eport performance on these measures. Because the PSIs are determined from administrative clai ms data, performance on these metrics is a reflection of not only care processes, but also appropria te documentation and coding practices. How is Parkland doing? Participation in the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) Clinical Data Base (CDB) has allowed Parkland to compare its performance against that of othe r academic medical centers. UHC currently has 105 members participating in the CDB including 40 members of the National Association of Public Hospitals. The AHRQ Patient Safety Quality Indicator Composite is a composite meas ure using an AHRQ formulation that incorporates performance on eleven AHRQ PSIs into one metric. As indicated above, Parkland's overall perf ormance on the AHRQ PSI Composite though improving is still higher (higher is worse fo r this indicator) than the median of the UHC membership. Internal analysis by a collaborative te am with representatives from Health Information Management and Clinical Quality M anagement indicated that hospital acquired pressure ulcers, prevention of venous th romboembolism, and accidental punctures and lacerations are the top priorities for improvem ent; the first two indicators a clinical care opportunity and the third is a mixed opportunity (c oding, documentation, and clinical care). 6 Part 2: Safe Practices 7 Leadership Structure and Systems Why is this important? Leadership structures and systems must be established to ensure that there is organization- wide awareness of patient safety performance gaps, direct accountability of leaders for those gaps, adequate investment in per formance improvement abilities and activities, and that actions are taken as necessary to ensur e the safe care of every patient. How is Parkland doing? In 2009 leadership made a number of significant changes that provided necessary support allowing the continued growth of a comprehensive patient safety program. These changes included: Administrative restructuring to include fo rmation of the Division of Clinical Quality Management and within it the Department of Patient Safety and Risk. Alignment of institut ional risk management activities with the patient safety program to eliminate duplication of effort s (event investigations) and to allow for development of a consistent message to our frontline staff - t hat the purpose of an event investigation is to learn what happened so that we can prevent future patients from experiencing harm. Creation of the Patient Safety Review Committee, a multidisciplinary leadership committee whose scope includes reviewing si gnificant adverse ev ents and the patient safety practices designed to ensure safe care. Formal participation with and reporting to an AHRQ designated Patient Safety Organization. Creation of high level patient safety metr ics (number of NQF SRE events and number of high harm events) that are routinely reviewed by institutional medical, nursing, and operational leadership. Expansion of the scope of the Patient Ca re Review Committee, a medical staff performance body, to include systematic review s of medical staff performance related to improving patient safety. Significant work remains to enha nce leadership systems related to patient safety throughout all levels of both administrative and medical leadership within t he organization. Some of necessary steps include: Addressing accountability while preserving t he tenets of a just cu lture that supports system learning from events Effective incorporation of learning from process failures into ongoing care delivery system improvement both at an i ndividual nursing unit level as well as at the enterprise level Training of leaders in the principles of clinical process im provement, appropriate interpretation of data related to process management, and systems theory Development of role models and mentors regarding effective in corporation of an adverse event response (disclosure, learning , support of the caregi ver) into the patient care process 8 Culture Measurement, Feedback, and Intervention Why is this important? Safe patient care cannot be g uaranteed for all patients unless all employees are actively engaged in ensuring safe care at a ll times, in other words, unless a culture of safety exists. Just as it is necessary for any other dimens ion in which one is trying to achieve change, measurement of progress and intentional activities to improv e the culture are necessary. How is Parkland doing? Parkland has administered the AHRQ Culture of Safety Survey every 12 to 18 months for a total of three surveys. The survey captures questions pertaining to ten dimensions of safety culture as well as asks staff to gi ve an overall patient safety grade. As indicated in the graphs above, in comparis on to last year (and the year prior, not illustrated), Parklands performance has been unc hanged. In comparis on to the national database, Parkland performs a little worse than average across all dimensions. For the first time, formal action plans are being created to try to bring about meaningful change in these results. 9 Identification and Mitigation of Risks and Hazards Why is this important? To drive down preventable harm, systematic and reliable approaches to identification and mitigation of risks are required. Identification of risks must come from multiple sources of data as no one source can provide a comprehensive pictur e of patient safety in the institution. Identification of risks s hould be directly linked to prioriti zation of performance improvement activities of the organization to ensur e true mitigation of clinical risk. How is Parkland doing? In addition to the NQF SRE and t he AHRQ Patient Safety Indicato rs, the reports in the Patient Safety Net (PSN) are systematically review ed and analyzed to identify opportunities for improvement. Work is ongoing with respect to continuing efforts that enhance risk identification capabilities as well as on the more formal integrat ion of these findings into the annual performance goal setting processes. At Parkland, reports to the PSN continue to be a rich source of information regarding improvement opportunities in ou r patient care processes; reporting rates are consistently above the median for large UHC hospitals. The increases in reporting coincide with Good Catch games, an initiative designed to encourage reporting of near misses to increase learning regarding opportunities to improve care. 10 Reporting of High Harm Events (those safety ev ents that cause harm and either prolongation of hospital stay, need for ICU care, permanent harm, or death) has remained steady over the past year. Reporting of High Ha rm Events represents approximately 7% of all reporting to PSN - this means that on a daily basis we harm two patients a day in a significant way. Some safety events, though a resu lt of medical care, are not pr eventable by currently known standards of care. An example would be the pat ient that suffers an anaphylactic (a life - threatening allergic response) reaction to a m edication that he's never previously received. 11 Of those High Harm Events thought to be potentiall y preventable, the largest categories were related to procedural complicat ions, coordination of care, and health care associated infections. Ongoing improvement efforts (e.g . simulation training for medicine residents, availability of clin ical documentation in the electronic medical record, a renewed focus on hand hygiene) are directed to dec reasing harm to patients. 12 Disclosure Why is this important? Patients expect and deserve timely, transparent, and complete information following unanticipated serious outcomes includ ing those that are the result of a system failure. Though traditionally disclosure of error has been thought to increase the risk of litigation, multiple studies have shown the opposite. What most pat ients want is an apology and the knowledge that everything is being done to prevent the same error from occurring to someone else. How is Parkland doing? In December 2008, the Board of Managers approved a policy dev eloped by medical staff leadership supporting a health syst em stance supporting full disclosure to patients. Patient Safety and Risk staff members are available to suppo rt clinicians in this process. Institutional level disclosure was performed in one case. Conti nuing effort is necessary to continue to educate and support Parkland staff in full disclos ure and the resources available. \"Just in Time\" educational materials are planned for the Patien t Safety intranet site. In addition, efforts are underway to collaborate with the Ethics Lecture Series for physician trai ning on this topic. A significant number indicate \" unknown\" reflecting that neither the medical record nor the records of the event review proc ess captured this information. Th is is significantly increased for the NQF Serious Reportable Events because many of these are identified much later after the fact through surveillance of coding records. 13 Care of the Caregiver Why is this important? Most adverse events are due to system failure s rather than intentional harm or gross negligence on the part of the car egiver. As a result caregive rs directly involved in events resulting in patient harm often become the \"second victim\". Caregivers can also be traumatized by the occurrence of an adverse event to someone for whom they were providing care. How is Parkland doing? By procedure, all reviews of adverse event performed by the Patient Safety and Risk staff are performed in a systematic fashion to determi ne what happened without in creasing individual caregiver trauma. Individua ls involved in an event are encouraged to participate in improvement activities to prevent recurrences by sharing their story, sharing suggestions for improvement, and always being informed of decisions and actions taken to prevent recurrence. In the past year, the procedure was revised to in corporate the participati on of a representative from the Employee Assist ance Program (EAP) to be present at debriefings of particularly traumatic events. Caregivers involved are also educated as to how they personally access EAP for assistance. Future efforts will focus on developing frontline m anager capacity for support of the individual caregiver after an adverse event. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Care Why is this important? Patients in the intensive care units are the most critica lly ill patients in the hospital. Critical care medicine requires significant expertise given the acuity of the patients and the complexity of the medical treatments and devices now available to save lives. How is Parkland doing? With the introduction of core privileges for the m edical staff this past year, the critical care physician group adopted privilegi ng standards consistent wit h this NQF Safe Practice. Specifically, to be privileged to provide care on t he Burn ICU service, the Medical ICU service, the Surgical ICU service, and the Neonatal ICU service, the medical staff member must be board certified in a critical care subspecialty of an appr opriate board. In addition, standard expectations for attending ICU physicians were adopted as outlined in Medical Staff Procedure: Intensive Care Unit Attending Role and Resp onsibilities. These expectations address the role of the attending physician regarding: Communication and coordination of care Documentation Supervision of residents Role in graduate medical education Schedules Procedures 14 Patient Care Information (Critical Results) Why is this important? Communication of diagnostic test results critical to a patient's care must occur timely so that clinicians can intervene as appropriate for patients. The Joint Commission has adopted this practice as a National Patient Safety Goal. How is Parkland doing? Annually, the Medical Advisory Council approves a list of proposed critical values. Significant changes were made to the list this past year based upon the work of a physician workgroup that looked at best practices to clearly define which results are truly critical for patient care. Additional review of the noncomp liant charts showed that appropriate interventions were taken in a timely way, suggesting that communication occurr ed appropriately but was not documented. Ongoing work consists of building flow sheet rows within the electroni c medical record to facilitate documentation of critic al results as well as ongoing m onitoring of the timeliness of reporting. 15 Read Back Why is this important? Though verbal orders are necessary to patient ca re particularly in emergency situations there is always the risk that they may be misunderstood. To minimize this risk, verbal orders and critical results are always expected to be written down and read back for confirmation. How is Parkland doing? Read Back is an expectation in all settings in wh ich either verbal order s or communication of critical results occurs. Monitoring of order r ead back occurs in the l aboratory when critical results are released to a licensed provi der (physician or registered nurse). As shown, compliance with verbal read back proc edures has been consistently high over time. 16 Labeling of Diagnostic Studies Why is this important? Medical treatments for inpatients are often determi ned by the results of diagnostic tests. To ensure that diagnostic test result s are reported on the correct pati ent, it is critical that all specimens or studies be correctly labeled. The Joint Commission made correct labeling of patient specimens a National Patient Safety Goal. How is Parkland doing? Correct labeling of specimens continues to be a challenge. To date ongoing efforts have emphasized the safe practice of labeling at the bedside to minimize the risk for error. Future efforts will focus in addition on utilization of bar-c oding technology to facilitate correct labeling of specimens at all times. 2 to 3 patients Per day experience delay in care Occurrences in 2009 are lower than in past year s; however, occurrence rates are still elevated with significant variation. 17 Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) Why is this important? Given the frequency of medication use and the potential for significant harm if ordered incorrectly, safe ordering of medications is an essential component of a safe healthcare system. Correct implementation of computerized physician order entry (a system in which the physician directly enters orders) eliminates transcription errors due to illegibility, use of abbreviations, etc. An effective CPOE system is contingent upon proper installation, sufficient physician training, and ongoing monitoring and improvement. How is Parkland doing? CPOE was successfully implement ed in April 2009 in t he inpatient care units. In 2010, the remaining patient care areas including dia gnostic areas and document ation of anesthesia services will go live. The medical staff has supported CPOE wherever it is available with mandatory training for all physician users. A pharmacy user group as well as multiple physician user groups monitor its use and makes recommendations for changes as necessary. The percentage of orders entered by CPOE is very high particularly considering that some areas of the hospital are still in a \"hybrid m edical record\" state. (The \"meaningful use\" requirement proposed by CMS for the reimbursem ent incentive program for the adoption of health information technology 80% in ambulator y and 10% in hospital settings of all orders should be directly entered.) Since the introducti on of CPOE, errors due to misinterpretation of the provider's request (a previously recurring phenomenon) have been eliminated. 18 Pharmacist Leadership Structure & Systems Why is this important? The medication use process is complex, cons isting of multiple phases involving many members of the healthcare team. The opportunity for medication errors to occur at any step in the medication use process is great. According to The Institute of Medicine Report, approximately 7,000 people die each year because of medication errors, many of which are preventable. The Joint Commission and The National Quality Forum believe pharmacy should have a leadership role in monito ring and managing the medication use process to assist the organization with reducing the potential for medication errors. How is Parkland doing? The year 2009 closed with signif icant improvements being made in pharmacist leadership over the medication management system throughout the organization. Some of which included: Establishment of an enter prise wide Medication Use Safety Improvement Committee chaired by the Pharmacy Director, to review and monitor reports of medication errors. The team identifies and evaluates the effect iveness of medication safety improvement processes and communicates trends and improvement opportunities to the medical and operational leadersh ip and staff. Initiation of routine reporting by Pharmacy of medication errors in each phase of the medication use process to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committ ee, a Medical Staff Committee, and to the nursing staff. Implementation of computer ized physician order entry (CPO E) with pharmacist review and verification of medication orders prior to medication administration. Establishment of an Epic Pharmacy workgroup with physician, nursing, pharmacy and IT staff participation to monitor the effe ctiveness of medication use in Epic and recommend system improvements. Pharmacy and Nursing evaluatio n of the medication adminis tration workflow and risk points. An interdisciplinary approach of evaluat ing the effectiveness of the medication management system and changes made thro ughout the year resulted in the identification of the top areas for improvements in 201 0. Some improvements targeted include: o Improve responding and reporti ng of Adverse Drug Events o Optimize use of Epic for medication management o Improve security and storage of medications o Coordination of care involving medi cations between inpatient and Jail Health 19 Influenza Prevention Why is this important? Influenza is a seasonal illness that can have serious consequences particularly for the elderly and the very young. Transmission within the hospita l from either patients or employees is a significant possibility and can be minimized by adherence to Centers for Disease Control influenza prevention practices. One of the most important of these prac tices is vaccination of employees. How is Parkland doing? Parkland Occupational Health has offered influenza vaccination to employees for many years. New initiatives to improve vaccination rates this year included: Use of a declination form to document refusal Publication of employee vaccination/decli nation rates by division to leadership Employee Flu Champions Ongoing efforts to bring the vaccine to employees at place of work Though influenza vaccination is not mandatory, ra tes have steadily increased due to activities such as the performance improvement efforts out lined above. Increasing numbers of health care institutions are mandating employee influenza vaccination. 20 Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection Prevention Why is this important? Some patients with catheters placed in their major veins for medical treatments may develop infections with bacteria and fungal organisms - central line infe ctions. A large proportion of these infections can be prevented by insert ing the catheters under sterile conditions, maintaining and accessing the catheters in a clean and safe manner, and removing the catheters as soon as they are no longer needed. Occasionally central line infections can lead to preventable deaths of patients. How is Parkland doing? Parkland has implemented a series of evidence based practices known as the central line bundle to prevent these infections. Those practices are: Appropriate hand hygiene Use of maximal barrier precautions - sterile draping of the entire patient not just the insertion site and use of sterile gown and mask by the inserter Use of chlorhexidine to prepare the site Avoidance of the femoral site (which pr edisposes to infections) unless medically necessary Presence of a nurse at every insertion w ho ensures that all measures noted above are followed and intervenes when nece ssary to protect the patient The nurse present fills out a checklist documenting compliance with the above measures. The chart below illustrates the resu lts of those checklists - compliance with the bundle though high remains variable. 21 22 As indicated, the overall number of central line infections is sign ificantly lower in 2009. Most recent risk adjusted rates by indi vidual type of intensive care unit are lower (lower is better for this indicator) than the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) mean performance. Current improvement efforts are focused on daily review of catheter necessity, sterile maintenance and access of the catheter, and ensuring checklist performance at every insertion including those insertions perform ed outside the critical care areas. NSHN Participation Checklist Implementation Care of the Ventilated Patient Why is this important? Patients in the intensive care unit on ventilator s are at risk for many complications: ventilator associated pneumonia, venous thromboembolism, stress related intestinal hemorrhagic disease, dentition problems, and pressure ulcers to name a few. To prevent these complications, successful treatment of requires reliable use of evidence based practices. How is Parkland doing? The adult intensive care units ha ve worked together over the pa st two years to implement the Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Bundle: a series of evidence based practices known to decrease the incidence of co mplications for patients on vent ilators. Current efforts are focused on strengthening the weaning protocols thr ough the efforts of resp iratory therapy care to decrease the time pati ents spend on a ventilator. Overall performance of the VAP bundle has been consistent since shortly after initial implementation. Due to the complexity of their underlying illness (e.g. trauma, hemodynamic instability) many patients at Pa rkland are not eligible for the all of the VAP bundle elements - the gap in performance noted above is primar ily due to medical contraindications. 23 VAP Bundle performance on medica lly eligible patients, though a lways high has significantly improved in recent months. As indicated below, the overall number of patients with ventilator associated pneumonia is significant ly lower in 2009; recent risk adjusted rates by individual intensive care unit continue to be higher (higher is worse for this measure) than the NHSN mean. 24 Pressure Ulcer Prevention Why is this important? Inpatients are at high risk for development of pressure ulce rs because of their medical condition and being at bed rest. Once developed, pressure ulcers require specialized nursing care and significant time to heal. They also run the risk of becoming infected and causing additional complications for the patient. It is now known that many pressure ulcers can be prevented with the applicati on of specific evidence based practi ces. Hospital acquired Stage 3 and Stage 4 pressure ulcers are a NQF SRE. Hospital acquired pr essure ulcers are a hospital acquired condition for which CMS will deny payment. How is Parkland doing? During this past year, nursing accepted the challenge of im plementing the known evidence based practices for pressure ulcer prevention: a full skin risk assessment with Braden score at admission, precautions for all patients, and addi tional precautions for high risk patients. 2 to 5 patients a month develop pressure ulcer Results are significantly impr oved with the process changes implemented this past year. (Current performance is slightly better than t he UHC median.) It is anticipated that further improvement will be noted wit h integration of nursing care processes with the electronic medical record. 25 Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prevention Why is this important? Inpatients are at significantly increased risk for VTE (blood clots that can form in veins of the pelvis and legs and travel to the lungs) due to underlying medical conditions such as surgery and bed rest. Though not all hospital acquired VTEs are preventable it is now known that many are preventable through appropriate ev idence based use of VTE prophylaxis. Postoperative VTE is one of the Patient Safety Indicators sele cted for public reporting in this coming year. CMS has identified VTE post knee and hip orthopedic procedures as a hospital acquired condition for which payment will be denied. How is Parkland doing? Data suggests that a high percentage of patient s receive VTE prophylaxis but that the risk of VTE is sometimes underestimated, therefore, some patients may be \"under-prophylaxed\". 20 patients a month develop VTE Since the EMR implementation the number of cases of hospi tal acquired VTE has dropped most likely due to the inclusion of prophylaxis orders on many admission order sets. (Current performance on the postoperative VT E Patient Safety Indicator is slightly worse than the UHC median.) Current improvement efforts are focus ed on building an electronic risk assessment system that integrates wit h the prophylaxis order set. 26 Anticoagulation Therapy Why is this important? Anticoagulation therapy, most commonly heparin and warfarin, are a frequently used therapy for the treatment and prevention of various conditions associated wit h formation of blood clots. Though essential when indicated, these treatments are also very high risk when errors are made in their usage. The Institute for Safe M edication Practices (ISMP) has designated this category of medication as high alert. The Jo int Commission has designated monitoring of anticoagulation therapy as a Na tional Patient Safety Goal. How is Parkland doing? Parkland has an extensive ambulatory anticoagulat ion program including a multidisciplinary clinic on campus and five pharmaci st led clinics at various Comm unity Oriented Primary Care locations. These clinics utilize a mu ltitude of safe practices allowing for the safe care of a large number of patients with minimum complic ations. These practices include: Immediate access for discharged pat ients newly started on warfarin Comprehensive education for all new patients Strong pharmacist involvement for appropriate dose adjustment Point of care INR testing so that changes in therapy can be made at the time of the visit Written dosage instructions at every visit Follow up for all patients who miss appointments. Safety practices for inpatients on anticoagulant therapy include the following: Heparin protocol as an electronic order set within the EMR which includes o Default orders for the appr opriate monitoring of the drug effect on the patient o Dose adjustment by nursing within previously established parameters o Parameters for when the physician must be notified of abnormal clotting results Development of clinical gu idelines for the practitioner s regarding safe initiation and monitoring of warfarin Pharmacist involvement to ensure that ever y patient has the appropr iate clotting tests at initiation of warfarin Pharmacist involvement to ensure ongoing ordering of clo tting tests as indicated and that appropriate action is taken as indicated while patients are continued on warfarin . 27 28 It was not until pharmacists were directly involved in the monitoring of warf arin that a drop in medication events related to anticoagulation was s een. Future efforts include utilizing clinical decision support tools wit hin the EMR to facilit ate ongoing improvement .Enhanced Pharmacist Involvement Organ Donation Why is this important? Hospital policies that are consist ent with applicable law and organ donation regulations should be in place and should address pati ent and family preferences for organ donation, as well as specify the roles and desired outcomes fo r every stage of t he donation process. How is Parkland doing? Parkland has a collaborative relationship with Southwest Transplant Alliance, our assigned organ procurement or ganization (OPO). Policies and procedures are consistent with al l applicable regulations. The hospital has an Organ Donation Collaborative team that meets regularly with members from the OPO and the Tissue Bank. Organ donation referral rates are measured to verify that all ventilated pa tients in the ICU or ER with a devastating neurological injury are appr opriately referred to th e OPO at the time of death. Family members of m edically eligible patients are then approached by the OPO. The conversion rate is the percentage of eligib le patients whose families consent to organ donation. Parkland Hospital has received rec ognition from Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for outstanding conv ersion rates in 2006, 2007 and 2008. . 29 Glycemic Control Why is this important? Nationally, diabetes has reached epidemic proportions with the Centers for Disease Control labeling it as the seventh c ause of death in 2006. Increasing evidence suggests that better glycemic control during hospitalization results in improved morbidity and mortality outcomes. Hypoglycemia is a frequent adverse ev ent related to insulin usage t hat is so common that it is often not perceived as an adverse event. The Inst itute for Safe Medical Practice has labeled insulin a high alert drug because of the problems with hypoglycemia if it is administered in error. Hypoglycemia is associated both with temporary harm and the potential for many long lasting sequelae. CMS has selected conditions associated with poor glycemic control as one of the hospital acquired conditions for which payment will be denied. How is Parkland doing? Multiple service lines have devoted efforts th is past year to improving glycemic management for Parkland patients and reducing the effects of hy poglycemia. Major init iatives have included the following: An insulin order set incorporated into the electronic medical record build Coordination of food tray, medication adm inistration, and glucose monitoring on the inpatient units And implementation of RALS connectivity to facilitate immediate and accurate communication of point of care gluc ose testing results into the EMR. 2 to 5 patients daily require treatment for low blood sugar Rates of severe hypoglycemia have been significant ly reduced. Current efforts are focused on optimization of the insulin or der set and house-wide implementat ion of glucose monitoring, insulin administration, and food tray delivery coordination. 30 Falls Prevention Why is this important? Anytime a patient falls, he/she is at risk of inju ry, disability, or even death. Many medical treatments increase the risk of falling, especially blood pressu re and/or cardiac medications, pain medications, and intravenous lines and other devices attached to the body. The Joint Commission lists falls as the sixth most common cause of senti nel events. CMS has selected injuries due to falls during hospitalization as a hospital acquired condition that will be denied payment. How is Parkland doing? Parkland has a Fall Reduction program which c onsists of a nursing fall risk assessment on admission, standardized precautions for all patients and additional precautions for those at increased risk, and a post fall review process. The most significant interventions continue to be routine rounding on patients as well as timely res ponse to call lights. Both of these activities continue to be a focus of ongoing improvement efforts on the inpatient nursing units. 1 to 2 patients fall every day Despite ongoing efforts the fall rate has not signi ficantly changed over time. In addition to the nursing activity noted above, future efforts will fo cus on incorporating le arnings from every fall occurrence into the fall reduction program. 31 Attachment 1 List of Serious Reportable Events (NQF 2009) Serious Reportable Events 1.

Gynecology Transplant Service (AV Fistula Placement) Plastic Surgery (Reconstructive Surgery) Orthopedics Pain Management2004 Key Assumptions 1.Parkland will partner with UTSW to attract funded patients for UTSW Private Patient Clinic. 2.Business practices will be aggressive with insurance companies and ensure that all patients comply with payment guidelines. 3.Patient experience will be seamless and efficient. 4.Focus on customer satisfaction.1.This type of relationship was not developed. UTSW built an Outpatient Center to accommodate the insured ambulatory surgery volume. 2.PHHS does comply with insurance payment guidelines but insured patients are not at the 2004 Performa level. 3.Patient experience is seamless and efficient. 4.The Simmons ASC produces high patient and physician satisfaction scores.Current State 2004 Assumptions2004 Key Assumptions 5.Resembles a private practice model with [limited] resident involvement. 6.Midlevel providers will be used to supplement medical staff as appropriate. 7.Procedure cost will be lower in ASC vs. Main OR. 8.Efficiency - more efficient staff ratios, procedure time, and supply cost. 9.Capacity - relieves OR and nurse unit capacity at PMH.5.Not a private practice model but a teaching model in 100% of cases. 6.CRNAs are used in Anesthesia but not other midlevels due to resident presence. 7.Cost per case comparison in Main OR and ASC as would be expected.8.Adjusted staff ratios to meet JC and AORN standards, longer procedure times due to teaching model. 9.The ASC provided additional inpatient capacity in the Main OR as expected.Current State 2004 Assumption2004 Key Assumptions 10.Teaching - Creates more opportunities for resident hours and training. 11.Utilization - high patient throughput and room maximization.12.Lithotripsy services will be provided at ASC (included in volume projections).13.Faculty contract expense was estimated on FTE model vs. RVU model with increases for inflation. 10.Provide true ambulatory setting for teaching cases - ACGME requirement in many services. 11.Has seen significant improvements in last 12 months.12.Lithotripsy services were relocated to the Urology Outpatient Clinic.13.FY 09 PMH shifted to a RVU model to be consistent with MSA. Prior to opening, the budgeted physician salary expense was increased from $1.5M to $3.6M due to changes in case and payer mix assumptions.Current State 2004 Assumption2004 Key Assumptions 14.Backfill Scenario - PMH will backfill volume with Bariatric Service line (606 cases per year in Main OR and fill 18-bed inpatient unit). 15.Private cases done by some departments will move from St Paul/Zale to Simmons ASC. 1.Plastics 2.GI 3.Pain14. Dr. Provost left UTSW. The volume backfill scenario was never fulfilled. A bariatric surgery program was never started at Parkland due to significant changes in reimbursement and lack of available surgeons. 15. Departments that planned to move to PMH moved to UTSW OSC instead. The insured outpatient surgical volume was retained at UTSW.

UTSW opened their own surgery center within t heir new St. Paul Outpatient Center in advance of Parkland opening the Simmons ASC in order to retain the insured patient population. This negatively impacted both the projected volume as well as payer mix. 2.The Parkland ASC functions as a full blown teaching environment which was not intended in the original pro-forma. The ACGME require ments of numerous surgical training programs requires the residents to have a robust ambulatory surgery experience. That could not be accomplished by limiting the residents' experi ence to the main operating room and limiting their exposure to high volume, lower acuity cases. This deviation from the original pro-forma led to longer case times thus limiting the total volume that could be accommodated in the ASC.Summary 3.Parkland had projected significant volume in GI procedures at the ASC that has not fully materialized due to a shortage of attending Gast roenterologists to perform the procedures. Currently, 2200 Parkland patients are awaiti ng a screening colonoscopy of which 400 are Parkland employees. Alternative providers are being sought to prov ide these services. 4. Not all surgical departments that had agreed to migrate cases from the Main OR did so. 5. The Simmons ASC receives extremely hi gh satisfaction ratings from patients and physicians. 6. The cost per case at the Simmons ASC is well within benchmark. 7. The opening of the Simmons ASC allowed for the much needed expansion of capacity in the main operating room.ASC Operational Improvements: Next Steps Organizational Structure Changes \u0083Consolidation of Director positions \u0083Standardize Equipment, Supplies, and Implants \u0083Sharing of Resources (Supplies and Staff) Operating Room Expansion \u0083Open the 6thOR Suite \u0083Add 780 Cases Colorectal Surgery Support for GI Procedures \u0083Currently added 2 days to provide screening colonoscopy \u0083Continue to work with UTSW to recr uit and retain qualified Gastroenterologists \u0083Seeking alternative providers to provide GI services at Parkland Continued Migration of Day Surgery Cases from the Main OR to the Simmons ASCCommunity Oriented Primary Care TODAY Clinic Update Board of Managers February 2010 Background and Budget 2PHHS was notified by the Parkland Foundation that an anonymous donor was interested in making a $2,000,000 donation.

COST: $150,000 estimated annual fees. Recommendation Approve contract. Background PHHS investment consultant RogersCasey assisted with a search and evaluation of global fixed income investment managers related to the P HHS defined benefit retirement plan. Global fixed income strategies involve investments in non-U. S. government and cor porate bonds. Seven firms responded to the RFP of which six went on for further analysis by the consultant. Below are the overall scores. Candidate Score Firm 1 86 Colchester 87 Firm 3 83 Firm 4 84 Firm 5 88 Firm 6 89 The PHHS Investment Committee reviewed the scores and details concerning each of the candidates and selected two firms for interviews: Colchester and Firm 6 (Firm 5 was not selected due to its low balance of investments in the st rategy). Both candidat es had similar performance over a multi-year term. Firm 6 invests in a variety of foreign investments, including corporate and government bonds, currencies, high yield, and emerging credits. Firm 6 also has only four investors with combined holdings of $48 million in its proposed fund ($690 million in the strategy). Colchester invests solely in i nvestment grade sovereign (government) bonds and currency markets. As of September 30, 2009, Colchester had 331 investors in its $2 billion fund. After the presentations, the Committee determined th at Colchester's approach represented a better fit with the portfolio over the long term. The Investment Committee recommends Colchester Global Investors, Inc for the defined benefit retirement plan's global fixed income strategy funding of approximately $25 million to be re- allocated from existing domestic fixed income strategies. Financials Fees estimated at $150,000 per year based on a $25 million invested balance and 60 basis points (0.60%) of the invested amount.

Parkland Community Health Plan, Inc. (PCHP) funds are covered by this Policy, but are managed as separately invested assets PURPOSE: The purpose of this Investment Policy is to comply with Chapter 2256 of the Texas Government Code (Public Funds Investment Act), which requires each subject entity to adopt a written policy regarding the investment of its funds and funds under its control. The Investment Policy addresses the methods, procedures and practices that must be exercised to ensure effective and judicious fiscal management of the District's funds. SCOPE: This Policy shall govern the investment of all hospital operating and bond funds and related reserves under the control of the District. This policy does not cover funds contained within the Parkland Foundation and PHHS employee benefit plans (which are managed pursuant to separate Investment Policies). In order to ensure optimum investment yields and liquidity, the District combines all of its cash, excluding that of bond program funds held in a separate trust relationship, the PCHP, the Parkland Foundation and PHHS employee benefit plans. . OBJECTIVES: Investment of the funds covered by this Policy shall be governed by the following investment objectives, in order of priority: Safety: Safety of principal is the primary objective of the Investment Policy. Investment of the District's funds shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital for the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, investment in only high quality securities and diversification are required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. Liquidity: The District's investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable the District to meet all operating requirements that might be reasonably anticipated while also seeking maximum yield. 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 2Yield: The District's investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining the best yield, throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the District's investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. The benchmark yield used for the Investment Manager's performance is the Barclays Capital 1-5 year Government Index. INVESTMENT OFFICERS: The District's Board of Managers shall designate by resolution all officers and employees responsible for, and authorized to, manage and invest funds controlled by the District (Investment O fficers). The Investment Officers shall be the individuals primarily responsible for investment activity under this Policy. The authority to manage the District's funds is effective until rescinded by the Board of Managers or until termination of the person's employment from the District. A minimum of two Investment Officers shall approve purchases of investment instruments. Investment Officers acting in accordance with this policy and all other applicable laws, are relieved of personal responsibility and liability in the management of the investment portfolio, provided that: 1) The Investment Officer acts in accordance with the standard of prudence described below; 2) The Investment Officer does not act in violation of the ethics and conflict of interest standards contained in this policy; 3) The Investment Officer does not act with reckless disregard, fraud, or intentional misconduct; and 4) Deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion to the Board of Managers and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. The Board of Managers, at its discretion, may designate an Investment Management Firm which meets industry standards as an Investment Officer in order to manage all, or a portion of, the District's invested funds in accordance with this Policy. INVESTMENT TRAINING: Investment Officers are required to attend at least one training session, provided by an independent source, within twelve months of assuming investment-related duties under this Policy. Such training must include education in investment controls, security risks, strategy risks, market risks, diversification, and compliance with the Public Funds Investment Act. After the initial training session, each Investment Officer is required to receive not less 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 3than ten hours of related instruction every two years.

PRUDENCE: The standard of prudence to be applied by Investment Officers shall be the \"prudent investor\" rule. This rule states that \"Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived\". In determining whether an Investment Officer has exercised prudence with respect to an investment decision, the determination shall be made taking into consideration the investment of all funds over which the official had responsibility rather than consideration as to the prudence of a single investment. ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Investment Officers involved in the investment process are to refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment process, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. I n v e s t m e n t Officers must file a disclosure statement with the Texas Ethics Commission and the District's Board of Managers if: 1) the Investment Officer has a personal business relationship with a business organization offering to engage in an investment transaction with the District; or 2) the Investment Officer is related within the second degree by affinity or consanguinity (Immediate Family Member), as determined under Chapter 573 of the Texas Government Code (see attachment), to an individual seeking to transact investment business with the District. 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 4An Investment Officer has a personal business relationship with a business organization if: 1) the Investment Officer or, their Immediate Family Member, owns 5 percent or more of the voting stock or shares of the business organization or owns $5,000 or more of the fair market value of the business organization; 2) funds received by the Investment Officer or their Immediate Family Member, from the business organization exceed 5 percent of his/her gross income for the previous year; 3) the Investment Officer, or their Immediate Family Member is, or has been within the last year, an employee, director or officer of the business organization; or 4) the Investment Officer or their Immediate Family Member has acquired from the business organization, during the previous year, investments with a book value of $2,500 or more for his/her personal account. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS: District funds governed by this Policy may be invested in the instruments described below, all of which are authorized by the Public Funds Investment Act. Investment of District funds in any instrument or security not authorized for investment under the Public Funds Investment Act is prohibited.

As such, each agency mortgage issuer guarantees the payment of principal and interest to investors in their respective pass-through securities, and the principal due investors is secured by a first lien against the underlying residential properties. Not Authorized: 1) Obligations whose payment represents the coupon payments on the outstanding principal balance of the underlying mortgage-backed security collateral and pays no principal. 2) Obligations whose payment represents the principal stream of cash flow from the underlying mortgage-backed security collateral and bears no interest. 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 7 3) Collateralized mortgage obligations 4) Short sales, margin purchases, or leverage in the portfolio. 5) Option or futures contracts, commodities, or direct real estate investments. 6) Corporate bonds, convertible bonds, or equity shares. 7) Obligations of any foreign banks or other entities issued outside of the United States. INVESTMENT SELECTION: It is the policy of the District to require competitive bidding for all individual security purchases and sales except for: 1) Transactions with money market mutual funds and local government investment pools (which are deemed to be made at prevailing market rates); 2) Treasury and agency securities purchased at issue through an approved broker/dealer or financial institution; or 3) Investments purchased by an Investment Management Firm. At least three bids or offers must be solicited for all other transactions involving individual securities. In situations where the exact security being offered is not offered by other broker/dealers, offers on the closest comparable investment may be used to establish a fair market price for the security. SALE OF SECURITIES: The District may hold securities to maturity. However, securities may be sold with explicit approval of the VP & Controller, Sr. VP-Finance, or the Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer for purposes of liquidity, safety, or yield enhancement. Investments administered by an Investment Officer may be actively traded provided the strategy adds value through issue selection, yield curve structure, convexity, and diversification in order to provide safety of principal and lower portfolio risks. DIVERSIFICATION AND MAXIMUM MATURITIES: 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 8 The District attempts to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the District will not directly invest in: 1) Individual securities maturing more than ten (10) years from the date of purchase. 2) Individual eligible Agency MBS as defined previously herein that exhibit average life characteristics and price sensitivity that exceeds that of a five (5) year security. While each eligible mortgage pool will specify a stated final maturity equal to the last contractual payment date due on the mortgages in the pool, such mortgage pass-through pools exhibit aggregate monthly cash flows that create predictable price volatility or average life / average maturity characteristics significantly shorter than the stated final maturity of the pool. (Example: a 30-year FNMA 6.00% mortgage pool may have a \"stated final maturity\" of 2035, but exhibit an average maturity of only three and a half (3.5) years). Mortgage pass-through securities otherwise authorized by this section must have average life / price sensitivity characteristics less than five (5) years at the time of purchase. In order to ensure the ability to meet obligations and to minimize potential liquidation losses, the dollar-weighted average maturity (WAM) of the District's pooled portfolio shall not exceed two (2) years. For the PCHP portfolio, the WAM shall not exceed 180 days. The portion of the District's pooled portfolio managed by an Investment Management Fi rm shall not have a WAM greater than three (3) years. The portfolio duration of the Investment Management Firm's investment assets under management should be plus or minus ten percent (10%) of the benchmark index. In addition, the individual investment portfolios of the District and PCHP will each be diversified to limit market and credit risk by observing the following limitations: 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 9 Investment Type Maximum Portfolio Ratio Maturity Limit Minimum Rating U.S. Treasuries 100% Overall 10 years NA U.S. Agencies & Instrumentalities 100% Overall 40% per Issuer10 years AA Municipals 10% Overall 5% per Issuer 5 years AA Certificates of Deposit 40% Overall 2 years N/A Repurchase Agreements 40% Overall 20% per Issuer 270 days N/A Commercial Paper 40% Overall 5% per Issuer 270 days A1-P1 Money Market Mutual Funds 100% Overall N/A AAA Local Government Investment Pools 100% Overall N/A AAA US Agency/Instrumentality Mortgage Pass-Through Securities 25% Overall 5 years* AAA * Eligible securities must exhibit average life / maturity characteristics less than 5 years at the time of purchase. AUTHORIZED BROKER DEALERS: Any broker/dealer wishing to do business with the District must provide the following: 1) most recent audited financial statements; 2) proof of current certification by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA; formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)); or 3) proof of current registration with the Texas State Securities Commission; 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 104) completed Broker/Dealer Questionnaire; 5) resume of designated brokers. The Treasury Manager reviews all submitted documents, checks backgrounds and references as may be appropriate, and presents findings and recommendations to the Investment Officers. The Investment Officers, after consideration of the broker/dealer's qualifications, may propose acceptance of the application to the Board of Managers. Approved broker/dealers are provided with a copy of the District's Investment Policy so that they may read and understand the District's investment parameters. A qualified representative of the approved broker/dealer firm must execute a written instrument acknowledging that the firm has: 1) received and reviewed the District's Investment Policy; and 2) implemented reasonable procedures and controls in an effort to preclude investment transactions conducted between the District and the organization that are not authorized by the District's Investment Policy, except to the extent that this authorization is dependent on an analysis of the makeup of the District's entire portfolio or requires an interpretation of subjective investment standards. The list of approved broker/dealers must be reviewed, no less than annually, by the Board of Managers. DELIVERY VS. PAYMENT: All marketable securities are purchased using the delivery vs. payment method. Payment for securities purchased is made only upon verification that the correct securities were received by the custodian. Payment may be made in a simultaneous transaction but may not be made before delivery of the securities occurs. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY: The District shall contract with a bank or banks for safekeeping of securities either owned by the District as part of its investment portfolio or held as collateral to secure demand or time deposits. Securities owned by the District shall be held in the District's name as evidenced by safekeeping receipts of the institution holding the securities. 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 11 Collateral for deposits shall be held by a third party custodian designated by the District and pledged to the District as evidenced by safekeeping receipts of the institution with which the collateral is deposited. Original safekeeping receipts shall be obtained. Collateral may be held by the depository bank's trust department, a Federal Reserve Bank or branch of a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or a third party bank approved by the District. COLLATERAL: Consistent with the requirements of the Public Funds Collateral Act, the District requires full collateralization of all uninsured collected balances plus accrued interest, if any. In order to anticipate market changes and provide a level of security for all funds, the collateralization level will be 102% of market value of principal and accrued interest on deposits, less the amount insured by the FDIC. The Treasury Manager is responsible for approving pledges, releases, and substitutions of collateral and for monitoring the market value of the pledged securities to ensure that it is adequate. Eligible collateral shall be limited to Authorized Investments 1-4 of this Policy. STRATEGY: For the PHHS and PCHP portfolios, investments are generally \"laddered\" to mature according to forecasted cash needs and are held to maturity. In addition, the portfolios are conservatively invested according to the following considerations listed in order of importance: 1) Suitability - All investments will be placed in appropriate instruments that are allowed by this Policy and with which the District's Investment Officers are thoroughly familiar. 2) Safety - Investments will be placed in instruments that offer low credit risk and minimal price volatility with the primary objective of preserving invested principal. 3) Liquidity - Securities will be selected to mature according to forecasted cash needs and to provide for contingencies. 4) Marketability - In order to further protect the District's assets from loss in the event that an early liquidation becomes necessary or desirable, a healthy trading market must exist for any securities maturing more than six (6) months from the purchase date. 5) Diversification - The investment portfolios will be diversified among specific issuers and investment types according to this Policy in order to minimize exposure to market and credit risk 8311-1-04 WD 04/91 (see file for interim revision dates) RD 09/07 RD 02/09 RD 02/10 13 Pages PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM FISCAL MANUAL INVESTMENT POLICY 12 6) Yield - Investments will be selected which maximize return on invested principal subject to the above considerations. 7) Trading - Trading securities with the intent to profit from short-term changes in interest rates and/or security valuations is only permitted by an Investment Management Firm. PORTFOLIO REPORTING AND CONTROLS: Not less than quarterly, the Treasury Manager shall prepare a report of investment activity for presentation to the Board of Managers. This report will describe the investment position for the end of the period. The report will detail balances and changes in market and book values as well as fully accrued interest for the reporting period; state the maturity date of each investment held as of the reporting date; and state the compliance of the investment portfolio with this Investment Policy. Market values will be obtained from a reputable and independent source that is disclosed in the quarterly report. This report will be signed by the Board authorized Investment Officers. In connection with the annual financial audit, a review of management controls on investments and adherence to this Policy will be performed and the results will be reported to the Board of Managers. The annual audit by the District's independent auditors will include a review of the quarterly investment reports, the results of which shall be presented to the Board of Managers. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND ADOPTION: Not less than annually, the Board of Managers shall adopt a written instrument by resolution stating that it has reviewed the Investment Policy and that the written instrument so adopted shall record any changes made to the Policy.

Government List s Comparison Parkland should not employ any entity, individual, employee or provider listed on the government sanction lists. DALLAS COUNTY HOSPITAL DISTRICT PARKLAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYSTEM INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES Review of Federal and State Government Excluded Individuals/Entities, Fiscal Year 2010 - 1st Quarter, Report No. 2010 -505 February 10, 2010 A-3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background: The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has been given the authority by the United States Congress to exclude individuals and entities that have engaged in fraud and abuse from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (THHSC), Medicaid Provider Sanctions Division, also has the authority to exclude individuals and entities from participating in Medicaid and Title XX Programs. In addition to t he OIG and THHSC, the U. S. General Services Administration (GSA) maintains a list of individuals, entities, and contractors that are excluded government wide from healthcare and non- healthcare programs. After September 11, 2001, Executive Order 13224 prohibits transactions with persons who commit, threaten to commit or support terrorism. Therefore, comparison to the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Sanction List must also be done prior to hiring and annually thereafter. The impact of the exclusion from Federal and State health care programs is that no payment may be made for any items or services furnished by an excluded individual or entity or directed or prescribed by an excluded provider. The Health Insurance Portability and Account ability Act of 1996 has given OIG the authority to impose Civil Monetary Penalties (CMP) for certain misconduct related to these programs. Under this authority, providers may face CMP exposure if they submit claims to a Federal health care program for heal th care items or services provided, directly or indirectly, by excluded individuals or entities. Providers who submit false claims may face penalties for violations of the civil False Claims Act to a maximum of $10,000 for each false claim. Human Resources, Medical Staff Services, House Staff Services/GME, Purchasing Department, and Outsourced Vendors should perform a search of Federal and State government excluded individuals and entities at the time of hiring employees or prior to contracting with prospective vendors and/or credentialing practitioners. Potential matches are verified with the government agency or with the employee, vendor, or provider. Confirmed matches will result in not hiring or in termination of employment, provider privileges, or vendor relations. If confirmed matches of current employees or vendors are identified during a review, Parkland Hospital will remediate all payments collected for the services and/or products rendered by the excluded individual or entity. Scope & Objectives: Internal Audit Services (IAS) performed a review to determine that the process of verifying all active and inactive potential vendors, employees, independent contractors, and credentialed providers with the Federal and State government exclusion lists is working as intended. Given the scope of the FY2009 review included March 2009, t he current scope reflected activity from April 2009 through December 2009. Conclusion: The FY2010 first quarter review, performed by IAS, screened inactive/active employees, providers, vendors and contractors against the required government exclusion lists. Since the last review, 23 potential matches have been ident ified. O f the 23 potential matches, IAS identified 1 confirmed match. IAS ruled out 18 potential matches and is currently investigating 4 potential matches .

Importance Low Moderate High This review received a high rating for importance because there can be Civil and Monetary penalties imposed on the organization if business transactions occur with an entity, individual, employee or provider on any of the government sanction lists. Fraud Awareness Parkland Health & Hospital System February 23, 2010Presented by Vic Summers, Sr. Vice President of Internal Audit ServicesFraud Awareness At the request of the Board of Managers, Internal Audit Services has continued efforts of increasing the level of fraud awareness in the organization. Surveys were conducted with Management to assess their overall knowledge of fraud. The results of the surveys were presented to Board of Managers. Currently, a program is being developed to increase fraud awareness within the organization by partnering with the Police, Information Security, Patient Financial Services, Compliance Office, and Internal Audit Services departments. 2Fraud Awareness Fraud awareness education is a highly effective fraud prevention technique. Studies have shown that companies with antifraud education programs can cut their fraud losses in half. In 2007, the National Health Care Anti -Fraud Association (NHCAA) estimated that 3% of all healthcare spending is fraudulent. By raising the level of fraud awareness in the organization, Parkland will enable employees in efforts to identify and stop fraud. 3Fraud Awareness An effective Fraud Prevention Program consists of the following elements: Annual fraud risk assessment Establishing policy on fraud Appropriate oversight Adequate internal controls Hotline Fraud Awareness Program Needs Identification Education Monitoring 4Fraud Awareness Monthly articles for the Parkland Now have been developed on topics such as: What is Fraud? Why Fraud Matters to me? How to Report Fraud? Types of Fraud Employees should for: -Kickbacks -Upcoding -Inducement -Medical Necessity -Identity Theft Reminders will be displayed on screen savers and posters. 5Fraud Awareness We are requesting the Board of Managers and Executive Management input to further enhance the program.

Information/Discussion Items A. NEXT STEPS FOR GRAND PRAIRIE COPC Ron Anderson, MD gave an update on the Grand Prairie COPC. The City Mayor and City Council from Grand Prairie have given their approval for the project. Sharon Phillips reported that the Parkland Facilities depart ment would like to look at the proposed sites. Management has a meeti ng scheduled January 22, 2010 at the Grand Prairie location. Dr. Anderson stated that the Parkland CO PC would only service Dallas County Residents as the Los Barrios Clinic and Tarrant C ounty Clinic will treat the Tarrant County population. Scope of services would incl ude both Adult and Pediatric services. Alan Walne remarked that Parkland made a promise to provide four (4) COPC's and two (2) Specialty Clinics. This location would be included as one of the four. The Board understands that COPCs will not yield profits but asked that management identify dollars lost or gained as a result of adding additional COPCs. Mr. Walne stated that he will ask the Board to revisit the implied policy of matching dollars that are given by various cities to build a COPC in a particular location versus looking at a needs assessment provided by the Strategic Pl anning Committee to determine the areas of Dallas County with the greatest need. Strategic Planning Committee Meeting Minutes January 7, 2010 Page 2 of 3 The Committee agreed to make a recommendati on to the Board to move forward with the Grand Prairie COPC. B. NEXT STEPS TO IMPLEMENT CO PC EXPANSION DECISION HEIRARCHY John Haupert reviewed steps for the decisi on hierarchy for the COPC expansion which included system framework and goals; determini ng current performance and estimate clinic access and gap, and identify additional clin ic location candidates by applying various principles.

Dr. Anderson gave a brief overview of presenta tions given by various cities that desire a COPC in their area and discussed his mee ting with John Price, Vice Chancellor for University of North Texas (UNT). UNT has a desire for a School of Pharmacy in which Mr. Price would like to see Parkland Hospital take part in. Discussion ensued re garding possible land sw ap between Methodist Hospital and UNT.
