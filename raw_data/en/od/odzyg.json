FasterCures, as a center of the Milken Institute, is nonpartisan, nonprofit, and independen t of interest groups. Barriers to progress in accelerating cures exis t all along the research continuum\u2014from basic research to development, from medical educ ation to medical practi ce, from investment capital to human capital. FasterCures is working to clear the path to faster progress, not just by analyzing barriers, but by overcoming them through action. A force to catalyze systemic change, FasterCures: Evaluates current systems of disease pr evention, research, development, and treatment; Identifies barriers to efficiency, effectiveness, and ex pediency in those systems; Creates achievable action plans to improve those systems; and Provides seasoned leadership and expertise in implementi ng those action plans in concert with organiza tions searching for ne w medical solutions. To guide its efforts, FasterCures developed a Blueprint fo r Change focused on the transformation needed in th ree areas of medical research: research leadership and innovation; research tools and resources; and the medi cal research environment. The Philanthropy Advisory Service (PAS) aims to promote progress in all three areas through more informed philanthropic investment. HELPING PHILANTHROPISTS MAKE INFORMED INVESTMENT DECISIONS The lack of independent, reliable data about nonprofit disease research opportunities is a major barrier to encouraging significant suppo rt for such research and to improving the efficiency and productivity of philanthropy. With grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Pioneer Portfolio of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, FasterCures has developed the PAS to address this problem. The objectives of PAS include: Helping philanthropists align their goals an d expectations with the capabilities and approaches of resear ch organizations; Identifying gaps in funding for areas cruc ial to the success of specific disease research efforts; and Promoting among potential donors a \"contin uum of cure\" perspective that can help develop cures for deadly and debilitating diseases. PAS creates an information marketplace to support informed philanthropic investment. It improves the efficiency and pr oductivity of both philanthropists and the nonprofit disease research organizations that depend on their support, espe cially in areas where there are demonstrated funding gaps in research and development. PHILANTHROPY ADVISORY SERVICE ANALYST REPORTS PAS provides two types of reports\u2014di sease and organization reports. Disease Reports discuss the burden, progression, and existing treatments for a given disease; highlight priori ty research areas; and provide an overview of relevant activities in the commercial and nonprofit research sectors. These reports provide a broader understanding of the disease, it s toll on the greater society, and any potential products in the pipeline, as well as describe promising research areas. This information establishes the contextual know ledge for readers to consider as they evaluate nonprofit organizations in a specific disease area, particularly with regard to whether an organization is addressing key research areas and challenges. PAS develops disease reports using desktop research. Each report is reviewed and validated by a Scientific Advisory Board, or SAB, composed of lading researchers and clinicians in that disease area. Organization Reports are developed describing the activities of nonprofit organizations involved in disease resear ch. For diseases primarily affecting the developed world, organization s reviewed include those f unding research, as well as those providing tools to support research ef forts. For diseases pr imarily affecting the developing world, the or ganizations reviewed incl ude product development partnerships as well as academic an d private research organizations. These reports provide detailed informat ion on strategy, research portfolio, management, and financials. They also incl ude an assessment of the organization's practices according to a set of metrics that FasterCures believes contribute to the acceleration of biomedical research. Reader s can use this information together with the context outlined in the disease report as an aid to making philanthropic investment decisions. Organization Reports are de veloped based on information collected in the public domain, augmented by discussi ons with representatives of the organization, with input from the relevant PAS SAB. With regards to the National MS Society, the PAS analysts accessed all references included in the document and spoke with th e National MS Society's CEO Joyce Nelson, executive leadership, research staff, an d Fast Forward staff in October 2008. The National MS Society also had an opportunity to review and provide input to the report.

The organization's mission includes funding research in multiple sclerosis (MS) and providing information and support for people affe cted by the disease. In its organizational strategy for 2007-2010, it outlin es five goals including: Be a driving force of MS research Address the challenges of ea ch person living with MS Mobilize the talents of the millions of pe ople who want to do something about MS Be activists Raise $1.25 billion by 2010 Key Research Accomplishments With a long history and a large amount of research funding, the Society points out that it has enabled researchers to enter and pursue a career in MS research, contributed to research that resulted in major breakthroughs in MS, and helped shap e the direction of MS research. The Society includes the fo llowing as its major achievements: Funding research that resulted in the six disease-modifying drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and research that contributed to the development of the curre nt therapeutic pipeline; Funding research and organizing meetings that led to new diagnostic criteria for MS and a standard for clinical trials design in MS; Supporting research on mye lin and axonal repair, whic h demonstrated that both myelin and axonal repair are required to reverse the damage in the central nervous system; Supporting research that successfully le veraged human stem cells to induce myelination in mice; Funding the first clinical trials that demonstrated the benefits of aerobic exercise in MS; Funding research that led to the recognit ion of cognition, de pression, and fatigue as major symptoms of MS and sponsoring rehabilitation trials to address them; Supporting research on sex differences in MS and sex hormone therapies; and Creating and supporting a consortium on MS genetics resear ch, generating the first genome profile for the disease. Rese arch results from the project led to the identification of new gene targets for treatment and understanding of the cause of the disease. In addition to funding research projects, the Society also provides su pport for tissue banks, a clinical trials network for MS, a DNA bank, and a network of Pediatric MS Care Centers to enable research on treatments for juvenile patients and the early-life triggers of MS. Research Portfolio The Society issues approximately 160 new grants per year, which amount to new commitments of $43 million, including multi -year commitments. At any given time, the Society provides support for over 400 active grants in its portfolio. The average grant provides $384,000 over three years, or about $485,000 for Research Grants, the Overview 2 of 50 investigator-initiated grants for established investigators. Its research funding program employs a variety of mechanisms including: \u008a Traditional basic and clinical research grants, including clinical trials \u008a Collaborative Center Awards to foster collaborative resear ch and attract new scientists to MS research \u008a Pilot awards to test innovative ideas yet to be applied in MS \u008a Fellowships to train and build career paths for young investigators \u008a Healthcare Delivery Research Contracts to increase rese arch on care management and quality of life \u008a Requests for proposals (RFPs) for emer ging yet underfunded research areas identified through the Society's scienti fic workshops, taskforce meetings, and portfolio reviews \u008a Fast Forward, an initiative launched in 2007 to fund industry-led drug development programs following a venture fund model. Management Many members of the Society's leadership have spent more th an a decade working with the Society and have risen through its ranks. The na tional Board of Director s, with 35 members, is the ultimate governance body of the Society, and it is structured so that the majority of the members are also members of the chapters' boards of trustees. Major advisory bodies for research and clinical activities includ e the Research Programs Advisory Committee (RPAC), which provides input on research strategy and operation, and the National Clinical Advisory Board (NCAB), which prov ides input on topics pertinent to clinical practitioners and patients. Fast Forward, a subsidiary focusing on funding early-stage ventures on MS, has separate governance an d advisory bodies. Financials The Society has an annual budget of $240 mill ion and $180 million in assets. Its annual program expenses, which amounted to $187 million in 2007, consist of: \u008a Research : 27 percent \u008a Patient support : 43 percent \u008a Public education : 17 percent \u008a Chapter services : 9 percent \u008a Professional education : 4 percent Its fundraising efforts are driven by special ev ents, Bike MS and Walk MS. Major donors are an emerging focus of the Societ y's fundraising practice. Donors can direct their giving to any programmatic area of interest, in which case the contribution is fully allocated to that area without deductions fo r administrative costs. ASSESSMENT Results Summary FasterCures believes the four areas outlined below are characteristics of innovative nonprofit medical research fu nders. Assessment results for the National MS Society are outlined below. Metric Category Assessment Summary Accountability \u0083 The Society's performance in accountability metrics is mostly strong . \u0083 The Society undergoes a strategic planning process every three years and monitors the impact of its research grant programs on regular intervals employing measures specific to each program. Overview 3 of 50 Metric Category Assessment Summary \u0083 In addition to the board of directors and peer reviewers, the Society's Research Program Advisory Committee guides its research operations, as do other advisory groups that it conv enes for specific issues as needed. Collaboration \u0083 The Society's performance in collaboration is outstanding and strong . \u0083 Fast Forward seeks to accelerate industry development of MS treatment by funding early-stage research, and it has entered into a partnership with EMD Serono. \u0083 The Society has played an important role in knowledge sharing in MS research, especially through its Scientific Workshops and Taskforces. \u0083 In addition, the Society has established the Collaborative Center Awards to foster collaboration in the field. Research Effectiveness \u0083 The Society's performance in research effectiveness metrics is strong . \u0083 PAS's scientific advisors point out that it has been the single organization serving as a catalyst for new research in MS. \u0083 The Society's grant program aims to increase collaboration and provide support for under researched and promising areas, and grant mechanisms that target these areas account for a significant portion of the Society's grant portfolio. \u0083 However, the Society could have additional efforts in place to electronically track and measure the impact of the publications resulting from research the Society has funded. Resource Building \u0083 The Society's performance in resource building is outstanding and strong . \u0083 The Society has played an important role in supporting the development of new investigators in MS. \u0083 The Society provides support for multiple tissue banks in MS and also ensures that they use a compatible protocol. Scientific Contribution The table below indicates how the Society cont ributes to the field of MS research by addressing key challenges that inhibit the development of a cure. The challenges were developed in conjunction with the PAS MS Scient ific Advisory Board and are noted in bold. For more information about the state of MS re search, please see the MS disease report. Spectrum Scientific Contribution Care Continuum Disease Understanding Limited understanding of the causes of the disease is an underlying challenge in MS research, and the Society invests a large portion of its research funding in this area. In addition, the Society's MS Lesion project, recognized by the PAS advisors for its potential, is likely to contribute to better understanding of the dr ivers of disease progression as well as the differences among disease subtypes . Prevention In addition to funding research on risk factors and epidemiology, which will contribute to the development of prevention measures, the Society also is supporting a research grant focusing on the role of vitamin D , an area identified by PAS's scientific advisors as having potential to lead to a prevention tool in the short term. Diagnostics Major challenges to development of diagnostics and disease markers for MS include the lack of tools to monitor disease activities as well as tools to measure disease progress and treatment effectiveness, including neurodegeneration and neuronal repair . In addition to the investigator-initiated grants that focus on this area, the Society's Nervous System Repair and Protection Initiative includes research to develop markers to measure treatment effectiveness, including tools that might contribute to direct observation of myelin . Overview 4 of 50 Spectrum Scientific Contribution Treatment The Society's research strategy calls for funding research across the disease process and its portfolio includes projects focused on neuronal repair and neuroprotection, as we ll as symptomatic treatments, in addition to strategies focused on inflammation . In particular, the Society's Nervous System Repair and Protection Initiative is expected to make great contributions to understanding neuronal repair and developing neuroprotection treatments. Delivery The high cost of treatments and access to specialists is a major issue for MS patients. The Society collects quality of life data through its Sonya Slifka Longitudinal Study to help address this issue. It also implements advocacy and patient support activities. Research Tools Biospecimens and Data The Society has provided support for three biospecimens repositories and ensured compatibility in sample collection. This will help address challenges posed by the small number of samples, limiting the power of analysis, and difficulties caused by differences in collection protocols . Clinical Trials As treatment options have been introduced in MS, placebo-controlled trials have become increasi ngly difficult to conduct . The International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials, convened by the Society, discusses and seeks solutions to issues related to trial design and outcome measures. Animal Models The EAE model, the dominant anim al model in MS research, focuses only on the immunologic aspects of the disease , and therefore is not adequate for research focused on other aspects of the disease. Through its investigator-initiated grant mechanism, the Society has funded grants aiming to validate animal models that allow investigations beyond immunology, such as axon degeneration, Research Training The Society has established several grant mechanisms to address the need for multidisciplinary talent and the need to increase young scientists' interest in a career in MS research , including the Collaborative Center Awards, Pilot Awards, and various career development awards. PHILANTHROPIC OPPORTUNITIES The Society's strategic goals guide its funding priorities through 2010. The following initiatives require the most funding: Discovery/Basic research : The traditional mechanism of the Society's funding for MS research, focusing on investigat or-initiated research in academia. Promise: 2010 : A plan to invest $35 million between 2005 and 2010 in four research areas in MS, which include the patt erns of tissue damage in MS lesions, a longitudinal patient database on quality of life and rehabilitation, development of research and care centers for pediatric patients, and neuroprotection and nervous system regeneration. Fast Forward : An initiative to accelerate deve lopment of treatments for MS by funding industry-based efforts, following a venture capital model. Strategy 5 of 50 NATIONAL MS SOCIETY : STRATEGY OVERVIEW The National MS Society is a national organization with regional chapters that funds research in multiple sclerosis (MS), provides information and support for people affected by the disease, and conducts advoca cy activities for affected pe ople. In 1946, the organization was found by Sylvia Lawry, whose brother had MS. Research has been a focus of th e Society, given that finding a cure is a priority for the MS community. However, because of the nature of MS, which is a chronic disease that causes disability and affects pa tients throughout most of their ad ult lives, advocacy and support for patients and their caregivers also are core areas of in vestment by the Society. The Society is a key player in MS research. With an annual research budget of over $40M for 2009, it provides research funding equivalent to almost half of that provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for MS, Through its research program, the Society aims to accelerate new disco veries for the development of a cure. To support this aim, the Society provides support for pilot studies with new research approaches, research career development of young scientists and physicians , and MS research by scientists from other fields. In addition, it has gr ant programs to increase collaboration among researchers and also funds development of rese arch infrastructure, includin g tissue banks and research databases. ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY MISSION AND FOCUS Established in 1946 as the Association for Advanc ement of Research in Multiple Sclerosis, the National MS Society is a national organizati on with 53 regional ch apters and a national office. The Society's vi sion is \"a world free of multiple sclerosis.\" The organization's Strategic Response for 2007- 2010 defines itself throug h the following goals: Be a driving force of MS research, relentle ssly pursuing preventi on, treatment, and cure; Address the challenges of each pers on whose life is affected by MS; Mobilize the talents and resources of th e millions of people who want to do something about MS; Be activists; Raise a total of $1.25 billion by the end of 2010 to be used in the fight against multiple sclerosis. When the current CEO, Joyce Ne lson, came to the position in 2005, the Society reached out to 25,000 of its members and donors to conduct a survey to guide the strategic direction of the organization. A major outcome of the survey was that while research is a key priority of investment, the Society's stakeholders also wanted it to a ddress the quality of life issues of MS patients and their caregivers, such as in surance coverage, economic and psychological impact, and implications for adolescent caregivers. In addition to the survey, the Society le adership consulted in dividuals and other organizations with a stake in MS to understan d their needs and views on the role of the Society. These included health care professionals and clinicia ns, pharmaceutical companies Strategy 6 of 50 involved in MS, members of the American Academy of Neurology, other nonprofit organizations focused on MS, and the Society's own boards of directors at the national and chapter levels. As a result of this process, th e Society determined that it need ed to take a bolder approach, raising the visibility of the impact of MS, actively mobilizing volunteers and other organizations, driving the resear ch on MS, and providing support for people affected by MS. At the same time, the Society undertook e fforts to create a new brand and a common language and culture across its franchise. Once the strategic response was finalized, the Society put in place cross-functional leadership to oversee each goal. Based on the strategic response, the na tional office and the chapter leaders collaborate to develop annual op erational plans. The activities of both the home office and the chapters are organized and reported alon g these five goals, and the national board of directors an d the head of chapters regularly hold meetings to assess progress against the goals. In addition, the MS community has the opportunity to provide input on the Society's programs and services , for example, through the townhall meeting held at the National Conference. APPROACH AND STRUCTURE The Society's home office coordinates activities across the organization, funds research programs, and conducts advocacy activities at the national level. It also organizes patient support programs, and develops education and advocacy materials for the MS Community, which it defines as people with MS, their family members and employers, and other community organizations (Figure 1). The national office also maintains the Information Resource Center (IRC) and the Professional Resource Cent er (PRC). The IRC is a call center focused on providing information for people with MS and the interest ed public, and it receives about 1,000 calls a day. The call center provides information about the disease, how to cope with it, and how to find support programs in local chapters. It also connects the callers with the appropriate local chapter and resources. The call center holds monthly teleco nferences with each chapter to ensure ongoing exchan ge and information updates. The PRC is an MS library that also serves as an informatio n dissemination center through phone and emails, but targeting healthcare professional s. It received over 6,000 inquiries in 2008. The PRC has a large collection of literature on MS and librarians to assist with literature searches, and it also releases expert opinion papers an d bulletins on standards of care.

Base d on the Society-wide strategic plan, each chapter sets its own strategy taking into account the local ci rcumstances. As back office operations are more consolidated in the national office, the chapters focus more on outreach and community building activities. MS Research Research Funding The Society has been funding medical research on MS since 1947. Research funding is an integral part of its mission, as development of a cure is a key goal for all of the Society's stakeholders. Its funding covers a variety of topics, ranging from epidemiology to nerve repair, treatment development, and quality of life and care management. The Society defines its research strategy as accelerating research by providing funding for new and under researched areas, sharing research reso urces, encouraging cooperation within the MS research community, engaging other organizati ons, and developing new treatment and care by funding research at various stages and topics. The Society's annual research budget is close to 50 percent of what NIH provides for MS. A major goal of its program is building a car eer path for junior researchers in MS and introducing new areas of research to the field. Research Prizes The Society has two prizes for researchers who make outstanding contributions to MS research. The John Dystel Prize for Multiple Sclerosis Research is a joint award by the National MS Society and the Am erican Academy of Neurology. Each year, the prize awards $15,000 to one researcher with an outstanding achievement. The other prize is the Ralph I. Straus Award for Multiple Sclerosis . The award is a one-time award \"to be given to that scientist...whose published research shall have resulted in the development of an effective and specific method of preventing or arresting multiple sclerosis in man.\" The Society estimates that the amount of the prize will be equivalent to or greater than the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Scientific Meetings The Society also sponso rs scientific meetings, Scientific Taskforces and Scientific Workshops . The meetings focus on emerging topics in MS an d identifying areas that need more research. The topics are selected with the advice of the RPAC and other MS researchers. Typically, the Society organizes two Scientific Taskforces per year; 22 were organized between 1997 and 2008, including a meeting that updated the diagnostic criteria for MS. A taskforce involves 12 to 15 researchers and fo cuses on identifying ke y research questions within a specific topic and developing strategies to encourage the scientific community to pursue these questions. The So ciety's scientific staff, with the input of the research community, selects the members of each task force. In addition to taskforces, the Society also organizes Scientific Workshops to discuss broader topics of importance in MS, which engage a br oader group of scientist s in and out of MS research. Usually, workshops are organized every 15 to 18 months, and more than 80 scientists attend the meetin g. Between 1968 and 2008 48 workshops were organized. Workshops may arise from taskforce recommend ations, as was the case for stem cell research, or a taskforce may be organized to prepare for a scientific workshop. The summaries of the meetings are ofte n published in academic journals. Strategy 8 of 50 Clinical Trials In addition to providing funding for selected clinical trials, the Society also convened the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials to address issues related to trial design and outcome measures. The committee includes 15 to 20 members, with approximately half of the members being Americans and the other half internationals. With the development of treatment options that can slow the disease pr ocess, clinical trials became increasingly challenging and expensive, espe cially for placebo-controlled tr ials. In addition, the group also discusses topics such as outcome measures for neuroprotective and neuronal repair treatments, regulatory issues, and follow-on biologics. The Society also seeks to encourage trial enrollment by providing information on clinical trials for MS and trials recruiting participants, along with the reasons for participation and how trials work. The Society's website also feat ures online surveys targ eting MS patients on specific research topics, as well as calls for pa rticipation for selected trials and biospecimen repository initiatives. Support Programs MS is a chronic disease that affects patients and their households throughout their adult lives. Therefore, support programs addressing quality of life are an integral part of the Society's mission. Disease Information for Patients and the Public Information dissemination tools include the Society's IRC, the website, a multimedia library, web-based learning programs, printed brochure s, guidebooks, and its quarterly periodical magazine, Momentum . All content provided by the Societ y is vetted by scien tific advisors. The information content includes information su ch as disease description, risk factors, and treatment options; strategies for management of specific symptoms and lifestyle recommendations; employment and insurance issues, including government programs, legal rights in the workplace, and employment decisions; and upda tes on ongoing research. The Society also provides MS information tailored for children, through the quarterly newsletter Keep S'myelin and parenting materials for MS patients. Community and Support Groups Local chapters organize in-person self-help groups to help patients and their caregivers deal with emotional and social chal lenges. Also, there are groups that address specific needs based on lifecycle, for example, parents with children with MS or patients with young children. In addition to support groups, the chapters also orga nize social events and family programs, such as holiday parties, camps, an d weekend getaways for children and families affected by MS. In addition, since 2001, the Society has been a collaborative partner of MS World, an online community of MS patients. Other sponsors of MS World include Bayer Healthcare, EMD Serono, and Teva Neuroscience. Direct Support The Society's chapters also provide direct su pport to patients and their families. This includes support for housin g modification, care manage ment services, and medical equipments. Often, the chapters partner with other local entities to co-sponsor the assistance program. In additi on, the Society has in place a college scholarship program for Strategy 9 of 50 families affected by MS, to help mitigate th e negative effect of th e disease on household economy. Support for Healthcare Professionals The Society also provides support for healthca re professionals such as clinicians, nurses, and other care facility staff. Major activities include information dissemination through the PRC and professional education opportunities. Through the PRC, the Societ y publishes and disseminates general information on the disease targeted to healthcare professionals, treatment reco mmendations by experts, and information on strategic to pics such as pediatric MS.1 It also provides t oolkits on strategies to discuss sensitive topics with patients and ot her resource material for clinicians, nurses, and administrators at assisted living facilities or at adult day programs. In addition, its MD- on-call program provides free expert consultation for clinicians. The Society also provides multiple educational opportunities to healthcare professionals, including online programs targeting clinicians, nur ses, and other healthca re professionals. It also developed a clinical training program in collaboration with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. In addition to education programs, the Society has offered fellowship programs for advanced training in MS since 2003. The Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care Physician Fellowships Program provides $65,000 to support one year of training for clinicians, and the John Dystel Fellowship in Multiple Sclerosis seeks to develop MS nurse specialists, providing $22,500 for three months or $44,000 for six months. Advocacy The Society's policy advocacy programs focus on topics related to MS research, disability rights, access to healthcare and long-term care, and insura nce. The Society publishes position papers and creates activist toolkits for outreach to elected officials. Subjects related to research include increasing funding focused on MS, enco uraging stem cell research, raising awareness of the increase of MS incidence in areas a ffected by the Gulf War, and legislation introduced in Congress in 2008 for a National MS Disease Re gistry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2 The Federal MS Activism Council, which includ es patients, researchers, and board members, provides input on the Society's national advocacy activities.3 The MS Action Network, with 16,000 volunteers, is an import ant mechanism for advocacy. Th rough the network, tailored e-mail messages are sent to le gislators from their constituents. The Soci ety also organizes an annual Public Policy Conference in Washington, DC, where activists from local chapters visit their legislators to voice their concerns. In addition, the Society is a founding member of the MS Coalition, a group of seven MS organi zations, focusing on advocacy for quality of life of MS patients. Major achievements in advocacy include the cr eation of the Congressi onal MS Caucus in 2007, with 116 congressmen and 20 senators as members, and the designation of MS as a disease eligible to be funded through the De partment of Defense's Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program. Additionally, the Depart ment of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program allocate d $5M for MS research in 2008. 1 The Society currently is focusing on pediatric MS. Because MS is perceived as a disease of young adults, MS in children often is overlooked and goes undiagnosed. In addition, pediatric MS may provide a unique opportunity to study early life triggers of MS. 2 The exact scope of this registry is yet to be determined. 3 The Government Relations Committees, located in each chapter, he lp guide the effort. Strategy 10 of 50 PARTNERSHIPS With the development of the Strategic Respon se, collaboration with other organizations came to be an important lever for the Societ y. The National MS Society has long been a member of the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, which connects MS organizations across the world. The Society's founder, Sy lvia Lawry was a founding member of the Federation, and three of the So ciety's leaders currently serv e on the Foundation's board. The Society has joint initiatives on pediatric MS with the MS Society of Canada, the Italian MS Association, and the MS Society of Argentina. In terms of research ac tivities, the Society collaborates cl osely with NIH to ensure effective use of resources in MS research. NIH and the So ciety often co-fund projects or jointly select projects to fund, in which case the two organi zations coordinate to avoid any overlaps in funding and to maximize the resources available. Examples of such jo int projects include a research project on sex differences in autoimmunity and a clinical trial on estriol based on gender differences. In a ddition to collaborations in resear ch funding, a representative from NIH is present in many of the Society's meet ings, including the gran t review an d scientific workshops. The Society also works with the Department of Veterans Affairs' Multiple Sclerosis Center of Excellence and CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. It participates in the Integration Panel at the Department of Defe nse Research Program, which will define the focus of research funds available for MS from the Department. The Society also assists the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation its peer-review process. The Society also provides inpu t and assistance to other enti ties in organizing scientific meetings on MS. For example, the Society has been providing staff and logistics support to ACTRIMS (Americas Committee on Treatment and Re search in Multiple Sclerosis), including organization of the 2008 scientific meeting, World Congress on Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, , which drew over 5,000 pa rticipants. It also provided inputs to the Keystone Symposia for its meeting on MS, and organized a joint conference with the Multiple Sclerosis Association of Am erica on primary progressive MS. In addition to research, the Society collaborate s with other organization s in its advocacy and patient support activities. Partners in these areas include the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers, the Heuga Center for Multiple Sclerosis, MSFriends, and MS World. It also collaborates with organizations with a focus other than MS su ch as the Parkinson's Action Network, for legislation creating a patient registry for MS and Parkinson's disease. RESEARCH STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH PRIORITIES The Society's research focuses on accelerating research by increasing collaboration and providing support for under researched and prom ising areas that could ultimately lead to a cure. The Society has reviewed its programs every five years. It convenes a task force of leading researchers to assess the state of MS resear ch, including progress made, key barriers, and what the Society can contribute. The task fo rce discusses the outcome with RPAC and other Strategy 11 of 50 advisory committees of the Society as well as other organizations involved in MS and leaders in other disciplines. Based on the review outcome, RPAC recommends whether a specific research topic needs additional support and whether a new award category needs to be instituted. For example, the Harry Weaver Neuroscience Scholar Award was put in place after the 1980 review, to attract more sci entists to MS. The 1990 review led to the introduction of pilot grants to generate prelim inary data and to recruit more talent to MS research. It also led to the gr ant program on healthcare deli very and policy, which enables the generation of basic data to support advoca cy activities. In the 1990s, targeted research programs in genetics and gender differences were launched as a result of these reviews. While the Society's established grant programs a ccept proposals in a wide array of topics in MS treatment development, it also targets fund ing to areas where more research is needed. The Society's scientific meetings , the Task Forces and Workshop s, provide an opportunity to identify these underfunded and under-investiga ted areas. Some topics emerge as ripe for additional investment, and in su ch instances, the Society puts together specific RFPs, either on its own or in collaboration with other organization s such as NIH or academic institutions. Once the topic gets traction in the research co mmunity, it is incorporated into the standard grant program. In terms of overall reviews of the state of MS research, the Society commissioned the Institute of Medicine to conduc t a strategic review of MS research in 2001. The outcome of this review was published as a report of th e National Academy of Sciences. The report recommendations led to the establishment of the Collaborative Center Award and an increased focus on quality of life and rehabilitation, including the introduction of Society- funded investigator-initiated grants for these topics. RESEARCH FOCUS The Society's ultimate go al in funding research is to develop cures for MS. It identifies three types of cures needed by MS patients and organizes its research along these areas: Cure 1 - Stopping MS attacks and disease progression : immunology, therapy development, measurement of di sease activities, infectious agents Cure 2 - Repairing the damage from attacks : glia biology, central nervous system repair, neuropathology, neur ophysiology, therapy development Cure 3 - Preventing onset of the disease : genetics, epidemiology, immunology, virology Beyond the three cures : healthcare delivery and policy, therapy development and symptom management, psychosocial research, rehabili tation research All investigators with grant proposals relevant to the areas outlined above are eligible to apply for the Society's support, and the Soci ety does not favor any specific areas of research. Rather, support for underfunded ar eas that the Society sees as crucial are provided through targeted research programs with a separate RFP. Recent research areas that received funding through an RFP process include MS pathology, genetics, myelin and axonal repair, a longitudinal study of quality of life, and gender differences in MS. Currently, the Society's major research initiatives include the following: Targeted Initiatives: o Promise: 2010 is an initiative to invest $35 million between 2005 and 2010 in four research areas in MS, which includ e the patterns of tissue damage in MS lesions, a longitudinal patient database on quality of life and rehabilitation, Strategy 12 of 50 development of research and care centers for pediatric patients, and neuroprotection and nervous system regeneration. o Fast Forward, initiated in 2007, focuses on accelerating industry-based efforts to develop new MS treatments. Collaborative MS Research Centers: Funding for interdisciplinary teams based in specific MS research centers. High-Risk Pilot Research: Short-term grants to enable investigators to test innovative ideas and bring new investigators to MS research. IMPACT MEASUREMENT The Society assesses the impact of each of its grant programs on a regular basis. The reviews are conducted every year, and the Society also surveys prior grant recipients\u2014every two years for the pilot grants, five years for collaborative center awards and most fellowships, and 10 years for the Harry Weaver Award. The metrics used to measure impact are defi ned based on the goal of individual grant programs. For example, review of pilot aw ards focuses on the program's success in attracting new researchers to MS and enabling researchers to secure follow-on funding on the research topic. For postdoct oral fellowships, the review focuses on whether the fellows continued a career in MS research and whethe r they have been successful in securing research funding afterward. In a 2008 survey of 522 past fellowship re cipients, out of whom 300 were reachable and responsive, about 60 perc ent of the recipients were continuing to pursue research in MS. About Fast Forward Fast Forward is a new initiative of the Society focused on accelerating drug development for MS. While the Society has focused on funding research in academia, it realized that results from academic research are not automatically transferred to the pharmaceutical industry for comme rcialization. As a result, the Society has set up Fast Forward, which provides funding for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with projects in MS, in addition to its ongoing support for academic research. Fast Forward operates as a ventur e capital model. Once a potential investment target is identified, the potential investee company submits a 10-page application. Six members of Fast Forward's science and business advisory committee (SBAC) review the application and determine whether it should move into the more detailed due diligence process. For the formal due diligence, the company is asked to provide detailed information on its tec hnology, clinical trial protocol, relevant publications, and intellec tual property (IP) arrangements. After reviewing the material, SBAC conducts a conference call with the company, discusses the application within the committee, and votes on whether Fast Forward should pursue the investment. If two thirds or more of the reviewers support the opportunity, Fast Forward and the company discuss what would be the appropriate funding vehicle and milestones. Once this process is complete, the investment thesis is presented to the Board of Managers of Fast Forward, who makes the ultimate decision on whether to invest in the project. Fast Forward announced its first deal in December 2008, awarding $1M to Apitope International fo r a proof-of-concept trial of a therapeutic vaccine. Fast Forward aims to raise $30M by 2012 to invest in industry-initiated projects. Initial seed funding is provided by the Society, but additional funding will be secured through fundraising efforts specifically targeting Fast Forward. One recent milestone is the collaboration with EMD Serono, announced in March 2009. According to the agreement, EMD Serono will provide up to $19M in support for early clinical research in early biotechnology companies and academia. Strategy 13 of 50 KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Society has been an integr al part of MS research during the past 60 years, and it considers setting the direction of MS research as a crucial aspect of its role. The Society identifies the following as major research achievements: Funding research that resulted in the six disease-modifying drugs approved by FDA and research that contributed to th e development of the current therapeutic pipeline; Funding research and organizing meetings that led to a new diagnostic criteria for MS and a standard for clinical trials design in MS; Supporting research on mye lin and axonal repair, whic h demonstrated that both myelin and axonal repair are required to reverse the damage in the central nervous system; Supporting research that successfully le veraged human stem cells to induce myelination in mice; Funding the first clinical trials that demonstrated the benefits of aerobic exercise in MS; Funding research that led to the recognit ion of cognition, de pression, and fatigue as major symptoms of MS and sponsoring rehabilitation trials to address them; Supporting research on sex differences in MS and sex hormone therapies; and Creating and supporting a consortium on MS genetics resear ch, generating the first genome profile for the disease. Rese arch results from the project led to the identification of new gene targets for treatment and understanding of the cause of the disease. RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK In 2003, the Society provided $220, 000 in funding for the creation of the Multiple Sclerosis Cooperative Research Group (MS- CORE). MS-CORE is a clinical trial cooperative with 80 trial sites across North America, to facilitate drug development efforts by small pharmaceutical companies or academic institutions. Though MS-CORE is yet to be widely used, the Society expects the network to become more instru mental in treatment development as Fast Forward and Promise: 2010 generate the need for trials beyond those conducted by the large pharmaceutical companies. TISSUE BANKS The Society supports the develo pment of tissue banks for rese arch purposes. For example, along with the National Institut e of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Department of Veterans Affairs' Research & Development Service, the Society sponsors the Human Brai n and Spinal Fluid Resource Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, which was established in 1961. Within the Center, the Society specifically supports the MS Human Neurospecimen Bank, which collects specimens of brains, spinal cords, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The most recent funding from the Society was $2.6M for 2004-2009. As of 2008, the bank's specimens led to 893 scientific articles cumulatively. Another tissue bank supported by the Society is the Rocky Mountain MS Center Brain & Tissue Bank in Colorado. Established in 1976, the Center has pledges from 1,100 MS Strategy 14 of 50 patients to donate their brai n tissues and has dist ributed samples to 180 investigators to date. The Society's most recent grant to th is tissue bank was made in 2004, a five-year grant amounting to $806,000. In addition, the Society has supported th e development of another tissue bank, the University of Illinois at Chicago MS Tissue Repository, through a grant of $426,000 awarded in 2007. These tissue banks collaborate to ensure the compatibility of the tissues. When the tissue bank in Chicago applied for its grant, the Society's peer review committee specifically required the investigator to collaborate with existing banks and le arn their practices. DNA DATA The Society supports the genetic data repository of the MS Gen etics Group at the University of California, San Francisco. As part of a multi-center study to understand genetic susceptibility to MS, the repository collects DNA data of MS patients and their family members not affected by MS. As of spring 2008, the effort collected biological specimens from 3,211 MS patients and their clinical da ta, as well as additional samples from the patients' family members when available, in a ddition to unrelated cont rols. The genetic data was instrumental in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium's genome-wide screening for MS risk genes. In addition to ma jor collaboration efforts, DNA data also is accessed by individual researchers. In 2002-2008, 26 laboratories used the data for their research. CLINICAL TRIALS AND REHABILITATION DATA In addition to biological data, the Society wa s involved in the estab lishment of the patient database at the Sylvia Lawry Center for MS Research in Munich, Germany. The database includes clinical and imaging data from more than 20,000 patients who received placebo in major clinical trials. Access to data is available for researchers and clinicians. The Sonya Slifka Longitudinal Study, launched in 2000, is a targeted project launched by the Society. It is an observational study tr acking over 4,500 MS patients through phone interviews. The study focuses on quality of life, rehabilitation, symptomatic therapies, employment and healthcare delive ry. The first cohort of the st udy, including 2,000 patients, has been followed up for eight years so fa r, and a new cohort was added in 2006. The resulting data is used for advocacy and pr ogram development in th e Society by enabling identification of problems faced by people with MS and also is made available to researchers. RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT SELECTION The Society's grant selection in terval varies depending on the grant type. The Society's Research Grants, which account for the majority of its grants, are issu ed twice a year, while the Contracts in MS Health Care Delivery and Policy Research, Collaborative MS Research Center Awards, as well as fellowships and tr aining awards are issued once a year. In addition, pilot grants are issued on a rolling basis. The selection proc ess takes five to six months for Research Grants, and two to three mo nths for pilot grants. Pilot research grants are disbursed immediately after of ficial notice . Most other grants take another two to three months until actual disbursement. Strategy 15 of 50 Figure 2 outlines the So ciety's grant selection process. Prior to grant application, the potential applicants are encouraged to consult with the Society to determine the funding program that best fits the content of the proposal and the applicant's career stage. The applications are accepted through an online grant application system. The length of the proposals varies, ranging from 2 pages for a pilot grant to 6 pages for a Collaborative MS Research Center Award to 35 pages for a typical research grant. For each proposal, two reviewers are assigned, and a critique of 2-3 pages is prepared to be shared with the applicant. The applications recommended by the initial reviewers and those for whic h the two reviewers had dive rging opinions are discussed during the respective advisory committee meetin g, which is the next stage of the selection process. The meeting occurs in person, where each grant is discussed and scored. In the process, the committee may restructure a standard grant application into a pilot if that is appropriate, or request discussions with the applicants if necessary. Major criteria for grant selection are summarized as the following: Scientific merit Relevance to MS Track record of grantee as a scientist (whether in MS or outside of MS) During the whole process, avoiding conflicts of interest and guaranteeing reviewer anonymity and confidentiality are consider ed crucial. In addition, the Society also collaborat es with NIH to ensure the two funders do not i ssue overlapping grants. Once all applications are scored, the peer-review committee arrives at a recommended cutoff score for funding. The RPAC ov ersees the whole process and ensures that there is no wide discrepancy among different committees ' decisions. The RPAC may recommend including or excluding some of the grants if it disagrees with the peer review decision. For pilot grants and targeted areas with a se parate RFP process, the process is slightly different. Because pilot grants are issued on a rolling basis, the review is conducted by two or more ad-hoc reviewers, rather than a committee. The reviewers are selected by the Society staff from a pool of re viewers committed to the program. Peer Review Committees Every year, the Society organizes a total of nine grant review committees. Three committees are organized for each Research Grant review, held semi-annually, and committees also are organized once a year for fellowships and training grants, Collaborative MS Center Research Awards, and the Contracts in MS Health Care Delivery and Policy Research. The review committee members serve for three years, with the possibility to serve additional terms, and rotate across different committees during their tenure. The Society aims to balance different expertise in each committee. Ad hoc members or outside reviewers may be invited if additional expertise is required. The Society staff requests recommendations for reviewers throughout its routine interactions with scientists. In addition to expertise and recommendations received from the scientific community, reviewers need to have secure research funding. The Society also considers the balance of home institutions, diversity, and geography in its selection of reviewers. In addition, a representative of NINDS is present at each grant review committee. Description Preliminary conver sation Ap plicatio n Initial review Committee review Finalization and noticePotential applicants cons ult with S ociety s taf f on topic and grant mechanism Applications ar e received online. A typical r esearch grant application is 35-pages long. Two reviewers are as signed t o each grant to conduct i nitial r eview and provide comments.

Strategy 16 of 50 For research areas with a separa te RFP, scientists with intent to submit an application are invited to a conference call to discuss the aims of the project. Once the applications are submitted, a special panel with appropriate expertise is conv ened to discuss each proposal, with more conversation with investigators if necessary. The Society al so may negotiate with the applicants to improve the pr oposal and review milestones. PROJECT STRUCTURE The Society has 11 different types of grant me chanisms in place to fund research in MS, which are described in Table 1.

Various Multiple years Source: National MS Society, FasterCures Strategy 18 of 50 MANAGEMENT OF RESEARCH RESULTS Each grantee is required to provide a financia l report and progress report every year, and a final financial report and progress report at the end of the award du ration. Awardees are expected to include an acknowledgement of the Society's support in publications resulting from the award and also are required to prov ide the Society with all published reports and preprints as part of the progress reports, as well as to discl ose any inventions. Beyond the initial year, funding for subsequent years is subject to receipt and approval of annual progress reports. Failure to comply with the annual reporting requirement results in cancellation of funding after a on e- to three-month grace period. Upon receipt of annual reportin g, the Society's scientific sta ff reviews the progress against the goals set in the original application an d makes sure that the grant funds are used appropriately. For certain projec ts such as clinical trials, ge netic studies, or healthcare delivery contracts, funding may be terminated if progress against milestones is not demonstrated. While research gr ants have more flexibility due to the nature of basic research, projects without adequate progress also can be terminated. Once the award is completed, awardees are as ked to provide the Society with information on publications and subsequent funding propos als on the topic. In addition, the Society conducts surveys of past grant recipients to understand the impact of its funding in the longer term. KEY RESEARCH POLICIES The Society's policy on IP rights defers the rights to the grantee organization, unless the grantee organization does not ha ve appropriate policies in place. The grantee institution has the obligation to report the emergence of any IP rights and actions taken on them to the Society. The grantee institution also has the obligation to pursue commercialization of the IP and share the income derived from it with th e Society. However, th e Society usually does not pursue commercialization beyond the efforts made by the grantee institution. Still, the Society received some royalty income from commercialization by grantee institutions. Major datasets derived from funding from the So ciety are required to be made available to the public domain. For example, the data from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium are made available to researchers on the Internet, subjec t to an application process. The recipients of the training awards are requ ired to attend the Tykeson Conference on MS for NMSS Fellows and Faculty Awardees, first or ganized in 2008. The conference, to be held every 18 months, aims to increase knowledge sharing and to build a community of MS investigators. Research 19 of 50 NATIONAL MS SOCIETY : RESEARCH PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW This section depicts the Nation al MS Society's grants as of October 2008. This analysis focuses only on the new grants that were issued during the pa st four years, including multi- year commitments. The report an alyzes the Society's active co mmitments issued during this period in terms of aggregate number and am ount, size, duration, type, and receiving institutions.4 On average, the Society's active commitments, including all grant types listed in Table 1 of the Strategy Section, have dura tions of 2.9 years and funding of $384,000 (the average for Research Grant category was $485,000). Approximately 90 percent of the Society's active commitments issued du ring the past four years focus on research.5 This also includes fellowships an d career development grants that require proposals, which amount to about 10 pe rcent of the total analyzed, as well as pilot grants that aim to test new ideas or generate data for further support, which amounted to 3 percent of the total analyzed. Research projects on etiology and treatment account for most of the portfolio, and translational research am ounts to 60 percent of the research portfolio in terms of stage of research. OVERALL PORTFOLIO FUNDS AWARDED ANNUALLY Figure 3 illustrates the number and amount of new grants that the Society committed each year for the past four fiscal years. For multi-ye ar grants, the full amount is accounted for in the year in which the commitment was made. Figure 3: Annual commitment size and number, 2005-2008.

The level of new commitments has been relatively stable, issuing about 159 grants amounting to $43M per year on average. In 2005, the average and median grant size was higher than other years because more Research Grants and fewer Pilot Awards we re issued. In 2006, a one-time award on neuronal repair, the Translational Research Partnerships on Nervous System Repair and Protection in MS, was issued. The program incl udes four grants that amounted to $16M for five years, which contributed to the relatively high average grant size. The number of grants issued was especially high in 2007 because more pilot grants were issued that year. GRANTS BY TYPE Figure 4 illustrates the distributi on of the Society's active gran ts by type: research, training, tools/resources, and policy/delivery. This analysis includes all active commitments made in 2005-2008. Multi-year commitments are al so included for their full amounts.6 Research grants refer to funding provided to su pport a specific research project and include, but are not limited to, grants issued under th e Society's Research Gr ant category. Training grants refer to funding that supports the training of individuals to build skills and expertise in a specific field, typically at the postdoctoral level, but without an individual research component. Grants that focus on providing career development opportunities to young scientists that require a specific research proposal are classified as research in this analysis. Tools/resources grants refer to funding provid ed to develop infrastructure required to conduct research, such as an imal models, tissue banks, or equipment. Grants for policy/delivery include funding for health services research and policy studies. Figure 4: Distribution of active grants by type, 2008. Source: National MS Society. Most of the Society's grants are for research . Many of the Society's research fellowships require a research proposal, and hence are catego rized as research here, as well as the Pilot 6 Note that Figure 4 excludes five active grants amou nting to $2M, as their summaries could not be located for analysis.

Grants that are categorized as focused on training are grants that provide clinicians with the opportunity to build skills in clinical trials and those that fund mentors to develop postdoctoral fellows in rehabilitation research. Grants for tools and resources support DNA banks, tissue reposi tories, and CSF repositories. Policy/delivery projects addre ss various topics such as fina ncial costs of MS, the Sonya Slifka study, development of indicators for quality of life, effect of mobility aids, evaluation of rehabilitation services, long-term care needs in MS, and cost effectiveness of MS treatments. The Society's own classifi cation of grants provides additi onal information (Figure 5). Among active grants issued since fisca l year 2005, grants and fellowships aiming to a ssist scientists in building a career path in MS and relevant s kills amount to 71 grants, or 12 percent of the active commitments, with multi-year commitmen ts accounted for the full amount. In terms of stage of career, grants for postdoctoral fello ws or equivalents amount to 59 grants or 7 percent of the portfolio analyzed. Grants specifically aiming to support young investigators, such as those transitioning from fellowship to a faculty position or junior faculty account for 12 grants amounting to 5 percent of the portfolio analyzed.

RESEARCH FOCUS GRANTS BY RESEARCH TYPE Figure 6 further categorizes th e active research grants issu ed in 2005-2008 into subtypes, based on the type of research: etiology, preven tion, diagnosis, treatment, and other. Grants included in Figure 6 are the gr ants categorized as being focuse d on research on Figure 4, but excluding pilot awards, which amount to 3 pe rcent of the portfolio, as their composition changes on ongoing basis as new grants are issued. Note that the total of all grants categorized as research on Figure 4 amounted to 331 grants for $123M, with the full amount of multi-year commitmen ts included, and Pilot Awards, amounted to 87 grants for $4M. Therefore, the total for Figure 6 amounts to 244 grants for $119M.

Preven tion focuses on developing stra tegies to reduce the onset of the disease. While some research on risk factors and epidemiology may have implications to prevention, those types of research are classi fied as etiology unless there is a specific approach in place for the development of a prev ention strategy. Develo ping diagnostic tools and criteria is another area of research, especially important if the disease is diagnosed only based on clinical manifestation and if dise ase progression cannot be clearly measured. Treatment research aims at stabilization of the disease progression or restoration of health. Figure 6: Type of research for active research grants, 2008. Source: National MS Society. Projects on disease etiology amount to 47 percent of the total analyzed, followed by treatment research, which account for 43 percent of the total. However, in terms of number of grants, projects on etiology account for 57 percent of the total, compared to 35 percent for treatment, as grants for etiology tend to be smaller than those for treatment research. Multi-type grants refer to research projects that encompass multiple types of research. In the Society's portfolio, grants that cover mult iple types of research are the Collaborative Center Awards and the MS Lesion Project, which is part of Promise: 2010 . All eight multi- type projects focus on etiology and treatment. The Society also has a grant focused on developi ng a specific prevention strategy, by better understanding the role of vitamin D in disease regulation. In addition, the Society has additional projects that will have implications for prevention, such as those that focus on epidemiology or genetics, classified as part of etiology here. Within the portfolio analyzed, the Society had two epidemiology projects an d nine genetics projects, which amounted to $99,000 and $5.8 million respectively, which am ount to a total of six percent of the research grants. GRANTS BY RESEARCH STAGE Figure 7 further categorizes the research grants by stage of re search: basic, translational, clinical, and other.

Basic research aims at deep ening the knowledge about the disease, without specific application of the resulting knowledge in mind. Much of the etiological research is considered basic research. Translational research is focused on outcomes, and seeks to fill the gap between current knowledge and a specific goal, such as developi ng a compound for treatment. It refers to a stage of research where the find ings are yet to be applied to humans, but often uses animal models. Clinical studies generally refer to the study of a drug, biologic, or device in human subjects with the intent to discover potential beneficial effects and/or determin e safety and efficacy. They also refer to studies of human populations (e.g., epidemiology, behavior, observation). In diagnosis or treatment resear ch, clinical studies refer to clinical trials of specific intervention strategies. Figure 7: Stage of research for active research grants, 2008. Source: National MS Society. Translational research projects amount to over 50 percent of the Society's research grants, followed by basic research and clinical research . Within translational research, 62 percent is treatment research and 35 perc ent is etiology research. Th e Society's basic research portfolio, which accounts for 28 percent of the total research portfolio, is dominated by etiology research. In the clinical portfolio, about 60 percent are efforts to develop a treatment for MS. The MS Lesion Project and seven Collaborative Center Awards address multiple stages of research. Among the Collaborative Center Awar ds, three encompass basic and translational research, two translational and clinical resear ch, and the other two all stages of research. The topics addressed by these grants include immunologic subjects such as leveraging T- cells to stop MS attacks, de veloping therapeutic vaccines and immunomodulatory agents, and developing therapies targeting specific components of an MS attack; as well as subjects in central nervous system repair such as char acterizing nerve fiber damage and developing neuroprotective therapies, understanding the progressive disability in MS, and 0153045607590 Basic Translational Clinical Multi-stage OtherUSD 16% 6% of research grant total Research 24 of 50 characterizing cells involved in myelin and tissue repair.

Pilot Awards include seed-funding grants that seek to test new ideas and generate very preliminary data as well as grants that seek to build more substantial data from existi ng preliminary evidence to eventually qualify for a larger grant. The share of seed funding in the Society's Pilot Award portfolio varies depending on years and de finition, ranging from 10 percent to 70 percent. There are 75 grants ranging $100,000-$249,0 00. Among them, 55 are fellowships for clinical training and postdoctoral fellowshi ps, and 20 are Research Grants targeting established investigators. Grants of $100,000-$249,000 account for only 11 percent of those issued through the Research Grants mechanism, targeting 20 established investigators. Out of the 177 active grants issued as Research Grants, 94 are in the $250,000-$499,000 range and 62 are more than $500,000. 7 Extramural R01 grants.

Among these, ten grants were greater than $1M, including four grants for the Repair Partnership, one Health Care Delivery Contract aiming to build a nationwide MS patien t registry, and Research Grants for a clinical trial of sex hormones, genetic studies, a stud y on MS lesions, and a project to build a biospecimens repository. GRANTS BY DURATION Figure 9 illustrates the distributi on by duration of the Society's active grants issued in fiscal years 2005-2008. The total number of grants includ ed in this analysis is 358, amounting to $138M. The average duration of NIH's extramur al research grants was 3.7 years in 2007, and the median was 4 years. Figure 9: Distribution of active grants by duration, 2008. Source: National MS Society. About half of the Society's grants included in this analysis have durations of three years. Among the grants with three-year durations, 70 percent are research grants for established investigators and 22 percent are postdoctoral fell owships. Most of the grants with durations of one year or less are pilot grants, accounting for two-thirds of all pilot grants. Most of the remaining pilot grants have durations of two years, although some have even longer durations. The Society's pilot grants include pr ojects that aim to generate very preliminary data as well as those that already have so me data but aim to accumulate more before applying for standard grants. About 10 percent of its pilot grants are without any preliminary data, providing a te sting ground for new ideas. Grants with durations of five years or mo re consist of large grants, including the Collaborative Center Awards, the Repair Part nership, Career Transition Fellowship, the Junior Faculty Award, and the Health Care Delivery Contract. 020406080100 1 yr or less 2 yrs 3 yrs 4 yrs 5+ yrsUSD Million s 04080120160200 Numbe r Total amount NumberPortfolio average : 2.9 years Portfolio median : 3 years Research 26 of 50 RECIPIENTS RECIPIENT TYPE Figure 10 illustrates the composit ion of the Society's grants in terms of recipient type. This analysis includes all active gr ants that the Society issued between 2005 and 2008, including the full amount of multi-year commitments. Gr ants are categorized as individual grants provided to a single investigator, team grants within a single institution, and team grants for multiple institutions. This analysis ai ms to understand the extent to which the organization issues grants that require collaboration. Figure 10: Distribution of ac tive grants by duration, 2008. Source: National MS Society. The Society's portfolio primarily is composed of grants for individual researchers, with 21 percent of the portfolio, or 16 projects, being grants that explicitly require collaboration. These grants include the Collaborative MS Rese arch Center Awards, the very type of grant mechanism the Society created to foster collabo ration in MS research, as well as the MS Lesion Project and the Nervous System Repair and Protection Initiative, both part of the Promise 2010 initiative. Among these 16 awards, eight involve collaboration within a single institution, while the other eight involve collaboration across multiple institutions. TOP RECIPIENTS Table 2 shows the organizations to which the Society pledged the most funding during the past four fiscal years. Total commitments made by the Society during this period amount to 635 grants, for $172M, as shown in Figure3.

The largest grant was made to the Johns Hopkins Hospital as part of the Repair Partnership Initiative, which amounted to $4.8M. Although the top recipient inst itutions are all based in the United States, the Society's research funding is not restricted to domestic institutions. During the past four years, the Society has issued 41 grants to institutions overseas, including Australia, Canada, Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Management 28 of 50 NATIONAL MS SOCIETY : MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW The Board of Directors is the ul timate decision-making body of the Society. Because of its structure as an organization wi th multiple chapters, the Societ y has mechanisms in place to make sure that the activities of the national office and the chapters are aligned and that the chapters' perspectives ar e reflected in the national office's operations. In addition to the Board of Directors, the Soci ety has multiple bodies that provide advice on its activities, including the NCAB and the RPAC . In addition, Fast Fo rward, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has its own Board of Managers and Science and Business Advisory Board (SBAC). The Society's Board of Directors, RPAC, and its leadership bring connections from other organizations that the Society is able to leve rage. Such connections are focused in nonprofit and clinical research institutions and nonp rofit research funders and advocacy groups. The Society makes its annual report and financials available online. It also provides a list of its current grants and newly issued grants. MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE MANAGEMENT STAFF The Society has a staff of 1, 400 employees, out of which 2 00 work in the home office, including over 40 employees in the Informationa l Resource Center. The Society's leadership includes the following: Joyce Nelson : President and Chief Executive Officer Duane Brown : General Counsel Julie Butcher : Executive Vice President, Information Technology David Chatel : Executive Vice Presiden t, Advocacy Programs Lisa Goldfarb : Executive Vice President, Human Resources Nancy Law : Executive Vice President, Programs and Services Graham McReynolds : Executive Vice President, Marketing and Development Mary Milgrom : Executive Vice President, Strategic Philanthropy John Richert : Executive Vice President, Re search and Clinical Programs Lisa Risi : Chief Financial Officer Paul Weiss : Chief Operating Officer Cyndi Zagieboylo : Executive Vice President, Field Operations The Society's CEO reports the So ciety's activities to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The update is organized around the five areas of focu s from the strategic response. Each staff member is evaluated annually based on individualized objectives tied back to the strategic goals, core competencies , and professional development. Many leaders of the Society have worked for the Society for more than a decade or have backgrounds in nonprofit management. The Soci ety also has scientifi c expertise in-house. The head of Research and Clinical Programs is a research clinician in MS, and other staff members in the research operatio n have scientifi c backgrounds. Management 29 of 50 The Society has more than 20 full-time staff for its research operations. A sizeable number of professional staff is requir ed as the Society's staff review s the annual progress reports for each grant, organizes scientific meetings, and is involved in communication with donors, chapters, and public officials. LOCAL CHAPTERS The Society's 53 chapters have their own boar ds and conduct their ow n programs to meet the needs of the constituents in their area. The chapters share a common set of bylaws and undergo an annual certification process to en sure that chapters m eet minimum standards established by the Society for their govern ance, resource development, programs, and financial management. Chapters are required to contribute a set percentage of funds raised to the home office for research funding purpos es, and they often contribute more than what is required to fund additional research grants and targeted programs such as Promise: 2010 . The chapters also provide input to the national office, through a quarterly call in which the chapter chairs participate. In addition, the home office organizes opportunities for cross- chapter networking and sharing best practices. BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Society's National Board of Directors sets the strategic dire ction of the organization. The board meets four times a year to have stra tegic discussions about new initiatives, the Society's role in coalitions, and policy, such as the Society's position on embryonic stem cell research or its National Health Care Reform Principles. The Board also reviews the Society's progress against its strategy. The Society's board is composed of 35 director s with one-year terms and the potential to serve for nine consecutive years. The nomina ting committee, composed of three or four board members and two or three chapter chai rs, selects the board candidates, and the Delegate Assembly, composed of representative s from each chapter and all members of the National Board of Directors, elec ts the directors through votes. The Society constructs its board so that a majo rity of the board members (51 percent) also serve as local chapter trustees. While thes e members are expected to provide chapter perspectives, they do not represent individu al chapters. The Society aims to create a balanced board in terms of demographics and expe rience. It also seeks to ensure that most board members have a personal connection to MS. Board members often come from business backgrounds and have been leaders in their fields. Some also have backgrounds in policy advocacy and healthcare re gulations, as well as expertise in social work and assisted living facilities. During the first board meeting of each year, the Society leadership conducts a new board orientation. Each new member is assigned to an existing board member who serves as a mentor. Multiple committees within the board help the Society conduct its mission. These include committees on finance, chapter relations, an d governance. Additional committees focusing on management include the audit and investment committees. The governance committee reviews the board's nominating proce ss and its policies. It also assesses the performance of the overall board and individual board members based on the Management 30 of 50 fundraising requirement, active participation in board meetings, and committee activities. In addition, board members are asked to su bmit an assessment of each meeting. In addition to regular board meetings, the Executive Committee meets as needed for the Society's operation. The Executive Commi ttee comprises the following directors: Ron Boire : Toys Us Carol M . Houghtby : Securico, Inc. Weyman T . Johnson, Jr : Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP; Chairman Craig T . Lynch : Parker, Poe, Adams & Ber nstein LLP; Secretary Linda J . McAleer . Mengel : Mengel, Metzger, Barr & Co LLP; Treasurer Joyce Nelson : President and CEO of National MS Society Kevin O'Sullivan : MIRATECH Corporation Eli Rubenstein: Goulston Storrs In addition to its board, the Society also has 15 honorary lif e directors and seven National Advisory Council members who provide addition al input and contribu te resources to the Society. RESEARCH PROGRAMS ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RPAC) RPAC sets the general directio n of research funding at the Society. The committee oversees all research initiatives, provides input on topi cs for scientific meetings, serves as advisors on research policy, oversees the gr ant review process, and provid es input. RPAC must approve all special initiatives of the Society. It meets twice a year, following the grant review meetings. RPAC is comprised of senior sci entists who are leaders in MS research. The Society aims to create an RPAC reflecting major areas of scientific expertise in MS as well as major institutions involved in MS research, such as NIH or the Department of Veterans Affairs. RPAC members serve for a term of three years, with the possibility to serve another term. Current RPAC members include the following: Etty (Tika) Benveniste, Ph.D. : University of Alabama at Birmingham Anne H. Cross, M.D. : Washington Universi ty at St. Louis Marie Filbin, Ph.D. : Hunter College Gary M. Franklin, M.D. : University of Washington William Hickey, M.D. : Dartmouth Medical School Weyman T.

Slifka : Global Petroleum Corporation Stephen G. Waxman, M.D., Ph.D. : Yale University Howard L. Weiner, M.D. : Brigham and Women's Hospital NATIONAL CLINICAL ADVISORY BOARD (NCAB) NCAB provides advice on educational and clinical programs at the Society. It also identifies areas where information on MS is not sufficie nt and produces expert opinion papers to address the void. The board comprises over 80 members who serve as clinical speakers for the Society and experts on the MD-on- call program on a weekly basis. NCAB members must have a na tional reputation as MS clinicians. The nominating committee selects new members, who serve a th ree-year term, without renewal limitation. The Executive Committee of the NCAB meets once a year as well as through conference calls several times a year to review specific ma terial or discuss specific topics. In addition, there are 10 subcommittees to provide advice on specific areas, such as various aspects of care, education for the public and healthcare pr ofessionals, and specif ic patient groups. The subcommittees also meet once a year through conference calls. MANAGEMENT OF FAST FORWARD MANAGEMENT TEAM Fast Forward, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Society, draws its management team from the Society. The Society's pres ident and CEO serves at Fast Forward in the same capacity, and the executive director, Timo thy Coetzee, Ph.D., has a back ground in MS research and molecular biology and was part of the Society's research progra m staff prior to assuming his current role. Fast Forward contra cts fundraising, marketing, and operations with the Society. In addition, Fast Forward has an external co nsultant serving as a portfolio advisor. BOARD OF MANAGERS Fast Forward's Board of Managers has 13 me mbers. Nine members also serve on the Society's national Board of Direct ors to ensure that Fast Forward is a controlled entity of the Society. The remaining four members are indivi duals with financial expertise. The Board of Managers includes people with MS, physicia ns, and individu als with business backgrounds such as consulting and risk management. The board review s the investment thesis and makes the final decisions on Fast Forward's funding. SCIENTIFIC AND BUSINESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE (SBAC) SBAC is the reviewing body for Fast Forward's funding to industry players. It assesses the investment opportunities presented to Fast Forward and makes recommendations to the Board of Managers. Half of the committee memb ers have scientific expertise and the other half have business backgrounds. Management 32 of 50 TRANSPARENCY The Society posts its annual report, IRS tax form s, and financial statem ents of the national office and consolidated financial statements on its website. It also provides a list of its active grants and new grants on its website. MANAGEMENT NETWORK This section seeks to identify the informal network that the National MS Society's leadership has with other organizations that could be leveraged in advancing the Society's research mission, in addition to existing collaborative relations described in the Strategy section. The analysis focuses on for-profit organizations in the medical industry, nonprofit and clinical research institutions\u2014including academic medical centers and research laboratories\u2014government and multilateral research entities, nonprofit research funders across various diseases and advocacy groups focusing on MS, and organizations that provide research infrastructure. In this analysis, a connection is defined as when a member of the staff leadership, National Board of Directors, or RPAC also holds leadership positions, such as board membership or mana gement leadership, at organizations that are in the categories of interest. 8 The organization's network is focused on nonprofit and clinical research institutions, primarily due to members of RP AC and the Board of Directors, who often have leadership positions at clinical or academic institutions (Figure 11). These connec tions include domestic and international research centers. The or ganization's leadership also connects the organization with other nonprofits focusing on MS or medical research in other diseases, as well as a research infrastructure provider. The Society has proactively developed connections with organizations focusing on MS by ensuring their pres ence on its board and vice versa. MSAC also provides links to the De partment of Veterans Affairs and NIH. Table 3 summarizes major institutions to which the Society is connected. In addition, the Society leadership is conne cted to various businesses, for example, Microsoft. The Society is one of the beneficiaries of Microsoft's i'm Initiative , which donates part of its advertisement revenue to nine no nprofit organizations ac ross the world based on user's designation and traffic. For 2007, the initiative contributed $100,000 to the Society. 8 The connections were identified using the biographies provided by the Society. We focus on leadership position as this would indicate the potential to mobilize the connected organization. Figure 11: Management network of National MS Society's leadership.

Financials 34 of 50 NATIONAL MS SOCIETY : FINANCIALS OVERVIEW This section focuses on the financial aspects of the National MS Society as a consolidated entity, including its chapters . The Society's annual budget is close to $250M and its asset base is $180M. Research activities account for 21 percent of the Society's total expenses, out of which 18 percent is for research grants, 34 percent for service to people affected by MS, and 22 percent for administ rative and fundraising costs. In 2005-2006, the Society reviewed its strategy and has refocused its activities around five major goals. Since then, it has seen a period of financial expansion, and its investment in research has increased both in terms of abso lute amount and share of program expenses. Special events have been the traditional source of fundraising and still are the most important fundraising mechanism for the Society. At the same time, the organization is diversifying its fundraising activities to include major donor cultivation, direct marketing, and corporate sponsorship. While the Society has a broad mission, donors have the option to direct their giving to a specific area of interest or specific type of expense, in which case the full amount is allocated to the designated program. FINANCIALS HISTORICAL TRENDS As an organization over 60 years old, the National MS Society is a large organization with annual revenue and expenses approaching $250M. During 2004-2007, the Society's revenue and expenses have grown at 9 percent and 10 percent compound annual growth rates, respectively. During the same period, assets grew by 6 percent per annum (Figure 12). Biomedical research grants, including research and training, amount to over $40M and have been growing at a compound annual growth rate of fourteen percent during 2004-2007. This growth rate is higher than that of total expenses, which explains the slight growth in the share of grants out of total expenses, from 17 to 18 percent (Figure 13). While research has always been part of the Society's mission, several large research initiatives were Figure 12: Financial activity, 2004-2007. Source: National MS Society.

As a result, large research commitments were put in place, wh ich is reflected in the growth of grant disbursement. Examples of large commitments initiated during this period include the Rehabilitation Research Fellowship, the Tran slational Research Partnerships on Nervous System Repair and Protection in MS, and a large-scale genome screening project. REVENUE AND EXPENSES The overall composition of the Society's revenue has been fa irly constant, with over 90 percent of revenue being genera ted from public support. Othe r sources of income include income from assets and government support for joint research programs (Figure 14). Within public support, special events are th e largest source of income, accounting for 62 percent of total revenue. These events, Bi ke MS and Walk MS, are organized by the Society's chapters across the country, and have enjoyed a growth of 10 percent per year over the last three years. Close to 80 percent of the Society's expenses are attributed to programs and services. Operational expenses and fundraising costs acco unt for 7 and 15 percent of total expenses respectively. The respective shares of thes e two expense categories have been fairly constant over the past four years, and with in the Society's guideline to maintain these combined expenses to less than 25 pe rcent of total expenses (Figure 15). Within programs and services, client and comm unity services\u2014which in clude programs that target the population affected by MS\u2014account for the largest share of the total, reflecting the fact that the Society has a broad mission. Th is also includes the costs associated with the Society's Information Resource Center. 2007 Total Expenses=$240M 78%7%15% Programs & Services Operating & Admin Fundraising Figure 14: Revenue composition, 2007.

This includes research grants and fellowships, conferences, and any contract or costs associated with the research operation. Research and research fellowships have been the fastest growing program area during the past four years, with a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent. Professional education and training includes programs that target medical professionals. The Society also incurs expenses from its efforts to support and strengthen the chapters, reflecting its organizational structure. These includ e expenses associated with staff training, information technology, and human resources, much of which are centrally managed by the national office (Figure 16). FUNDRAISING In 2007, the Society raised $228M in total, ex cluding the costs associated with special events. Total funds raised grew by a nine pe rcent compound annual growth rate over 2004- 2007, which is in line with reve nue growth. At the same time , the cost of raising $1 has remained level at 16 cents, with a slightly decreasing trend compared to 2002. This reduction in cost is attributed to the use of the Internet in fundraising, which took place between 2003 and 2005 (Figure 17). With the goal of raising $1.25B between 2006 and 2010, the Society employs multiple fundraising strategies. The Society targets a broad range of donors, ranging from corporate donors providing financial and in-kind support to small individual donors based on direct marketing and online donations. Among the diverse areas of the Society's missions, donors can direct their contributions to specific program areas or specific research projects approved th rough the peer-review process. Chapters play a crucial role in the Society' s fundraising activities, contributing over 80 percent of total income.

In the course of these even ts, the Society ensure s that the participants form bonds with the MS community. The chapters also have been instrumental in increasing funding availa ble for research. During the annual financial planning process, chapters commit to provide specific levels of funding for national programs, out of which half is allocated to research and the other half to other programs. 9 However, in addition to th e set amount allocated to research, chapters have been contributing more funds to the national offi ce to support research, and the Society estimates that chapters contribute 90 percent of discretionary funds available at the end of the fiscal year to research. In addition to special even ts, corporate sponsorship, direct marketing, and ma jor gifts are the major sources of funds for the Society. Among corporate sponsors, pharmaceutical companies contribute about four percent of total income; however, the Society ensures that such sponsors do not in fluence its programs. Other corporate sponsors include \"Corporate Stars\" part icipating in the spec ial events, which contribute $500,000 in revenue; companies involved in cause-related ma rketing, such as Chri stopher & Banks, Pure Protein, Care-a-lot, and Crocs; and corporatio ns providing pro-bono services. The Society has 38 national corporate supporters, in addi tion to various corporate supporters at the chapter level. Direct marketing brings in about 10 percen t of the Society's income. With a database containing information on a million individuals, the Society's direct mail generates about $25M, with an average donation of $43. It also initiated onlin e fundraising efforts in 2007, which generated $1M. The effort is combined with the Society's monthly national e- newsletter, and the Society sees it as a definite growth area. Finally, Helping Hands is an initiative supporting volunteers raising funds in their communities by providing fundraising toolkits; it contributes $4-5M a year. Major gifts are an area of increasi ng importance. Initiatives such as Promise: 2010 and Fast Forward provide an impetus for additional fundraising and also motivate donors to contribute. Major gifts have been the fastest gr owing area of growth, with a growth rate of 24 percent. The Society has a team in the nati onal office focused on major giving and has developed individualized plans for its 400 larges t donors and individual s with potential. It also is building capacity in its chapters, incl uding 23 existing major gift officers across the country. The Society maintains a recognition program, the Discovery Circle, for its donors, organized into nine tiers based on an nual contributions ranging fr om $250-$499 to more than $75,000. Those who make a gift through bequest or gift annuity are reco gnized as Pillars of Society. In addition, the Soci ety organizes calls to update major donors of its research progress, such as the Monthly Na tional Research Call, and prov ides quarterly updates on the Society's activities through the newsletter On the Move . 9 This general rule does not apply for cases where the do nor designated specific programs for which to use the funds. Bike MS and Walk MS Bike MS and Walk MS are key fundraising and awareness-raising events that the Society organizes across the nation with the participation of the regional chapters. Participants, whether participating as individuals or as a team, are asked to raise funds for the Society, and the Society provides toolkits to facilitate the effort\u2014including brochures, Web- based management tools, and any financial forms required. These events raise about $150M a year. Financials 38 of 50 The Society's strategic goals guide the Society's funding pr iorities through 2010. Among those, research areas defined in Promise: 2010 and Fast Forward are areas where funding is most needed. Assessment 39 of 50 NATIONAL MS SOCIETY : ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW This section provides an assessment of the Soci ety's operations and research portfolio. It is based on a set of me trics developed by FasterCures to assess practices and attributes of nonprofit disease research grou ps that contribute to the acceleration of high-impact biomedical research. While these areas of assessment are believed to contribute to accelerating research, it should not be assumed that all organizations will exhibit all of these practices and attributes. Each organization's assessment is made with in the context of its stated strategies and mission as well as the research needs with in the specific disease. In addition, this section also hi ghlights how the Society's effort s respond to the needs of the research community as identified in the PAS disease report on MS. ASSESSMENT RESULTS The metrics used for the assessment are organized into four primary groups: Accountability: The degree to which an organi zation engages in planning, demonstrates transparency, and up holds stakeholder responsibility Collaboration: The degree to which an organi zation can engage and nurture relationships that accelerate the ov erall funding and research cycle Research Effectiveness: The degree to which the organi zation's research portfolio yields sufficient data and deliverables in alignment with its stated mission Resource Building: The degree to which the organi zation contributes critical resources and infrastructure to the greater scientific community Several metrics are included in each assessment category. The assessment reflects FasterCures ' evaluation of the orga nization's performance for that metric and the results color indicates the quality of performance. \u0083 OUTSTANDING performance \u0083 STRONG performance \u0083 ACCEPTABLE performance \u0083 Performance NEEDS IMPROVEMENT Accountability: Accountability refers to the degree to which an organization engages in planning, demonstrates transparency, an d upholds stakeholder responsibility. Metric Results Assessment Strategic Planning and Monitoring Strong The Society formulates its organizational strategy every three years, through a rigorous process that incorporates input from a large group of constituents, which helps to ensure they are addressing their needs. The Society also regularly reviews its grant programs using metrics tailored to the goal of each program, a good practice given that some of its grant mechanisms have very specific goals. In addition, the Society is upgrading to a more effective mechanism for tracking the progress of its activities against its goals. Milestones Strong The grants funded by the Society are subject to an annual interim review, and grants that do not make reasonable progress may be terminated. Some clinical research grants and healthcare delivery and policy grants are subject to additional pre-determined milestones. Given that most of the Society's grants are investigator- Assessment 40 of 50 Metric Results Assessment initiated, it is difficult to directly tie the achievement of the specific aims of individual grants to the organization's strategy, beyond research advancement and career development. However, the Society also invests a sizeable share of its research budget in Targeted Initiatives, in which case the achievement of aims can be linked directly to the achievement of a larger goal. Advisory Boards Strong In addition to the National Board of Directors, the Society convenes multiple advisory boards to solicit expert input. The RPAC is the main standing advisory body that provides input on its overall research operation, and additional ad hoc committees and taskforces are established for specific issues or initiatives. In addition to RPAC, the National Clinical Advisory Board provides input on clinical issues. Intellectual Property (IP) Acceptable The Society relies on the IP policies of the grantee organizations, but requires them to report on IP right creation and to pursue commercialization. This policy is generally aligned with the Society's programs, similar to policies of peer organizations, and easily operationalized within the existing challenges of the university technology transfer environment. The Society is commended for their enforcement of the policy to ensure their rights are protected as defined in their policy. Opportunities exist for the Society to better understand the potential for policy and procedural changes to more effectively share IP with the broader MS community. Collaboration: Collaboration refers to the degree to which an organization can engage and nurture relationships that accelerate th e overall funding and research cycle. Metric Results Assessment Industry Partnerships Outstanding Fast Forward, launched in 2007, actively seeks opportunities to fund industry-based drug development efforts. Fast Forward aims to accelerate MS drug development by providing funding to drug development projects in academia and early-stage biomedical companies. In addition to announcing its first deal in December 2008, Fast Forward also entered into a collaborative agreement with EMD Serono, to which the company has contributed up to $19 million. At the same time, PAS' scientific advisors expressed concern that a focus on commercialization could hinder the Society's capability to fund basic science research, so maintaining strength in both areas will be an important measure of success for the Society. Knowledge-sharing Strong The Society contributes to knowledge sharing in MS research by organizing Task Forces and Workshops on specific issues, which has been very effective in bringing MS researchers together, as well as in providing support for scientific meetings organized by other entities. In addition, the Society launched its Tykeson Fellowship Conference in 2008, which all traini ng award recipients are required to attend to increase knowledge sharing, build a community of MS researchers, and interact with patients. Such efforts could be expanded across its research programs. Team Science Strong The Society's Collaborative MS Research Center Award was specifically put in place as a strategy to increase collaboration in MS research, based on a recommendation of an IOM review of MS research. In addition, many of the organization's Targeted Initiatives are large-scale projects structured as team grants with multiple collaborators. In total, about 20 percent of the Society's active portfolio is composed of team grants, reflecting the Society's emphasis in this area, although additional resources could be invested in this area. Assessment 41 of 50 Metric Results Assessment Global Research Outstanding The Society's grant programs are open to researchers in the United States and overseas, and approximately 10 percent of active grants are disbursed to researchers in other countries, including grants for targeted initiatives. In addition, the Society engages international scientists in various aspects of its research operations, including its Scientific Workshops, study groups, and advisory committees. One notable international effort is the Atlas of MS, an international survey done in conjunction with the WHO to collect data on disease prevalence for over 88 percent of the world's population. Research Effectiveness: Research effectiveness refers to the degree to which the organization's research portfolio yields sufficient data and deliverables in alignment with its stated mission. Metric Results Assessment Scientific Advancement Strong PAS's scientific advisors point out that the Society has been the single organization serving as a catalyst for new research in MS. This contribution to science is made through the Society's research funding as well as its Scientific Workshops, which raise awareness in the scientific community about new research areas. The organization could further track the outcomes of the research projects against a research plan to demonstrate how the funded research is advancing the Society's strategic goals. Portfolio Congruence Strong The Society's research strategy focuses on accelerating research toward a cure by increasing collaboration and providing support for under researched and promising areas. The Collaborative Center Awards, the Pilot Awards, and the targeted RFPs are mechanisms specifically designed to address these focus areas, which amount to over 20 percent of the active portfolio. The Society's research portfolio is balanced between etiology and treatment research, and the PAS SAB believes that the Society's portfolio is consistent with what is required given the status of research, with additional focus on psychosocial aspect of the disease. Knowledge Production Strong The Society is a key source of new knowledge about MS. Internal tracking of publications of its grantees indicates that a typical grant results in 4-6 publications, and that in 2008, research grants resulted in 240 publications. The Society has also calculated that in 2006 - 2008, 67 percent of the applications reviewed were from investigators who had written their proposals based on data produced from previous Society grants indicating contribution of new knowledge to the field. The Society could to benefit from tracking publications electronically and systematically tracking the quality of its publications. Resource Building: Resource building refers to the degree to which the organization contributes critical resource s and infrastructure to the greater scientific community. Metric Results Assessment Tools/ Resources Development Strong The Society has provided support for multiple tissue banks in MS, an important resource for research on the pathology of the disease. In addition to providing financial support, the Society also ensures the compatibility of sample collection procedures by requiring all banks to use the same collection methodology, which is important for research using biospecimens. In addition, the Society contributes to generating research data accessible to the research community, including its support of the genetic data repository of the MS Genetics Group at the Assessment 42 of 50 Metric Results Assessment University of California, San Francisco and its collection of quality of life data through its Sonya Slifka Longitud inal Study in the United States. At the same time, the Society is at a unique position to contribute to the field in this area, calling for additional responsibility. Research Training Outstanding Providing funding to build the next generation of MS researchers is an important mission of the Society, and among the active grants issued since 2005, 12 percent focus on providing career development opportunities to postdoctoral fellows or equivalent and to young investigators. The PAS SAB notes that the Society's support for young investigators has been crucial in research training and that the majority of leading researchers today were past recipients of the Society's career development grants. Patient Organization Strong The Society is advocating for passage of the National MS Disease Registry Act in Congress, which aims to create a National MS Registry at CDC. The registry is expected to contribute to better understanding of the epidemiology and causes of MS, and also complement the existing patient registry maintained by the Co nsortium of MS Centers. However, given the unique position that the Society has in terms of patient access, the Society can make an important contribution in executing such efforts, so it will be interesting to see the role it will play in building the registry. Clinical Trials Networks Strong The Society has funded the establishment of MS-CORE, a clinical trial network of 80 sites. Although the network is yet to be widely used, it will help facilitate clinical trials, especially those sponsored by agents other than the pharmaceutical industry. The National MS Society was not assessed against the following metrics as they are not aligned with the organization's stated strategy: 1. Pipeline Profile SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION This section highlights the National MS Societ y's scientific contributi ons to the research community, focusing on how it is contributing to addressing the challenges facing the research community. The Society's specific ongoing contributions are summarized below: Spectrum Scientific Contribution Care Continuum Disease Understanding Limited understanding of the causes of the disease is an underlying challenge in MS research, and the Society's research funding, with almost half of it directed to etiology research , contributes to progress in this area. In addition, the Society's MS Lesion project focuses on understanding the difference in clinical disease by researching the patterns of MS lesions in different patients. This project is likely to contribute to better understanding of the drivers of disease progression as well as the differences among disease subtypes. Additional areas are identified as major areas requiring investment, and this project has the potential to greatly advance science in MS. Prevention Better understanding the role of vitamin D and it potential in prevention approaches requires research attention. The Society has an investigator-initiated grant directly addressing this issue . In addition, the Society's research on risk factors and epidemiology will contribute to the development of treatment measures in the long run. Diagnostics Major challenges to development of diagnostics and disease markers for MS include the lack of tools to monitor disease activities as well as tools to Assessment 43 of 50 Spectrum Scientific Contribution measure disease progress and trea tment effectiveness, including neurodegeneration and neuronal repair . The Society has issued a number of investigator-initiated grants focused on disease markers. In addition, the Nervous System Repair and Protection Initiative , described more in detail in the treatment section, includes research to develop markers to measure treatment effectiveness, including improved imaging technology to detect myelin and nerve fiber damage and repair, which could contribute to direct observation of myelin . Treatment Treatment research focusing on neuronal repair and neuroprotection, in addition to strategies focusing on inflammation , were identified by PAS's scientific advisors as areas needing more investment. The Society's Nervous System Repair and Protection Initiative , an investment of more than $15M plans to enable clinical trials by 2010. Scientists have highlighted the potential impact of this project to the MS research field overall. In addition, another area needing research investment is more effective symptomatic treatment . The Society's research strategy calls for focus on all aspects of treatment, including stopping MS attacks and disease progression, repairing the damage from the attacks, preventing the onset of the disease, as well as quality of life issues such as policy and delivery, rehabilitation, symptom management, and psychosocial research . As such, the research projects funded by Society span these areas. Delivery The high cost of treatments and access to specialists is a major issue for MS patients, though not an issue directly linked to research. Through the Sonya Slifka Longitudinal Study , the Society collects data on quality of life, rehabilitation, symptomatic ther apies, employment, and healthcare delivery. These data will be leveraged to develop strategies for the Society's own advocacy efforts, and will be made available for use by researchers. In addition, the Society's advocacy and patient support activities directly help address this challenge. Research Tools Biospecimens and Data The small number of samples, limiting the power of analyses, and difficulties caused by differe nces in collection protocols are some of the major challenges facing the use of biospecimens in MS research. The Society has funded three biospecimen repositories for MS research , including the Human Neurospecimen Bank at the University of California, Los Angeles; the Rocky Mountain MS Tissue Bank; and the recently established University of Illinois at Chicago MS Tissue Repository. In addition, the Society specifically required the biospecimens repository at the University of Illinois to collaborate with the existing repositories to ensure that the tissues are collected in a compatible manner . Clinical Trials As treatment options have been introduced in MS, placebo-controlled trials have become increasi ngly difficult to conduct . The International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials , convened by the Society, discusses and seeks solutions to issues related to trial design and outcome measures. Animal Models The EAE model, the dominant animal model in MS research, focuses only on the immunologic aspects of the disease , and therefore is not adequate for research focused on other aspects of the disease. Through its investigator-initiated grant mechanism, the Society has funded grants aiming to validate animal models that allow investigations beyond immunology, such as axon degeneration. Research Training The limitations in multidisciplinary talent and lack of young investigators with an interest in a career in MS research are major challenges for MS research community. The Society addresses these by establishing grant programs designed to meet these needs, including its Collaborative Center Awards and Pilot Awards that seek to attract scientists from other fields as well as its Career Development Awards .

METRICS DEFINITION Accountability: The degree to which an or ganization engages in planning, demonstrates transparency, and upholds stakeholder responsibility. Metric Definition Sample Metric Importance Strategic Planning and Monitoring Establishes a research strategic plan for managing a portfolio of research projects and evaluates itself against the goals and objectives outlined in the plan Existence of a strategic plan that responds to the needs of the field and incorporates measurable goals Evidence of monitoring efforts at regular intervals using a performance management system Organizations taking a proactive approach to understanding their position in the disease landscape, to developing a research strategic plan, and to monitoring research portfolios are better able to target the research \"investments\" where they will have the most impact in understanding and curing disease. Those that incorporate a feedback loop from the patients and key constituencies ensures the plan is relevant to its stakeholders and responsive to the needs of the field. Milestones Utilizes milestones to measure and manage scientific advancement against its research plan and project goals Alignment of project milestones to overall research plan Demonstrated use of milestones to secure future funding Evidence of terminating underperforming projects Organizations that require achievement of milestones for funding, as appropriate for the duration of the grant, ensure that focus is maintained on key activities and vital resources are appropriately distributed to efforts and researchers demonstrating progress. Advisory Boards Has established active advisory boards, with appropriate composition, that provide external, objective guidance at regular intervals Effective use of advisory boards that have balanced membership, adequate turnover, and whose decisions are key inputs to leadership and Board decisions Organizations can convene scientific, clinical, business, and other ad visory boards to validate research excellence as well as to provide guidance in developing and executing their organizational strategy. These boards should have the relevant skill and experience mix for the organization's mission and membership should turnover to ensure the benefit of new perspectives. Intellectual Property (IP) Has established an actionable IP policy aligned with the organizational mission Existence of IP policy consistent with mission Demonstration that efforts to commercialize appropriate technologies are pursued IP is an important consideration when sharing knowledge among researchers as well as when enticing industry for drug development. An IP policy should be documented, enforced, and aligned with the or ganization's mission, strategy, and goals. Access and Delivery Strategy Provides a strategy for ensuring candidate interventions can be made available to the target population, particularly in endemic countries Existence of a robust strategy that engages and has been vetted by product constituencies, addresses affordability, and is timed appropriately to the product development timeline Candidate therapies are not effective if they cannot reach the target patient population. There are several obstacles that impede access to interventions in the developing world including lack of healthcare facilities, skilled professionals to administer care, and political will. Organizations with missions of delivering novel therapies to these regions will need to implement strategies for ensuring the access and delivery obstacles can be overcome in a timely manner. Glossary 48 of 50 Collaboration: The degree to which an organization can engage and nurture relationships that accelerate the overall f unding and research cycle. Metric Definition Sample Measure Importance Industry Partnerships Has formed arrangements to engage with industry towards product development or has a mechanism and strategy for moving research towards commercialization Existence of industry relationships and/ or drug development subsidiaries Existence of a commercialization plan if no industry partnerships Demonstration of feedback loop from partners Organizations engaging in partnerships, particularly with industry, will help to accelerate the translation of basic science at the bench into clinical application in the market. Partnership arrangements may differ and include instances of nonprofit venture funding of for-profit research. Knowledge- sharing Employs policies and practices to facilitate sharing of data (both internally and externally) from projects funded by the organization Existence and execution of policy Demonstration that the knowledge shared has made a relevant contribution to the field Sharing knowledge from studies helps to accelerate the research process by equipping scientists with data to identify studies with potential impact as well as to further inform their own scientific questions. In-person sessions such as annual scientific retreats as well as open access publishing can expedite the knowledge-sharing process and reduce the information dissemination cycle. Team Science Funds / conducts goal- oriented, team-based science with a translational endpoint Existence of multi- investigator projects to target large, complex scientific questions Organizations funding team science help to facilitate collaboration among leading research stakeholders, to focus innovation that benefits patients, and to shorten the cycle of discovery and development. Global Research Funds or collaborates on international research initiatives Existence of international funding or collaborations In an ever-increasing gl obal environment, it is important for organizations to acknowledge a geographic position within a global research environment and build international relationships among top researchers, industry partners, and funders, etc. around the world, as appropriate. Research Effectiveness: The degree to which the organizati on's research portfolio yields sufficient data and deliverables in alignment with its stated strategy. Metric Definition Sample Measure Importance Scientific Advancement Results in generation of scientific deliverables (e.g., assays, targets, pathways, biomarkers) that are aligned with the needs of the field Number of scientific deliverables as portion of those planned Rate of projects moving through the R&D pipeline as compared to the planned rate Research projects that produce deliverables and advance candidates through the R&D pipeline per their proj ect plans demonstrate the ability of the organization to identify capable investigators and to bring together the necessary resources to achieve the desired outcomes of the organization and the field. Portfolio Congruence Achieves a research portfolio aligned with the organization's mission and stated goals as well as those needs of the field Distribution of research funding across types and stages as compared to organizational objectives and field needs Organizations that demonstrate research portfolios that are cong ruent with their goals and objectives are appr opriately stewarding their research funding in efforts to achieve desired outcomes. This validates their planning and resource management efforts to focus on outcomes. Glossary 49 of 50 Pipeline Profile Funds a portfolio of projects that ensures sufficient volume of candidates to move into later-stage testing Proportion of early- stage to late-stage research projects Organizations with missions to deliver novel therapeutic products to the market need to ensure they are funding a sufficient number of early-stage projects that will feed later- stage development. If outside of one's mission, there must be a strategy for ensuring that early-stage inputs can be added to the pipeline. Knowledge Production Results in annual generation of new data and knowledge for the field Annual measurement of: Number of presentations Number of publications Number of citations Research that is presen ted, published in peer- reviewed publications, and then subsequently cited, especially by those in varying disciplines, demonstrates the ability of the organization to identify high-quality, high- impact research and thus to efficiently allocate funding to th ese research efforts. Knowledge that drives the advancement of ideas through drug development is particularly valuable to the field. Resource Building: The degree to which the organization contributes critical resources and infrastructure to the greater scientific community. Metric Definition Sample Measure Importance Tools/ Resources Development Funds the creation, maintenance, and expansion of infrastructure and resources to meet the needs of the field Percentage of total grant funding dedicated to tools/resources Congruency of tool development with their plan Contribution of tool to the field More resources must be readily available to the research community, including predictive animal models, interoperable clinical and research databases and systems, comprehensive biob anks, information technology platforms, and data standards and protocols. Effective research resources are essential to expand available datasets and analytical capabiliti es that are necessary to accelerate and drive research from discovery to the clinic. Research Training Funds training programs to develop a new cadre of translational researchers to meet training needs in the field Percentage of total funding dedicated to translational research training Congruency of training with organization's plan Contribution of training to the field Training is required to develop a cadre of researchers who have the multidisciplinary skills necessary fo r a R&D environment focused on translational and clinical research. Patient Organization Dedicates resources to understanding and organizing their target patient population Number of patients organized in a patient registry as proportion of disease burden Understanding of the patient profile as evidenced by the segmentation of patient population (e.g., by geography, subtype, ethnicity) Understanding and engaging patient populations is essential to developing effective treatments. Patient enrollment to clinical trials is one of the most significant hurdles for conducting clinical research for new therapies. Therefore, efforts like registries that organize patients and potential research participants enable expedited study enrollment and overall acceleration of the research process. These registries also provide data to better understand the patient population and thus design effective intervention trials. Clinical Trials Networks Organizes or develops a group of sites that are trained in administering clinical trials for a particular disease Number of sites organized in a clinical trials network Clinical trials networks create a group of research sites that are connected through common informatics systems to share data, employ consistently trained clinical trials coordinators and staff, are attractive for industry partnerships, and thus are able to more quickly advance the clinical development of promising compounds. Clinical trial network development that incorporates business and project management training is particularly valuable.
