Not every patient will respond to a chiropractic adjustment in the same way. Other forms of therapy may be needed to provide the structural support the body needs to heal efficiently and completely. Compression and Massage therapies are two of the most well-known companion therapies associated with chiropractic care. Learning their benefits and why they work so well when combined with chiropractic adjustments will help you get the relief you need to feel your best. Benefits of Compression Therapy Compression therapy is used to improve circulation to the lower extremities. It can also be beneficial for treating wounds that are not healing correctly. Mild compression is used to improve blood flow through the lower extremities and strengthen veins so that blood is moved back toward the heart more effectively. This is accomplished through the use of compression devices and compression stockings. Benefits of Massage Therapy Massage therapy is another form of treatment that goes hand in hand with chiropractic care. Deep tissue massage improves circulation, keeps soft tissues flexible and pliant, strengthens muscles and connective tissues, and relaxes the body. When a person receives a deep tissue massage, it gives them an opportunity to fully relax and unwind. This works to eliminate stress and anxiety. Inflammation is broken up throughout the body and toxins are flushed away leaving more room for the nutrients and oxygen the body needs to thrive. During Treatment and After While both compression therapy and massage therapy can be included in a treatment plan, both can be used on a regular basis to help maintain good health, keeping both the body and mind vivacious and strong. Regular chiropractic adjustments that are performed during periods of wellness will help to keep the body in balance, reducing the risk of injury and disease. Visit Lefevre Chiropractic Today!
