Fever blisters are a common viral infection. Cold sores are red, fluid-filled blisters that form near the mouth or on other areas of the face. These blisters are often grouped together in patches. Cold sores usually heal in two to four weeks without leaving a scar. Risk factors - - Infection, fever, or a cold - Stress - Sun exposure and severe burns - Cancer chemotherapy - Menstruation and eczema - HIV/AIDS or a weakened immune system - Dental work - Anti-rejection drugs for organ transplants Complications - - Difficulty breathing or swallowing. - Red, irritated eyes with or without discharge. - High or persistent fever. Symptoms and causes - Symptoms - - Tingling and itching:- around the lips many people feel an itching, burning or tingling sensation for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blister erupt. - Oozing and crusting:- the small blisters may merge and then burst, leaving shallow open sores that will ooze fluid and then crust over. - Blister:- small fluid-filled blisters typically break out along the border where the outside edge of the lips meets the skin of the face. Cold sores also occur around the nose or on the cheeks. - During the first time some people also experience fever, painful eroded gums, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes.
