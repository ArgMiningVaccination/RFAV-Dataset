What we put into our bodies has a direct effect on our health, our appearance, and our energy. Eating and drinking replenishes our bodies with the nutrients and vitamins needed to live a long and healthy life. Eat well! Live well! The fact is simple. Making better choices about what you put into your mouth is probably the best way to prevent cancer. According to the [ American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention.html), dietary choices are a key factor that can increase - or decrease! - our cancer risk. The good news is, what you put in your mouth is entirely up to you. We are bombarded with chemicals and other unhealthy ingredients that make their way into our food supply. While you may not notice an immediate reaction to what you are eating, chances are all of these plastics and synthetic food additives are causing damage to your body right now. The damage can be irreversible. Your liver is an amazing cleansing machine, but if you overload it with junk, it can't always process everything and then these toxins can enter your bloodstream and spread throughout the body. Start at home. Eat fresh, homemade food as much as possible. Eating at home is the best possible way to know what goes into your food. Learn how to cook and prepare food that doesn't come in a package. Try to do your best to buy organic produce and avoid foods that have been processed. They often contain added chemicals and are devoid of most the nutrition the original food embodied. A popular rule of thumb is that the fewer ingredients there are in something, the better it is for you. A carrot has one ingredient - carrot. A Twinkie has over 30 ingredients, most of which are synthetic or semi-synthetic food additives. Which do you think is safer for you and which would you rather have in your cart? Affordable, nutritious food should not be a luxury. Look into options in your community for nutritious food options. Farmers markets are springing up all over the country, and they are a great place to find fresh, local food. Taking a trip to a local farmers market and perhaps spending a little extra now on better products may save you thousands of dollars on medical bills later if you get sick, not to mention time missed at school and/or work. And many farmers markets now accept food stamps to ensure that everyone has access to fresh, local food. "}
