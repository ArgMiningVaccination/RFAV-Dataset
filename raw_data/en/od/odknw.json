ABSTRACT: This groundbreaking book systematically characterizes Western drugs, as well as chemicals in the human body, for the first time as having \"hot\" and \"cold\" properties. This development, discovered over a 20-year period through chemistry and the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), may help medicinal chemists and drug manufacturers identify new drug leads and predict their potential side effects. One drug lead that this book identifies, for example, is a common feature of compounds that improve memory. Nai-Yi Wang is a Ph.D. organic chemist with a 35-year career in teaching and research at universities and in the pharmaceutical industry. He holds more than 20 patents in synthetic organic chemistry, natural product synthesis, and biotechnology. His research has focused on cardiovascular drugs discovery, anticancer compounds syntheses, and the development of immunoassays. As an organic chemist specializing in natural products synthesis, Wang accomplished the first total synthesis of compactin (an analog of the Merck cholesterol-lowering drug Zocor). He is also an expert in the chemistry of Traditional Chinese Medicine. This is the fourth edition of his book, \"The Principle of Febrile and Inflammatory Diseases.\" Among the highlights of this edition is the application of immunology to the \"Hot and Cold Theory\" in TCM in order to address the issues in diseases for which there are currently no effective treatment in Western medicine.", "sitename": "The Principle of Febrile and Inflammatory Diseases, 4th Edition.      | hc:50871", "date": "2010-05-01", "cleaned_text": "- The Principle of Febrile and Inflammatory Diseases, 4th Edition. - URL: [https://doi.org/10.17613/61c4-gc96](/deposits/item/hc:50871) - Abstract: - Wang, Nai-Yi (2023).
