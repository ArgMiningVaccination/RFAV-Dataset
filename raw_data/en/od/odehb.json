Many of the supplements I use have herbs and it helps to learn more about them in depth, to add versatility to my practice and better treatment options for my patients. Thank you to all the teachers who take time to impart their years of practical knowledge to us.\" L.I., MD Here's how the Restorative Medicine Herbal Fellowship is different than other programs: The program is focused on herbal applications without spending a lot of time teaching clinical basics. Experts will teach the mechanisms of action for the most commonly used herbs, and train doctors on how to apply their understanding of plant pharmacology to other clinical conditions. Unlike other herbal medicine courses, our approach is not about rote memorization of lists of herbs. We offer patient-centered learning based on what really works. \"I would like to thank AARM for having this kind of fellowship program. Distant learning is within reach. They have variety of dynamic speakers from different fields of herbal medicine. Now I am more confident in treating my patients with this kind of modality. \" Lovely Ediza Dollosa, MD \"I just wanted to tell you how truly wonderful I found this program--I have thoroughly enjoyed it and learned so much of interest and of use in my family practice. I'm disappointed actually that I've finished it! You all have done a beautiful job in organizing the program as well as finding excellent speakers and choosing appropriate clinical topics. If only all webinars could be so riveting... Thank you for a rewarding experience!\" Carrie Browne, MD \"As someone trained in a modern Western tradition, I started the program with a scarcity of knowledge and an abundance of curiosity. As the general public's interest in herbs have grown, I felt the need to educate myself on the topic. I was uncertain as to how this knowledge would influence my own practice. The herbal fellowship program exceeded my expectations. It provided a refreshingly evidence-based introduction to herbal medicine, and has given me confidence not only to continue further exploring the subject on my own but also to begin incorporating it in my own practice.\" Audrey Le, MD \"I had a great time, I have to be honest as an allopathic trained doctor it was a little daunting at first but as I kept listening and attending the live webinars I started to feel more and more confident. Overall it was a wonderful experience: from the didactic modules to the top-notch speakers all the way to an easy to navigate web base system, I will be recommending and displaying proudly my Herbal Medicine Certificate to my colleagues for sure.\" S.D., MD \"The Herbal Medicine Fellowship education was Stellar... I do not say that lightly, having over 25 years of full time college coursework at some of the nations premier educational institutes (Univ MI, NE, John's Hopkins and Univ WA). The variety and caliber of instructors was excellent. The response when questions occurred was rapid. Dr Hand was always helpful ... AARM consistently provides personalized support. My experience was the reason I have gone on to the neurology "}
