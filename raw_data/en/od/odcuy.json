You want to avoid alcohol in your facial products if it results in dry or oily skin. Secondly, Parabens are used as preservatives in most cosmetics and skin care products.

Of particular note is his approach to the immune system, a widely appreciated (yet poorly understood) function of the body. We Are Made of Microorganisms As humans, we each possess a [microbiome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/microbiome), a community of microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that inhabit the body. Our bodies are home to about 100 trillion of these microbes, and their role in protecting us from disease cannot be overstated: They are not just necessary, but crucial, to human life on a great many levels. Microbiome research is an emerging field in which researchers investigate how the bacteria that live in and on our bodies affect our health and states of mind. Beneficial microbes in the gut have much to do with how efficiently we can extract calories from different kinds of food, how likely we can escape colon cancer or heart disease, and even how we metabolize different kinds of drugs. And, as Lipton teaches, these microbes regulate a wide array of aspects related to both mind and body\u2014from the removal of toxins to gut feelings, and from sleep patterns to appetite. In fact, because of their role in the [production of certain hormones such as serotonin](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-brain-gut-connection), a deficiency in the microbiome literally affects happiness levels and may contribute to anxiety and depression.
