Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible e ects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an \"immune booster \", are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the \"meaning response\" described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively infl uence immunity either by direct e ects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic signi cance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be bene cial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection. 1. The meaning response and psychoneuroimmunity: An analysis of the Indian government's Ayurvedic immunity-boosting measures for the COVID-19 crisis With over 2,400,000 cases and 170,000 deaths reported to date (April 21st, 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis withan actual or potential impact on citizens of all nations. This outbreak has already had a signi cant impact on mental health, especially in vulnerable groups such as healthcare workers ( Rajkumar, 2020 ). Be- sides causing distress in their own right, these psychological symptoms have the potential to adversely impact immune functioning. Psycho- social factors such as stress, anxiety and depression are associated with increased susceptibility to viral upper respiratory infections ( Pedersen et al., 2010) and can in fluence the immune response to the in fluenza vaccine ( Whittaker, 2018). Such ndings suggest that a link between psychological distress and immune responses to COVID-19 infection is biologically plausible and deserves further attention. In India, the practice of modern medicine co-exists with indigenous systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha, which are extensively used by wide sections of the population ( Shankar and Patwardhan, 2017 ). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Indian government released a set of guidelines, developed based on the opi- nion of 16 eminent vaidyas (traditional doctors), entitled \"Ayurveda 's immunity boosting measures for self care during the COVID-19 crisis \", and made them available to the public ( https://www.ayush.gov.in/ docs/123.pdf ). These guidelines listed ten measures that were aimed atboosting immunity against infection, though without any speci c claims being made with reference to COVID-19. From a scienti c viewpoint, it is worth examining such re- commendations in terms of knowledge derived from two contemporary models. The rst, psychoneuroimmunology, is based on evidence of an intimate link between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems, andexplains the mechanisms by which stress and emotional disorders can modulate the immune response to infection ( Kim and Su, 2020). The second, the \"meaning response \", was developed by Moerman as an alternative to the concept of the \"placebo response \". According to this model, an individual 's response to any given treatment depends not only on its pharmacological properties, but on the meaning they ascribe to this treatment. This meaning is largely shaped by the culture they live in ( Moerman, 2013). Both these models -psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response -are valuable in understanding the e ect of treatments that do not work via a conventional \"scienti c\"paradigm, and are not mutually exclusive; a \"meaningful \"intervention could modulate immune function through its e ects on psychological distress. Table 1 shows the application of these paradigms to the 10 measures recommended by Ayurvedic specialists and published by the Govern-ment of India. A potential psychoneuroimmune mechanism was identi ed for ve of the proposed methods, via neurobiological mechanisms such as modulation of monoamine function, stress axis response and autonomic activity, as well as reduction of anxiety, depression and perceived stress in human subjects ( Sarris, 2018 ). In terms of the \"meaning response \" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056 Received 21 April 2020; Accepted 21 April 2020E-mail address: ravi.psych@gmail.com .Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 87 (2020) 8-9 Available online 22 April 2020 0889-1591/ \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Tevoked by these measures, a symbolic meaning based on relevant tra- dition from Ayurvedic literature, and often echoed by folk practices, could be identi ed in all ten cases. These meanings were related to substances seen as rejuvenating, to \"cleansing \"of the body, to the local application of medicinal substances, to speci ceects against cough, sore throat and respiratory disease, and even to the symbolic meaning of a particular colour in terms of health and prosperity ( Ali, 1998; Shrivastava et al., 2020 ). Viewed through these lenses, it is possible that such traditional measures can positively in fluence mental health and immune function. For some, there is already putative evidence of a cellular mechanism, at least in vitro , which could modulate psychoneuroimmune pathways in a positive way; in others, the e ect can only be inferred from evidence of ecacy in alleviating psychological distress or in providing a symbolic meaning related to health, well-being and protection against speci c diseases. While there is no direct evidence that the \"meaning response \" can aect immune function, it may be associated with alterations in immune-in flammatory activity in vivo , as well as with reduced stress, anxiety and mood, mediated through e ects on mesolimbic and me- socortical brain circuits ( Oken, 2008). The relevance of these e ects to psychological and immune function during the COVID-19 outbreak requires direct experimental testing, and the Government 's guidelines themselves recommend that these mea- sures be used only side-by-side with appropriate hygienic precautions,and that consultation in a medical setting should be sought immediately if symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 emerge. If they can be con rmed, such e ects would be consistent with anthropological perspectives which show that there is no irreconcilable di erence between Ayurvedic and \"biological \"models of mind -body medicine meaning response providing poten- tial \"missing links \"between the two. The further development of such explanatory models could clarify the usefulness of \"traditional \"medicalpractices during disease outbreaks, and could facilitate a more sy-nergistic interaction between traditional and modern medicine (Shankar and Patwardhan, 2017).
