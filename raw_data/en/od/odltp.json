Some children are ready to accept \"taps\" right away, and others need time to warm up to the idea. At The Acupuncture Den, children are never forced or tricked into treatments they aren't ready for. A number of very effective non-needle techniques are also available to treat kids who aren't ready for \"taps.\" Acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years, including on kids. Qi, or life energy, travels throughout the body along pathways which have been mapped over time. When the body is out of balance, the Qi does not course these channels smoothly. Acupuncture, the insertion of extremely thin needles into points along the channels, is a method of tapping into and regulating the Qi, thereby helping the body and mind to rebalance and heal. Shonishin is a Japanese pediatric massage technique which uses a smooth edged tool to gently brush along the skin. This technique is gentle and non-invasive. Shonishin can be combined with acupuncture or serve as an alternative for babies and young children who are not yet ready to accept acupuncture. Pediatric Tui Na is a safe form of therapeutic massage which is highly effective for treating young children. Parents can be taught some of the basic techniques and continue these treatments at home. Pediatric Tui Na can be combined with acupuncture or serve as an alternative for children who are not yet ready to accept acupuncture. A non-invasive technique that uses small cups to create a suction on the skin, promoting circulation. Returning kids often request \"polka dots,\" referring to the temporary marks that are sometimes visible on the skin after cupping. Cupping can be combined with acupuncture or used independently. Moxibustion is a warming technique, using dried mugwort to stimulate specific acupuncture points. It is a grounding and soothing therapy, and is frequently used to relax muscle tension, strengthen the immune system, regulate digestion and the menstrual cycle, decrease pain and alleviate the symptoms of anxiety. Herbal medicine is an integral part of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Safe and effective, herbal formulas come in many forms, including herbal teas, powders, pills and tinctures. The Acupuncture Den uses only the highest quality herbs, and reputable pediatric lines are carried to make herbal medicine more accessible to children. Traditional Chinese Medicine offers many insights into nutrition and using food in ways to promote greater health. Dr. Den will often make dietary suggestions, beginning with minor adjustments that may ultimately bring about great changes. Over time, simple nutritional concepts may be incorporated into your relationship with food. "}
