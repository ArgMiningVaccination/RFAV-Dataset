The best part about Dr. Sanders was that not only does she know what she's doing but she was readily available via email and patiently answered all my questions and concerns during the whole process. I thank God that I found out about her services. I am very grateful for Dr. Sanders' help and have already recommended Dr. Sanders to a few of my friends who suffer from stomach or joint issues. Thank you Dr. Sanders and please keep up the good work!\" - J.N., New Haven I brought my daughter to Dr. LaRosa because I was hoping to get her some relief from the chronic IBS she was suffering from. Not only did the acupuncture give her relief the very first sesson, he also found the cause for the IBS. We are following his recommendation for treatment, and the improvement in her symptoms is incredible. Dr. LaRosa is professional, passionate about his work, and I highly recommend him. - K.M., Milford Dr. Frank LaRosa has been such an influence to me!...He has such a kind and gentle nature and shows that he truly cares about each and every patient.
