Good question! Our name says a lot about who we are, what we do, and what you can study here. SPEA was founded as a response to the needs and problems of modern society\u2014needs that were not being addressed by other more traditional schools such as business, arts and sciences, or political science. Our scope is wide, and we address such issues as public finance, nonprofit management, public management, environmental management, policy analysis, health administration, criminal justice and arts administration. Even better, this year we have welcomed several new faculty members who are already making a difference and leading our school into the future. You can see who they are by going here. The school's broadening globalization is already being realized in the expanded programs of studies in several countries around the world through SPEA Overseas Education. Additionally, we are strengthening our research in energy policy, sustainable development, and the prevention of poverty, and building on traditional strengths in public finance, management of nonprofit and public sectors, and arts administration. Beyond your degree program, SPEA offers many opportunities to enrich your academic career, such as the Honors Program, IU in DC program, the Accelerated Master's program, and many more. Seek out what speaks to you to expand your experience here at SPEA! To us, a public or environmental affair is an issue or problem that affects the quality of life on this planet for its citizens. That's a big list, obviously, and our graduates go on to jobs in many fields\u2014public, private, and nonprofit.

The SPEA graduation application is found online or by visiting SPEA Student Services. Further information can be found on the SPEA-IUPUI bulletin at http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ . Bulletin Policy Students are expected to complete the requirements for their undergraduate degree within 10 years of admission to the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Students are allowed to continue beyond this time period only at the discretion of the undergraduate program director or campus director. If a student has not taken classes for three years or more, that student must satisfy the program requirements of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs in effect at the time of reactivation. Requests for deviation from requirements listed in the bulletin must be approved in writing by the program director, whose decision is final. Course Opportunities A student in good academic standing may choose to take a maximum of eight elective courses (two per academic year) pass/fail for the B.S. degree or two courses for the A.S. degree. Deadlines for exercising this option are published in the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Handbook and are strictly enforced. With prior approval, a student may take three courses, totaling no more than 10 credit hours, by independent study through the School of Continuing Studies. Under no circumstances may a student satisfy a core or major/ concentration requirement by independent study. With SPEA faculty approval, a student in good standing may earn a maximum of 9 credit hours through the SPEA internship program. SPEA students may choose to pursue a minor from another school, department, or within SPEA in an area other than their degree or major/concentration. Students interested in a minor should contact that department for additional information. More information on SPEA-IUPUI policies covering independent study, internships and minors can be found at http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ . Double-Counting In Bloomington , the following course double-count policies are for admitted SPEA students only. Non-SPEAmajors cannot double count courses with any SPEA academic program. SPEA Minors: Admitted SPEA students earning a SPEA minor may double count up to six (6) credit hours of minor courses with any other SPEA academic program. Each SPEA minor must have at least nine (9) credit hours that do not count toward any other SPEA academic program. SPEA Certificates: Admitted SPEA students earning a SPEA certificate may double count up to six (6) credit hours of certificate requirements with any other SPEA academic program. The remianing SPEA certificate credit hours cannot be applied toward any other SPEA academic program. SPEA Double Majors: Admitted SPEA students earning two SPEA majors within the same degree may double count up to six (6) credit hours of major courses for both majors. Since, SPEA core courses are common to both majors, only specific to the majors (not core courses) are subject to the double- counting limit. Dual Degrees: Admitted SPEA students earning two SPEA degrees may double count up to six (6) credit hours of core or major courses for both degrees. For Indianapolis policies on double-counting, please go to SPEA-IUPUI bulletin at http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ .

In addition, a SPEA major GPA of 2.3 must be maintained in order to graduate. For students seeking certificates from SPEA, the minimum cumulative GPA requirement is a 2.0 or higher, and for students pursuing a minor the minimum cumulative GPA is a 2.3 or higher in all applicable course work. More information on Indianapolis grade polices can be found at http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ .August 5, 2013 9 Hours Requirements Students must successfully complete a minimum of 120 credit hours. However, the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science requires 122 credit hours. The campus at which a student completes the plurality of course work will award the degree, provided that campus is authorized to grant the degree/major/concentration and that the student has been admitted to that campus. Students may transfer no more than 90 credit hours (60 credits from a junior college) toward a Bachelor of Science degree or 30 credit hours toward an Associate of Science degree. Class standing, based on total credit hours that count toward minimum degree requirements, is as follows: senior, 86 or more; junior, 56-85; sophomore, 26-55; freshman, fewer than 26. Transfer Course Policy For the Indianapolis campus policies on transferring credits, please go to http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ . Degrees Awarded with Distinction SPEA recognizes outstanding performance by awarding bachelor's and associate degrees with three levels of distinction to students. The levels of distinction are as follows: highest: 3.90 and above high: 3.70 through 3.89 distinction: 3.50 through 3.69 Requirements for a Second Bachelor's Degree\u2014Bloomington and Indianapolis Students must petition for approval to work toward a second bachelor's degree. If permission is granted, students are required to take 30 credit hours beyond the credits used for the first bachelor's degree and satisfy all the requirements for the second degree. Generally, SPEA encourages students to work toward a graduate degree rather than a second bachelor's degree. Programs The Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs offers a wide range of undergraduate programs on the Bloomington-Indianapolis core campuses. The undergraduate degrees are the Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.), the Bachelor of Science in Public Health (B.S.P.H.), the Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice (B.S.C.J.), Bachelor of Science in Arts Management (B.S.A.M.) and, through a joint program with the College of Arts and Sciences, a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.). In addition, the undergraduate program includes minors and certificate programs. On July 1, 2008, the Divisions of Public and Environmental Affairs located on the Fort Wayne, Kokomo, Northwest (Gary), and East (Richmond) campuses became SPEA affiliated programs. As affiliated programs these divisions will continue to offer the SPEA curriculum approved for their campus; will continue to grant SPEA degrees to students who fulfill the necessary degree requirements; and will continue to use the SPEA name for academic purposes. Courses will continue to be transferable between the affiliated programs and the Bloomington-Indianapolis core campus programs. Not all degrees, minors, and certificates are offered at all campuses.

This bulletin has additional information specific to the IUPUI campus. Explore the IUPUI bulletin here: http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ Bloomington Campus Bachelor of Science in Arts Management (B.S.A.M.) Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.) Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.) Bachelor of Science in Public Health (B.S.P.H.) Minors Certificate Programs About the Bachelor of Science Degree Programs The School of Public and Environmental Affairs recognizes the complex problems facing our society such as global climate change, hazardous waste, escalating health care costs, balance of trade, and international relations. Through the four bachelor of science degree programs, the students develop problem-solving abilities and organizational skills so that they may contribute possible solutions to these and other problems. More than ever, people who take on leadership roles in society\u2014whether as professionals or volunteers\u2014 need formal training in managing staff, fiscal resources, information, public relations and marketing, and technology. With its focus on managing resources and solving problems, the Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.) degree prepares students for careers in diverse areas such as federal, state, and local politics and administration; public policy evaluation; management consulting; public relations; management of10 August 5, 2013 nonprofit organizations; and monitoring, assessment, and amelioration of environmental problems\u2014to name only a few. Majors in the degree program include: management, legal studies, public and nonprofit management, policy analysis, public financial management, and environmental management. Students who choose to continue with their education after earning an undergraduate degree frequently study law, planning, public affairs, environmental science, or business administration. There is a critical need for scientists who can incorporate their expertise into policies that address environmental concerns, such as global climate change, pollution of water and air, conservation of endangered species and habitats, urban sprawl, and human illnesses caused by environmental problems. To meet that need, the School of Public and Environmental Affairs and the College of Arts and Sciences developed the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.) degree, a unique cooperative program between two leading schools at Indiana University. Designed as a rigorous interdisciplinary science curriculum, the degree prepares students either for direct entry into an environmental science career or for graduate study in the traditional sciences or environmental science. Both government and private organizations are seeking ways to maintain or improve the quality of health care in the United States. At the same time, there is an increasing need to control skyrocketing costs. The Bachelor of Science in Public Health (B.S.P.H.) prepares students to meet those challenges. The Health Administration major prepares students for health management careers by developing their organizational, analytical, managerial, and leadership skills. Graduates often pursue careers in the public, private, or nonprofit sector in areas such as public health, environmental health, health administration, epidemiology, or health policy and planning. B.S.P.H. students have gone on for post- baccalaureate training in diverse areas such as public health, health administration, public affairs, law, business administration, and environmental science and policy. Now more than ever, institutions in the arts need a well trained, dedicated cadre of administrators able to navigate minefields underlying financial pressures, organizational constraints, and shifts in competitive entertainment, as well as consumer interest. The Bachelor of Science in Arts Management (B.S.A.M.) degree provides undergraduate students with the background and skills necessary to function in the management aspects of the arts industry. Graduates of this degree program are prepared to seek entry level careers in areas such as: development and donor relations, marketing, audience development and public relations, artistic direction and programming, financial management, volunteer coordination, arts education, public policy, and advocacy. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Public Affairs Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs The Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs requires 120 credit hours. The Bloomington campus offers six majors: Environmental Management, Legal Studies, Management, Policy Analysis, Public and Nonprofit Management, and Public Financial Management.DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The SPEA curriculum is divided into five categories\u2014 Common Ground, SPEA Preparation, Electives, Public Affairs Core, and a Major area.

(B) Indianapolis Campus Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A) Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice (B.S.C.J.) Minors Certificate Programs Indiana University founded the School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA) more than 40 years ago to prepare students to address the issues of modern society in ways that more traditional schools overlooked. At SPEA, people learn how to work in government, nonprofit and business roles to make positive changes in their communities, their states, their countries and the world. SPEA graduates lead the organizations that make and enforce laws, keep communities livable and safe, shape smart public policy, protect the planet and help our fellow citizens. Through the combined study of civic leadership, management, policy studies, public affairs and media, criminal justice and public safety, SPEA students develop both the practical and philosophical skills that prepare them to develop solutions to society's problems. SPEA Indianapolis offers two bachelor's degrees: a Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (BSPA) and a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice (BSCJ). Within the Public Affairs degree, you can major in Civic Leadership, Management, Media and Public Affairs, Policy Studies or Sustainable Management and Policy. BSPA students learn how to address issues in government and nonprofit settings and prepare to become leaders in their communities, organizations and businesses. Careers for SPEA graduates with a BSPA include legislative staffer, urban planner, director of a nonprofit, lobbyist or financial or policy analyst. Others work in public affairs or government affairs for private companies or nonprofits. Still other BSPA graduates continue their educations in law, planning, public affairs or environmental management. Within Criminal Justice, you can major in Criminal Justice or Public Safety Management. The Criminal Justice major gives students a broad and layered understanding of the history, operations and implications of criminal justice in America. You will be trained to address pressing societal needs related to law enforcement, the judicial system, corrections and national security. With a BSCJ in Criminal Justice, you might work in law enforcement management at the local, state and federal levels, as well as in the courts, prisons and victim advocacy programs. The Public Safety Management major covers the administration of emergency services, the principles of public safety and the art of decision-making. Public Safety Management graduates work in public safety agencies as well as private companies that focus on public management, emergency services, solid and hazardous waste management, public health and more. Both majors are also excellent preparation for pursuing graduate studies in law or criminal justice.More information can be found at http://bulletin.iupui.edu/ . Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Public Affairs Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.) may major in Civic Leadership, Media and Public Affairs, Management, Policy Studies, or Sustainable Management and Policy. Public Affairs majors focus on how we provide for our citizen, making our communities better places to live, work and raise a family. Public Affairs students study and analyze government policies, and learn how to manage government and nonprofit organizations. A Civic Leadership major teaches students how individuals and organizations can work together to provide for their communities. Graduates often work in public service roles - leading businesses, nonprofit organizations or government agencies. This major is ideal for pre-law student, or students interested in advocacy or community leadership. Media and Public Affairs gives students an in- depth understanding of governance plus the skills needed to use today's media to communicate to customers, constituents, employees, supporters, opponents and the many other audiences involved in shaping effective public policy. Students who major in Media and Public Affairs will be prepared for careers as public information officers; government affairs personnel for private or nonprofit organizations; public administrators at the local, state, and federal level; lobbyists; representatives of trade organizations; and reporters for various media on the subjects of public affairs, public administration, public policy personnel and decisions. This major teaches anyone who intends to go in to management (public, private or nonprofit) or who will work in the policy area, when and how to deploy traditional and new media tools to achieve their goals. A Management major teaches some of the things you'd learn in a business school, but you get the additional benefit of leaning how public agencies and nonprofit organizations operate. This holistic approach helps graduates move seamlessly between business, nonprofit and government management roles. A Policy Studies major prepares students to analyze and assess the usefulness of existing and proposed laws. This major emphasizes critical thinking skills. Graduates often go on to law school or directly into positions in government or government relations. A major gives students a solid understanding of public affairs, finance, policy-making and civic engagement, combined with specialized classes in the principles of sustainability, environmental justice and green technologies.
