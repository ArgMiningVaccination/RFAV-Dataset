By 2003, she walked regularly with a cane, had given up virtually all unnecessary physical activity, and was on numerous medications, all with horrible side effects. After stumbling upon some studies that linked MS outcomes to diet and lifestyle, Dr. Stancic undertook a radically different approach to managing her illness. Within a relatively short time period, she was off all MS medications, walking normally, resumed dancing, and in 2010, she ran a marathon! Today, she lives an active, symptom-free life and takes no medications for multiple sclerosis. Now, in What's Missing from Medicine: Six Lifestyle Changes to Overcome Chronic Illness, Dr. Stancic shares her own inspiring story and explains the incredible power that specific lifestyle changes can have for those living with chronic illness. Her prescription to prevent, treat, and even reverse chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis, and many others, is what listeners will find in this audiobook. Dr. Stancic is also highly critical of the medical community's lack of success when it comes to treating chronic illness, and that's why What's Missing from Medicine is both a prescription for a better life for each of us, as well as a clarion call for the medical establishment to make these lifestyle changes an integral part of the practice of medicine.

The book itself is excellent. The content is interesting and it is well written. Unfortunately, the narration takes away from the content. Maybe the narrator is new, but poor inflection and so many mispronounced words made it difficult to focus on the content. This will be the first book I have returned due to the narration. 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - Anonymous User - 02-20-21 The future of medicine! Dr Stancic shows medics and patients how to effective combat chronic disease. 70% worldwide and 89% of all UK deaths alone are caused by preventable, lifestyle related chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, some cancers and much more. Until we continue to treat only the symptoms of diseases instead of the root cause of the disease: lifestyle and nutrition we will continue to fail our patients and feed them into the hands of the current pharmageddon & crippling life long diseases which steal our patients present years which they will have to live in a sick and crippled body and their future because they will die many years before their time. As doctors, it is time that we wake up, and start demanding that our patients heal under our care instead of just get by. Dr Stancic has raised the bar, and even took the time to spell it out for us in an easy to digest book that lovely to listen to as well as full of the scientific evidence we demand in our profession with humility that is a lost art in our current clinical practice. Now all we need to do is follow in her lead! I sure am, because our patients deserve the care, love and healing Dr Stancic lays out here and that which O see in my patients when I apply the Lifestyle Medicine treatment and a whole food plant based diet. Thank you Dr Stancic! Brilliant book, that I hope all of our colleagues will read, and then they share with all of their patients in every speciality at every level we must unite to spread this knowledge if we want to make a real difference! 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - Abi Nimmo - 07-06-21 One Day All the Detail in This Book Will Be Common Sense Thank you Drs Stancic and Ornish. I am a Biomedical Scientist, a Health Professional and I also happen to have MS. For years I believed in \"modern medicine\", now I see the common sense route to a positive, healthy life is only achievable via a healthy lifestyle. Modern medicine has its place, but not for long term chronic conditions such as MS. Common sense... Of course animal proteins and fats are seriously detrimental to health, particularly dairy! No one can surely look at a block of cheese and consider consuming even a fraction of it to be healthy? With all the antibiotics in livestock to fatten them up, speed up growth, healthy, really? Look up gut health, use of antibiotics and links to obesity. Cortisone (stress hormone) in all animals organic/non organic, healthy? Most livestock go to the same awful abattoirs whether organic or battery after all. I have been living on a whole food plant based diet for 6 years now and I am the healthiest I ever been. I am nearly 50, and feel much better physically than when I was in my 20s. All it takes is a small change in diet, eliminate all animal products, increase in activity *move, dance, play!* better sleep, drink more water and love yourself/others... socialise! I would like the world to know the detail contained in this book, an easier read than the 'China Study'. We are conditioned to eating animal products in our early childhood. Arguably conditioned to poor health at a very early age. We have long believed our health is down to our genes. Our father, grandmother had heart disease therefore it's inevitable. Well, if you have the same lifestyle yes, but if you don't the likelihood becomes significantly less. Given how detrimental animal products are to health, should we be allowing our children to consume them at all?
