Compounding provides access to medication for patients who may not be able to use commercially available formulations due to dosing requirements, allergies or rare diseases. Medications that are required to be sterile include those administered through injection, intravenous infusion (IV), intraocular (injection in the eye) or intrathecal (injection in the spine). Understanding the risks inherent in sterile compounding and incorporating established standards are essential for patient safety. Compounded medications made without the guidance of standards may be sub-potent, super potent or contaminated, exposing patients to significant risk of adverse events or even death. USP develops standards for preparing compounded sterile medications to help ensure patient benefit and reduce risks such as contamination, infection or incorrect dosing.
