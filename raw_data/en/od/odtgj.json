We are excited that you are a student in our professional program and I want to provide for you some information that I hope will be of assistance to you during your academic journey with us. A very important person during your time with us is your advisor. This individual is available to assist you in planning your program of studies and answer questions about future career options. I urge you to meet regularly with your advisor especially if you have any questions, concerns or need help with any academic, College, or campus issues. Faculty and staff are prepared to work with you on an individual basis and help guide you through your journey with us. Addi tional career information can also be found in our Administrative Offices, in Fargo - Sudro 123, in Bismarck -130B, and by attending our Annual Career Fair in September at the Fargodome. The professional curriculum is designed to challenge you and to teach you to become an independent learner and to work in collaborative teams. Therefore, students are expected to take a very active role in their education and take responsibility for their own learning. Student active learning is a major emphasis of our program. You will be asked to apply your knowledge, dig for the answers to questions, communicate both verbally and in writing, critically think and problem -solve through case discussions, practice team -based care with students from other disciplines, and part icipate in numerous experiential activities. I encourage you to ask questions in class and to learn by understanding and applying the material presented rather than by simply memorizing factual information. The goal of our curriculum is for you to achieve the necessary life- long learning skills which will become important to you in your future career as a health professional to be able to \"keep up\" with the plethora of new information associated with our rapidly changing health care system. Your ultimate su ccess will be determined by the amount of effort you are willing to put into your academic studies. So work hard and give your best effort in all that you do. If you give us your best, you will receive the best in your educational experience with us. We d esire to provide a positive learning environment for all students here within the College and we strive to continually improve our program. Students are a very important part of this process and we actively solicit your input and active participation through various formats. Students are elected from each class to serve on the Dean's Student Liaison Committee. This committee meets with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development throughout the year to bring student concerns to the attention of the administration. In addition, the College holds a Deans' Open Forum each semester to allow students an opportunity to interact directly with the Dean (and his administrative leadership team) on matters of interest and concern to students. And I als o want you to know that my door is always open to you, so please don't hesitate to stop by my office if you need my assistance for anything. We encourage you to use these sources as well as visits with faculty, or any of the members of the staff in our Adm inistrative Offices whenever you have issues that need to be brought to our attention. In addition, I encourage you to become actively involved with your profession by joining one of our student professional organizations. This is a great way to learn about what's going on within your profession and begin contributing to the advancement of your future professional career and practice. This \"Handbook\" is devoted to academic information to help enhance student success within our program. We hope you find it helpful to you. I wish you much success in your educational pursuits with us and in your later professional practice. Best wishes to you for a successful year! Charles D. Peterson, Pharm.D. Dean, NDSU College of Health Professions 4 GENERAL FAQ AN INFORMAL GUIDE: The following is a series of informal responses to questions most frequently asked about rules and procedures at NDSU. For further information, please refer to the current NDSU Bulletin ( www.nd su.edu/bulletin/ ), your adviser, Administrative Office in Sudro 123, the Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110, or One Stop in the Memorial Union. ACADEMIC ADVISERS Who is my adviser? Students in the pre- pharmacy and professional pharmacy program are assigned an adviser. It is important to meet with your adviser on a regular basis to receive updated curricular information. Advisers help students learn how to complete the registration procedures. Students are responsible for the course and pro gram selections which they make. However, an adviser is a valuable source for acquiring information about the advisability of student choices. (If you desire a change of adviser, please contact the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development , School of Pharmacy , 231- 7601.) Do I need to see my adviser about my semester schedule? Yes, make an appointment with your adviser during advising week to plan your schedule of classes. Dates for advising and registration are available on the Office of Registration & Records web site ( www.ndsu.edu/registrar ) and \"The Spectrum,\" published twice per week when full semester classes are in session. CREDITS How many credits do I need to be a Sophomore, a Junior and a Senior? You need 27 credits to be classified as a Sophomore, 60 credits to be classified as a Junior, and 90 credits to be classified as a Senior. To graduate, you must successfully complete all general education requirements, the requirements in your major, and with a minimum of 2.0 grade point average. A complete list of University requirements for graduation is in the current NDSU Bulletin. What is the limit on the number of credits I can take per semester? Full-time students will carry from 15 to 19 credits per Semester. Registration for more than 20 credits is not recommended. Special permission from your adviser and a grade point average of at least 3.0 are required to register for more than 20 credits. You must obtain a \"Petition to Enr oll in More Than 20 Credits\" form under the link, \"Over 20 Credits Petition,\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . How many credits will I lose when I transfer to NDSU from another school? Ordi narily you shouldn't lose any. However, a \"D\" grade in any course does not transfer to the College of Health Professions . Some technical courses may not fit your degree program and in this case some extra work may be required. For evaluation of transfer credit see current NDSU Bulletin. How many credits can I transfer from a junior or community college? All college -level credits from regionally accredited institutions transfer; however, not all may apply to the particular degree program you have selected. To obtain a baccalaureate degree you must complete at least 60 semester credits at a four year college or university. At least the last 37 of these credits must be at the junior or senior level. (See current Bulletin.) 5 How do I challenge a course? A student who is currently registered may seek credit by challenging a course. A course challenge usually consists of a special comprehensive examination; however, additional types of performance may be required for some courses. A course challenge is only permitt ed for courses in which the student has not received transfer credit or has no previous academic record. Prior registrations are allowable if course was dropped prior to the No Record Drop deadline in a given term. Student must be registered at NDSU during the semester in which you wish to challenge a course (see current NDSU Bulletin for complete descriptions) . Procedures for pursuing a course challenge may be found at: www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/registrar/forms/challenge.pdf Is it possible to obtain college credits by taking examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board (CLEP and AP)? Yes. Students may demonstrate evidence of college- level achievement through the use of nat ionally standardized tests. Competency to write these examinations may have been gained through intensive preparation in high school, extensive reading in a particular field, or other types of formal or informal preparation. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course that has been previously taken or failed at NDSU or another accredited institution. Score reports must be sent directly to NDSU from the awarding agency/board. School reports and student -issued grade reports are not considered official for purposes of awarding credit by examination. DEGREES (CURRICULUM REQUIREMENT) How do I petition for a waiver or substitution of a curriculum requirement? To petition, you must obtain a \"Request to Waive or Substitute Courses\" form under the link, \"Substitute/Waive a Course\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . In this petition, which is presented to the Academic Affairs Committee of the College of Health Professions , you state exactly why you th ink you should have a waiver. The Committee will review your petition and you will be notified of their decision. (Petitions should be submitted only when special circumstances make it virtually impossible for you to meet the regular degree requirements. ) Only departmental and college requirements may be waived. University requirements may not be waived. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Who must complete the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements apply to all students. What are the General Education Requirements? The General Education Require ments are listed in the current NDSU Bulletin. A list of the courses approved for the different categories is provided at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/academics/gened. General Education tr ansfer with the ND University System. Students who plan to transfer from one institution to another in the ND University System should check with Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110 or One Stop in the Memorial Union. GRADES AND ACADEMIC STATUS What is the G.P.A.? Grade Point Average. For each credit of \"A\" you receive four (4) honor points; three (3) for each credit of \"B\"; two (2) for each credit of \"C\"; one (1) for each credit of \"D\"; and zero (0) for each credit taken in which a grade of \" F\" is received. The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of honor points earned at NDSU by the total number of credit hours in which honor points were recorded. For example, a person with a G.P.A. of 3.00 has a grade average of \"B.\" The minimum GPA of 2.00 is required for graduation. Developmental courses do not count toward graduation requirements. 6 If I do not do well in a course, may I take it over again? Yes. The second grade, whether higher or lower , will replace the first grade in com puting the GPA. Both grades are listed on your Permanent Record. To replace a grade for a course taken at NDSU, that course MUST be repeated at NDSU. The one exception is that NDSU students may register for a Tri -College course to repeat a course previo usly taken at NDSU. NOTE: PROFESSIONAL COURSES IN THE PHARMACY PROGRAM - please refer to Policy #3.24, Repetition of Professional Courses, in the College Policy Manual . NOTE: PRE-PHARMACY CORE COURSES, Policy #2.21.1 - The total number of pre- pharmacy core courses which may be repeated shall be limited to three. The grade received during the student's final attempt for any core pre- pharmacy course will be used in evaluation for admission. A withdrawal is not considered an attempt. A core course is one that is included in the GPA for admission purposes. CURRENT COMPETENCY, Policy #2.28 - Coursework in the areas of science and mathematics must be no more than seven years old at the time of application to the professional program. Coursework presented in these areas that is older than seven years must have current competency demonstrated. Current competency may be demonstrated by a) retaking a portion of the series in question, i.e. 122 of 121/122 Chem series; b) enrolling in a formal audit that is indicat ed on a student's official transcript; c) challenging coursework through the department in question; or d) meeting with faculty in the areas of Science or Mathematics and having them determine current competency. Students who intend to meet current competency requirements using item c or d must receive approval from the Chair of Pharmacy Admissions Committee prior to undertaking the current competency. (This coursework does not fall under the rule, \"Repetition of Pre- Pharmacy Core Courses.) Will I receive mid -term grades? Upon request, all instructors shall inform students directly of their approximate mid- term grades before the end of the eighth week of the semester. MAJOR/MINOR How do I change my major? Occasionally students find they are not suited f or a particular field. If you decide to change majors while you are a student in the College, you are expected to follow this procedure: discuss it with your adviser, fill out the electronic form \"Major/Minor and Adviser Change Form,\" www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . You will be assigned a new adviser in the field in which you will be majoring. Once you select a major, you must transfer to the college that offers the major.

The College does not permit any course required with name and number to be taken pass/fail, with the exception of labs offered only this way. Course work utilized for NDUS general education credits must be taken for a letter grade. 13 PRE-PHARMACY & PROFESSIONAL PHARMACY MAJORS The faculty reserve the right to change rules and regulations including those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Such changes m ay apply to prospective students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a timely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contact their advis er or the Dean's Office to obtain current policies. PREREQUISITES FOR PROFESSIONAL COURSES POLICY 3. 23 Prerequisites for all courses taught in the professional curriculum are to be established by the faculty and any changes made in prerequisites for professional program must be approved by the faculty. All prerequisite course work in the professional program, whether offered from within or without the College of Health Professions, must be completed with a minimum grade of C in order for the student to progress. It is the responsibility of individual course instructors to check and enforce their own course prerequisites. PROFESSIONAL DRESS POLICY 3.09 Professionalism is a core value of our program. Students are expected to dress appropriately during the laboratory and experiential components of the professional program in order to promote and maintain a positive professional image. In addition, appropriate professional clothing is to be worn when representing the College at professional out -reach activities. Violations of the College or depart mental dress code may result in sanctions per College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Poli cy. Students should refer to their respective department or affiliated clinical/experiential dress code policy for further details. PROFESSIONAL ELECTIVES POLICY 3.26 A minimum of six professional elective course credits, that permit exploration of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest, are required for graduation with the entry -level Pharm.D. degree. Professional elective courses are subject to the fol lowing rules . (Note : Students who were admitted before Fall Semester 2017 are required to complete four credits.) 1. Professional elective courses must be taken while enrolled in the entry -level Pharm.D. program (e.g. beginning Fall Semester P1 year). These courses must be completed prior to the beginning of the P4 year. 2. Professional elective courses must be taken for a letter grade, and a grade of C or better is required to meet the requirements. 3. The pre- approved professional elective courses are listed be low. 4. A student may take a professional elective course that is not included in the pre- approved list only after (1) consultation with his/her academic advisor, AND (2) approval of the course by the Pharm.D. Curriculum Committee. The necessary steps to ta ke a course that is not included in the pre- approved professional elective course list is as follows: 1. The student must meet with his/her advisor and demonstrate that the course \"permits exploration of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest \". This request must be made to the advisor by December 1st for upcoming spring semester courses, and April 1st for upcoming summer and fall semester courses. 2. If the advisor supports the student's elective course choice, then the advisor shall petition to the chair of the Curriculum Committee to approve the course. 14 3. Curriculum Committee will obtain a syllabus for review and contact the instructor to address other criteria as needed. 4. Upon receipt of all required information, the Curriculum Committee shall review the information, determine the status of the request, and inform the student, and advisor, of the outcome of the petition. 5. If the Curriculum Committee approves the course, the course shall be included in future revisions of the pre- approved prof essional elective course list.

NDSU provides professional liability insurance coverage for all students in experiential rotations in amounts up to $1,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 aggregate (North Dakota Risk Management Fund: NDCC Ch.32- 12.2). Students who work may wish to purchase additional coverage because this insurance only covers educational endeavors. REPETITION OF PRE -PHARMACY CORE COURSE S POLICY 2.21.1 The total number of pre- pharmacy core courses which may be repeated shall be limited to three. The grade received during the student's final attempt for any core pre- pharmacy course will be used in evaluation for admission. A withdrawal is not considered an attempt. A core course is one that is included in the GPA for admission purposes. REPETITION OF PROFESSIONAL PHARMACY COURSES POLICY 3.24 The total number of professional pharmacy course repeats due to failure (i.e., grade less than a C) is limited to three (3). Withdrawal (for reasons other than extenuating conditions*) from a professional pharmacy course with a grade less than a C is considered the same as a failure. A fourth occurrence of receiving a grade less than a C (or withdrawal due to a grade less than a C) in a professional pharmacy course will result in termination from the pharmacy program. *All extenuating circumstances must be approved by the Senior Associate Dean before the withdrawal takes place. 16 SCHOLARSHIPS AND AWARDS The College of Health P rofessions has a limited number of scholarships and awards avail able for assistance to students. Applications for scholarships and awards are available beginning with the second Monday in April and ending on the Friday after spring graduation: (www.ndsu.edu/ healthprofessions ). NOTE: Specific information related to criteria for selection of scholarship recipients is available in the Office of Development in Sudro Hall 120. STATUS DOCUMENTATION POLICY 3.06 Upon acceptance to a professional program housed in the College of Health Professions, students may be required to submit documentation of health status. Programs will define their own documentation requirements and include those requirements in their program handbook(s). Examples of documentation may include, but are not limited to: Record of immunizations or other immunity for influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, poliomyelitis, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B tuberculin testing Phys ical examination by the student's health care provider (MD, DO, NP) within one year Allergies Health problems that may be of significance in clinical practice Permission to release information to clinical agencies Affirmation of veracity of the record Health status documentation to be completed by the student and his/her health care provider will be provided to the student. Documentation must be submitted to the student's professional program designee as indicated in student's program handbook. If required by the professional program, tuberculin testing must be done annually and the report submitted to the appropriate department. The expense of the physical examination and any needed immunizations is the student's responsibility. STUDENT ACADEMIC AND CONDUCT STANDARDS POLICY 3.01 (revised April 29, 2015) Introduction The mission of the NDSU College of Health Professions is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, a llied sciences , and public health . The College has established professionalism and ethics as two of its core values. Pharmacists, nurses, allied health care professionals, public health professionals, and pharmaceutical scientists must live up to the high ideals of their profession. Their lives must be guided by the principles of honesty and integrity, in order to ensure that the public can regard their words and actions as unquestionably trustworthy. To develop an understanding of and respect for these principles of honesty and integrity as applied to the academic work of pharmacy, nursing, allied science, and public health students, the College of Health Professions has developed this student conduct policy. This policy is applicable to anyone enrolled as a student in the College, including those in the pre- professional, professional, and graduate programs. This policy also applies to any student taking a course for credit in the College. Acceptance of this policy is required as a condition of admission to the College. 17 Academic Standards The academic standards of the College of Health Professions differ from those of the University. Any student who fails to meet or exceed the University standards may be placed on University probation or suspension (see the current NDSU Bulletin for univ ersity information on academic deficiencies). Semester Grade Point Average (All Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all undergraduate and professional students shall maintain a semester grade point average of 2.00 or above f or each semester enrolled in the College of Health Professions . All graduate students are expected to maintain a 3.0 grade point average as well as any other academic policies outlined by the graduate school. Any student who fails to attain a semester G PA of 2.0 or above may be placed on College warning or probation. Students who have been placed on academic warning or probation for two (2) consecutive or three (3) non- consecutive semesters shall be suspended from enrollment in the College. After two suspensions, students will be terminated from the College. (Termination from the College does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the University provided the academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exc eeded.) A student who is suspended and desires readmission into the College must file a request for re- admittance with the Senior Associate Dean at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the semester in which readmission is sought. In addition, professi onal students must seek readmission to the professional programs in Pharmacy, Nursing , Allied Sciences , and Public Health through the Admissions Committee of their respective program. Minimum Grade Requirement (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in the professional programs of the College must complete all required courses within the College with a grade of \"C\" or above. Students are encouraged to refer to program - specific policies related to minimum grade requirements which can be found in the College Policy Manual at: http://www.ndsu.edu/ healthprofessions /college_information/policy_manual/ . Graduate students are expected to uphold policies and procedures consistent with the graduate school a nd to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Students Enrolled in College Affiliated Educational Training Programs (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in College affiliated internships, clinical , or experiential training programs are also required to uphold the academic standards of that affiliate and will be subject to the terms of probation, suspension, and termination of the affiliated program. Students failing to meet affiliated program academic standards may also lead to termination from the College. Conduct Standards High standards of professional conduct are expected from all students, both to facilitate the learning of all students and to promote professional values. Individuals are expected to represent the College, professional program, or profession in a positive, professional manner. Students conducting clinical experiences, rotations, and/or internships must also uphold the specific policies of their clinical site. All students are held responsible for exhibiting the following professional attributes: honesty, integrity, accountability, confidentiality, and professional demeanor. Academic dishonesty and professional misconduct are unacceptable. If there is doubt about whether or not academic or professional conduct is appropriate, individuals should query the Dean's Office. Examples of unprofessional conduct include, but are not limited to, the following: Academic Misconduct: 1. Cheating, includes but is not limited to, the following: a. The receipt, possession, or use of any material or assistance not authorized by the instructor in the preparation of papers, reports, examinations, or any class assignments to be submitted for credit as part of a course or to be submitted to fulfill Coll ege requirements. b. Arranging to have others take examinations or complete assignments (i.e., papers, reports, laboratory data, or products) for oneself, unauthorized collaborating with another student on individual assignments, or doing academic work for another student. 18 c. Stealing or otherwise improperly obtaining, unauthorized copies of an examination or assignment before or after its administration, and/or passing it onto other students. d. Copying, in part or in whole, exams or assignments that will be kept by the instructor and are handed out in class only for review purposes. e. Knowingly submitting a paper, report, presentation, examination, or any class assignment that has been altered or corrected, in part or in whole, for reevaluation or re- grading, without the instructor's permission. f. Misrepresenting your attendance or the attendance of others in a course or practical experience where credit is given and/or a mandatory attendance policy is in effect. g. Plagiarism: Submitting work that is, in part or in whole , not entirely the student's own, without attributing such portions to their correct sources. Unauthorized collaboration with another student and representing it as one's own individual work is also considered plagiarism. Ignorance is NOT an excuse. h. Fabri cation: falsifying data in scientific/clinical research, papers, and reports. i. Aiding or abetting dishonesty: Knowingly giving assistance not authorized by the instructor to another in the preparation of papers, reports, presentations, examinations, or laboratory data and products. 2. Utilization of a false/misleading illness or family emergency to gain extension and/or exemption on assignments and tests. 3. Violation of any IRB and/or University research processes. Professional Misconduct 1. Violation of conduct described in course policies or articulated by the instructor in writing. 2.

Failure to deal with professional, staff, and peer members of the health care team in a considerate manner and with a spirit of cooperation. 7. Unprofessional dress (as outlined in the professional program, class and/or clinical agency policies) during classes, clinical experiences, or when representing the College of Health Professions . 8. Bringing family members, guests, and pets to the classroom or any professional academic activities witho ut prior consent of the instructor. 9. Falsifying applications, forms, documents, reports, or records of any kind or providing false information to the University personnel prior to admission to the College, or while an active member of the College's academic programs. 10. Unauthorized accessing or revealing of confidential information about faculty, staff, or students of the College and University. 11. Violation of patient respect and confidentiality in any practice/learning setting. 12. Theft, damaging, defacing, or unauthorized use of any property of the College, University, or training sites. 13.

Students are required to report any academic misconduct to the Senior Associate Dean within 7 days of the occurrence. Failure of the student to report violations within the required time could result in immediate expulsion from the College and/or its programs. Graduate students must also report to the Department Chair of the graduate program. 2. The course instructor who suspects that academic misconduct has occurred in their course or other instructional context has an initial responsibility to: a) inform the student(s) involved of his /her suspicion and the suspicion's grounds; b) allow a fair opportunity for the student to respond; and c) make a fair and reasonable judgment as to whether any academic misconduct occurred. 3. The course instructor will report academic misconduct violations to their Department Chair within 7 days of the occurrence or di scovery of the misconduct. 4. The Department Chair will report the academic misconduct to the Senior Associate Dean. Professional Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any professional misc onduct to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 days of the occurrence. Failure of the student to report violations within the required time could result in immediate expulsion from the College and/or its programs. 2. Faculty members are required to report unprofessional conduct within the classroom setting. Similarly, other College personnel are required to report professional misconduct issues as they arise and which directly affect their daily professional activities. 3. The faculty member/College personnel will report professional misconduct violations to their Department Chair within 7 days of the occurrence or discovery of the misconduct. 4. The Department Chair will report the professional misconduct to the Associate Dean f or Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 days of the discovery of the misconduct. 5. If a faculty member is aware that a student has violated the Conduct Policy outside of the classroom, he/she should remind the student of the policy and direct the student to self - report any professional misconduct violations to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 days of the occurrence. Disciplinary Sanctions Academic Misconduct 1. The course instructor is responsible for determining the sanction for academic misconduct in the course. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, failure for a particular assignment, test, or course. 2. The course instructor will inform the student of the sanction in writing by completing the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form as per University Policy 335 and submitting it to the student and the Department Chair. 3. The Department Chair will submit a copy of the form to the Senior Associate Dean. 4. The Senior Associate Dean will submit the form to the Registrar and Provost/VPAA in accordance with University Policy 335. In the case of graduate student academic misconduct, the Dean of the College of Graduate & Interdisciplinary Studies must also receive a copy of the completed Student Academic Miscond uct Tracking form. 5. A copy of the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form will be placed in the student's academic file. Professional Misconduct 1. Professional misconduct issues may be more likely to happen outside of the classroom and have broader implications for the well -being of students, faculty, and staff in the College. Hence, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development has the initial and primary responsibility for administering and enforcing professional misconduct issues. 2. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development will work collaboratively with the Department Chair (and where appropriate, individual instructors) to resolve professional misconduct issues. Department and College Related Sanctions Additional academic and/or professional disciplinary sanctions for the department/program may be assigned by the Department Chair depending upon the circumstances and nature of the misconduct. The Department Administrator will notify the student in writing of the sanction and rights to due process and 20 forward a copy to the Senior Associate Dean &/or Associate Dean for Student Af fairs and Faculty Development. The Senior Associate Dean may impose additional disciplinary sanctions for the College and will notify the student in writing and the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (if a graduate student involved). Disciplinary action for academic and professional misconduct will depend based upon the seriousness of the misconduct. In general, sanc tions may include, but are not l imited to, any of the following: 1. Probation 2. Supervised probation 3. Suspension from the College. 4. Termination from the College. (Termination from the College of Health Professions does not prohibit the student from registering el sewhere in the University provided the academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) In cases of particularly egregious or multiple instances of academic/professional misconduct, the Dean of the College may also r ecommend expulsion from the university. Student's Right to Appeal Students sanctioned for violations of the College Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy have the right to appeal. Student appeals must follow the appeal procedure outlined below. Graduate student appeals of sanctions involving academic misconduct must be filed in accordance with the Graduate Student Appeals policy described in the NDSU Graduate Bulletin. Pre-professional/Professional Student Appeal s Procedure 1. If the student choos es to appeal a course instructor's sanction, it must be pursued in the following sequence: course instructor, Department Chair, Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development or Senior Associate Dean, and Dean. 2. Department and College related sanctions may be appealed to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (Professional Misconduct), Senior Associate Dean (Academic Misconduct), followed by the Dean. 3. In cases of sanctions involving College suspension or termination, the appeal will follow the process outlined in University Policy 335: Code of Academic Responsibility and Conduct. 4. An appeal for any sanction must be made in writing within 15 business days of the sanction letter. The date of the letter shall be the date the letter is postmarked. If hand- delivered, a notation of that date will be made in the student's file. 5. Appeal letters must specify in detail one or more of the following bases of appeal: a. the sanction was too severe for the offense; b. the decision for non- action/action/sanction was made in an arbitrary or capricious manner; c. the finding of the Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy having been violated was not substantiated by evidence, and/or d. the student's/student organization's rights were violated (specify those rights believed to have been violated). Appeal Review Process (Pre -professional and Professional Students) 1. Appeals made to the Senior Associate Dean or Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development will be reviewed by the Academic Affairs Committee or Student Affairs Committee of the College depending upon the conduct violation in question. 2. The Academic Affairs/Student Affairs Committee will review the written letter of appeal from the student/organization and the materials from t he original adjudication process. After reviewing these materials, the committee may decide to do one of the following: a. issue a decision based solely on the written materials; b. issue a decision based on a review of written materials and discussion with the involved principals; c. recall one or more witnesses; d. refer the decision to the full faculty for action; e. return the case for reconsideration of the decision and/or sanctions. 3. The Academic Affairs/Student Affairs Committee may uphold or lessen the original decision/sanction but not increase the sanctions/actions imposed by other persons or bodies. 4. The decision of the committee will generally be issued within 15 working days of the receipt of the appeal letter, but may take longer during University recesses, or in the event of complex cases. 5. The Registrar will be advised of the results of the appeal. 21 Unresolved Appeals After the College appeals process has been completed, if the student/organization is not satisfied with the appeal decision, the student/organ ization has the right to appeal the decision to the Provost. The Provost will make the final decision on any appeals. Incomplete Disciplinary Process Students with pending disciplinary or legal actions, with sanctions for which an appeal has been submitted but not resolved, or whose sanctions have not been successfully fulfilled, will not be allowed to graduate from NDSU with a degree, major, or program of study offered by the College of Health Professions . In such cases, the College reserves the right to place a hold on a student's graduation until the case has been successfully resolved and the sanctions have been successfully fulfilled. Annual Pledge and Signature I have read and understand the above policy and I agree to accept and abide by this Stude nt Academic and Conduct Standards Policy of the College of Health Professions . I understand that violations of this policy and sanctions imposed, as well as information used to substantiate v iolations (i.e., criminal background checks), may be shared with College affiliated educational training programs. I am also aware of and assume responsibility for following other College and Department policies as stated in the student handbook. Revised: May 14, 2008, April 15, 2009, April 21, 2011, October 7, 2013, April 29, 2015 Source: Faculty Meeting Minutes STUDENT COMPLAINT POLICY 3.28 The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), at the behest of the U.S. Secretary of Education, requires all accredited pharmacy programs to establish, implement and assess a formal complaint policy for students. More specifically, all accredited colleges or schools of pharmacy must establish a comprehensive policy with a simple set of procedures whereby all students enrolled in the College (and the pharmacy program in particular) can submit and resolve a complaint about the educational process. While such procedures do not always produce an outcome that meets the student's preferences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitable and efficient means to remediate their complaints. The complete set of ACPE standards regarding student complaint policies can be found on pages 38-39 (Standard 20) of the following website: http://www .acpe- accredit.org/pdf/FinalS2007Guidelines2.0.pdf . The NDSU College of Health Professions takes student complaints very seriously. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a manner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. To that end, a copy of the NDSU College of Health Professions policy relating to this issue is available on its website at www.ndsu.edu/ healthprofessions . Students who have difficulty accessing this webpage may also obtain a copy of the complaint policy in the Dean's Office (Sudro Hall 123). A discussion of this policy shall take place annually during the orientation process for first professional year students. Each student complaint will be appropriately documented and investigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the nature of the complaint, written records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution process shall be maintained in the Office of the Dean of the School of Pharmacy, and shall be available for review by ACPE or its representatives upon written request or in the process of an on- site evaluation visit. Student complaints generally fall within two major categories: complaints about unfai r grading and all other, non- grade- related complaints. Student complaints about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually administered through the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. 22 Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy 337 NDSU has an established policy regarding complaints about grading, otherwise known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal policy , which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/337.pdf . While students actively considering a grade appeal are referred to the aforementioned website for the specific details of the policy, a summary of the policy is outlined below. With the exception of incomplete grades, a course grade is considered final unless an appropriate appeal is filed by the student. Grade changes are also considered only for those students who have not yet earned a degree for which the course in question was applied. For a student who has reason to believe that they have been issued an incorrect or inappropriate grade, he/she must initiate a request for a change of a grade with the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semester immediately following the semester in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made within fifteen (15) instructional days of the start of Fall Semester . A grade appeal is formally initiated when the student presents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor. If there is an unsatisfactory decision, the student must consult the Department Head, and the Dean or a designated college committee, proceeding from one level to the next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflict at that level. In the event that the instructor is also the Department Head or Dean, he or she need only be consulted in the capacity of instruct or. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit a formal written appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) instructional days after conclusion of the college proceedi ngs as stated above. Non-Grade Student Complaints Pre-professional and professional pharmacy students who have a non- grade- related complaint can seek resolution of that complaint through the following procedures. It is important to note that these proced ures represent the sole avenue for student complaints regarding non- grade- related issues, including (but not limited to) ACPE standards, policies and procedures. Additionally, because the pharmacy program spans multiple departments, the non- grade complaint s are handled through the Dean's Office, rather than by the departments themselves . 1. The student(s) or, in cases where student anonymity is required, their advocate (also known as the \"plaintiff(s)\") will file a formal written complaint (delivered through the postal service or NDSU email) to the Dean's Office in the NDSU College of Health Professions . 2. The written complaint must include a description of the policy, procedure or ACPE standard in question. It must also summarize the argument of the plaintiff (including the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable amount of evidence supporting the claim. 3. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the complaint will be assigned to either the Senior Associate Dean ( as the Chair of the College Academic Affairs Committee) if the complaint is primarily academic in nature, or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development (as the Chair of the College Student Affairs Committee) if the complaint is primarily non- academic. The plaintiff(s) will receive email notification (via NDSU email) within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the complaint concerning the identity of the Associate Dean handling the complaint. 4. The Senior Associate Dean (or, if a non- academic issue, Associ ate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development ) shall convene a meeting of College Academic (or, if a non- academic issue, Student) Affairs Committee to review the complaint. Because the procedures for both Associate Deans and Committees are similar in procedure, they will henceforth be referred to generically as \"Associate Dean\" and \"Committee\", respectively. The Committee meeting shall occur within thirty days from the time that the Associate Dean receives the written complaint. 23 5. Once the Com mittee has met, the Associate Dean shall prepare and submit a formal, written reply to the student(s) based on the recommendation of Committee. The reply shall include an evaluation of the complaint, a description of any violations, and a proposal for any necessary corrective action. The reply will be sent through official NDSU delivery methods (i.e., the postal service, campus mail and/or the NDSU email system) within fifteen business days from the time that the Committee makes a decision. 6. Decisions of the Committee that demonstrate arbitrary and capricious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the plaintiff(s) may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU College of Health Professions . In such cases, the student(s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and provide evidence indicating that the Associate Dean and/or the Committee acted in an arbitrary , capricious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 7. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substantiating the claim of unfair treatment at prior procedural levels. STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDARDS (PHARM.D) POLICY 3.29 The Nort h Dakota State University College of Health Professions' mission is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences , and public health. As a corollary to this mission, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D. ) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligible for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, the Pharm.D. professional program requires students to undertak e the full set of activities that are necessary to complete their program of study. The goal of every licensed pharmacist is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals must have the physical, cognitive and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's profession. Failure to demonstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmacist's care, but also impacts the ability of other providers to pr ovide safe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following technical standards represent competencies necessary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provides additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or without reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Students who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligible for admission or progression in the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy (Pha rm.D.) professional program. The technical standard competencies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities 5. Behavioral and Socia l Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and mental abilities to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large- group lectures Small group discussions and presentations One -on-one interactions 24 Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a distance or close at hand) Procedures 2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communicate effectively and effic iently (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing strategies with faculty members, other members of the healthcare team, patients, families, and other students, in order to: Produce written and oral communication Elicit information Convey in formation Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeutic relationships Demonstrate computer literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient motor function, skills, and tactile abilit y to execute basic tasks in the training and provision of patient care. This includes coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision in order to: Attend and participate in classes , groups, and activities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non- sterile compounding. Demonstrate aseptic technique. Examine patients (including inspection, auscultation, palpation, per cussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers). Administer immunizations, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropriate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably independent way in potentially high speed/high demand/emergency environments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative & Quantitative Competencies: Student must be able to demonstrate higher -level cognitive abilities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written, diagrammatic, three dimensional) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning 5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistently demonstrate attributes of professionalism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrity, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and accountability consistent with a commitment to excellence. Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertaining to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, recognizing that one's professionalism is constantly evaluated by others. 25 Reasonable Accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages any student who suspects that he or she may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Disability Services for guidance concerning the steps that are necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. Consistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with documented evidence of disabilities may request reasonable accommodations. However, such requests are not reasonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger patients, students, co- workers and/or instructors, or otherwise cause a fundamental alteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Adjudicating Technical Competencies Applicants and students of the Pharmacy Doctorate professional program who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies identified above are ineligible for admission or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate professional program and who realize (either through their own efforts or as demonstrated by a licensing board, a preceptor or a faculty member in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technical competencies to be eligible for licensure have an ethical obligation to self -report that information to the College's administration (i.e., the appropriate department chair, the Senior Associate Dean and/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs). Once realized (through own awareness or as reported to them by a licensing board, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self -report a consistent lack of technical competencies represents a violation of the Student Conduct Policy (College Policy Manual, Policy 3.01). SUBSTANCE MISUSE TESTING POLICY 3.14 The NDSU College of Health Professions is commit ted to ensuring safe, healthy learning environments, including both didactic and experiential learning environments, for all of its students. The use of illicit drugs, as well as the overt misuse of alcohol and/or legally prescribed medications (including, but not limited to, mood altering medications) compromise learning environments and are prohibited under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy and University Policy 155. It is beneficial for all College of Health Professions stakeholders (including its students, faculty, staff, clinical partners, and the patients and families we serve) to establish a testing policy process to ensure the safety and health of these learning environments, as well as to ensure an equitable due process for students who are alleged to partake in substance misuse. Basi s for Testing The College of Health Professions reserves the right to require any student enrolled in one of its pre- professional or professional programs and/or enrolled in any course housed within the Coll ege to undergo testing for substance misuse. All testing is coordinated and monitored through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSAFD). All testing must be direct observation, 10 panel (or higher) tests, and mus t be conducted at a WADA -accredited or SAMHSA - certified laboratory. Per College Policy 3.12: Student File Contents, all test results shall be maintained in a secure location in the Office of the ADSAFD, and may be included in the Student's Personal File. The default method of analysis will be urinalysis, although the ADSAFD reserves the right to require alternative methods of analysis (for example, blood analysis or hair analysis) where appropriate. Alternative methods (if required) will be disclosed in wri ting when notifying the student about the need to be tested. Nonrandom Testing Nonrandom testing for substance misuse may occur as a requirement for entry into clinical sites (per site policies or program -specific experiential education policies), or to fulfill the requirements of sanctions imposed under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Reasonable Suspicion Testing Incidents or events involving suspected substance misuse by students shall be reported to the ADSAFD using the Reasonable Susp icion Reporting Form. Reasonable suspicion shall be determined using objective evidence (photos, legal documents, or other documentation), reports made by credible sources (law enforcement, clinical site staff, NDSU faculty and staff, etc.), or a combinati on of these sources. Because it is a violation of University Policy 155 and College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct 26 Policy to misuse alcohol or prescription medications, or to use illicit drugs, and testing may exonerate the student of an alleged policy violation should the allegation be made falsely, the ADSAFD may exercise discretion in determining what evidence is of sufficient credibility to require testing. A descriptive summary of the evidence will be provided to the student at the time the student is informed of the need to submit to testing. Random Testing The College of Health Professions may implement a random substance misuse testing program. Should a random substance misuse testing program be implemented, the parameters of the program must be mad e freely available on the College of Health Profession's website, and students must be provided notice of the policy at least 6 months prior to its implementation. No more than 5 percent of the active College of Health Professions student body may be randomly selected for testing in any academic semester. No student will be randomly identified for testing more than once in a single academic year. The random selection of students will be implemented using a computer generated random number generating process , with interval (or other non- weighted) sampling. A summary of that selection process shall be provided to the Dean of the College of Health Professions on an annual basis. Testing Process Students who are required to undergo testing will be notified in writing via NDSU email. Upon receiving a request for testing, students are responsible for providing a 10 (or larger) panel, direct observation, drug screen from a reputable, appropriated licensed vendor within 12 business hours of the date and time of th e request. The student identified for testing is solely responsible for obtaining his/her own appointment for testing, his/her transportation to the appointment, and paying the costs of these tests. An original copy of the test results must be delivered to the Office of the ADSAFD at the end of the 12 business hour window. Test results that show evidence of a diluted sample will not be accepted, and will not result in additional time in which to submit test results. Ramifications for Positive Test Results or Failure to Test in a Timely Manner Students whose test results are positive are subject to sanctions outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Once sanctions are assigned, a student's rights of due process are also outlined in College P olicy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Students who fail to submit an original copy of their test results within the 12 business hour window face additional sanctions under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. More specifically, students who fail to provide the required test results within the 12 business hour window will be sanctioned under the presumption that the test results for the substance misuse in question are positive. Testing Alternatives Students whose religious, cultural or other pract ices prohibit them from undergoing a specific type of drug test may request that the ADSAFD require an alternative test, so long as the alternative test is of equal or greater accuracy and precision than the original test required by the ADSAFD. All parameters identified previously apply to the alternative test. In the event that no such test exists, or in the event that students are unable to justify the need for an alternative test, students may be found in violation of College Policy 3.11: Student Techni cal Standards. TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS FOR PHARMACY STUDENTS Students are required to purchase an iPad for use in the classroom, Thrifty White Concept Lab, and experiential rotation sites. The Pharmacy program endorses a full size iPad or iPad Pro that has 64 GB or higher based upon the amount of memory, sharpness of display, and speed. When making your choice, keep in mind that the iPad will be utilized for a variety of applications including note taking and for testing; the iPad mini 4 may not be an opt imal choice for all formats . Other devices, such as smartphones, android tablets, and/or lap tops cannot be substituted for the iPad requirement . It is important to keep the technology consistent in the learning environment so that all students have the same learning experience. Even though other devices can do some of the same 27 things an iPad can do, all of these devices operate off different platforms. Not all educational apps will work on all platforms and some devices (e.g. smart phone) are not appropr iate for some apps (exams). Lastly, apps are designed to work on tablets, not laptops. If you have already purchased a device other than an Apple iPad it may be possible to sell it on Craigslist, eBay, or Amazon so that you may recoup some of your investme nt. We highly recommend that the iPad be purchased through the NDSU Bookstore. Exclusive arrangements have been made with the NDSU Bookstore to allow students the ability to charge the iPad to their student account. For students with financial aid, the c harge will be subtracted from your aid. The NDSU Bookstore has knowledgeable staff including: Brad Sonmor, Dept. Manager; Erin McCormack, Assistant Manager; and Justin Hills, Certified Apple Technician. Erin McCormack is specifically well -versed in operati ng an iPad and functions as a campus -wide resource for them. Finally, Bookstore personnel will assist students with any service issues for all iPads purchased from them. Options to purchasing a less expensive iPad include buying a \"refurbished\" iPad through the online Apple store or purchasing one through Craigslist, eBay, or Amazon. It is recommended that students also purchase the AppleCare+ Warranty. The cost of the war ranty is $69 for iPad and iPad mini and $99 for iPad Pro for two (2) years and provi des technical support and repairs, including coverage for up to two (2) incidents of accidental damage (such as dropping it). See http://store.apple.com/us/product/S4689LL/A/applecare- for-ipad for more information. (Note: If your parents purchase this device for you, their homeowners insurance may cover the iPad, minus the cost of the deductible, in the event it is stolen. You will need to keep track of the device ID in order to report it.) The AppleCare+ Warranty can be purchased from the Bookstore. Again, the NDSU Bookstore will assist students with service issues if the iPad was bought from them. Students have also found that purchasing an external keyboard is advantageous for taking notes in class. There are several to choose from, some of which are described in this article: https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best -ipad-keyboards/ . Lastly, a word about iPad Apps. Initially, you will \"need\" only a few Apps, many which are free. At the minimum, you will need: An App to take notes in class on your iPad. The iPad comes loaded with \"Notes\", which is basically a blank legal pad you can take notes on. Newer versions of the iPad come with \"Pages\", Apple's version of Word. NDSU students can also download Microsoft Office on their iPads for FREE! Check the following for details: https://www.ndsu.edu/its/software/software_licensing_program/microsoft/office_proplus/ If you want to take notes on a course handout that you've downloaded, \"iAnnotate\" is a fantastic App and worth the $9.99. Another note taking App that is cheaper is Notability for $9.99 that is a white board application for drawing, writing, and note- taking. \"Adobe Reader\" to view PDF documents and also provides annotation options -FREE Some textbooks are available as downloads on the iPad as a K indle, iBook, &/or Nook and you will find electronic books are cheaper than the hardcover new edition. Typically, the Kindle version is the most economical of the three listed. You will need to install the \"Kindle\" App- FREE Blackboard - FREE - and Tegrity App which is also FREE to be able to access these sites directly without having to go through Safari. High Point Mobile Campus Connection - FREE - https://m.cnd.ndus.edu . You can now view and register for classes, s ee exam schedules (at institutions where exam schedules are used), view grades, see advisor information, check waitlist status, review student calendars, check their school bills, see the status of your financial aid, and review account activity. 28 Turnin gPoing 8 (mobile clicker). The App is free to download, but a license is needed to activate them. As the best option, students can purchase a 3- year license for $41.99 at the NDSU Bookstore. Other license options (one or two years) are available for purchase at the Turning Technologies student store: https://store.turningtechnologies.com/ . A medical calculator, such as Calculate by QxMD - FREE or MedCalX - $4.99 (In- App purchase to unlock app). Quizle t Flashcards and Study Tools -FREE with option of In- App purchase of Quizlet Plus for $19.99 Evernote Organization and productivity -FREE, or $4.99 for the Premium version. You may also \"want\" the following useful Apps at some time during your pharmacy educ ation: MedScape - FREE medical resource. Medpage Today - FREE medical news, education, etc. ePocrates Rx - FREE medical resource. LinkedIn - Free professional networking. Coach's Eye - An APP for taking, viewing, and editing video - $4.99 Some helpful videos are located within the Pharm.D. Student BlackBoard organization in the 'iPad Apps. See the short \"How -to' Videos\" folder under Student Resources. TERMINATION - RIGHT TO TERMINATE ENROLLMENT P OLICY 3.03 The College of Health Professions reserves the right to terminate the enrollment of any student at any time, if the student demonstrates that he or she is unsuited for a professional career and its inherent responsibilities and obligations. Circumstances that may lead to student termination will i nclude, but not be limited to, violation of state or federal statutes or regulations. TUITION In 2012 the North Dakota Board of Higher Education approved a differential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher than the standard university tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the higher costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other student fees, room and boards, and miscellaneous expenses. As noted earlier, students are expected to complete certain degree requirements including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) during summer months in addition to the regular academic year. Starting with the fall 2013 s emester, students should expect to be charged (and to pay) differential tuition on course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which credits are earned. The amount of differential tuition in an academic term can be found on the NDSU F inancial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/accounts/ .There is a non-refundable admission deposit fee of $500 for students who have been accepted to the pharmacy program. This fee is to assure their place in the class and will be applied to the differential tuition for the first semester of the professi onal program. 29 NDSU ENTRY -LEVEL PHARM.

To enter the pre- pharmacy program the student must qualify for and obtain admission to the University. Applications to NDSU may be obtained from the NDSU Office of A dmission. Admission to the professional pharmacy program is competitive and limited to 85 students each year. Students are selected based upon successful prior academic performance at the time of admission. There are two paths to gain admission into the pharmacy program. New Early Admission Pathway (EAP) to the Professional Entr y-Level Pharm.D. Program The first is our \"early admission\" path. This path is designed for high achieving high school students who seek an expedited path to the professional program. Students are selected for this path based on their academic credentials (including high school grade point averages and ACT or SAT scores) at the time they apply to NDSU. Preference is given to North Dakota residents. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Committee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental application. Students are evaluated during the summer before they enroll at NDSU as first year students, and will be offer ed admission to this path on or before May 15 of that year. Once accepted on this admission path, students must attend NDSU for the entire six -year program. The first year entails standard pre- professional studies. At the conclusion of the first year, st udents who maintain academic and professional requirements transition into a five- year professional program. During the first year in the professional program, students complete all remaining pre- professional requirements, including an expedited set of courses that prepare them for the final four years of the professional program. Students also complete the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT) and an on- site interview. Transition into the final four years of the professional program is guaranteed as long as students meet all academic and professional requirements. Students accepted into the \"early admissions\" path, but who fail to meet all academic and professional requirements, are encouraged to apply to the professional program through the second path described below. Traditional Admission Pathway to the Professional Entry -Level Pharm.D. Program The second path is our \"traditional\" path. Pre- pharmacy students (including transfer students) typically apply for admission to the four -year professional program during the second (or in some cases the third) pre -pharmacy year. Admission to the professional pharmacy program is competitive and limited to the difference between the number of available seats (85) and the number of \"early admission\" students entering the final four years of the professional program each year. Students are selected based upon s uccessful pre -pharmacy academic performance. Preference is given to North Dakota residents and students who attend NDSU. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0 = A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the professional program. The actual admission cutoff is much higher. The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is an admission requirement. Students must take the PCAT during the July or September testing dates. An on- site interview is part of the admission process for the professional program. Supplemental applications are due on or before December 31 for subsequent fall semester admission. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Committee. A nonrefundable $1 25.00 applic ation fee must accompany the supplemental application. Applicants should note that admission to the University does not grant admission to the Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. All students must apply and be for mally accepted by the Pharmacy Admission Committee of the School of Pharmacy before they may begin the professional courses in the four years of the pharmacy program. 32 Students may apply to the School of Pharmacy for admi ssion into the Profes sional Pharmacy program upon satisfactory completion of the pre- pharmacy program or evidence that this program will be successfully completed at either NDSU or another accredited college prior to admission. Students not previously enrolled at NDSU must apply both to NDSU (with a NDSU Application for Admission) and to the School of Pharmacy (with the Supplemental Pharmacy Application form). Applications will be reviewed by the Pharmacy Admission Committee, which is composed of administrators, p harmacy practitioners, and pharmacy faculty in the basic , administrative and clinical sciences. The size of each entering professional class is limited by the availability of the resources of the School of Pharmacy and the capacity of the clinical facilities. NDSU is a state supported institution, thus, residents of North Dakota will be given primary consideration. Residents from other states who attend NDSU full time will also be given partial residency preference. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0=A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the Professional Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. The actual admission \"cut off\" is generally much higher than a 3.0. Application Procedures 1. APPLICATION MATERIALS are available on PharmCAS and should be submitted by December 31. The student is responsible for seeing that ALL application materials are submitted and received by December 31. Applications with materials missing will not be considered for admission. A pplications received after December 31 may not be evaluated. Applications submitted after December 31 will be used to fill remaining spots in the professional program i f any are available after evaluating those applications sub mitted prior to the December 31 deadline. 2. APPLICATION FEE - All PharmCAS fees must be paid before your application will be processed. A $125.00 non -refundable application fee is required for admission . 3. If the applicant is not a current or former NDSU student, separate application must be made for adm ission to NDSU through the NDSU Office of Admission. 4. Official transcripts from all universities and colleges attended must be sent to the NDSU Office of Admission AND to the College of Health Professions . The transcripts must contain the winter quarter or fall semester grades. Students must show transcript evidence that all coursework required by the end of the spring term (courses listed by name and number) will be completed by the end of spring term. The applicant must also supply official transcripts of spring term. It is the responsibili ty of the applicant to determine that all transcripts and other application materials (supplemental applications and completed PCAT scores) are submitted and updated if incomplete transcripts are initially s ubmitted . a. Note: NDSU students not enrolled in the pre -pharmacy major must contact the Office of Registration & Records t o request their transcripts be forwarded to the School of Pharmacy. . 5. The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is required. Completed scores must be sent to the Chair of the Pharmacy Admission Committee. For information on the PCAT, contact us at 701- 231-7601. The School of Pharmacy requires that students take the PCAT in July , September, October or November 2018 as their most recent exam. We will accept PCA T scores back three years ( July 2015 to Novem ber 201 8). The web address for the PCAT is www.pcatweb.info . 6. All courses must be completed with at least a grade of \"C.\" Selected core courses, indicated by an asterisk ( *) must be completed by the end of fall semester prior to the December 31 deadline date to apply to the pharmacy program. Remaining courses, which are required and listed in the pre- pharmacy curriculum, MUST be completed by the end of spring term. The only exceptions are the electives which may be completed during the summer (up to six credits) . 7. An interview on campus is part of the evaluation process for students who receive final consideration for admission. 33 Notification of Acceptance 1. Applicants are n otified of their acceptance as rapidly as admission decisions are made. 2. Acceptance Deposit : Applicants who are offered a position into the entry -level Professional Pharm.D. program are required to submit a non- refundable deposit fee of $500.00 to the School of Pharmacy to assure a place in the class. This deposit is typically due within 30 days of receipt of an admission letter. This fee will be applied to the differential tuition for the first semester of the professional program. 3. Differential Tuition. In 2012 the North Dakota Board of Higher Education approved a differential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher than the standard university tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the higher costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other student fees, room and boards, and miscellaneous expenses. As noted earlier, students are expected to complete certain degree requirements including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experienc e (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) during summer months in addition to the regular academic year. Starting with the fall 2013 semester, students should expect to be charged (and to pay) differential tuition on course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which credits are earned. The amount of differential tuition in an academic term can be found on the NDSU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/accounts/ . 4. An additional $1 00 fee is required. It will be applied to the first year annual fee for registration as a Pharmacy Student Intern in North Dakota, with the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy. Note: this $1 00 annua l fee for licensure as a student intern is required by the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy for four years of enrollment in the professional program. Once a student is accepted into the professional pharmacy program, he or she is expected to continuously hold a valid North Dakota Pharmacy Intern license for the entirety of their professional program. Reapplication A student who has made application to the professional program but is not accepted, who fails to enroll after being accepted or who was unsuccessful in the Early Admissions Pathway program (EAP) , may reapply f or admission to the professional program. Students are allowed to apply to the program twice (including the EAP) . Regardless of whether or not a student meet s the eligibility requirements, once a student pays the pharmacy application fee, that application officially counts toward the limit of two attempts. All academic and admission requirements in force at the time of his/her reapplication must be met. PLEASE NOTE The faculty reserve the right to change rules and regulations including those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Such changes may apply to prospective students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a timely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contac t their adviser or the Dean's Office to obtain current policies. For further information, forward inquiries to the Chair of the Pharmacy Admission Committee, School of Pharmacy, College of Health Professions, North Dakota State University, Dept . 2650, PO Box 6050, Fargo, ND 58108. 34 PHARM.D. EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES This document defines the educ ational outcomes, or w hat students will be able to do upon c ompletion of the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum at North Dakota State University School of Pharmacy. The educat ional outcomes reflect competencies essential for an entry-level pharmacist in any s etting to practice collaboratively as a member of an interprofessional team, provide patient-centered care, contribute to the health of diverse patient popu lations, de monstrate leadership, and effectively manag e a complex work environment. A glossa ry of terms used in this docum ent can be found in Table 1. Domain 1.

Students are expected to make sufficient financial and other preparations in advance of these experiences to allow them to successfully complete the experiential requirements. Students are responsible for housing, board, travel expenses and all other related expenses during these experiences. Pharmacy students must register annually as a Student Intern with the North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy and must continuously hold valid licensure as a pharmacy intern in North Dakota for the duration of the professional program. Students must pay all ND Board internship fees to be eligible f or the experiential education program. Students with experiential placement in states outside of North Dakota must also register and pay for an intern license in those states. INTRODUCTORY AND ADVANCED PHARMACY PRACTICE EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION Introduct ory Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE) consists of a total of 300 hours throughout the P1 - P2 - P3 years. First year professional students will complete 120 hours of IPPE in an institutional pharmacy setting during the summer between their P1 and P2 year . Second year profes sional students will complete 16 0 hours of IPPE in a community pharmacy setting during the summer between their P2 and P3 year. The remaining required 20 hours consists of actual and simulated patient care experiences dispersed throughout the P1, P2, and P3 curriculum. Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) is comprised of 8 five- week rotations during the fourth professional year. Five of the eight rotations are required rotations including; ambulatory care, acute care, institutio nal, community advanced, and rural health. The remaining three rotations are considered elective rotations and are chosen based on student personal and professional preferences. PHARMACY REGULATIONS FOR EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION North Dakota A student enrolled in the entry -level Pharm.D. program is required to register as a PHARMACY INTERN per North Dakota Administrative Code prior to the fall term of the first professional year. Registration is conducted at a time specified by the Board of Pharmacy in cooperation with the College of Health Professions .

Cody Wiberg, Pharm.D., Executive Director Minnesota State Board of Pharmacy 2829 SE University Ave., Suite 530 RESIDENCY FAQS What is a Pharmacy Residency? A pharmacy residency is an organized, mentored, post -graduate training program. Typically, a residency is completed directly after graduating from a Doctor of Pharmacy program. However, some may choose to complete residency after practicing as a licensed pharmacist for a few years. What will I learn in a residency program? You will learn the knowledge and gain the experience required of pharmacists in various areas of practice. You will have the opportunity to learn from pharmacists who are experts in their area of pharmacy. Why should I do a residency? This is an opportunity to bridge the gap between being a pharmacy student one day, and the next day being a licensed pharmacist. You will have the opportunity to fortify your strengths, strengthen your weaknesses, and develop confidence in your abilities as an individual pharmacist. Other benefits include a competitive advantage in the job market, networking opportunities, career planning, and attendance/participation at local and national meetings. What is the duration of residency program? Each residency is typically one year. They start July 1 and conclude June 30 each year. Some residencies are offered in combination with a postgraduate degree (M.S., MBA), and may take additional years to complete. Are all residency programs the same? No. The type of residency you select will depend on your c areer objectives. Select a program that will prepare you for the type of job you eventually want to have. Examples of current residency types include: PGY -1 (\"Pharmacy Practice\" or \"General\") Pediatrics Psychiatry Ambulatory Care Infectious Diseases Oncology Pharmacy Management Managed Care Critical Care Are residencies only for hospital -based programs? No. There are many ambulatory based programs. In fact, these programs are among the fastest growing type. Do I get paid during this program? Yes. Most r esidencies pay roughly $40,000- $45,000 for the year. Some programs allow the opportunity to pick-up extra pharmacist shifts to earn extra pay. Most programs offer fringe benefits (e.g. health care, investment opportunities, etc.). Also, you may be eligible for deferring payment on your student loans during the program. I'm not sure what type of program is right for me. What do you suggest? The most common type of residency is a PGY -1 (\"Pharmacy Practice\" or \"General\") residency. It covers a broad spectru m of practice areas and patient types. Required experiences include acute care, ambulatory care, drug information, and practice management. In addition to these \"core\" elements, each program has various specialty areas to complete the training experience. Also, a research project (in collaboration with one of your preceptors) is completed during the residency year. Some programs include teaching/precepting opportunities in cooperation with an affiliated college of pharmacy. Finally, programs have various service (\"staffing\") requirements. Typically, staffing requires functioning as a pharmacist during evening and/or weekend hours. 56 How do I apply for a residency program? PGY -1 and PGY -2 residencies (ASHP -accredited) require participation in the residency -matching program. This is a formal process that attempts to match applicants to their choice of programs and vice versa. Programs that are in the process of receiving accreditation may also participate in the residency -matching program. Check with the i ndividual programs to verify their accreditation, and match participation status. To participate in the Match for a position designated as a PGY -2 residency, an applicant must have already completed a PGY -1 residency, or currently be in training in a PGY -1 residency program that will be completed before the start of the PGY -2 residency. Current PGY -1 residents who are interested in continuing their training in a PGY -2 residency offered by the same sponsor as the applicant's PGY -1 residency (e.g., the same or an affiliated organization) may be able to obtain the position through an Early Commitment Process. Applicants who are committed to a position in this manner do not need to register for or participate in the Match. After I complete this residency experience, what is next? You will have an advantage over many of your peers regarding employment opportunities. More \"doors\" will be open to you, and you will have more freedom in your career choice. Many employers value residency - trained pharmacists, and som e jobs require residency experience. Graduates of residency programs go on to the following: pharmacist positions (staff, specialist, manager, etc.) in their area of training, faculty positions, specialty residency programs, or fellowship programs. How do I find out more about residency programs and where they are located? Here are a few good resources: https://www.ashp.org/Professional -Development/Residency -Information , your college's ASHP advisor, local pharmacy practice residency directors, and ASHP's Midyear Clinical Meeting, which showcases virtually all of the ASHP -accredited programs. For additional information, please view the following web sites for the NDSU Department of Pharmacy Practice: https://www.ndsu.edu/pharmacy/residency_programs/ https://www.ndsu.edu/pharmacy/residency_programs/residency_checklist/ 57 PHARM.D. / MBA OPTION The Master of Business Administration (MBA) Program at North Dakota State University is a non- thesis, concise, professional program for qualified students with undergraduate or graduate degrees in various fields.

Public health is defined as the practice of helping members of society live healthier, longer lives. More specifically, public health focuses on improving the general health of communities through efforts to monitor the spread of disea ses, initiatives (both clinical and policy -oriented) to prevent disease and disability, and by promoting healthy lifestyles through education and community engagement. Public health is both an art and a science. It is practiced by inter -professional teams whose members' training spans a wide array of academic and vocational fields. Of particular importance to public health in our state is determining how to meet the challenges of change and diversity within rural areas. Rural health solutions are essential to the well -being of North Dakota and to other areas of the nation and the world. North Dakota is an ideal location for rural public health research in addition to the application of practical solutions to health improvement for rural communities. Public health is an interdisciplinary field; it is common for many people to gain competencies and/or training in a related field (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, business, engineering, etc.) and subsequently move into public health as a matter of vocation or occupation. The MPH degree is uniquely designed to accommodate the needs to these individuals. It blends theory and practical knowledge across a wide array of disciplines, and is the \"degree of choice\" among practitioners in the field. There are three specializations to choose from within the MPH degree at NDSU. The specializations of Community Health Sciences or the Management of Infectious Diseases are the most suitable for most pharmacists, as they prepare health professionals to integrate public health initiatives and policies within traditional medical models. It is designed to provide pharmacists and other health professionals with a better understanding of their diverse roles in public health. For more information on the NDSU MPH program you can visit www.ndsu.edu/publichealth or contact the Academic Coordinator/Lecturer, Stefanie Meyer, at Stefanie.meyer@ndsu.edu. PHARM.D./MPH DUAL DEGREE OPTION The M aster of Public Health (MPH) offers diverse tracks in public health that build upon the strengths of campus to meet the practical needs of the public and health care practitioners who serve it. Specializations at NDSU include community health sciences , man agement of infectious diseases, and American Indian public health. The MPH degree consists of 42 credits and can be completed in two years as a full time graduate student. Pharm.D. students are able to complete a Pharm.D./MPH dual degree in as little as one extra year of study. Pharm.D. students who are in good academic standing are eligible to apply for the Pharm.D./MPH program through the graduate school during their P2 year. Why Public Health? Practitioners in our region have limited opportunit ies for advanced, pract ical public health training that focuses on the unique challenges facing this largely rural area that encompasses North Dakot a and other Northern Plains states. There are many underserved populations living in the region that would bene fit from expanded public health interv entions. For example, the American Indian comm unities have typically been underserv ed and signif icant health disparities between this populat ion and others have resulted. Overall, there is much to be gained from greater collaboration within the Northern Great Plains, and the education of public health professionals is a natural starting point to facilitate that collaboration. 60 Is the MPH accredited? Yes. T he Council on Educatio n for Public Health (CEPH) at its October 6 -7, 2016, meeting acted to accredit the Master of Public Health Program at North Dakota State University for a five- year term, extending to December 31, 2021. What are the admission requirements for the Pharm.D./MPH dual degree? You must be enrolled in the Pharm.D. program and in good academic standing. In addition to graduate school requirements (with the exception of the GRE ; the PCAT score can be used instead for Pharm.D. students), the MPH Admissions Committee may invite selected applicants for an interv iew. How do I apply to the Pharm.D./MPH dual degree? You apply online during the spring semester of your P2 year through the Graduate School at http://ndusndsugrad.a skadmissions.net/emtinterestpage.aspx?ip=application and choose \"Public Health.\" If you are a P1 student and wish to get started early, apply online at the above website but choose \"Non- Degree\" in the drop down box during the spring semester of your P1 year. This will allow you to take PHRM 632 for Graduate credit. Up to nine graduate credits can be taken as a non- degree student. When can I start the MPH program? Applic ations are reviewed each year beginni ng March through May for a fall semester start. You may also take up to nine graduate credits as a non- degree seeking student with permission of the instructor. How much does it cost for MPH courses? Tuition and fees for MPH coursework can be found here: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/accounts/tuition/graduate_tuition_fall_2018_spring_summer_2019/ Are there scholarships available? Yes. Express Scripts Scholars Program offers scholarships for Pharm.D. dual degree students. The program provides four (4) $10,000 scholarships nationally each year to enrolled dual degree students. The awarded students are given $2,500 per semester for four consecutive semesters, totaling $10,000 over two years. For application instructions, please contact: ExpressScriptsScholars@aacp.org . The College of Health Professions has a limited number of scholarships and awards avail able for assistance to students.

MPH core courses are generally offered in the evening to accommodate students who work. These courses are only offered in the Fall and Spring semester s. There are no summer core courses, although the MPH practicum may be completed during summer. Current students are encouraged to talk with their faculty advisors for the most uptodate information on course offerings. Does the MPH program accommodate distance learners? MPH stude nts can take their courses on campus at NDS U or offcampus through live video broadcasts of classes (IVN). Since I will not enroll in Phrm 555 IPPE III or Phrm 552L in the P3/Public Health year, do I still need to complete the required online trainings (e.g. HIPAA, HIPAA Security, NDSU Bloodborne Pathogen, Preve nting Methamphetamine Abuse, etc.)? Yes. You will still need to complete the required trainings in the fall of your P3/Public Health year. In addition, you will need to be registered as a Pharmacy Intern in the state of North Dakota. 61 Can I take courses in more than one area of special ization? Yes, there is a list of electives in each special ization that are available to all MPH students. You are welcome to take additional credits if you are interested. Can I change to a different specializatio n track after starting the MPH program? Yes. You must be in good academic standing within the MPH program and the admissions comm ittee for the specialization you wish to enter must agree that your backgr ound is sufficient for the transition. Contact the Academic Coor dinator/Lecturer if interested. Where can I do my Practicum? Can the Practicum be done in another country? NDMPH has secured Practicum affiliati on agreements with local, national, and global sites in publ ic health. Students can also request a Practicum site without an existing affiliation agreement, but this must be done a minimum of 6 months in advance of the Practicum start date to ensure that a working agreement can be establi shed. Practicums can be done in other countries as long as an acceptable agree ment can be establi shed beforeh and. What are the hardware and software requirem ents for off camp us students? The ability of a student to succeed in a distance education class depends on his or her ability to understand both the course structure and t he associated technology. Informing students of what skills and technology are needed for distance education allows them the opportunity to self -evaluate their capability to succeed in the course. At the time of admission to the program, students are required to ensure that their computers meet the minimum hardware and software requirements described below.

DUAL DEGREE OPTION Purpose The entry level curriculum leading to the Pharm.D. degree requires a minimum of six years of study. Up to 76 semester hours are required in the pre- professional curriculum. Admission to the professional program is competitive, based upon successful pre- pharmacy academic performance and available positions in each class. After successful completion of 76 semester hours, interviews, and the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), students are admitted to a four -year professional program. The Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, one of six academic departments of the College of Health Professions , subscribes to the missions of the College and of North Dakota State University in the provision of Teaching, Research, and Service. The Department provides instruction in disciplines applicable to science. The faculty design and conduct research in the natural and biological scienc es, as well as mentor graduate and Professional students in advanced concepts of pharmaceutical science and in the process of scientific inquiry. NDSU offers both the MS and Ph.D. degrees in Pharmaceutical Sciences. The graduate program emphasizes both research and teaching excellence. The doctor of philosophy degree is awarded in recognition of high scholarly achievement as evidenced by a period of successful study, the satisfactory completion of examinations and the development of an acceptable dissertat ion project covering some significant aspect of a major field of learning and research. After successful completion of a Ph.D. degree program, students have had a high level of success gaining highly desirable employment in academia, industry and governmental agencies. The dual program (Pharm.D./Ph.D.) is designed to provide an opportunity for outstanding professional students in the Pharmacy Program at North Dakota State University obtain research experience and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the Depart ment of Pharmaceutical Sciences. It is proposed that this can be accomplished with an additional three years of study and research placed between the second and the third years of the four -year professional program. It is believed that the combination of the Pharm.D. and Ph.D. degrees will greatly enhance the student's research background, critical thinking skills, and marketability for leadership positions within the profession of Pharmacy in academic, government, and industrial environments. Summer Res earch Experience During the summer between the P1 and P2 years, up to six students per year will be allowed into an introductory research experience phase of the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program and will spend twelve weeks rotating throughout these three research l aboratories. A summer stipend will be provided for each participating student in return for a 20 hour/week commitment (These funds are to be obtained from the College's differential tuition funds). Admission Students in the Doctor of Pharmacy program wi ll make an application to the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences by December 20h at the end of the fall term of their second year (P2) in the program for acceptance into the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program. They should have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above. At the same time, an application to the graduate school should also be made. The GRE should also be taken by the end of this semester. Pharm.D./Ph.D. applications will be considered by the Department as for all graduate students. Course requirements during the professional program The P harm.D. curriculum is unchanged. In the fall semester of the P1 year, a faculty member(s) will make the students aware of the Pharm.D./Ph.D. option, and briefly outline the program. 68 The Ph.D. Graduate Dissertation Years (i.e. G1, G2, G3) Students will receive a monthly stipend, and tuition waiver during Ph.D. graduate year 1 (G1), year 2 (G2) and year 3 (G3). For this time period the students are full -time graduate students in the Department, subject to the same expectations (e.g. seminar participation, 6 credits of PSCI 790, year -round study, etc.). During the three graduate years, the students will be required to complete STAT 725 (3 cr), BIOC 701 (4 cr) and BIOC 702 (4 cr). In addition, if interested, student s may take other 700- level courses available in the department and university. Thus by the end of G3, the students will have a minimum of (12 cr) 600 -level and (up to 21 cr) 700 -level didactic credits. At the end of three graduate years, students would be able to write dissertation and pass the final thesis examination. In addition to didactic credits, students will take 1 credit Seminar (PSCI 790) in the fall and the Spring semesters of each of the three graduate years. Students will also be required to t ake 60 thesis research credits (PSCI 799) during three graduate years. The Clinical Years (P3 & P4) For the final two years of the professional program, dual degree students will receive a waiver of NDSU base tuition and pharmacy differential tuition. No changes in the didactic coursework of the P3 year are proposed. Program requirements for the participants Once accepted into the dual degree program (i.e. the G1 year and beyond), the student is considered to be a full - time graduate student in the D epartment of Pharmaceutical Sciences. They must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above. Ph.D. Summary: 12 credits of 600 and at least 18 out of 21 suggested credits of 700=30 didactic credits, with 6 credits seminar and 60 credits dissertation gives a total of 96 graduate credits. Up to 12 credits of 600 level courses can be used for the Pharm.D. P3 and P4 years will remain as it is in the traditional Pharm.D. program. Suggested Course Schedule for Pharm.D. /Ph.D. Students P-1 Year: It would remain the same. In summer, students are required to do a research rotation in three laboratories. Please contact the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences (231- 7661) for details. P-2 Year: It would remain G-1 Year: BIOC 701 (4 cr), BIOC 702 (4 cr), STAT 725 (3 cr), P SCI 790 (2 cr), PSCI 799 (15 cr), PSCI 611 (3 cr), PSCI 670 (3 cr) G-2 Year: PSCI 790 (2 cr), PSCI 799 (25 cr) , and at least any two of the following 3 credit courses: PSCI 612/613/614/615 G-3 Year: P-3 Year: Unchanged P-4 Year: Unchanged Students interested in pursuing this option need to see Dr. Singh, the Chairman of Pharmaceutical Sciences, to begin the process. His office is located in Sudro Hall 136. 69 PHARMACY STUDENT ACTIVITIES & ORGANIZATIONS The American Pharmaceutical Association- Academy of Students of Pharmacy (APhA- ASP) The mission of the American Pharmacist Association Academy of Student Pharmacist (APhA -ASP) is to be the collective voice of student pharmacists, to provide opportunities f or professional growth, to improve patient care, and to envision and advance the future of pharmacy. APhA- ASP membership has opportunities which will help NDSU student pharmacists navigate their way through their education and career through the developm ent of leadership skills, eligibility for awards and scholarships, participation in patient care projects, community outreach, networking opportunities, and advocating for their profession. Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International (CPFI) Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International (CPFI) is a worldwide ministry of individuals working in all areas of pharmaceutical service and practice. Its mission is to: provide fellowship among like- minded professionals; challenge and promote spiritual growth; encourage the advancement of knowledge and ethics in the practice of pharmacy; encourage the integration of faith into practice; and provide support and opportunity for service in both home and foreign missions. The NDSU student chapter of CPFI was establi shed in Fall of 2003. Its purpose is to unite, support, and strengthen the faith of Christian pharmacy students, faculty, and staff within the College of Health Professions . The group holds weekly devotional and prayer meetings and also meets every other Thursday in the student lounge for Bible studies and social activities. The group plans in the future to host speakers on various topics. CPFI students have had opportunities to complete a medical missions trip in a foreign country as part of their experiential program. College of Health Professions Ambassadors The College of Health Professions Ambassadors is a selective student organization of 35+ members that represents each of the departments within the College, with members from many of the programs w ithin each department as well as the different stages of the programs ranging from pre- professional to graduate students. The members of this student organization serve an essential role in the College of Health Professions. This premiere group of student s works to promote the College through involvement in a variety of events, including: Sudro Hall building tours for prospective students interested in the majors within the College, homecoming tours for alumni, the White Coat ceremony, the Nurse Pinning ceremony, Discover NDSU, and a host of other events for prospective students, current students, and alumni. The Health Professions Ambassadors are advised by Dana Davis, Director of Outreach and Community Engagement for the College of Health Professions. St udents who are interested in this organization should contact Dana. Dean's Liaison Committee (DLC) The Dean's Student Liaison Committee shall consist of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development, who shall be chair, and one student representative from each of the following areas: pre-pharmacy, first year, second year, third year, and fourth year of the pharmacy professional program; first year, second year, and third year of the nursing professional program; two allied sciences professi onal students (or pre- professional students designated by the professional students); up to two master of public health students; as well as one representative from each of the following student organizations: Academy of Students in Pharmacy, American Asso ciation of Pharmaceutical Scientists, American Society of Health System Pharmacists, Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International, College of Health Professions Ambassadors, Kappa Psi, National Community Pharmacists 70 Association, Native American Profes sional Program, NDSU Public Health Association, NDSU Student College of Clinical Pharmacy, Phi Lambda Sigma, Rho Chi, Sigma Theta Tau, the Students of Allied Sciences Club, and the Student Nurses Association.

Kappa Psi Kappa Psi is a professional, co- ed fraternity whose main purpose is to unite its members and to help them become better professionals. We try to achieve this by being actively involved in community affairs, university affairs, and the College of Health Professions . Throughout our history, the Beta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Psi has maintained a stout brotherhood founded on industry, sobriety, fellowship, and high ideals. Our chapter has been involved in many community service events including volunteering for Bethany Homes, the New Life Center, the American Diabetes Association, the Ronald McDonald house, the Arthritis Foundation, Dorothy Da y Food Pantry. We also provide a mont hly meal along with a blood pressure screening at low income housing in West Fargo. We consistently earn the highest cumulative all -Greek GPA. We sponsor an annual Homecoming pig roast, a faculty appreciation dinner, a Spring Formal, and other social activities. We are also active on the local, regional, and national levels of Kappa Psi. Kappa Psi was founded in May 1879 at the Russell Military Academy in New Haven, Connecticut. Initially, it was a medical pharmaceut ical fraternity and continued as such until 1924. At that time, by mutual agreement, the members of both professions decided to separate into two distinct groups. The medical group became Theta Kappa Psi and the Pharmacy group became Kappa Psi. Our chapter was founded April 25, 1924 and was one of the 27 founding chapters of Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity. Our chapter became co- ed in 1998. We continue to thrive on the North Dakota State campus as a source of brotherhood for pharmacy students. If you have any questions about Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity, please feel free to contact: Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity, 1345 North University Drive, Fargo ND 58102. Native American Professional Program (NAPP) To address the critical shortage of Native American pharmacists in the United States, the College initiated NAPP (then known as the Native American Pharmacy Program) in September 1987. The program was designed to recruit and facilitate the entry of Native American students into the College and provide them with counseling and retention services to increase their chances for academic success. In 2009, NAPP members transformed the program into a student organization and made it inclusive of all the majors within the College, thus changing t he name from Native American Pharmacy Program to Native American Professional Programs. NAPP meets monthly to discuss a variety of topics related to the knowledge and skills needed to pursue degrees offered by the College of Health Professions at NDSU . Counseling and tutorial services for students, financial aid and scholarship information, and internship and future career opportunities also are presented. The NDSU National Community Pharmacists Association Student Chapter (NCPA) NCPA is a national organ ization representing independent community pharmacy practice. In 1987, the national office began a student outreach program that has founded student chapters in 41 colleges of pharmacy across the nation. The mission of the NCPA student outreach program is to foster entrepreneurial spirit in pharmacy students and introduce them to opportunities in independent pharmacy practice and ownership. 71 Established at NDSU in April 2000, the NCPA Student Chapter provides a forum for students to learn about the many career options available in independent community practice. The objectives of the chapter are to promote the profession of pharmacy and the role of independent pharmacy in the health care system, and to maintain and expand educational programs and strengthen student members' professional, business, and leadership abilities. Goals of the chapter are to sponsor pharmacists involved in an innovative practice to speak at meetings, start a management/ownership workshop for students interested in owning their own pharmacy, participate in service activities to the community, and to send students to the NCPA Annual Convention in October of each year. Benefits of membership in the student chapter include a variety of scholarships, low interest student loans, and a student publication called The New Independent in addition to the national journal America's Pharmacist. Students also receive free registration to NCPA's national convention and opportunities to do a rotation or summer internship at NCPA headquarters i n Alexandria, Virginia. Membership is open to all NDSU students enrolled and in good standing with the University. NDSU Student College of Clinical Pharmacy (NDSU- SCCP) Established in May 2015, NDSU -SCCP is a student chapter of the American College of C linical Pharmacy (ACCP). Our mission is to familiarize students with the field of clinical pharmacy by providing information about careers and opportunities within the field of clinical pharmacy, to advocate for the role of clinical pharmacists in providing direct patient care, and to encourage participation in the American College of Clinical Pharmacy at the national level and in local/regional chapters. NDSU Student Public Health Association The purpose of the NDSU Public Health Association is to strive to meet the public health needs of the community by increasing awareness and through the multi -disciplinary collaboration of NDSU students, faculty and staff with the goals of promoting health, preventing disease and improving the quality of life. The SPH A provides opportunities for students to learn more about public health issues in the community and to take on leadership roles in public health community engagement. North Dakota Society of Health System Pharmacists Student Chapter at North Dakota State University (NDSHP- NDSU) Our mission is to inform students about pharmacy practice opportunities in health- systems, which includes areas such as hospital pharmacy, ambulatory care clinics, home health care, and long- term care. We invite guest speakers each semester to discuss pharmacy opportunities in the region, including regional residency programs. Each year we hold a clinical skills competition in the fall semester, with the local winning team representing NDSU at the American Society of Health- System Pharmacists (ASHP) Midyear Clinical Meeting. NDSHP -NDSU members are also involved with several community service activities throughout the year. Our organization is a member of the Student Societies of Health- System Pharmacy (SSHP) in coordination wi th ASHP and NDSHP. Membership is open to all pre- pharmacy and pharmacy students at NDSU with an interest in health- systems pharmacy. Phi Lambda Sigma (PLS) In February 1991, Phi Lambda Sigma was initiated at NDSU. The purpose of Phi Lambda Sigma, the National Pharmacy Leadership Society, is to promote the development of leadership qualities in pharmacy, especially among young pharmacy students. By peer recognition the Society encourages participation in all pharmacy activities. Membership crosses frate rnal and organizational lines, thus, the Society does not compete with any other organization. The Society describes a leader as a \"do- er\" in pharmacy, one who gets the job done. It avoids the stigma of being called an \"officers club\" by recognizing the performance, not the office. 72 Membership in Phi Lambda Sigma consists of four categories: students, faculty, alumni, and honorary. For a student to be eligible for membership, he or she shall be of high moral and ethical character, shall have completed at least 135 quarter hours or 90 semester hours of scholastic work applicable toward the pharmacy degree, and shall have a grade point average of 2.5 on a 4.0 grading system. Prospective members are considered for membership by submitting an application during the spring semester. Applicants are evaluated by the existing membership for admittance into the Society on the basis of their demonstration of dedication, service, leadership in the advancement of Pharmacy , and nomination by existing members . Through recognition of dedication and service by pharmacy students, Phi Lambda Sigma provides an incentive for the development of future leadership potential for the profession of pharmacy. Rho Chi The Rho Chi Society is a national pharmacy honor society. The Society encourages high standards of conduct and character and advocates critical inquiry in all aspects of pharmacy. Only the top 20% of the second year professional class is selected for membership. The Society's activities focus on the advancement of its members through scholarship and service to the community.
