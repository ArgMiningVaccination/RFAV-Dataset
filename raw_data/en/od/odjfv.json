How UC students, staff avoided COVID-19 mandate On Nov. 1, two months after the [University of Cincinnati announced a COVID-19 vaccine mandate](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/08/31/university-cincinnati-announces-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/5671338001/) for all students, staff and faculty, a student wrote to the school quoting 1 Corinthians 6:19 from the Bible. \"Do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own. That God is in you. That he is our healer.\" The student, whose name was redacted from one of 72 exemption request forms obtained by The Enquirer through Ohio's Public Records Act, wrote they have \"sincere and genuine beliefs\" that \"forbid\" them from getting vaccinated against COVID-19. \"I have decided to place my trust in God,\" the student wrote. The request was approved, along with nearly 3,000 others as of March. About 95% of the university's approved COVID-19 vaccine exemption forms were for nonmedical reasons, including religion or their conscience. None of the nonmedical requests were denied. [The university lifted its vaccine mandate on Thursday](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/04/22/covid-19-vaccine-mandate-ends-university-cincinnati/7410425001/), though it's unclear why. Even with the exemptions, 89% of students taking in-person classes at UC received a COVID-19 vaccine by April and 90% of on-campus employees are vaccinated, university officials confirmed. The [university requires five other vaccines](https://med.uc.edu/landing-pages/university-health/vaccination/overview): shots for hepatitis B, meningitis A and chickenpox; the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; and the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis booster. There has been an increase in non-COVID-19 vaccine exemption requests in recent years, generally related to the flu vaccine, university spokesperson M.B. Reilly told The Enquirer. The Enquirer requested all COVID-19 vaccine exemption request forms submitted to UC in November. The university initially denied the request, but ultimately agreed after The Enquirer filed a legal action to provide a fraction of those requests with names and other identifying information redacted. Approved vaccine exemption requests were mostly for nonmedical reasons In another request form approved by the university, a different student wrote: \"If it is my time to be called to everlasting Heaven, that is God's will and I will happily look forward to eternity with my God.\" \"I believe God commands that we take good care of our body and make decisions based on His commands, not those of certain medical professionals,\" another student wrote in their request. At least one of the approved requests cited the religious beliefs of the Nation of Islam, which is [recognized as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam). Some of the forms included three-page letters citing all of the reasons why that student or employee refused to get vaccinated. Other forms were submitted with no more than a one-sentence explanation. There were students who expressed love for the university and anxiety about not being able to finish their studies at the school if they stuck to their moral compass by not getting the vaccine. There were employees who had already planned on retiring this year, before the mandate was announced, and didn't see the point in getting the jab when they were so close to the end of their tenure. Some elicited the support of local religious leaders in their applications for exemption. Others [cited relevant court cases ](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/01/04/lawsuit-asks-stop-university-cincinnati-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/9091474002/)or submitted letters from their own legal counsel with their request forms. There were applicants who acknowledged university policy and agreed to wear masks and test for the virus on a weekly basis in lieu of getting vaccinated. But not everyone was agreeable to this alternative, and at least one student requested a religious exemption from getting tested in addition to an exemption from inoculation. \"I will not be involved in the testing for unvaccinated students and staff,\" the student wrote, noting that they were exempt from testing the previous semester. \"I as an American citizen will not be discriminated against for my religious and philosophical beliefs.\" Compliance rates and herd immunity at the University of Cincinnati The university announced its [compliance rate for faculty and staff across all three campuses was at 95%](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/12/06/see-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-results-miami-university-cincinnati/8855671002/) in December. COVID-19 vaccine compliance rates for students were lower, at 88% for the main campus and 60% for the Blue Ash and Clermont campuses. University officials said at the time that they would \"continue to dialogue\" with noncompliant students to share information on how to submit proof of vaccination or exemption forms. The forms continue to be accepted on a rolling basis. Compliance rates have risen since December, and vaccination rates have risen, too. In April, the university confirmed its vaccination rate among students taking in-person classes was at 89% and at 90% for on-campus employees. Experts are still unsure what percentage of any community needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity and therefore protection from further spread of the virus, said [Dr. Robert Frenck, director of Gamble Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/08/02/cincinnati-childrens-hospital-dr-robert-frenck-put-area-at-forefront-of-covid-19-vaccine-trials/7530774002/) Medical Center. The best bet for now, he said, is to get as many people vaccinated as possible. \"The vaccine is safe. The vaccine is effective,\" said Frenck, who led early tests on the Pfizer vaccine at Cincinnati Children's. The research center is not exclusively for kids. \"Our goal is to get, really, everybody vaccinated that can.\" COVID-19 is an \"equal opportunity virus,\" Frenck said: it doesn't care about gender, race, politics, religion or wealth. \"It's just looking for cells to invade and to infect.\" Fact check: [6 of the most persistent misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/08/05/fact-check-6-persistent-covid-19-vaccine-misconceptions-online/5489437001/) Frenck said misinformation about the vaccine is keeping some from getting the shot. Are fetal cell lines used in COVID-19 vaccines? Several exemption requests to UC cited the use of fetal cell lines in available COVID-19 vaccines as a reason to abstain from the injection. Frenck would not speak to the practices at UC or these exemption request forms specifically. But he maintains that no fetal cell lines are used in the creation of either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, both of which are mRNA vaccines. \"While my religion may not prohibit the use of vaccines, it does prohibit abortion and I do believe that abortion is a sin,\" one student wrote in their exemption request form. Others requesting religious exemption from the mandate wrote: - Injecting a vaccine made with cells from aborted fetuses \"is equivalent to profaning and defiling the Holy Temple of the Lord.\" - \"What the world considers a type of remedy, a privilege, and something to covet in 2021 but is something I consider an impurity, I do not believe that using fetal cells from an aborted fetus for the benefit of the greater good or my personal benefit can be reconciled.\" - \"Due to my devout belief that all life is sacred, if I were to have difficulty conceiving, experience a miscarriage, or if my future child suffered morbidity from the vaccine, my conscious would be guilty of either harming or worse aborting my own child.\" Fact check: [No evidence Pfizer, Moderna COVID-19 vaccines cause miscarriage](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/12/13/fact-check-pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-dont-cause-miscarriage/6446010001/) As part of the clinical trials testing the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, blood was collected from vaccinated participants to measure antibodies as a way to tell how well their immune system responded to the vaccine. One specialized blood antibody test, used only in research, used a fetal cell line that was created over 60 years ago to see how well the antibodies blocked the COVID-19 virus from entering the cell line, Frenck said. It was necessary to use cells for the test because viruses cannot survive on their own. Frenck said this test was used only in research and participants were never exposed to the cells used in the test. This specialized, research testing was not performed at Cincinnati Children's. But the vaccines were not made with cells of any kind, Frenck said, and talk of the vaccines being connected to use of fetal cells is \"totally nonsense.\" Antibody testing conducted with regular patients since the trials do not use this method or fetal cells, he said. [Pope Francis has been vaccinated, for example, and the Catholic Church encourages](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/08/18/pope-francis-covid-19-vaccination-psa-coronavirus/8171706002/) people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Francis said in an August public service announcement that getting the vaccine is \"an act of love.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has [a webpage dedicated to debunking other myths](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html?s_cid=10495:covid%20vaccine%20facts:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21) about the COVID-19 vaccines. The center maintains the following as facts: - Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is a safer and more dependable way to build immunity to COVID-19 than getting sick with COVID-19. - COVID-19 vaccines do not create or cause variants of the virus. - COVID-19 vaccines do not contain microchips. - Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will not make you magnetic, including at the site of vaccination which is usually your arm. - COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. - The vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19. Unvaccinated individuals are 'taking a big chance' with their health: doctor In total, nearly 2,500 students and more than 400 employees at UC were granted exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine between September 2021 and February 2022. Not all of the nonmedical requests were for religious reasons. One student's request, approved by the university, described an aversion to Western medicine in favor of holistic healing practices. The student wrote they do not take over-the-counter medications like aspirin or Tylenol and have never received a vaccine. \"If I were to take a vaccine, I would feel that I had betrayed my body,\" the student wrote. \"I cannot imagine how I would be able to function if I were to violate my body in that way.\" Other students and employees said the thought of getting the vaccine gave them anxiety, or that they wanted more time to do their own research on the vaccine and virus: - \"Ever since being presented with the opportunity to get the vaccine, it has brought much stress and anxiety for me ... my anxiety goes through the roof with thought of having to get it.\" - \"Not knowing what the vaccine will do to my body 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year and so on will add to my constant anxiety already present in my life.\" - \"I have made it through from the start of the pandemic without contact to covid. So my thoughts are I can control my environment but there is no control if I take the vaccine and have a bad reaction.\" While Frenck recognizes there are valid religious exemptions or medical exemptions that may exist if someone is allergic to a vaccine (which he says is extremely rare), he said most of the aversion to the vaccine stems from fear of the vaccine being made \"too quickly\" and questions as to its safety. \"It can be a very deadly virus,\" Frenck said. \"And to rely on your immune system (alone) is taking "}
