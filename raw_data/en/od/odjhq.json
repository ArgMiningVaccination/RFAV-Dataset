Accreditation SACS-COC The University of South Florida St. Petersburg is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the baccalaureate and master's levels. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 40044-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. AACSB The Kate Tiedemann College of Business is accredited by AACSB International - the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business in both business and accounting. AACSB International is the premier accrediting agency for bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in business administration and accounting, and as such is the most widely-recognized and sought-after endorsement of business schools. Less than one-third of U.S. business school programs and only 15 percent of business school programs worldwide meet the rigorous standards for AACSB accreditation. NCATE The College of Education is accredited under the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) Standards, through the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) accreditation system. Formed in 2013, CAEP is the single specialized accreditor for educator preparation, and administers NCATE accreditation. ACEJMC The Department of Journalism and Digital Communication at USF St. Petersburg is one of 115 journalism programs nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. ACEJMC is the national accrediting body for professional programs in journalism and mass communications. Journalism and Digital Communications (first founded in 1991 as Journalism and Media Studies), was received its initial accreditation for both its undergraduate and graduate programs in 2004, and was reaccredited for seven more years in 2010. About 25 percent of all journalism and mass communications programs in the United States are fully accredited. A far smaller percentage of programs are accredited at both the undergraduate and master's level. 29 Section 3 - Graduate Admissions Graduate Admissions University of South Florida St. Petersburg Office of Graduate Studies 140 Seventh Avenue South - PNM St. Petersburg, Nicki University Admissions Criteria and Policies Also see Regulation USF3-008: Admission of graduate and post-baccalaureate professional students; http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf3.008.pdf Statement of Principles In graduate admissions decisions, multiple sources of information should be used to ensure fairness, promote diversity and balance the limitations of any single measure of knowledge, skills or abilities. The sources may include: undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommendation, personal statements, samples of academic work, portfolios, auditions, professional experience related to proposed graduate study, as well as nationally known, standardized test scores. It is the responsibility of each graduate program to select admissions criteria that best predict success in their specific field and to determine the weight given to each measure. None of the sources of information, particularly standardized test scores, should be used in isolation nor should such scores be used in combination or separately to establish minimum or \"cut off\" scores. Program-specific guidelines for the use of standardized test scores should be developed based on the experience of a given department with its pool of applicants1. 1Adapted from the GRE \"Guide to the Use of Scores, 2003-2003.\" Admission Requirements Each applicant to a graduate program at USF St. Petersburg is required to meet the following minimum requirements. Graduate programs often require additional information and supporting documents; applicants should consult with the desired program of interest for additional requirements: Must have earned a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution with either a: \"B\" average or better in all work attempted while registered as an undergraduate student working toward a baccalaureate degree, OR 30 \"B\" average or better in all work attempted while registered as an upper division undergraduate student working toward a baccalaureate degree, OR A bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution AND a graduate degree with a \"B\" average or better from a regionally accredited institution OR The equivalent bachelors and/or graduate degrees from a foreign institution. Bachelor's degrees from institutions in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) are considered equivalent based on the Bologna Accord. For applicants with a 3-year Bachelor's Degree with less than 120 hours, from Non-Bologna Accord institutions, a transcript evaluation from a NACES member is required to confirm equivalency. Submission of standardized test scores if required by the graduate program to which admission is sought. Refer to individual major admission requirements for more information. English Proficiency for International Applicants* Applicants from countries where English is not the official language must also demonstrate proficiency in English in one of the following ways: a. By providing a minimum total score of 79 or higher on the internet-based test, a score of 213 or higher on the computer-based test, or a score of 550 or higher on the paper-based test, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). b. By providing a score of 6.5 or higher on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). c. By earning a score of 153 or higher on the GRE Verbal Exam. d. By earning a baccalaureate or higher degree from a regionally-accredited institution in the U.S. e. By earning a score of 53 or higher on the Pearson Test of English Academics (PTE-A). f. Applicants who earn a baccalaureate or equivalent degree at a foreign institution where English is the language of instruction (for the institution, not just for the program) may meet this requirement. However, other related factors (including test scores) will also be considered. Medium of instruction must be documented on the transcript or an original Certificate of Medium Instruction from the institution. g. All specific and additional requirements of the graduate program to which admission is sought (including requirements to submit standardized test scores) consistent with the above Statement of Principles. The Graduate Program Advisor and the College Dean must approve any exceptions to these requirements before they will be considered by the Office of Graduate Studies. The reason for the waiver and related documentation must be included on the Graduate Application Referral (GAR) form. *International student who are seeking employment as a teaching assistant (in departments that offer them) must meet additional English language requirements. Additional Requirements for International Applicants In addition to meeting the published application deadlines for the program of interest, all immigration documents should be submitted as soon as possible, but must be on file with USFSP no later than the following processing deadlines: 31 International Applicants Applying from Outside of the U.S.: Fall Semester admission - May 1 (VISA deadline: June 27) Spring Semester admission - September 15 (VISA deadline: November 16) Summer Semester admission - January 15 (VISA deadline: March 21) International Applicants Applying from Within the U.S.: Fall Semester admission - May 1 (VISA deadline: July 11) Spring Semester admission - October 15 (VISA deadline: October 30) Summer Semester admission - February 16 (VISA deadline: April 4) Note: For programs with later admission applications deadlines, all materials, including application and supporting documents, must be submitted by the international processing deadlines noted above. Foreign applicants who are outside of the U.S. are required to apply for a VISA. Depending upon the country of origin, this may take a few months. Therefore, the deadline for these international applicants may be earlier than the program admissions deadline and these applicants must apply prior to both the admission and VISA deadlines. Foreign applicants who are in the U.S. and are currently on VISA may use the domestic application deadline dates. Application Process Graduate applicants are urged to submit accurate and complete information as early as possible. Applications and supporting documents received after the published deadline may be processed for the next available term. Both the Office of Graduate Studies and the graduate program for which the application is submitted review applications for admission to the program. Once the graduate program determines an applicant's eligibility, a recommendation is forwarded to the Office of Graduate Studies who will issue an official decision. For foreign applicants, the Office of Graduate Studies with work with International Student Services to review financial statements once the student has been admitted to determine eligibility for a student VISA. Each of these offices may request additional documents to make an admissions decision.

Test Scores If standardized test scores are a requirement of admission to a graduate program, only scores of tests taken within five (5) years of the desired term of entry will be accepted. Some programs will waive the standardized test requirement if another measure can be used to determine the potential for success in the program. Specific program requirement regarding standardized testing may be accessed here: http://www.usfsp.edu/graduate-studies/#toggle-id-5. Official scores must be submitted directly to the institution by the testing agency. However, applicants may provide unofficial copies of their test score to expedite the processing of their applications while awaiting the transmission of official scores.

A late registration fee is charged during this week. To avoid cancelation of registration, fees and tuition are due and payable for all registered courses of record on the fifth day of classes (end of drop/add period.) Students are responsible for verifying the accuracy of their course registration by the end of the drop/add period (i.e. by the fifth day of classes.) In the event there are courses incorrectly listed or missing on the record, students should go into OASIS and make the necessary corrections. Course registration not corrected by the fifth day of classes will result in liability of tuition and fees. If courses need to be added or dropped after the fifth day of classes, refer to the Add/Drop section of the catalog. Medical Requirements for Registration University Immunization Policy, USF Regulation USF33-002: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-33-002-pdf Forms: http://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-health-services/immunizations/index.aspx Student Health Services is charged with the responsibility of evaluating and maintaining medical requirements for registration for all students at all institutions within the USF system. Florida law (Section 1006.69 Florida Statute) requires that all admitted Florida university students be aware of MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS and HEPITITIS B, two diseases that may be prevented by vaccination. The vaccines for each of these diseases are available at Student Health Services (with locations at both USF Tampa and USF St. Petersburg.) Please refer to http://www.shs.usf.edu/immunizations/aspx for further information. In addition, students residing in on-campus housing must present proof of vaccination against HEPATITIS B or sign a declination of HEPATITIS B proof. According to Florida Administrative Code Rule 6C-6.001(5) \"Each student accepted for admission shall, prior to registration, submit on a form, provided by the institution, a medical history signed by the student.\" As a prerequisite to matriculation or registration, the State University System of Florida requires all students born after 1956 to present documented proof of immunity to MEASLES (Rubeola) and RUBELLA (German Measles.) New admits (international students and US citizens living abroad must show proof of screening for Tuberculosis (TB) within the past year.

Cancelation of Registration for Non-Payment USF Regulation USF4.010, http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf4.0101.pdf Equal Opportunity Policy Diversity and Equal Opportunity: Discrimination and Harassment Policy http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf4.0101.pdf DEO website: http://usfweb2.usf.edu/eoa Phone: (813) 974-4373 The University of South Florida System (USF System) is a diverse community that values and expects respect and fair treatment of all people. The USF System strives to provide a work and study environment for faculty, staff and students that is free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, marital status, sex, religion, national origin, disability, age, or genetic information, as provided by law. The USF System protects its faculty, staff and students from discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, as well as gender orientation and expression. The USF System is also committed to the employment and 42 advancement of qualified veterans with disabilities and veterans protected under the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act, as amended (VEVRAA), as part of the effort to maintain an environment that is comfortable for all people and to ensure consistency with state and federal laws. Discrimination, harassment and retaliation are prohibited at the University, and complaints of such conduct are to be filed with the office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. (\"DEO\") or the office of student rights and responsibilities (OSRR) or the appropriate student affairs office at the campus or institution where the discrimination or harassment occurred. The designated office will review such complaints and provide appropriate response including counseling, mediation, and/or referral for disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment and/or expulsion from the USF System. In addition, DEO and OSRR will, as part of their internal processes, report any conduct that may be criminal in nature, such as bias-motivated crimes, to the appropriate law enforcement entities as set forth in section [IV.B] of USF policy 0.007. A student or employee who believes that he or she has not been treated in accordance with the University's Equal Educational and Employment Opportunity Policy or its Policy on Sexual Harassment may file an Equal Opportunity Complaint. Additional information about these procedures may be obtained from the Diversity and Equal Opportunity Office, Human Resources, BAY 206, or by calling 727-873-4105. It is prohibited for any administrator, supervisor, or other employee of USF to take any retaliatory action against an individual who, in good faith, has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under provisions of applicable law. Student Ombuds - BOG Regulation 6.011 PNM 104B (727) 873-4184 studentombuds@usfsp.edu The Ombuds Offices at USFSP provide confidential, impartial, independent and informal resources for students and employees (staff, faculty, administration, and temporary) to discuss concerns regarding their experience at USFSP and to explore alternatives for resolving problems or complaints through informal means. The Ombuds Office function under the following standards of practice: CONFIDENTIALITY In order to create a space to voice concerns, the evaluate issues, and generate options, the Ombuds maintain privacy and hold all communication with those seeking assistance in strict confidence unless given permission to do so and to the extent permitted by law and University policy. IMPARTIALITY As an appointed neutral party, the Ombuds do no side with any individual, the University, or other parties involved and consider the interests and concerns of all parties with goal of achieving fair and equitable solutions. INDEPENDENCE The Ombuds offices operate independent of administrative authorities. 43 INFORMALITY As informal resources, the Ombuds Offices do not participate in any formal adjudicative procedures or processes, including legal. EXPRESSING CONCERN Please call the Ombuds for an appointment if you are USFSP student or employee and can't figure out where to go to get a problem resolved; or aren't sure if you want to pursue a formal complaint; or want help dealing with an issue in an informal way; or want to rehearse your plan for dealing with a concern with a confidential, neutral listener. ACTIVE LISTENING Using active listening techniques, the Ombuds helps visitors describe their concerns, become aware of USFSP and USF System resources that might be helpful to them, and consider their options for how to address their concerns. The Ombuds works to empower individuals to best advocate for themselves. Except in the unusual circumstances described below, the Ombuds will not reveal the identity of a visitor. The Ombuds is not part of any formal complaint process, does not carry forward formal complaints, and does not advocate for any party in a dispute. However, with agreement of all relevant parties, the Ombuds may serve as a neutral participant in conversations including these parties. For example, the Ombuds may attend, but not participate in, a Student Code of Conduct hearing with the reporting student or may accompany a student who wishes to discuss a concern with a professor. CONFIDENTIALITY The Ombuds keeps visits as confidential as is legally possible. During a conversation, the Ombuds may jot down a few notes for the Ombud's personal use. If the Ombuds agrees to attend a meeting or hearing with a visitor, that person will be asked to provide a written request that indicates consent. The Ombuds keeps records on the number of visits, whether the visitor is a student or an employee, and the nature of concerns, but does not include any identifying information in those records. As the Ombuds Office protects confidentiality and does not keep identifying information, the Ombuds cannot serve as an \"Office of Record,\" or and \"Office of Notice.\" The Ombuds will, however, direct individuals to the appropriate offices to file official complaints. The only way a visitor's confidentiality would be broken is if there is imminent threat of serious harm or if required by law. For example, the Ombuds would contact the USFSP police department if the Ombuds believed the life of the visitor or lives of others were at risk. Another example is that the Ombuds is legally required to report known or suspected child abuse.

Graduate Certificate Seeking Students Students who have been accepted into a Graduate Certificate program. Students who are non-degree seeking, but who are admitted to a Graduate Certificate may register during the same registration period as Degree Seeking students. For more information on Graduate Certificates, please visit the Graduate Studies website: https://www.usfsp.edu/academics/graduate-certificates/ Non-Degree Seeking Students Non-Degree Seeking students are students who have not been accepted into a degree program or Graduate Certificate program. Non-Degree Seeking students may enroll and enter classes on a space available basis by obtaining appropriate approval from the degree-granting college or academic unit in which the courses are offered. Non-Degree Seeking students must meet all prerequisites for courses in which they wish to enroll. Certain classes are available only to degree seeking students and may not be available for Non-Degree Seeking students. Should a student be accepted into a graduate degree program, no more than 12 hours of credit taken at any USF system institution earned as a Non-Degree Seeking student may be applied to satisfy graduate degree requirements. All coursework transferred into the graduate program must have a grade of B or better. Any application of such credit must be approved by the degree-granting college and must be appropriate to the major. For more information, refer to the Transfer of Credit policy in the Academic Policies Section. Prior to completing twelve (12) hours in a specific degree program it is strongly 47 recommended that a Non-Degree Seeking Student apply for admission and be accepted to the degree program to continue taking courses in the program. Programs may have additional requirements; students should check with the program of interest for more information. Transient Student Transient Student Policy USF 10-001 Transient Student Policy: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-10-001.pdf The State University System (SUS) Transient Student program enables a graduate student to take advantage of resources available on other SUS campuses. A Transient Student, by mutual agreement of the appropriate academic authorities in both the sponsoring and hosting institutions, receives a waiver of admission requirements and application fee at the host institution and a guarantee of acceptance of earned credits by the sponsoring institution. A graduate advisor, who will initiate a visiting arrangement with the appropriate faculty of the host institution, must recommend a transient student. USF St. Petersburg degree-seeking students who wish to enroll at another regionally accredited institution (other than USF system institutions) MUST HAVE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL from their college academic advisor to receive credit for courses taken. Transient Student Form: http://www.registrar.usf.edu/forms/TSF2008-0407_16_17_06.pdf Graduate Assistantships (GA), Research Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantships (TA). Graduate Assistantships are intended to recruit quality students to graduate study at USF St. Petersburg and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist within academic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assistants may teach, conduct research, or perform other tasks that contribute to the student's professional development. Graduate students may be classified as Graduate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GTAs), Graduate Instructional Assistants (GIAs), and/or Graduate Research Assistants/Associates (GRAs). All graduate assistants at USF St. Petersburg work under a contract negotiated between Graduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduate assistants at USF system institutions. To receive an assistantship, graduate students must meet the following eligibility requirements: Be accepted into a graduate major degree seeking program; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and degree program GPA of 3.00; Maintain full-time enrollment during the semester(s) appointed as a graduate assistant. For teaching assistantships, demonstrate proficiency in spoken English (if student is not from an English speaking country). Full-time enrollment is considered to be enrollment in nine (9) graduate credit hours in the fall semester, nine (9) graduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the full-time requirement. Graduate assistants must comply with all Graduate School enrollment requirements to retain their assistantship as stated in the USF St. Petersburg Graduate Catalog. For specifics regarding Graduate Assistantship requirements, guidelines, and policies, refer to the Academic Policies Section of this catalog and also the Graduate Studies web resources available on the USF St. Petersburg Graduate Admissions website: https://www.usfsp.edu/graduate-studies/graduate-assistantships/. 48 Student Identification Card (USFCard) Policy Reference: USF 0-517 - http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-0-517.pdf University policy requires all students obtain and carry the USFCard while on campus. The USFCard is primarily used for identification, for verification of USF status, and for using University services, such as the Library, the 23 purchase of parking decals, obtaining passes for University sporting and theatrical events, and other related events/services. USFCards may be obtained at the USF St. Petersburg ID Card Center located in the Nelson Poynter Memorial Library-POY 221. For questions call: (727) 873-4409 or visit their website: http://www.dl.usf.edu/npml/usfid.html.

Academic Record The student's academic record shall not be changed after the student has graduated. Except in cases of administrative error, the student's academic record shall not be changed once the semester has rolled. 49 Release of Student Information Pursuant to requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the following types of information, designated by law as \"directory information,\" may be released via official media of USF St. Petersburg or the USF system (according to USF System regulation USF2.0021 Student records): Student name, local and permanent addresses, telephone listing, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, full- and part-time status, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended, and other similar information. The University Directory, published annually by the University, contains only the following information, however: student name, local and permanent address, telephone listing, classification, and major field of study. The Directory and other listings of \"directory information\" are circulated in the course of University business and, therefore, are accessible to the public, as well as to students, faculty, and staff. Students must inform the USF Office of the Registrar in writing (forms available for that purpose), if they wish directory information to be withheld. Such requests must be received within the first two (2) weeks of the semester and will remain in effect until the student has not been enrolled at USF for three (3) consecutive terms. Notification to the University of refusal to permit release of \"directory information\" via the University Directory must be received no later than the end of the first week of classes in the Fall Semester. Exclusions Members or former members of the faculty who hold or have held the rank of Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor are not eligible to be granted degrees from USF St. Petersburg, except upon prior authorization of the Office of Graduate Studies and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. In cases where a member of the immediate family of a faculty member is enrolled in a graduate degree program, the faculty member may not serve on any advisory or examination committee or be involved in any determination of academic or financial status of that individual. Course Information Academic Credit Hours Reference - USF Policy 10-065 http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-10-065.pdf Florida Statute 6A-10.033 - https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ruleno.asp?id=6A-10.033. Academic credit provides the basis for quantifying the amount of engaged learning time expected of a typical student enrolled in traditional classroom settings, laboratories, studios, internships and other forms of experiential learning, and distance and correspondence education. Credit hours are a measure of learning, and support a wide range of activities, including the transfer of students from one institution to another, awarding financial aid, and credentialing for employment. Because of the significance of awarding credit hours, an institution is obligated to ensure that credit hours for courses and majors conform to the commonly accepted standards of higher education, as stated in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) Federal Requirements 4.9 (Definition of Credit Hour) (http://sacscoc.org/pdf/081705/Credit%20Hours.pdf) and the SACSCOC Credit Hours Policy Statement. This Policy is intended to ensure that all credit bearing courses and programs offered by the 50 University of South Florida System (USF System) meet the requirements of the Federal definition of a credit hour and the Credit Hours Policy Statement issued by the SACSCOC. In determining the maximum number of credits that may be assigned to a course, the following guidelines apply: For courses taught in a \"traditional\" classroom format in a 15-week semester, the maximum number of credits to be assigned is limited to the weekly number of 50-minute contact periods (or their equivalent) with the instructor. Underlying this statement is an assumption that each 50-minute contact period requires a minimum additional two hours of student work outside of the class involving reading, exercises, etc. Where this assumption does not hold true (as may be the case with some laboratories, for example), then the maximum number of credits may be significantly less than the weekly number of 50-minute contact periods. o For a lecture class, one unit is considered to be one hour of lecture class time and two hours per week of homework. For the typical three-unit class, a student spends three hours per week in class and should do six hours per week of homework. The total number of class contact hours per semester equals the credit hours multiplied by 15 weeks. o For a laboratory class, the hours per week are considered to be all in class with no outside assignments. Thus, one unit is three hours per week of laboratory time. o Where a course includes \"by arrangement lab hours,\" these generally take the place of the hours assigned to homework, since the student is required to use supervised college facilities to do assignments related to homework. An example might be a 3-unit lecture course which requires the student also to work two hours per week in the computer lab. There would be only four hours per week of additional homework required. In all cases, but particularly in cases such as online learning where seat time is non-verifiable, credit hours are awarded on the basis of documented student learning outcomes that reflect the amount of academically engaged time for a typical student in a traditional format, and on the basis of documentation of the amount and type of work a typical student is expected to complete within a specified period of academically engaged time. The number of credit hours awarded is based on the number and/or rigor of student learning outcomes, with the higher number of credit hours awarded yielding greater number and/or rigor of outcomes. Availability of Courses USF St. Petersburg does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this catalog unless there is sufficient demand to justify them. Some courses may be offered only in alternate semesters or years, or even less frequently if there is little demand. Course Attendance at First Class Meeting - Policy for Graduate Students Students are required to attend the first class meeting, for both online and on-campus courses. Students having extenuating circumstances beyond their control and who are unable to attend the first class meeting must notify the instructor prior to the first class meeting to request an exception to the mandatory first class attendance requirement and to ensure that they are not dropped from the course. To avoid fee liability and academic penalty, the student is responsible for insuring that he/she has dropped or been dropped from all undesired courses by the end of the 5th day of classes. (See USF 51 Regulation - Registration - 4.0101, http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf4/0101.pdf. Attendance Policy for the Observance of Religious Days by Students In accordance with Sections 1006.53 and 1001.74(10) (g) Florida Statutes and Board of Governors Regulation 6C-6.0115, the University of South Florida system has established the following policy regarding religious observances: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations-and-policies/regulations-policies-procedures.asp Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in accordance with this policy. Students absent for religious reasons, as noticed to the instructor at the beginning of each academic term, will be given reasonable opportunities to make up any work missed. In the event that a student is absent for religious reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, pop quiz, etc.), the student shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make up such work or shall not have that work averaged into the student's grade at the discretion of the instructor. Any student who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly with regard to the above may seek review of a complaint through established USF System Academic Grievance Procedures (found in the Graduate Catalog) and those provided by the University's Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. Course Concurrency All courses, with the exception of those approved for transfer of credit, should meet the time limit specified for the degree and be academically relevant as determined by the faculty in the graduate major. Courses used for the graduate degree requirements can be no more than ten years old at the time the degree is conferred. Course Descriptions For a listing of the most current, approved course descriptions refer to the USF Course Inventory Database available online at http://ugs.usf.edu/course-inventory or in the course description listing in the Graduate Catalog. Adds After a student has completed his/her registration on the date assigned, he/she may add a course during the drop/add week (i.e. through the fifth day of classes) using the OASIS system. Courses may be added with instructor approval and verification up to the last day to withdraw without academic penalty. See Academic Calendar for deadlines. Courses may not be added after the deadline to withdraw without academic penalty or retroactively except in cases of University Administrative error. Drops/Withdrawals Drops A student may drop a course(s) during the drop/add periods (first five days of classes) in order for the course(s) not to appear on any permanent academic records. No tuition or fees will be assessed for courses(s) dropped within that period. Courses may not be dropped after the last day of classes except in the case of University Administrative Error. Withdrawal 52 A student may withdraw from a course(s) between the second and tenth week of the semester (except for summer sessions - see the Summer Schedule of Classes for dates). However, tuition and fees will be assessed for any course(s) withdrawn by the student after the first week. The student's academic record will reflect a \"W\" grade for any course(s) withdrawn between the second and the tenth week of the semester. Under specific conditions, consideration for refund of tuition and fees may be requested if a Fee Adjustment Request form accompanied by verifiable supporting documentation is submitted to the Office of the Registrar within six (6) months from the end of the semester to which any refund would be applicable. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Effective Fall 2016, all graduate students will be limited to a total of two course withdrawals while enrolled as a degree-seeking or a non-degree seeking student taking graduate courses at USF St. Petersburg. Appeals for additional course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies via the Graduate Petition process. Fee Adjustment Options Students who receive approval to drop a course during the second through tenth week of classes are liable for tuition and fees. However, the student may apply for a Fee Adjustment through the Registrar's Office if the student has any of the exceptional circumstances listed above. The Fee Adjustment form may be submitted after the petition to drop is approved and processed. The Registrar will determine if a fee/tuition refund is applicable. Deletes A \"delete\" completely removes the course from the record with no history that it was ever part of the student's record. Courses will not be deleted from a student's record except in cases of University Administrative error. Requests for course deletions must be submitted only during the semester in which the error has occurred and only with written explanation from college faculty or administrative staff verifying the error. Such requests must be submitted by the last day of classes and approved by the College Dean or designee and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs or designee. Retroactive requests for course deletions will not be approved. Faculty and students are encouraged to review course enrollment to verify accuracy of registration. In the event of extenuating circumstances such as documented medical emergencies, military leave or University error, students may request special consideration for deletions in writing to the USF St. Petersburg Office of Graduate Studies. Retroactive Actions Requests for retroactive actions will no longer be considered/approved. Also see Academic Record. Auditing Privileges and Fees A student who wishes to sit in on a class to review the course material may do so; however, the student is not allowed to take exams, earn grades, or receive credit. The student's status for that class is an audit and his/her presence in the classroom is as a listener. Audit status must be obtained only during the first five days of the term by submitting an Audit Form and receiving a date-stamped permit from the college/department where the course is being offered. Audit forms should be submitted to the Office of Records and Registration. IN-STATE fees are assessed for all audit courses. Procedure and forms for requesting to audit are available on the Office of Records and Registration website: http://www.usfsp.edu/records 53 Cancellation of Registration before First Class Meeting Students may cancel their registration by notifying the Office of Registration and Records in writing prior to the first day of classes. If fees have already been paid, the student may request a full refund of fees and tuition through the Cashier's Office: (727) 873-4107. Voluntary Withdrawal (from the major) A student may voluntarily withdraw from their graduate major. A Voluntary Withdrawal cannot be retroactive. The effective date of the withdrawal will be entered into the student's record by the Office of the Registrar as the first business day after the end of the semester. Students who wish to withdraw must submit a Voluntary Withdrawal Form, available from the Office of Graduate Studies (www.usfsp.edu/graduate-studies). Once processed, the student's status will be changed from Graduate Degree Seeking to Non-Degree Seeking. A change to Non Degree Seeking status could adversely impact financial aid. Questions regarding the impact on financial aid should be directed to the Financial Aid Office at (727) 873-4128. Students will remain financially and academically responsible for any course(s) they have registered for. Students may request to drop or delete courses by submitting an Office of Graduate Studies petition. Academic Dismissal Students may be academically dismissed from their graduate degree program for a variety of reasons. Once processed, the student's status will be changed from Graduate Degree Seeking to Non Degree Seeking. A change to Non Degree Seeking could adversely impact financial aid. Dismissal cannot be retroactive. The effective date will be entered into the student's record by the Office of the Registrar as the first business day after the end of the semester, except in cases of academic dismissal due to academic dishonesty or disruption of academic process. Some of the reasons for academic dismissal include*: Failure to successfully satisfy requirements to meet Conditional Admission by the deadline established by the program. Receiving an \"FF\" grade Failure to maintain \"good standing\" Failure to make satisfactory progress. *Students may be dismissed for other reasons, such as violations of student conduct. Refer to the USF system Code of Student Conduct USF - 6.0021 http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf6.0021.pdf To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at any USF system institution. 54 Section 5 - Tuition, Fees and Financial Information Tuition Information Tuition and Fees Regulation: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf4.0102.pdf For tuition information refer to the link: http://www.usf.edu/business-finance/controller/student-services/tuition-rates.aspx All registration fees and all courses added during the drop/add period must be paid in full by the payment deadline date specified in the current Schedule of Classes.

While advisors, directors, department chairpersons, and deans are available to assist the student meet these requirements, it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing the requirements. If requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. The information presented here represents the University Academic Policies. Colleges and departments may have additional requirements. Check with your College Graduate Advisor or your Department Director for more information. Courses, major, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the Board of Trustees. For a list of current course descriptions, refer to the USF Course inventory database online at https://www.systemacademics.usf.edu/course-inventory Student Conduct Members of the University community support high standards of individual conduct and human relations. Responsibility for one's own conduct and respect for the rights of others are essential conditions for academic and personal freedom within the University. USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to deny admission or refuse enrollment to students whose actions are contrary to the purposes of the University or impair the welfare or freedom of other members of the University community. Disciplinary procedures are followed when a student fails to exercise responsibility in an acceptable manner or commits an offense as outlined in the Student Code of Conduct. Refer to USF 6.0021, Student Code of Conduct at http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regultaion-usf6.0021.pdf. Responsible Conduct in Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Intellectual and Scholarship Integrity Shared Authorship and Research Education Policy USF St. Petersburg contains a broad range of academic majors in diverse disciplines, and the USFSP faculty recognize that the conventions on shared authorship and credit for scholarship vary among disciplines. In general, sharing in authorship implies both substantive intellectual contributions to the work and also approval of the work as it appears in public. Right to authorship credit is not automatically conveyed by being the instructor of a course, being a student's major professor, or being a research assistant working with faculty and professional researchers; neither is credit automatically prohibited because of such status. 56 Each college/program that includes research education shall include an explicit discussion of shared authorship issues and disciplinary conventions as part of the formal curriculum addressing research methods and ethics, including the conventions of the discipline's publications. In addition, each college or program shall have a formal statement about shared authorship made available to students (such as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about other program and college expectations. Each college/program shall also have a written procedure for resolving questions or conflicts about shared authorship where students are involved. The college and program may use the same procedure for resolving questions for non-student employees, but the procedure for resolving questions or conflicts involving students must address the educational needs of students (e.g., explicitly asking about the nature of the research methods and ethics education as experienced by a student involved in the case at hand). This written procedure must be made available to students (such as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about other program and university expectations. Academic Integrity of Students Reference: USF Regulation USF 3.027 - To read the entire regulation, go to: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf3.027.pdf. Please note the sections that specifically pertain to graduate students. Disruption of Academic Process Reference: USF Regulation USF 3.025: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf3.025.pdf Student Academic USF 10.002 Student Academic Grievance Procedure http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations-and-policies/regulations-policies-procedures.asp For matters that are not academic in nature, reference USF 30-053 Student Grievance Processes and Non-Academic Grievance Policy: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-30-053.pdf. Graduate Catalog The USF St. Petersburg Graduate Catalog, including college and major requirements, and major and course descriptions, is available on the web at https://www.usfsp.edu/catalog/. Each Catalog is published and in effect for the academic term(s) noted on the title page. Student's Program Degree Requirements In order to graduate, students must meet all requirements specified in the USF St. Petersburg Catalog of their choice, except as noted below. As the University is dynamic, changes and updates to the catalog 57 are anticipated. In contract to major requirements, which are tied to a specific catalog, all students must comply with University policies and procedures that come into effect each catalog year. Students cannot choose a USF St. Petersburg Catalog published prior to admission (or readmission) or during an academic year in which they did not complete at least two terms. If a student is dropped from the system and must be reinstated, the student's choice of Catalog is limited to the USF St. Petersburg Catalog in effect at the time of readmission or any one Catalog published during their continuous re-enrollment. If state law or certification requirements change, the student must comply with the most current standards or criteria. If the College or program makes fundamental changes to the major that necessitates changes in the degree requirements of enrolled students, the needs of those students will be explicitly addressed in the proposal for change and scrutinized by the Office of Graduate Studies. USF St. Petersburg and USF system policies and procedures not related to degree requirements such as academic grievance procedures, student conduct code and other procedural processes and definitions may be updated each year and the student will be held to the most current catalog and procedures available. USF St. Petersburg does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this Catalog. If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the Catalog of choice as a result of decisions and changes made by the University, appropriate substitutions will be determined by the program to ensure that the student is not penalized. Student/Advisor Relationship Although it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements, the Advisor's role is to guide students in all aspects of their academic major and to monitor and evaluate students' progress toward their degrees. He/she should be aware of any difficulties that students may be facing in their coursework or research experiences and should work with students in resolving these issues. It is recommended that the advisor and student understand each other's expectations and that effective means of communication are established. The advisor and student are encouraged to meet at appropriate intervals to critically evaluate the student's progress. These meetings may be requested by the student or the advisor. The advisor also has the obligation to express to the student any concerns he/she may have regarding the student's performance, to stipulate the level and quality of work expected, and to offer suggestions leading to student success. As such, the advisor neither gives the student excessive guidance nor allows the student to struggle needlessly. The goal of this relationship is to foster student independence, which results in successful completion of the program of study. Student's Program of Study In addition to the graduate major requirements as specified in the Graduate Catalog, each student should have a written, flexible program of study that includes the student's choice of catalog year, choice of concentration, cognate, or other options available in the major, and a tentative identification of other appropriate choices available to the student in the program, which may (but does not need to), include specific courses. A program of study is not a guarantee that specific courses will be available in a specific semester or that statutory and regulatory requirements will not change during the student's 58 enrollment in the major. As required or appropriate, the program of study should be revisited and modified by the student and the student's advisor/major professor(s). Electronic signatures Where procedures described in this catalog require signatures, requirements for original signatures may be satisfied by University-approved electronic signatures or other secure methods of verifying approvals by advisors, major professors, committee members, or other University administrators, faculty and staff. Assistantships Graduate Assistantships (GA), Research Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantships (TA). Graduate Assistantships are intended to recruit quality students to graduate study at USF St. Petersburg and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist within academic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assistants may teach, conduct research or perform other tasks that contribute to the student's professional development. Graduate students may be classified as Graduate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GTAs), Graduate Instructional Assistants (GIAs), and/or Graduate Research Assistants/Associates (GRAs). All graduate assistants in the USF system work under a contract negotiated by the Graduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF system Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduate assistants in the USF system. Eligibility To receive an assistantship, graduate students must meet the following eligibility requirements: Be accepted into a graduate degree program; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and degree program GPA of 3.00; Be enrolled full-time during the semester(s) appointed as a graduate assistant; Teaching assistants must demonstrate proficiency in spoken English (if student is not from an English speaking country). Maintain a satisfactory work performance evaluation for all previous work performed as a Graduate Assistant. Appointments Graduate Assistants (GA) may be appointed up to a maximum of .50 FTE for a single assistantship. Majors who desire to appoint a graduate student, in any classification more than .50 FTE up to .75 FTE, for single or multiple appointments, must submit justification to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. Students hire in non-GA positions on campus must also not exceed .75 FTE for the combined position and assistantship appointments. It is preferred that students refrain from employment outside of the assistantship appointment. Departments may determine the maximum number of semesters for teaching assistant appointments. Enrollment (Assistantships) Full-time enrollment is considered nine (9) graduate credit hours in the fall semester, nine (9) graduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the full-time requirement. Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate Studies enrollment requirements to retain their assistantship as state in the Graduate 59 Catalog. For specifics regarding Graduate Assistantship requirements, guidelines and policies, refer to the USF System Graduate Assistants Policies and Guidelines Handbook. Note: Criminal history background checks may be required depending upon the appointment. Reference USF Policy 0-615. http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-0-615.pdf. Enrollment Requirements Students receiving Veterans' Administration benefits should confirm their enrollment requirements with the Office of Veterans' Services or Veterans' Coordinator. Minimum University Regulations USF Full-Time Student Definition Students taking nine (9) or more hours toward their degree in the fall or spring semester, or taking six (6) or more hours in the summer semester, will be classified as Full-Time students for academic purposes. For financial aid requirements, contact the Office of Financial Aid. Students may not take more than 18 graduate credit hours per semester without prior written approval by the college. For financial aid enrollment requirements, refer to the Office of Financial Aid http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/enrollment.aspx. Continuous Enrollment for All Graduate Students All graduate degree-seeking students must be continuously enrolled. Continuous enrollment is defined as completing, with grades assigned, a minimum of 6 hours of graduate credit every three consecutive semesters. Courses that receive a \"W\" grade do not fulfill continuous enrollment requirements. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Students on an approved leave of absence are not subject to the enrollment requirement for the time approved for the leave. See also the Time Limitations Policy. Readmission Following Non-enrollment A graduate student who is not registered and enrolled for a minimum of six (6) credits in a 12-month period is automatically placed in non-degree seeking (i.e. inactive) status. Students must be readmitted to the major to continue their studies. Readmission is at the discretion of the program and is not guaranteed. Refer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for more information. Enrollment during Comprehensive Exams During the term in which students take the comprehensive exams, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Enrollment during Semester of Thesis Submission Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) thesis hours during the semester that the thesis is submitted and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies, usually the semester of graduation. Students not enrolled for the minimum requirement will not have the thesis approved and therefore may not be certified for graduation. 60 Enrollment during Semester of Graduation Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) graduate hours during the semester of graduation. Enrollment for Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants should be full-time students. Exceptions must be approved by the College Dean and the Office of Graduate Studies. Leaves of Absence (LOA) Leaves of Absence (LOA) may be granted to students under exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. Students requesting a LOA must specify the reasons for the leave, as well as the duration. Requested LOA may be approved for up to two years. Students requiring less than three (3) consecutive terms of absence do not need an approved LOA if they meet the continuous enrollment requirement. Students with an approved LOA must be enrolled in the first semester after the leave expires. To request an LOA, the student must complete and submit the LOA form available on the Graduate Studies website. The LOA must be approved by the Major Professor, the Program, the College, and the Office of Graduate Studies, and is noted in the student's record. If the LOA is granted, the time absent does not count against the student's time limit to obtain the degree. Students returning from an approved LOA must reactivate their status by contacting the Office of Graduate Studies for procedures. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) For Academic Purposes Satisfactory Academic Progress for academic purposes is determined by the progress the student has made in the major toward degree completion, taking into account the curriculum requirements, as well as the time to degree allocations. This is a separate assessment from the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirement for financial aid. For Financial Aid Recipients Reference http://www.usf.edu/financial-aid/sap/index.aspx Reference http://www.ifap/ed/gov/gahome/gaassessments/sap.html Federal regulations require all schools who participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs to have a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy that conforms to specific grade-based and time-based requirements. These requirements apply to all students as one determinant of eligibility for financial aid and include three components: GPA Pace Maximum Time Refer to the Financial Aid websites above for information and requirements. Academic Standards and Grades Minimum University Requirements 61 In Good Standing To be considered \"a student in good standing,\" graduate students must Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken as a graduate student, and Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken in each of the student's degree-seeking programs. Only courses with grades of \"C\" (2.00) or better will be accepted toward a graduate degree; no grade of \"C-\"or below will be accepted. Students must meet the requirements to be in good standing to graduate. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades must be cleared for graduation to be certified. Students who fail to maintain good standing may be placed on probation or academically dismissed. Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded (A-F) hours completed. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W and Z and grades which are preceded by T (Transfer) are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Graduate students are not eligible for grade forgiveness. All grades earned, regardless of course level, will be posted on the transcript. If a student retakes a course, both grades will be used in the determination of the GPA. Courses taken at a USF System Institution as non-degree-seeking are not computed in the GPA unless the courses are transferred in and applied to the degree requirements. The program and the college must approve such actions. Grades for transfer credits accepted toward the degree program will not be counted in the GPA unless the coursework in question was taken as a non-degree-seeking student at a USF system institution and meets the requirements stated above (see Institution Based Credit/Transfer of Credit section). Graduate Grading System Plus/Minus Grading: Effective fall semester 2000, graduate and undergraduate grades are assigned quality points in the Grade Point Average (GPA) grading system. The +/- designation must be included in the syllabus provided at the beginning of a course. The use of the +/- grading system is at the discretion of the instructor. The syllabus policy is available in the office of Academic Affairs. Letter grade = number of grade points A+ 4.00 A 4.00 A- 3.67 3.33 B 1.00 D- .67 F 0.00 FF Failure due to academic dishonesty CF Canceled Financially (Course was canceled due to financial reasons) CMU Canceled, Missing Grade that has turned to a \"U\" IB Incomplete, grade points not applicable IC Incomplete, grade points not applicable ID Incomplete, grade points not applicable IF Incomplete, grade points not applicable* M Missing grade/no grade reported by instructor, grade points not applicable N Audit, grade points not applicable S/U Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, grade points not applicable W Withdrawal or drop from course without penalty, grade points not applicable Z Continuing registration in multi-semester internship or Thesis/Dissertation courses, grade points not applicable *Incomplete grade policy change effective Fall 2008. IF grades earned and posted prior to Fall 2008 do calculate in the GPA; IF grades earned beginning Fall 2008 forward do not calculate in the GPA. Refer to Incomplete Grade Policy for more information. Satisfactory (S)/Unsatisfactory (U) Graduate students may not take courses in the major on an S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory) basis unless courses are specifically designated S/U in the Catalog. Students may take courses outside of the major on an S/U basis with prior approval of the course professor, major professor or advisor, and the Dean of the College in which the student is seeking a degree. The student may apply a maximum of six (6) hours of such credit (excluding those courses for which S/U is designated in the Catalog) toward a master's degree. Directed Research, Thesis, and Dissertation courses are designated as variable credit and are graded on an S/U basis only. Before a student begins work under Directed Research, a written agreement must be completed between the student and the professor concerned, setting forth in detail the requirements of the course. Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. This applies to all gradable courses, including pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: the majority of the student's work for a course has been completed before the end of the semester. the work that has been completed is qualitatively satisfactory the student has requested consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of finals week 63 The student must request consideration for an incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decision on granting a student's request for an incomplete grade. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed one semester from the original date grades were due for that course. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the department that offered the course and the Office of Graduate Studies by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re-register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade. Students may register to audit the course with the instructor's approval, but cannot re-take the course for credit until the \"I\" grade is cleared. The instructor will be required to complete the I-grade contract online when posting the semester grade at the end of the term, identify the remaining coursework to be completed, the students last day of attendance and the percent of work accomplished to this point. This online contract will be automatically copied to the student's email and to the Registrar. An \"I\" grade not cleared within the next academic semester (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. I grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course is taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. When the final grade is assigned, if applicable, the student will be placed on academic probation or academically dismissed (refer to Automated Academic Probation Procedures for information). Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or certified for graduation with an \"I\" grade. Example: Student has a \"B\" in the course, not including the grade for the missing assignment, therefore is eligible for an \"I\" Student's grade, including zero for the missed work, would be a \"D\" Student and instructor complete the \"I\" grade contract, assigning an \"ID\" (Incomplete +D grade) Student earns final grade comprised of all completed course work If the student does not complete the work as agreed upon in the contract by the noted deadline: \"I\" automatically drops off and the \"D\" remains GPA is recalculated for the current semester and retroactively recalculated for the semester in which the \"I\" was granted. *Although the instructor establishes the deadline for completion of the work, the deadline may only extend through the end of the subsequent semester. Missing (M) The University policy is to issue an M grade automatically when the instructor does not submit any grade for a graduate student. Until it is removed, the M is not computed in the GPA. To resolve the missing grade, students receiving an M grade must contact their instructor. If the instructor is not 64 available, the student must contact the instructor's college dean. Courses with an M grade may not be applied to the degree program requirements. Students cannot be certified for graduation with an M grade. Continuing Registration Grades (Z) The Z grade shall be used to indicate continuing registration in multi-semester internship or thesis courses where the final grade to be assigned will indicate the complete sequence of courses or satisfactory completion of the thesis. Upon satisfactory completion of a multi-semester internship or thesis, the final grade assigned will be an S. The Office of Graduate Studies submits the change of grade for the last registration of thesis courses once the thesis has been accepted for publication. Note: Graduation will not be certified until all courses have been satisfactorily completed. No grade changes will be processed after the student has graduated except in the case of university error. Procedures requiring petitions are processed through the Office of Graduate Studies. Probation Any student who is not in good standing at the end of a semester shall be considered on probation as of the following semester. The college or program may also place students on probation for other reasons as designated by the college or program. Notification of probation shall be made to the student in writing by the Office of Graduate Studies, with a copy to the College Dean. At the end of each probationary semester, the department shall recommend, in writing, to the College Dean one of the following: 1. Removal of probation 2. Continued probation; OR 3. Dismissal from the degree program. Students on probation may only enroll in graduate courses (5000-6000 level) that are part of the approved degree requirements specified in the graduate catalog. Students with a GPA below 3.00 for two consecutive semesters will be prevented from registering for courses without the permission of the College Dean. The College Dean will notify the Office of Graduate Studies in cases of academic dismissal. To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. Voluntary Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the university without grade penalty by the University deadline. Information on the different types of withdrawal (i.e., withdrawing from a single class - see the Drop section, an entire semester, or from the degree program itself) can be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies. Appropriate alternative calendar dates may apply. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Transfer of Credit (From institutions External to USF St. Petersburg) Students may transfer graduate-level structured coursework into their graduate major taken at regionally accredited institutions, including USF System institutions (USF Tampa, USF Sarasota/Manatee), with the approval of the graduate major, college and Office of Graduate Studies. May transfer only graduate level (5000-7999) structured coursework with a grade of B (3.00) or better. Courses with pass/fail grades are not eligible for transfer. Grades from courses taken at 65 other institutions are not calculated into the USF GPA, although the courses are listed on the transcript. May transfer in up to 50% of a given graduate major's total minimum hours as reflected in the individual major listings in the USFSP Graduate Catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment for that major. Note - the 50% maximum includes the total of both external transfer of credit and internal application of credit. Individual graduate majors may have more restrictive requirements. Must not have been used for a completed degree. For students with coursework from a completed degree, the specific course requirements in common across both majors may be waived with the substitution of other approved coursework at the discretion of the student's graduate program advisor. Must not be older than ten years at the time of graduation or course currency in required. Approval Process and Deadlines for Transfer of Credit: Acceptance of transfer of credit requires submission of the Transfer of Credit Form and approval of the: Graduate Director College Dean or designee Director of the Office of Graduate Studies or designee The graduate/major department will be responsible for evaluating, approving, and initiating the transfer using established criteria to ensure academic integrity of the coursework. This must be completed and submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies no later than the end of the first semester the student is enrolled in the graduate major. Application of Internal Credit (internal transfer within USF St. Petersburg) Students may request application of internal credit of graduate-level (5000-7999) structured coursework toward their graduate major taken at USF St. Petersburg, with the approval of the graduate major, college and the Office of Graduate Studies for courses taken as: an undergraduate student that were not used as part of the undergraduate degree requirements, except in cases of an accelerated degree program approved through Undergraduate Council, Graduate Council and SACSCOC. a non-degree seeking student (including graduate certificate students, INTO students, etc.) a degree-seeking student, where the student is approved for a change of major to another graduate major. For application of internal credit: May transfer only graduate-level (5000-7999) structured coursework with a grade of B (3.00) or better. Courses with Pass/Fail grades are not eligible for transfer. Grades from courses taken at USFSP are calculated in the USF GPA and are noted on the transcript. 66 May transfer in up to 50% of a given graduate major's total minimum hours as reflected in the individual major listing in the USFSP Graduate Catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment for that major. Note - the 50% maximum includes the total of both external transfer of credit and internal application of credit. Individual graduate majors may have more restrictive requirements. May transfer in the total hours taken as part of a completed Graduate Certificate to the graduate major with major approval. Must not have been used for a completed degree. For students with coursework from a completed degree, the specific course requirements in common across both majors may be waived with the substitution of other approved coursework at the discretion of the major. Must not be older than ten years at the time of graduation or course currency is required. Approval Process and Deadlines for Application of Internal Credit: Acceptance requires completion of the Application of Credit Form and approval of the Graduate Faculty Advisor College Dean or designee Office of Graduate Studies The graduate major/department will be responsible for evaluating, approving, and initiating the application of credit using established criteria to ensure academic integrity of the coursework. This must be completed and submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies no later than the end of the first semester the student is enrolled in the graduate major. Dual Degree Programs A student may pursue two graduate degrees simultaneously through a formal, approved Dual Degree designation. The goal is for a student to attain two graduate degrees. A dual degree designation is required for a student pursuing two separate graduate degrees. Either through an established relationship between two degree programs or through an individualized designation, up to 15% of the total combined credit hours of structured coursework for the two degree programs may be shared, with Department (if applicable), program, College and Office of Graduate Studies approval. With the exception of shared structured coursework, all separate degree requirements must be met (e.g. two theses, one thesis/one applied research project, etc.) Example: A student is enrolled in two master's programs, each requiring 30 credits minimum. The student may share 9 hours (equal to or less than 15%) across the combined 60 total minimum credit hours required. The degrees may be conferred concurrently or sequentially-however, both degrees must be conferred within the time limit for the first degree to which the student is admitted. Procedures for applying for a Dual Degree Program are available through the Office of Graduate Studies. Dual Degree Programs are formalized through the College, Office of Graduate Studies and the USF St. Petersburg Graduate Council. 67 Off-Campus Courses and Programs Graduate courses and programs are offered at locations other than USF Tampa, USF Sarasota-Manatee and USF St. Petersburg. Information on course enrollment procedures for off-campus courses and programs may be obtained from the college in which the courses or programs are offered. 68 Section 7 - University Degree Requirements Degree Requirements The following sections describe the University's minimum requirements established by the Office of Graduate Studies (in conjunction with the Colleges, Programs and the USF St. Petersburg Graduate Council) for Master's degree programs. However, individual programs and colleges may establish additional or more stringent requirements. Student Responsibilities The University of South Florida St. Petersburg and all colleges, departments and programs therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Faculty and graduate program directors are available to help the students understand and help students to arrange to meet these requirements, however, students are responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if all requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain informed throughout their college careers. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF system Board of Trustees. Graduate Faculty Definition The University of South Florida St. Petersburg recognizes Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty. Only Graduate Faculty, and Affiliate Graduate Faculty approved for such purposes, may serve as the Instructor of Record for graduate level courses. Graduate Faculty is defined to consist of all tenure-track or tenured faculty appointed at the Assistant, Associate, or Professor rank, who hold a terminal degree or equivalent in their discipline. Graduate faculty members are eligible to teach graduate courses and may direct and serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership may be granted by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (or designee) to individuals whose skills or expertise meet criteria established by the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership is in effect for a specified period of time and specific purposes. Affiliate members may be eligible to teach graduate courses, to serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees, to direct master's and specialist's level committees, and to co-direct doctoral level committees, at the discretion of the College. Emeritus Professors and retired or recently resigned professors may also be appointed as Affiliate Graduate Faculty with the approval of the College Dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (or designee). Graduate Faculty is defined as noted above; Colleges and Departments may have additional requirements. The Office of Graduate Studies will maintain a list of Graduate Faculty along with approval guidelines from the Colleges and Departments. For a current list of Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty in any program contact the program director or coordinator. Reference: USF Policy 10-115: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-10-115.pdf. 69 Master's Degree Requirements Minimum Hours A minimum of thirty (30) hours is required for a master's degree, at least sixteen (16) hours of which must be at the 6000 level or above (no 7000 level above for master's students); the remaining hours must be at the 5000 level or above. At least twenty (20) hours must be in formal, regularly scheduled course work, ten (10) of which must be at the 6000 level. Lower level undergraduate coursework may not be used to satisfy master's course requirements but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student will be included in the computation of the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. Graduate students may not enroll for more than 18 hours in any semester without written permission from the College Dean. The minimum number of credit hours required for each individuals master's degree program is noted in the degree requirements section of the Graduate Catalog for that program listing. Programs with formally approved concentrations must have major core requirements that all students must successfully complete. Institutional Enrollment Requirement At least 50% of credits toward a master's degree must be earned through instruction offered by the institution granting the degree. Students at USF St. Petersburg are expected to complete the majority of the required credits at USF St. Petersburg. Students are responsible for consulting with their graduate faculty advisor for information on courses that may be taken outside their degree program, as well as the transfer course policy. Although equivalent course may be offered at other institutions, including those within the USF System, they may not satisfy degree requirements. Time Limitations Master's degrees must be completed within five (5) years from the student's date of admission for graduate study. Courses taken prior to admission to the USF St. Petersburg graduate program, for example as non-degree seeking or from other institutions, can be no older than ten years at the time of graduation. Master's (including dual degree programs) that require course work in excess of 50 credit hours may be granted a longer statute of limitations by the University of South Florida St. Petersburg Graduate Council. Time Limit Extension In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Graduate Studies website: http://www.usfsp.edu/grad. Requests must include: the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate program, and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree Note: for the time limit extension procedures, if the time limit extension will cause courses taken within the major to be older than 10 years, then a request for course concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirements, per the time limit policy. 70 If approved, the time limit extension also applies to courses applied toward the degree. However, programs may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition at the time limit extension. Students who exceed the time limitation may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one time limit extension request is permitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave (see the section on Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section). Note: Time limit extensions are valid for a maximum period of two (2) years from the date of request. Enrollment Requirements Refer to the Academic Policies Section Major Professor For students enrolled in programs requiring a thesis or for students selecting the thesis option (where thesis and/or a project is required), the Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the department to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor and receive that person's agreement to serve as major professor. The selection of the Major Professor must be approved and appointed by the department as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a major professor in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a major professor cannot be identified or in the event a major professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another major professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement major professor should confer with the Program Director for available options (including converting to a non-thesis program if available). The major professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements. If no other options exist the student may be requested to voluntarily withdraw from the program or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Major Professors must be graduate faculty, as defined by the University, from the student's academic area. Faculty who do not meet this definition may serve as Co-Major Professor with graduate faculty who do meet the definition. Major Professors must be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements. Major Professors must be approved by the Department Chair (when applicable) or the College Dean to serve as a Major Professor or Co-Major Professor. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e. for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a Co-Major Professor on the committee and another faculty is 71 appointed as the other Co-Major Professor. It is important that one of the Co-Major Professors be accessible on the university campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.), the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Program Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"Co-Major Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, etc.) The membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Director of Graduate Studies. Thesis Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format. Composition The committee will consist of either: the major professor and at least two other members or two co-major professors and at least one other member Committee members should be from the general research area in which the degree is sought. (Colleges and graduate programs may require additional committee members and specify characteristics). Member Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the university and the college/department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate Studies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a Master's Thesis committee. Persons desiring to serve on a Masters committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the university and the college/department must submit a curriculum vitae and be approved by the department, college, and the Office of Graduate Studies for each committee. Committee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate graduate faculty as defined by the University Have the background and expertise that contributes to the success of the student In addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definitions, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Office of Graduate Studies. Approval Once a committee has been determined, a Supervisory Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signatures. Check with the College for 72 instructions and forms. The original appointment form and two (2) copies should be submitted to the College Associate Dean's office for approval. A copy of the approved form should be kept in the student's file. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file in the program/college before graduation may be certified. Committee forms need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. (Colleges and departments may institute additional requirements for membership on Supervisory Committees.) Changes to Committee Changes to a Supervisory Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co-) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co-) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co-) Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgment and approval of the change by the removed member. Any non-faculty being added to a committee must submit a Curriculum Vitae (CV) for college approval. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. Masters Comprehensive Examination Prior to clearance for the degree, candidates must perform satisfactorily on a comprehensive examination or an alternative method designated by the academic unit to measure student competency in the major area. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit during the semester when the comprehensive examination is taken. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Thesis If a thesis is required, it must conform to the guidelines of the University. Refer to the Thesis Guidelines available on the web site of the Office of Graduate Studies at http://www.usfsp.edu/grad for complete information about requirements, procedures, and deadlines. For enrollment requirements, refer to the Academic Policies section in this Catalog. T The Thesis must conform to one of two formats: Option 1- a traditional format inclusive of: Part I: Preliminary Pages Title Page Dedication (optional page) Acknowledgments (optional page) Table of Contents List of Tables (if applicable) List of Figures (if applicable) Abstract Part II: Text (divided by chapter or section headings) Part III: References / Bibliography 73 Appendices Title Page Appendix Sections (if applicable) Option 2 - collection of articles/papers instead of chapters. References may be at the end of each section or at the end of the entire document. Copyright permissions (if applicable) must be noted on the Acknowledgments page. Part I: Preliminary Pages Title Page Dedication (optional page) Acknowledgments and copyright permission (if applicable) Table of Contents Abstract Part II: Introduction Chapter Review Part III: Collection of Articles/Papers Part IV: Conclusion/References/Bibliography Appendices Title Page Appendix Sections (if applicable) Deviations from the available format are acceptable if approved in advance by the Supervisory Committee and the Office of Graduate Studies. *Students must be first author of articles and papers used for the thesis, or another designation or affirmation that the student had primary intellectual responsibility for the publication. Directed Research Directed Research hours may satisfy up to 50% of the thesis hour requirement. Exchange of Thesis for Non-Thesis Credit If a student changes from thesis to non-thesis during a semester and is currently enrolled in thesis credit, the current thesis credits may be exchanged without academic penalty if a Graduate Drop/Add Petition is filed with the Office of Graduate Studies no later than the last day to withdraw without Academic Penalty (see Academic Calendar for applicable dates). If a student has enrolled in thesis credits but elects to change to a non-thesis track or program, the accumulated thesis credits may not be exchanged or converted to another non-structured credit. The thesis hours will remain on the transcript and will retain the \"Z\" grade. Thesis Defense Policies and procedures for the thesis defense are handled within the College and Program. Contact the College and Program for requirements. Thesis Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available on the Office of Graduate Studies website: http://www.usfsp.edu/grad. Students who fail to submit the final copy of a thesis by the posted submission deadline will be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for graduation by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) thesis hours for that subsequent semester, and meet the submission requirements 74 as posted on the Graduate Studies website. Only after the Office of Graduate Studies has approved the manuscript can the student be certified for the degree. Changes after Publication Once a thesis is approved and accepted for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Thesis Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preserving patent rights...\" To protect the University's primary goal from undue compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, theses will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the thesis, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for consideration. Such requests must be received by the format check of the thesis. 3. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their theses by agreements involving publication delays. Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works USF 0.300 http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-0-300.pdf and USF 12.003 http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation-usf12.003.pdf. For information about the requirements of this policy contact the Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 974-0994. Thesis Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submits the change of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of thesis hours to the Office of the Registrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. 75 Section 8 - Graduation Information Application for Degree (Graduation) To graduate, a student must submit the Application for Degree online through OASIS. This application must be submitted in the term of expected graduation by the deadline noted in the academic calendar. If a student applies for graduation and is not approved, a new Application for Degree must be submitted by the deadline in a new term. In order for the degree statement to appear on a student's academic record, the student must file the aforementioned application whether or not participation in the commencement ceremony is desired. Inquiries concerning approval or denial of graduation should be made to the appropriate college. It is the student's responsibility to clear all \"I\" (Incomplete) and \"M\" (Missing) grades in all courses and to provide official transcripts of all transferred course work needed for graduation at least three weeks prior to the end of the term in which he/she expects to graduate. Graduation Requirements It is the student's responsibility to make sure that he/she has met all degree requirements as specified in the Policies and Degree Requirements section of this publication, as well as any College and Program requirements for the degree. Commencement Students may not participate in commencement exercises until all requirements for the degree sought have been fulfilled. Students graduating from USF St. Petersburg may not participate in commencement ceremonies at other USF system institutions (with the exception of Summer semester graduates - they may participate in the commencement ceremony offered at USF Tampa as none is provided through USF St. Petersburg). Diplomas Diplomas are mailed to the student's permanent address approximately six (6) weeks after commencement. Students with a change of address need to fill out a change of address form at the Registration and Records office. Questions regarding diplomas and degree certification should be directed to the Registration and Records Office at 727-873-4645. Letters of Certification Students in need of verification of the degree prior to receiving their diploma may request a Letter of Certification. This letter specifies that the student has finished all of the requirements for the degree and the date the degree will be conferred. The letter must include the student's university identification number (UID), name of degree program and official name of the degree. The Major Professor, the College Dean (or designee), the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (or designee), and the Registrar must sign the Letter of Certification. A template for the Certification Letter is available on the Office of Graduate Studies website at http://www.usfsp.edu/grad. Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam Reference -USF Policy 10-047 http://regulationspolicies.usfedu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-10-047.pdf. 76 The University of South Florida St. Petersburg may award a posthumous master's degree to a student who was in good standing at the time of his or her death and who had completed all substantive requirements for the degree. The University may also award masters in memoriam to a student who was in good standing at the time of his or her death. To award a non-thesis degree, the student would need to have completed all courses required for the degree. Courses required for the degree, in which the student is enrolled at the time of his or her death, must have been completed to the satisfaction of the faculty so that passing grades might be posted. All other requirements (e.g., grade point average, tests, etc.) must have been satisfied as well. To award a thesis degree, all courses must have been completed as described above and the thesis must be sufficiently complete to the satisfaction of the faculty so that certification of completion may be posted to the student's record. Procedures for Award of Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The Program Director or Department Chairperson, on his or her own initiative or upon the request of the family of the student, may recommend a posthumous degree, or a degree in memoriam, by forwarding the recommendation to the respective dean of the College. If approved by the Dean, the recommendation with supporting documentation will be forwarded to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for approval. If the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs approves the recommendation, the Office of Registration and Records will be notified and the degree will be awarded at the next commencement ceremony or will be presented to the student's family in an appropriate setting. Diplomas for posthumous degrees will be identical to other degrees awarded in the same colleges and majors. Diplomas for Degrees in Memoriam will be prepared to read \"Master of Arts in Memoriam, Master of Science in Memoriam,\" etc., depending upon the degree the student was pursuing at the time of his or her death. Transcripts Transcripts of a student's USF system academic record may be requested by the student through the Office of Records and Registration. A student's academic record can only be released upon authorization of the student. Students requesting transcripts may do so in person or by writing to the Office of the Registrar. By law, the request must include the student's signature and date. For transcripts to be issued, the student must have no financial obligations to the University. Transcript request forms are available on the Records and Registration website at: http://www.usfsp.edu/registrar Degree statements are posted approximately five weeks after the graduation ceremony. Current term grades are posted approximately one week after the final exams end. If grades for the current term are needed, clearly indicate that the transcript request is to be held for grades. 77 Section 9 - Degrees, Majors and Concentrations New graduate degree programs, majors and concentrations are continually under development and may now be approved and available. For the most current list of authorized degrees, programs and concentrations for USF St. Petersburg, please visit: http://www.usfsp/edu/grad. Definitions Degrees A degree program is defined as an organized curriculum leading to a college degree in an area of study recognized as an academic discipline by the higher education community, as demonstrated by assignment of a Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code by the National Center for Educational Statistics, or as demonstrated by similar programs existing at other colleges and universities, and having designated faculty and instructional resources. Each degree program is assigned a CIP code and included in the State University System Academic Degree Program Inventory. Examples: Master's of Arts (M.A.), Master's of Science (M.S.), Master's of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Master's of Liberal Arts (M.L.A.), Master's of Education (MEd). USF System Curriculum Definitions - also reference USF 3.038 Academic Curricular Offerings https://www.systemacademics.usf.edu/curriculum/definitions/php Degree Program An organized curriculum leading to a degree in an area of study recognized as an academic discipline by the higher education community, as demonstrated by assignment of a unique Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code and name by the National Center for Educational Statistics. Each degree program shall have designated faculty effort and instructional resources, and shall include at least one program major, but may have multiple majors. Five degree levels are used in the SUS: Bachelor (B), Master (M), Specialist (S), Research Doctoral, and Professional Doctoral (P).

CIP 13.0301 - M.A. in Elementary Education (AEE) with a concentration in: Elementary Math and Science (MSM) Track, Specialization, Cluster, etc. Areas of study within a major or concentration that are less formal and not tracked in the student's BANNER record. Certificate An organized set of courses offered as a distinct area that leads to specific educational or occupational goals. Certificates may consist of courses that are part of a major or courses that are created outside of a major. The number of credit hours for a certificate shall be set by the University. Example: The Infant-Family Mental Health graduate certificate is designed for individuals who are 79 interested in gaining knowledge, skills and connections to become powerful change agents for infant-family mental health in the systems and communities where they live and work. It is a 12-hour certificate appropriate for students who have earned a bachelor's degree in psychology, social work, criminology, human development, early childhood education, nursing or other social science-related fields, and will benefit practitioners in allied health professions and social and behavioral sciences. The program does not provide specialized clinical training in specific forms or modalities but rather provides broad coverage of knowledge necessary for informed and competent work in early childhood mental health, prenatal and health-related positions, child protection and child welfare positions, and other fields working with families of infants and toddlers.

Food Writing and Photography 4. Geospatial Science 5. Infant-Family Mental Health 6. Leadership Management 7. Middle Grades Digitally-Enhanced Mathematics Education 8. Sustainable Entrepreneurship Graduate Certificate Policies The areas of study for graduate certificates are created within the mission of graduate education. Students will be awarded certificates upon completion of specific course work, which has been approved by the USFSP Graduate Council. The graduate certificate is not defined as a degree by the Office of Graduate Studies; rather, it is a focused collection of courses that, when completed, affords the student some record of distinct academic accomplishment in a given discipline or set of related disciplines. Moreover, the graduate certificate is not viewed as a guaranteed means of entry into a graduate major. While the courses comprising a graduate certificate may be used as evidence in support of a student's application for admission to a graduate major, the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite. Student Eligibility and Admission Criteria Students must apply and be accepted into the Graduate Certificate to be eligible to receive a certificate. The prerequisites and general criteria of eligibility for admission to any graduate certificate area of study include: 1. An earned baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from a regionally accredited college or university with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher. Colleges and/or academic units that administer the graduate certificates may have more stringent admission requirements. 2. Each Graduate Certificate specifies the requirements for admission including standardized test scores (if applicable), and other similar criteria as part of the application. However, prospective non-degree seeking graduate certificate students must meet University graduate admissions grade point average requirements. Students who wish to pursue a graduate certificate must apply through the Office of Graduate Studies and be admitted to the graduate certificate. Students are encouraged to contact the coordinator prior to applying. Non-degree Seeking Students All non-degree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates should apply for admission to the certificate through the Office of Graduate Studies as soon as possible for maximum benefit, but must apply to the Certificate and complete required coursework within five years of taking the first course applicable to the certificate. Students must submit a Completion Form, approved by the sponsoring graduate program for the Graduate Certificate to be awarded. 81 Degree Seeking Students All degree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates must apply for admission to the Graduate Certificate through the Office of Graduate Studies. The application must be received prior to conferral of the graduate degree that includes the same coursework. Students who have completed all coursework must apply for admission to the certificate and submit a Completion Form (approved by the sponsoring graduate program) prior to the deadline to apply for graduation by the fourth week of the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Degree seeking students who are pursuing a Graduate Certificate in a discipline outside of their graduate major must apply for admission to the Graduate Certificate through the Office of Graduate Studies. The application must be received prior to the deadline to apply for graduation (by the fourth week of the semester) in which the student plans to graduate. Required coursework for the certificate must be completed within five years of taking the first course applicable to the certificate. Students must submit a Completion Form (approved by the sponsoring graduate program for the certificate to be awarded. Certificate students not currently enrolled in a degree-granting graduate major, will be admitted into a separate classification within the University, and will be classified as \"Graduate Certificate Students.\" This separate classification will permit the University to monitor statistical and enrollment data for certificate areas of study, and will allow inclusion of such efforts in the annual reports and academic planning. Students pursuing a graduate certificate are required to meet the same academic requirements as those defined for degree-seeking students to remain in \"good standing.\" All graduate certificate students must meet all prerequisites for course in which they wish to enroll. Should a graduate certificate student subsequently apply and be accepted to a graduate major, the University's Transfer of Credit Policy applies. It is up to the graduate program to determine the number of credits that may be transferred in from the Graduate Certificate into the Graduate Major, up to the 49% of the number of credits required for the graduate major. Any application of such credit must be approved by the degree-granting college and must be appropriate to the major. See the Transfer of Credit Policy for more information. Certificate Requirements To receive a Graduate Certificate: 1. Students must successfully complete certificate requirements as established by the University. Graduate Certificate student will be held to the academic standards for all graduate students as specified in the Graduate Catalog. 2. Students must submit a completion form. Degree-seeking students must submit this form before graduating from their graduate major. Non-degree seeking students must submit this form no later than one semester after completing their certificate course work. 3. Students must have been awarded a bachelor's or higher degree to be eligible. Graduate Programs may have additional eligibility requirements (i.e. GPA, test score, etc.). 82 Section 10 - College of Arts and Sciences at USF St. Petersburg University of South Florida St. Petersburg 140 Seventh Avenue South, DAV 100 St. Assistant Dean: Dr. Thushani Rodrigo-Peiris Mission Statement: To embody the principles and activities of a research-intensive liberal arts college, where our graduates will be trained within their disciplines and thus prepared for meaningful careers and lifelong learning. Our students will have the critical skills, broad outlook and civic awareness that will make them engaged and productive citizens. In short, our students will be recognized as citizen scholars.

Each student will work with the instructor to identify a relevant final project of interest and which should result in professional growth to the student. The final project requires students to integrate and apply the knowledge and skills 92 acquired in their coursework via completion of a project. The final project results will be written and presented to program faculty. To ensure quality control, each report will be evaluated by the instructor and the graduate coordinator. Final projects* will typically fall into one of the three following themes: Meta-Analysis Projects\u2014these projects involve bringing together the seminal ideas, theories and concepts of a field in an original synthesis to produce new insights and observations that may move the community's understanding forward. Such a project would likely involve primarily archival and document analysis, based on the relevant scientific literature of the chosen field. Focused Fieldwork Projects\u2014these projects utilize accepted research methods to answer a specific question concerning anything from local ecosystem functions, services or health; spatial distribution of environmental phenomena; to public attitudes about ongoing environmental conflicts. Focused Field Projects may use a variety of research methods, including but not limited to, survey research, photographic techniques, water or soil sampling techniques, laboratory analysis, spatial analysis and mapping. They are generally more narrowly defined than topics chosen for master's theses, and may be very specific to particular places and times. A Focused Field Project demonstrates your ability to collect appropriate data in order to an answer a practical and applied question. Such skills are useful in many entry-level environmental positions. Policy Case Studies\u2014 these studies use a combination of document, archival and possible field methods to analyze policy approaches to, or public attitudes toward, a specific environmental problem, usually at the local or state scale. A thorough comparison of the possible impacts of specific policies intended to resolve an environmental problem may be explored with the goal of suggesting ideal outcomes in the form of a policy analysis report. Case studies may also involve measuring the effectiveness of particular organizations such as non-profits or government agencies or the impact of specific entities such as local industries or corporations on well-defined ecosystems. Outcome assessments of specific regulatory laws regarding the environment may also be analyzed. *Students may propose a final project outside the scope of the aforementioned themes but you must seek approval from the professor teaching the Final Project course. Comprehensive Exam Upon completion of all Theme 1 and Theme 2 courses, students will sit a Comprehensive Exam designed to assess that they have mastered the major concepts expected of a master's-level graduate. A test bank will be created by the instructors of these courses and Comprehensive Exams will consist of questions chosen from the test bank. Students will be allowed two opportunities to pass the Comprehensive Exam. Students must pass the Comprehensive Exam to earn the M.A. degree. 93 Masters of Science (M.S.)

The courses listed under requirements will provide students and professionals with a strong understanding of the fundamental theories and concepts underlying spatial analysis and extensive hands-on experience. Geospatial Science is the quantitative and analytical study of relationships of events and processes in space and time that is in high demand in the workforce. In recent years, powerful new technologies and techniques have emerged that greatly improve our ability to acquire, archive, analyze and communicate information regarding people, places and other processes on or near the Earth's surface. These same technologies and analytical frameworks allow us to combine this information into multi-tiered databases describing complex and inter-related aspects of our physical and social world. Such databases can then be analyzed in novel ways that take the spatial nature of disparate phenomena and processes into account. The insights produced by these analyses are revolutionizing many fields of science, decision making, government operations and businesses, and through now-commonplace consumer products such as web-based mapping systems and Global Positioning systems (GPS) unites, are directly impacting the everyday lives of ordinary individuals. Students completing the certificate will acquire the skills to become more competitive and successful in the environmental management, urban planning, homeland security and defense services contracts and private/public workforce for which command of spatial analytical thinking and GIS and related technologies are rapidly becoming imperative. Completion of the course requirements will prepare students to complete the professional certification exams such as 1) GISP offered by http://www.gisci.org/ and 2) Certified Mapping Scientists (GIS/LIS) offered by http://www.asprs.org/Certification-Program/Certified-Mapping-Scientist-GIS-LIS.html.

Before a student's internship is approved, a faculty supervisor confirms that the practicum involves professional-level assignments and responsibilities. Working with an advisor, students help set up the internship and obtain a written description of duties and work hours from the editor or manager who will be overseeing the practicum. Students may not receive internship credit for any currently paid position. The academic credit for an internship, ranging from one to three hours, is assigned according to the number of days worked per week during the semester. No more than three credits of practicum will count toward the student's 36 hours for graduation. Typically, a practicum would come in the final semester of study; however, exceptions are sometimes granted. Comprehensive Exam Graduate students in the Department of Journalism and Media Studies must pass a comprehensive written examination, which can be taken after completing 21 hours of course work, including all three core courses. All core courses must be passed with a grade of C or better. Students should monitor their coursework and advise the graduate program director the semester before they plan to take the comprehensive exams. The graduate director will authorize the student's eligibility to take the exam. Students must elect either the Applied Research Project option or the Thesis option for their culminating project. Students are urged to review the requirements for the culminating project on the program website: http://www.usfsp.edu/journalism/programs-summary/grad/culminating-work. Applied Research Project The project is a serious, culminating experience in journalistic production and presentation for print, electronic, or website format. The topic may be the investigation of an issue or problem related to journalism/mass communications or the piece may be itself an example of in-depth journalistic work. But, it should be intended to be published for a lay, trade, or professional audience. Applied research projects may be visual presentations, such as photography, Web design, or video or may be text-centered. The project offers a creative and professionally-oriented approach to an in-depth study. Students should plan to spend 45 or more hours completing the ARP, to fulfill the requirements of a 3-credit course of study. The project does not require the graduate research methods course, as a project is not an academic research activity. While the project is a different mode from the thesis for illustrating developed skills and competencies, we hold our students to the same degree of rigor as that required of the thesis. The project gives students a wide degree of latitude but requires that they put together a substantial piece of work beyond what they have done in their classes. For example, a design-oriented student might come up with a well thought-out approach to redesigning all or a section of a newspaper or a website. A student might report and write a series of articles on race relations, integrating the elderly into community life, crime and violence, or any other issue that affects the community. The project is expected to demonstrate a new and fresh approach to thinking about the topic. The Thesis A thesis is a work of original scholarship that adheres to commonly accepted rules of academic publication. Students doing a thesis are required to take MMC 6421-Research Methods in Mass Communications. The thesis requires academic research that uses at least one of the following six research methodologies: analytical research, historical research, legal research, clinical or ethnographic research, qualitative research, or quantitative research. Any academic research involving the study of living human beings requires review by USF's Institutional Review Board. 102 Analytic research includes examination of text or visual themes, framing, comparisons, or other content analyses. This type of research also includes ethical analysis of cases or issues. Historical research includes examination of media accounts or others' perspectives of issues or past events or the close examination of the life of a notable individual. Legal research involves the study of legal cases or an aspect of legal theory. Clinical or ethnographic research includes in-depth presentation of a particular case. Material may be gathered through document collection or through participant observation. Qualitative research involves the collection of human opinion or belief through surveys, questionnaires, or interviews. Quantitative research includes statistical interpretation of data gathered from documents, field observation, surveys, interviews or experiments that compare test groups with control groups. Most theses, as with most academic research, usually include a combination of methodologies. For example, the literature review, which is required of every thesis, is a form of historical research. The methodology to explore particular hypotheses or research questions will be determined by student and thesis chair. Theses usually include an introductory chapter based on the prospectus, outlining the subject, its significance, hypotheses or research questions, and the methodology employed. The second chapter is often the literature review, which relates other research in the area to the student's research and at the same time shows why the study is so valuable. The third chapter should explain the methodology in depth, discussing and defending the process by which the hypothesis will be explored or research questions answered. A fourth chapter should include results and may be presented visually as well as through text. The last chapter concludes with the discussion and need for further research, which provides a complete analysis of the findings and how they relate not only to the research questions but to larger issues as well. 103 Graduate Certificate in Food Writing and Photography Certificate Admission Deadlines: Fall: July 1 for best consideration Spring: October 1 for best consideration Summer: March 1 for best consideration Minimum Total Hours: 12 Program Level: Graduate Certificate Contact Information: Graduate Faculty Janet Keeler jkeeler@mail.usf.edu Graduate Studies Website: www.usfsp.edu/grad Program Information: Food is essential to human existence, and more and more food writers are connecting audience members with what nourishes us. Food is far more than physical sustenance. It defines cultures while challenging the environment. It creates political strife and builds economies. It provides entertainment and is a vehicle for health problems. It's surrounded by legal and regulatory issues and ethical choices that are often not even noticed. But, at its core, food is the story of people. This program will train writers and photographers - veterans and novices - to best convey the stories that they want to tell. From personal essays to restaurant reviews and profiles to research pieces, food writers with the course work this certificate provides can entertain and enlighten their readers while having the background to mix in societal, environmental, ethical, public health and economic implications of what we put into our mouths. This program can be completed entirely online or through a combination of online and face to face courses or semester-long courses. Certificate Outcomes include improved visual and verbal mass communications skills and a better understanding of the legal and ethical issues that any contemporary communicator in the virtual or physical world might face. Students will conclude the program by completing a mentored and carefully reviewed project that fits their needs, communication methods and paves the path for the future.

It will benefit practitioners in allied health professions and social and behavioral sciences seeking to become effective change agents for infant-family health in the systems and communities where they live and work. This involves gaining a greater knowledge for working with infants and their families. It also involves developing a systems thinking orientation in order to partner with infants, families, and others to transform systems and communities. Program emphasis provides coverage of theoretical/conceptual and applied issues in building knowledge and skills for understanding infant and toddler social and emotional development, also referred to as \"infant mental health.\" It also builds knowledge and skills about how co-parenting relationships develop and function in a diversity of different family systems, and a means of understanding how co-parenting alliances can and should be capitalized on to promote the healthy adjustment of any infant or toddler. This is a 12-credit hour certificate program. The IFMH Certificate program's four courses cover best practices, latest research, and strategies that can help children from birth to three years and their families - even those facing substantial challenges - make more successful adjustments during the child's earliest years so that more young children might be ready to learn by preschool age. The courses also introduce students to approaches and initiatives emerging in various fields to bring about transformed communities where all young children and families are thriving. The program does not provide specialized clinical training in specific forms or modalities of intervention but rather provides broad coverage of knowledge necessary for informed and competent work in early childhood mental health, prenatal and health-related, child protection and welfare, civic and community life, and other fields serving and collaborating with families of infants and toddlers. 121 Admission Information Must meet University requirements (see section of this catalog entitled Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below.

The first line of each description includes the State Common Course prefix and number (see below), title of the course, and number of credits. Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System. This common numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating non-public institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). The list of course prefixes and numbers, along with their generic titles, is referred to \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course details.\" Courses are created using the Statewide Course Numbering System. The following information is from the SCNS handbook. For more information: http://scns.fldoe.org. The SCNS uses a course designation which consists of a three-letter prefix and a four-digit number and, when necessary, a one-letter laboratory (L) or lecture/laboratory (C) suffix. Example: SCNS Course ID AML Suffix Laboratory Explanation: AML 6017, Studies in American Literature to 1860. American Studies course taught at the graduate level (no lab). A level code, which roughly corresponds to the year in college the course is normally taken (i.e. master's, doctoral, etc.), is placed between the course prefix and the course number. The level is recommended by the institution according to its own policies and the policies of the State of Florida, and approved by faculty committee. The level digit does not affect course equivalency - course equivalency is determined by the prefix and the last three digits. The following are level definitions: 0 - PSAV, college prep, vocational prep 1-2 Lower-level undergraduate 3-4 undergraduate 5-9 Graduate and Professional Important Note: USF St. Petersburg does not accept any courses below the graduate and professional level (5000 level or above) to count towards satisfactory completion of a graduate degree. 189 Courses are numbered based on content, rather than by department or program. This means that a single program may have courses in several disciplines and may consist of courses having several different prefixes. Glossary of Course Description Terms Credits separated by a colon indicate concurrent lecture and laboratory courses taught as a unit: PHY 3040, 3040L PHYSICS and LAB (3:1) Credits separated by a comma indicate unified courses offered in different semesters: AMH 2010, 2020 AMERICAN HISTORY I, I (4,4) Credits separated by a hyphen indicated variable credit: MAT 7912 DIRECTED RESEARCH (1-4) The following abbreviations are used in various course descriptions: G Graduate PR Prerequisite CI With the consent of the instructor CC With the consent of the chairperson of the department or program CR Co-requisite Lec Lecture Lab Laboratory Dem Demonstration Pro Problem Dis Discussion ML Master's Level GS Graduate Standing Rpt May be repeated UL Upper Level S/U No grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Only Course Level Definitions: 5000-5999 Graduate Level 6000-6999 Graduate Level 7000-7999 Doctoral Level 8000 Professional The University reserves the right to substitute, not offer, and add courses and programs that are listed in this catalog.
