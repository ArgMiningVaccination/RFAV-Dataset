This booklet provides information on available supports for all staff in the CHO 1 area. Wellbeing can be described as having a healthy and happy existence. The World Health Organisation defines wellbeing in its broadest sense as \"an optimal state of health,\" concerning an individual's physical, mental, emotional and spiritual state of being. It is important that you aim to look after all aspects of your health so that you have a balanced approach to your overall wellbeing. Staff Health and Wellbeing is one of three strategic priorities specified by the Healthy Ireland Framework, alongside System Reform and Chronic Disease Prevention. Since the beginning of the CHO 1 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018-2023, there have been a range of initiatives to support Staff Health and Wellbeing including the Ballyshannon Pilot Programme, staff health checks, flu vaccination clinics, smoking cessation supports, supporting staff choirs, pilates, yoga, mindfulness, healthy eating cookery demonstrations, interventions to include mental health promotion including Minding Your Wellbeing and Stress Control and national initiatives such as Steps to Health, Ireland Lights Up and Love Life Love Walking. This resource guide hopes to present staff with a range of supports for all types of health and wellbeing scenarios. It will be updated annually to ensure it is an effective and valuable resource. However, in the current context, all of us need to be aware of working safely in the time of Covid-19. We will also be issuing regular Staff Newsletters, so please keep an eye out. There are many supports available on Covid 19 which are housed under: https://healthservice.hse.ie/staff/coronavirus/safety-in-the-workplace/managing- employees-return-to-work-safely1.html They include Return to Work Safely protocols, guidelines on social distancing in the workplace, staff travel guidance, and information on safely working from home.

If you are desk-based aim to get up, stretch and move around regularly throughout the day. Check out the YouTube videos from Irish Heart Foundation Plan and prepare healthy lunches/snacks to bring to work or select healthy options in the canteen/caf\u00e9. Be aware of your alcohol consumption and aim to stay below the maximum recommended number of drinks/units per week (11 standard drinks for women and 17 standard drinks for men).

It is about taking care of your physical body so that you are able to carry out your daily activities as well as possible. Feeling physically well also has a significant impact on your mental health. Being physically well includes paying attention to your diet and physical activity levels. It also includes monitoring your stress levels, your use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs.

By being aware of our emotions and how they impact us we are better able to respond rather than react to daily challenges and demands. At the time of development of this resource guide (June 2020), the nation and all of our population and workforce continue to experience the effects of COVID-19. Many of our staff have been working under enormous pressure, may have been diagnosed with COVID- 19 themselves, have experienced deaths of patients and service users or been bereaved themselves. There are a range of supports available to staff which are listed in the resources and contacts below. Resilience, being able to cope with daily challenges and demands and managing stress are all part of emotional wellbeing. Stress is a normal part of everyday living and we all need some stress to motivate us and to challenge us. However, when stress becomes chronic or constant it can become a serious risk to your health and wellbeing. Learning how to manage stress starts with good self-care and reaching out for support when you need it.
