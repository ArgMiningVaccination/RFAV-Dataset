We are warned that Lepto abounds and Lepto kills and we need to vaccinate for it. If you are considering vaccinating for Lepto, you might want to first read this article: [Smoke and Mirrors](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/leptospirosis-vaccine/). Regardless of whether you vaccinate for Lepto or not, your dog can be susceptible. Despite the dire warnings, up to 90% of infected dogs survive Lepto while the vast majority of dogs testing positive for Lepto are subclinical. Given the dangers of the [Lepto vaccine](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/the-lepto-vaccine-why-vets-give-it-yearly/), your best defense is to recognize the symptoms of Lepto and have remedies on hand so you can act immediately if your dog suddenly becomes ill. Disease Symptoms Leptospirosis is caused by infection with serovars of the spirochete Leptospira interrogans sensu lato, of which eight can infect dogs and cats. Leptospira cannot replicate outside of a host which acts as a reservoir, shedding the bacterium intermittently. Leptospira are passed in urine and penetrate mucous membranes or abraded skin and multiply rapidly upon entering the blood vascular space. The bacterium continues to spread within the body and replicates further in many tissues including the kidney, liver, spleen, central nervous system (CNS), eyes, and genital tract. Thereafter, increases in serum antibodies clear the spirochetes from most organs, but bacteria may persist in the kidneys and be shed in urine for weeks to months. The extent of damage to internal organs is variable depending on the virulence of the organism and host susceptibility. Many animals carry Lepto, especially rodents and racoons, and pets can catch it by drinking water contaminated with urine. The clinical signs of Lepto in [dogs depend on the age and immunity](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/dog-immune-system-boosters-that-work/) of the host, environmental factors affecting the bacteria, and the virulence of the infecting serovar. Young animals are more severely affected than adults. In acute infections a fever of 103-104\u00b0, shivering, and muscle tenderness are the first signs. Then vomiting and rapid dehydration may develop. Severely infected dogs may develop hypothermia and kidney or liver failure can develop. In subacute infections, the animal usually develops a fever, anorexia, vomiting of bile, dehydration, and increased thirst. Animals with liver involvement may develop jaundice. The dog will also be in pain and be reluctant to move. Dogs that develop kidney or liver involvement may begin to show improvement in organ function after 2 to 3 weeks or they may develop chronic renal failure. The majority of [Lepto infections in dogs](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/report-lepto-vaccine-uk-dogs-dying/) are chronic or subclinical. Dogs that become chronically infected may show no outward signs, but may intermittently shed bacteria in the urine for months or years.
