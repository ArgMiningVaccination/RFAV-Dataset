THE CHNA COMMITTEE MET REGULARLY VIA IN PERSON MEETINGS AND CONFERENCE CALLS TO PLAN AND EXECUTE PROJECT ACTIVITIES, VET PRELIMINARY FINDINGS, ADDRESS CHALLENGES, AND ENSURE THAT THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WAS INCLUSIVE, COMPREHENSIVE, AND OBJECTIVE. DURING THIS PROCESS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND CLINICAL STAFF WERE ENGAGED TO HELP PRIORITIZE COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES AND PRIORITY POPULATION SEGMENTS FOR INCLUSION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. THE ASSESSMENT BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2018 AND WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASES, WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE COLLECTION OF AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA (PHASE 1); ENGAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, KEY STAKEHOLDERS, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS (PHASE 2); AND ANALYSIS AND PRIORITIZATION OF FINDINGS FOR USE IN DEVELOPING A DATA-DRIVEN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (PHASE 3). PHASE I ------- THE PRELIMINARY NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND ENGAGEMENT EFFORT RELIED ON SECONDARY DATA COLLECTED VIA LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL SOURCES. THIS INFORMATION INCLUDED DATA ON THE POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF BERGEN COUNTY, INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHICS, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, HEALTH STATUS, AND MORBIDITY/MORTALITY. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, CONFIDENCE INTERVALS WERE ANALYZED TO TEST FOR STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND STATE OF NEW JERSEY DATA POINTS. A COMPREHENSIVE DATA BOOK IS INCLUDED IN APPENDIX B OF THE ORGANIZATION'S CHNA. IN THIS DATA BOOK, DATA POINTS ARE COLOR-CODED TO VISUALIZE WHICH MUNICIPAL-LEVEL DATA POINTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OR LOWER COMPARED TO THE STATE OVERALL. RELATIVE TO MOST STATES, NEW JERSEY DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB AT MAKING COMPREHENSIVE DATA AVAILABLE AT THE STATE, COUNTY, AND MUNICIPAL LEVELS THROUGH AN INTERACTIVE PORTAL ACCESSIBLE VIA THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (\"NJ DOH\") WEBSITE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION IN REGARDS TO QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS THE AVAILABILITY OF TIMELY DATA RELATED TO MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND SERVICE UTILIZATION. THE DATA SETS USED IN THIS REPORT ARE THE MOST UP-TO-DATE PROVIDED BY NJ DOH. THE DATA PROVIDED WAS VALUABLE AND ALLOWED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF HEALTH NEEDS RELATIVE TO THE STATE AND SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, THESE DATA SETS IN SOME CASES MAY NOT REFLECT RECENT TRENDS IN HEALTH STATISTICS. ADDITIONALLY, QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS NOT STRATIFIED BY AGE, RACE/ETHNICITY, INCOME, OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH LIMITED THE 37Schedule H (Form 990) 2021 Page8 Facility Information (continued) Part V Section C.

THE BERGEN COUNTY RANDOM HOUSEHOLD SURVEY AND THE TARGETED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES ALLOWED FOR EXPLORATION OF THESE ISSUES. KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH APPROXIMATELY 80 COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS FROM THROUGHOUT BERGEN COUNTY. THESE INTERVIEWS CONFIRMED AND/OR REFINED THE FINDINGS FROM QUANTITATIVE DATA SOURCES AND PROVIDED VALUABLE INSIGHT ON COMMUNITY NEED, COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES, SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION MOST AT-RISK, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSETS. INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED BY PHONE USING A STRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE DEVELOPED BY JOHN SNOW, INC. (JSI), A PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH AND CONSULTING FIRM, AND THE STEERING COMMITTEE. AT THE OUTSET, JSI WORKED WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY A REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF KEY INFORMANTS THAT COULD PROVIDE A DEEP AND BROAD PERSPECTIVE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF THE COUNTY. THIS LIST INCLUDED ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THE HOSPITALS AND BCDHS, AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES FROM ACROSS MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING HEALTH, PUBLIC HEALTH, SOCIAL SERVICE, ACADEMIC, AND BUSINESS. DETAILED NOTES WERE TAKEN FOR EACH INTERVIEW. DURING THIS PHASE, JSI STAFF WORKED WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A RESOURCE INVENTORY. THIS INVENTORY WAS MEANT TO INFORM WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN BERGEN COUNTY TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE ARE GAPS IN HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES. THE CHIP AND BCDHS STAFF SUPPORTED THIS EFFORT BY PROVIDING A LIST OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND KNOWN RESOURCES FROM ACROSS THE BROAD CONTINUUM OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CLINICAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES, COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES, AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES. THIS WAS DONE PRIMARILY BY COMPILING INFORMATION FROM EXISTING RESOURCE INVENTORIES AND PARTNER LISTS FROM THE CHIP, BCDHS, HOSPITALS, AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. PHASE II -------- PHASE II INCLUDED SEVERAL ACTIVITIES AIMED AT FURTHER ENGAGING COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS - INCLUDING SEGMENTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY HARD TO REACH. JSI CONDUCTED A MAIL-BASED BERGEN COUNTY RANDOM HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, WHICH CAPTURED INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ON HEALTH STATUS AND OVERALL WELL-BEING, SERVICE UTILIZATION, AND BARRIERS TO CARE. TO GENERATE THE SURVEY SAMPLE, A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO MORE THAN 4,000 RANDOMLY IDENTIFIED HOUSEHOLDS IN THE COUNTY. THE INITIAL RANDOM SAMPLE OF 4,000 HOUSEHOLDS INCLUDED AN OVERSAMPLE OF COMMUNITIES WITH LARGE PROPORTIONS OF BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN, HISPANIC/LATINO, AND LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS TO ENSURE THAT ENOUGH SURVEYS WERE GENERATED FROM HOUSEHOLDS WITH OFTEN UNDER-REPRESENTED SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. IN ALL, 1,372 COMMUNITY RESIDENTS RESPONDED 38Schedule H (Form 990) 2021 Page8 Facility Information (continued) Part V Section C. Supplemental Information for Part V, Section B.

FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH POPULATION SEGMENTS AND HEALTH/SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER GROUPS TO GATHER MORE PRECISE AND NUANCED INFORMATION ON THE NEEDS OF SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION OR FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE. FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD AT LOCATIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR PARTICIPANTS AND WERE FACILITATED IN APPROPRIATE LANGUAGES TO ENSURE FULL PARTICIPATION. JSI AND CO-FACILITATORS CONDUCTED ALL FOCUS GROUPS USING A GUIDE THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THE ONE USED FOR KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS TO ENSURE CONSISTENT DATA COLLECTION. JSI, THE CHIP, AND HOSPITAL PARTNERS WORKED WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTY TO PLAN THESE EVENTS AND IDENTIFY FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS. JSI FACILITATED TWO COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSIONS, ONE IN RIDGEWOOD AND ONE IN ENGLEWOOD. THESE SESSIONS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE WHO WAS INTERESTED TO PARTICIPATE AND ALLOWED FOR THE CAPTURE OF INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, STAFF FROM COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO REACT TO PRELIMINARY DATA FINDINGS AND TO SHARE THOUGHTS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, BARRIERS TO CARE, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, AND COMMUNITY ASSETS AND RESOURCES. BOTH SESSIONS WERE HELD IN LOCATIONS THAT WERE EASILY ACCESSIBLE, SAFE, AND WELL KNOWN. FINALLY, JSI WORKED WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A WEB-BASED BERGEN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH PERCEPTIONS SURVEY TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE THEIR OPINION AND PERCEPTIONS OF LEADING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND BARRIERS TO CARE, CLINICAL HEALTH ISSUES, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE HOSPITAL TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMMING. SURVEYS WERE AVAILABLE ONLINE, THROUGH THE SURVEYGIZMO PLATFORM, IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. SURVEYS WERE ALSO MADE AVAILABLE IN HARD COPY FOR DISTRIBUTION; HARD-COPY SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED AND THE RESPONSES WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. THE CHIP, BCDHS, HOSPITALS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESSES, AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DISTRIBUTE THE SURVEY TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE TYPICALLY HARD-TO-REACH (E.G. NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS, DIVERSE POPULATIONS). SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTIONS 6A & 6B 39Schedule H (Form 990) 2021 Page8 Facility Information (continued) Part V Section C.

CERTAINLY ALL GEOGRAPHIC, DEMOGRAPHIC, AND SOCIOECONOMIC SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION FACE CHALLENGES THAT MAY IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CARE OR MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH. REGARDLESS OF AGE, RACE/ETHNICITY, INCOME, FAMILY HISTORY, OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS, EVERYONE IS IMPACTED IN SOME WAY BY HEALTH-RELATED DISPARITIES. WITH THIS IN MIND, ENGLEWOOD'S IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY INCLUDES ACTIVITIES THAT WILL SUPPORT ALL RESIDENTS, ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT'S QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FINDINGS, THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WILL PRIORITIZE CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. THE ORGANIZATION'S IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ON APRIL 23, 2020. THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS THE RESULT OF BERGEN COUNTY'S CHNA, CONDUCTED IN 2019. THROUGH THE CHNA, ENGLEWOOD HEALTH WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY MULTIPLE COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS. THESE AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED AFTER CONSIDERATION OF VARIOUS CRITERIA, INCLUDING SECONDARY DATA (COMPARISON OF BERGEN COUNTY DATA TO NEW JERSEY AND NATIONAL DATA); QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM SURVEYS, FOCUS GROUPS, COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSIONS, AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS; AND THE POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACT WITHIN A PRIORITY AREA. BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM ITS CHNA, ENGLEWOOD HAS PRIORITIZED THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED INTO THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY AREAS: 1) WELLNESS AND PREVENTION - GOOD NUTRITION IS MISSION CRITICAL FOR GOOD HEALTH. GOOD NUTRITION IS NOT PRACTICED FOR A RANGE OF REASONS, INCLUDING AWARENESS, ACCESS AND COST. AS A RESULT, WEIGHT-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING OBESITY, ARE PERVASIVE AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE SPREAD OF CHRONIC AND COMPLEX CONDITIONS (HEART DISEASE AND STROKE, CANCER, DIABETES). PHYSICAL FITNESS IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF A HEALTHY LIFE. ACROSS ALL POPULATIONS, EXERCISE RATES ARE AT AN ALL-TIME RECORDED LOW. 2) CHRONIC AND COMPLEX CONDITIONS - CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART DISEASE, CANCER AND DIABETES ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY AMONG BERGEN COUNTY RESIDENTS. MORE THAN 50% OF U.S. ADULTS HAVE AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC CONDITION. THE NUTRITION CHALLENGES AND EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH CHRONIC AND COMPLEX CONDITIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND ADDRESSED IN THE SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND CARE PLANS FOR THIS POPULATION. 3) BEHAVIORAL HEALTH - MENTAL HEALTH, ANXIETY, STRESS AND SUBSTANCE USE ARE IDENTIFIED AS LEADING HEALTH ISSUES IN OUR COUNTY. THE IMPACT CAN BE SEEN IN THE INCREASE OF DEPRESSION, MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES, AND RISE IN SUBSTANCE USE AND ADDICTION. THERE IS A GAP IN THE ABILITY TO ACCESS SUPPORT, COMPLICATED BY LACK OF ADEQUATE SUPPLY AND AFFORDABLE OPTIONS. 41Schedule H (Form 990) 2021 Page8 Facility Information (continued) Part V Section C.

VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HAVE FREQUENT \"LAPSES\" IN INSURANCE. LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE LEADING BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE; (B) NEARLY ONE THIRD OF BERGEN COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE FOREIGN BORN AND FACE LANGUAGE-RELATED CHALLENGES THAT IMPACT UNDERSTANDING, NAVIGATION AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE; (C) BERGEN COUNTY HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST POPULATION OF ADULTS OVER 65 IN NJ (16.4%). THIS GROUP COMMONLY FACES WELLNESS CHALLENGES (ISOLATION, INFLUENZA, PNEUMONIA, FALLS, ALZHEIMER'S AND LACK OF END OF LIFE CARE DIRECTIVES); AND (D) NEARLY 20% OF ALL RESPONDENTS TO THE BERGEN COUNTY RANDOM HOUSEHOLD SURVEY REPORT THEY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT OR VERY WORRIED ABOUT FOOD RUNNING OUT SOMETIME IN THE PAST YEAR. PERCENTAGES WERE HIGHEST AMONG LOW INCOME (46.8%), HISPANIC/LATINO (42.2%), AND BLACK/AA (27.2%). ENGLEWOOD HEALTH IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING IMPROVED HEALTH THROUGH BETTER QUALITY CARE AT LOWER COSTS. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITY, ENGLEWOOD HEALTH IS ALLOCATING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET FORTH IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. ENGLEWOOD HEALTH'S POPULATION HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES, WILL LEAD THIS EFFORT.

ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE \"CHARITY CARE STANDARD.\" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. 64Schedule H (Form 990) 2021 Page10 Supplemental Information Part VI Provide the following information. 1 Required descriptions.

THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY.

THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS \"PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY\" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE 66Schedule H (Form 990) 2021 Page10 Supplemental Information Part VI Provide the following information. 1 Required descriptions.

THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (\"AHA\") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. 67Schedule H (Form 990) 2021 Page10 Supplemental Information Part VI Provide the following information. 1 Required descriptions.

Schedule H (Form 990) 2021JSA 1E1327 2.0007529MK U600ENGLEWOOD HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL CENTER 22-1487173 REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (\"CBO\") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT \"THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE.\" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY.

BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS \"SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT\" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial stateme nts present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Hospital as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audits in acc ordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our respons ibilities under those standards a re further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial St atements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Hospital and to meet our othe r ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requi rements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropri ate to provide a basis for o ur audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management fo r the Consolidated Financial S tatements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presenta tion of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair present ation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about t he Hospital's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date t hat the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. Auditors' Responsibilities for the Au dit of the Consolidated Fi nancial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fra ud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance, and therefore, is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in ac cordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it e xists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatem ent resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may invol ve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the overri de of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, i ndividually or in the aggregate, they wou ld influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the co nsolidated financial statements. 2 In performing an audit in ac cordance with GAAS, we: Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skept icism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit pro cedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence re garding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Obtain an understandi ng of internal control relevant to the au dit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circ umstances, but not for the purp ose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Hospital's i nternal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Evaluate the appropriateness o f accounting policies used and t he reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by m anagement, as well as evaluate th e overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Conclude whether, in our judgment, there ar e conditions or eve nts, considered in t he aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Hospital's ability to continu e as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate w ith those charged with governan ce regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findin gs and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

Hospital and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Englewood Hospital (the Hospital ) is a not-for-profit, teaching , tax-exempt, acute care hospital with 531 licensed beds located in Engl ewood, New Jersey established and operated for the delivery and promotion of healthcare. It is ope rated to serve the public rat her than private interests. To further this purpose, the Hospital provi des various programs for medica l training, research and education, in addition to programs estab lished to improve the health of th e community. Englewood Health (the System) is the parent corporation of the Hospital. Its purpose i s the performance of planning activities related to the promotion of health of pe ople within the System's service area. The System's Board o f Trustees consists o f, among others, certa in officers of the Hospital. The System is also the parent cor poration of Englewood Healthca re Enterprises, Inc., Englewood Healthcare Properties, Inc. and E nglewood Health Foundation (th e Foundation). The Foundation was organized to raise fu nds for the Hospital. On September 23, 2019, the System signed a definitive agreement to merge with Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH). On December 7, 2020 , the Federal Tr ade Commission (FTC) sued to b lock the merger, and to move to an administrative hearing to determine the merge r's ultimate fate. The System and HMH fought the FTC's challenge in U .S. District Federal Court, and on August 4, 2021 the District Court ruled in favor of the FTC. The merging parties appealed that ruling, and on March 22, 2022 the appellate division of the District Court upheld the prior ruling, and ess entially ended the possib ility of the merger. The parties formalized this through a joint dissolvent of the d efinitive agreement, effective March 31, 2022. As part of the definitive agreem ent, and an adjunct credit and security agreement, HMH committed to a $400 million capital invest ment at the System, with up to $45 million available immediately. During calendar 2020, the Hospit al drew down $22.9 million of t hese funds and recorded them as contributions in the December 31, 2020 consolidated financia l statements. The assessment of recording the drawdowns as contributions was based on a prob ability perspective that payback would be remote and the fact tha t the FTC has never successfull y blocked a hospital merger in New Jersey. Financial Accounting Standards B oard (FASB), Acco unting Standar ds Update (ASU) 2018-08, Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for C ontributions Received and Contributions Made became effective January 1, 2020. This update clarified the scope and the accounting guidance for contributions received and contributions made . The update added the concept o f a barrier to recognizing contribution revenue until such ba rrier was met. The update also added clari fication that revenue recognition on a contribution with a barrier is not subject to pr obability. This accounting guid ance was in effect at the time of HMH funded the draw downs, t herefore, the advances should ha ve been recorded as liabilities within the December 31, 2020 consolidat ed financial statements until t he merger closed. Management has assessed the oversight of ASU 2018-08 on both th e December 31, 2020 and 2021 consolidated financial statement s from a quantitative and quali tative perspective and has determined that retrospectively applying this correction to the 2020 consolidat ed financial statements (increase liabilities and decrease net assets by $22. 9 million, and decrease other re venue and the performance indicator by $6.9 million, and decrease contribu tions for capital purposes a nd change in net assets by $16 million) would have an immaterial impact on the Hospital's 2021 and 2020 consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the liability for t he drawdowns and the revenue reve rsal to those same line items were recorded in the 2021 consolidated financial statements. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 7 The following items comprise the significant accounting policie s which are follow ed by the Hospital. Basis of Consolidated Financial Statement Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of t he Hospital, Englewood Medical Associates, Inc. (EMA), a not-for -profit corpora tion and wholly owned subsidiary of the Hospital, which provides physician service s to the Hospital and Medical A ssociates of Englewood, P.C., doing business as Englewood Health Physician Hospital (EHPN), P hysician Partners of Englewood, P.C. (PPE), Emergency Physici ans of Englewood, P.C. (EPE), Engl ewood Health Alliance ACO (ACO) and Englewood Health ACO ( ACO2), all not-for-profit corpo rations which meet the criteria of consolidation with the Hosp ital. EHPN, PPE and EPE were inco rporated for the purpose of establishing relationships with physician practices. All signif icant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Numeric schedules presented in the notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements are presented in thousands (000's). All numbers included in narrative portion s are presented in whole numbers. Classification of Net Assets The Hospital separately accounts for and reports upon net asset s that are donor restricted and net assets without donor restr ictions. Some donor-imposed restr ictions are temporary in nature, such as those that will be met b y the passage of time or other events specified by the donor. Other donor-imposed restrictions are perpetual in nature, where the d onor stipulates that resources be maintained in perpetuity. Resources arising from the results of operations or net assets set aside by the Board of Trustees are no t considered to be donor restric ted. When a donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated ti me restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished, net assets with donor restrictions are reclass ified to net assets without donor restrictions. The Hospital recognize s its interest in the net assets of the F oundation. Contributions to net assets without donor restrictions from the Foundation are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net ass ets as a component of other re venue. Changes in the Hospital's interest in the Foundation's net a ssets with donor restrictions are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operat ions and changes in net assets . Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidat ed financial statements in con formity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and ac companying notes. There is at least a reasonable possibility that certain estimat es will change by material amounts in the near term. Actual results could di ffer from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The Hospital classifies as cash equivalents all highly liquid f inancial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, which are not deemed to be assets limited as to use or short-term investments. For pur poses of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash include invest ments purchased with an initi al maturity of three months or less. Patient Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable ar e recorded at net realizable value at the transaction price based on standard charges for services provided, reduced by contractual adjustmen ts provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured or underinsured patients in acc ordance with the Hospital's policies, and/or implicit price concessions provided to uninsured or unde rinsured patients, and do not bear interest. Subsequent c hanges to the estima te of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to patient revenue in the period of the change. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 8 Assets Limited as to Use a nd Short-Term Investments Assets limited as to use and sh ort-term investments consist of cash equivalents, money market funds, certificates of deposit, U .S. government obligations and other fixed income securities. Investment securities are carr ied at fair value based on quoted market prices. Amounts reported within assets limited as to use r epresent investments whose use is restricted under terms of the Hospital's mortgage loan agreement (see Note 8). Investment income and realized gains or losses on investment tr ansactions are recorded as other revenue unless with donor restric tions. The Hospital's investme nts (see Note 4) are classified as other than trading. As such, unreal ized gains and losses on U.S . government obligations and other fixed income securities that are considered temporary are exclu ded from revenue in excess of expenses. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined on a first- in, first-out basis. Investment in Joint Venture The Hospital holds three investm ents in joint ventures in which it maintains various percentages of ownership. Approximately $6.4 million and $5.8 million, respect ively, were recorded within other assets on the consolidated balan ce sheets as of December 31, 20 21 and 2020. Deferred Costs Deferred costs include costs incurred in connection with debt f inancing and refinancing and are amortized by the effective inte rest method over the period the applicable obligation is outstanding. Accumulated amortization total ed approximately $4.7 million and $4.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortizatio n expense was approximately $266,000 and $282,000 during 2021 and 2020, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment pur chased are carried at cost and those acquired by gifts and bequests are carried at apprais ed or fair value established at the date of contribution. The carrying amount of assets and the related accumulated depreciation are r emoved from the accounts when such assets are disposed of and any resulting gain or loss is i ncluded in operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight- line method over the estimated u seful lives of the assets. Equipment under capitalized lease obligatio ns and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the esti mated useful life of the asse t or lease term. Such amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying c onsolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Net patient service revenue is recognized at the amount that re flects the consideration to which the Hospital expects to be entit led in exchange for providing p atient care. These amounts are due from patients, third-party pay ors (including commercial and governmental programs) and others and includes variable cons ideration for retroactive reve nue adjustments due to settlement of audits, reviews and investigat ions. Generally, the Hospital bills the patients and third-party payors several days after the se rvices are performed and/or the patient is discharged from the facility. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 9 Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of t he services provided by the Hospital. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time is reco gnized based on actual services incurred in relation to total ex pected (or actual) payments. Th e Hospital believes that this method provides a faithful depiction o f the transfer of services over the term of the performance obligation based on the inputs needed to sat isfy the obligation. Generally , performance obligations satisfied over time relate to patients in t he Hospital receiving inpatien t acute care services. The Hospital measures the performance obligati on from admission into the fac ility to the point when it is no longer required to provide services to t hat patient, which is generall y at the time of discharge. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time are recogn ized when services are provided and the Hospital does not believe it is required to provide additio nal services to the patient. Generally, because all the Hospital's performance obligations r elate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, the Hospital has elected to apply the optio nal exemption provided in Accounting Standard Codification (A SC) 606-10-50-14(a) and, therefore, the Hospital is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to perf ormance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsat isfied at the end of the reportin g period. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligatio ns referred to above are prima rily related to inpatient acute care services at the end of the reporti ng period. The performance ob ligations for these contracts are generally completed when the patients are discharged, which gen erally occurs within days or weeks of the end of t he reporting period. The Hospital determines the transaction price based on standard charges for services provided, reduced by contractual adjustment s provided to third-party payo rs, discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with the Hospital's policy, and /or impl icit price concessions provided to uninsured patients. The Hospital determines its estimates of co ntractual adjustments and discounts based on contractual agreements , its discount policies and hist orical experience. The Hospital determines its estimate of implicit price concessions based on its historical col lection experience with this class of patients. Other Revenue Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily comprised of amounts received from federal and state funding s ources related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Hospital accounts for this funding in accordance w ith the FASB ASC 958-605 guidan ce for conditional contributions and, accordingly, revenues are measured and recognized when bar riers are substant ially met, which occurs when the organization co mplies with the terms and condit ions related to the purpose of the grant rather than those that are administrative in nature. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Securit y (CARES) Act w as signed into law to combat the financial effect s of COVID-19 . The CARES Act created a Provider Relief Fund to provide financial support for hospitals and other healthcare providers. The Hospital received approximately $75,475,000 in the y ear ended December 31, 2020 r elated to this funding. In accordance with the terms and conditions in place at Decembe r 31, 2020, the Hospital could apply the funding against lost revenue and eligible expenses. T he Hospital has incurred lost revenue and eligible expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund that were applicable as of December 31, 2020, sufficient t o fully recognize the aforementioned funds as revenue in the current fi scal year. These amounts are included with other revenue in the accompanying consolidated state ments of operations and changes in net assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. No funding was received during 2021. Noncompliance with the terms and conditions could result in rep ayment of some or all of the support, which can be s ubject to governmen t review and interpre tation. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has i ndicated Provider Relief Fund pay ments are subject to future reporting and audit requirements. These matters could cause rev ersal or claw-back of amounts previously recognized; however , an estimate of the possible eff ects cannot be made as of the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. In additio n, it is unknown whether there will be further developments in the regulatory guidance. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 10 Advances From Third-Party Payors The CARES Act included provisio ns to expand the Centers for Med icare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Accelerated and Advance Pa yment Program in order to impro ve cash flows for providers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic . In 2020, the Hospital receiv ed $87,134,000 in advance payments under this program. Repay ment occurs automatically thr ough a partial offset in Medicare payments due to the Hospital for services rendered to Medicare program beneficiaries. Repayment of the advances began in April 2021 an d will end 17 months later ( 29 months from initial payment), at which time the advances are re quired to be repaid in full. The Hospital expects services rendered during 2022 to be sufficient to o ffset the payments received. M edicare advanced payments of $49,010,000 are included in accru ed expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021. Medicare advanced payments of $31,546,000 are included in accrued expenses and other cur rent liabilities, and $55,588,000 are included in other long-term liabilities, in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. Revenue in Excess of Expenses The consolidated statements of operations and changes in net as sets include revenue in excess of expenses as the performance indic ator. Changes in net assets wi thout donor restrictions which are excluded from the performance indi cator, consistent with indust ry practice, include net change in unrealized gains and losses on fi xed income investments, contri butions and transfers for capital purposes and the change in pen sion and postretirement benefit l iabilities. Estimated Malpractice Costs The Hospital is insured for medical malpractice claims under a claims-made policy and excess loss policies. The Hospital records a n estimated liability for medic al malpractice costs related to reported claims, and incurred claims tha t have not been reported. Antici pated insurance rec overies associated with reported claims are reported separately in the Hospital's consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value. Income Taxes The Hospital is a not-for-profit Hospital described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and is exempt from Federal income taxes on related income pursuant to Section 501(a) of the IRC. The Hospital also is exe mpt from state income taxes. The Hospital and consolidated ent ities qualify as a tax-exempt Hospital under the IRC and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes with respect to thes e entities has been made in the accompanying consolidat ed financial statements. The Hospital accounts for uncerta inty in income taxes using a r ecognition threshold of more-likely-than-not to be sustai ned upon examination by the ap propriate taxing authority. Measurement of the tax uncertai nty occurs if the recognition th reshold is met. Management determined there were no tax unc ertainties that met the recogni tion threshold in 2021 and 2020. New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, FASB i ssued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . ASU No. 2016-02 was issued to increase transparency and comparability among Hospita ls by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the cons olidated balance sheets and di sclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the provisio ns of ASU No. 201 6-02, a lessee is required to recognize a right-to-use asset and lease liability, initially measured at t he present value of the lease payments, in the consolidated balance sheet s. In addition, lessees are re quired to provide qualitative and quantitative disclosures that enabl e users to understand more a bout the nature of the entity's leasing activities. The Hospital will be required to retrospectively ad opt the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 for years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Hospital has not y et determined the impact of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on its consolidated financial state ments. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 11 2. Charity Care and Community Benefit In accordance with its mission and philosophy, the Hospital com mits substantial resources to sponsor a broad range of services to both the indigent as well as the bro ader community. Community benefits provided to the indigent include the cost of providing services to persons who canno t afford health care due to inadequate resources and/or who are uninsured or underin sured. This type of community benefit includes the costs of: traditional charity care; unpaid costs o f care provided to beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid and other indigent public programs. Charity care is provided by the Hospital to patients who meet c ertain criteria defined by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) with out charge or at amounts less th an established rates. The Hospital reduces net revenue in accordance with these criteria. The Hosp ital's records identify and monitor the level of charity care it provides. Community benefits provided to t he broader community include th e costs of providing services to other populations who may not qualify as indigent but may need specia l services and suppo rt. This type of community benefit includes the co sts of: services such as healt h promotion and education and health screenings, all of which are not billed or can be operated only on a deficit basis; unpaid portions of training health professionals such as medical residents, studen ts in allied health professions; and the unpaid portions of testing medica l equipment and controlled stu dies of therapeutic protocols. A summary of the estimated cost o f community benefits provided to both the indigent and the broader community follows: December 31, 2021 2020 Community benefits provided to the indigent: Financial assistance, which includes charity care and uninsured discounts provided $ 25,694 $ 24,537 Unpaid cost of public programs, Medicaid and other indigent care programs 51,892 46,894 Community benefits to the broader community: Nonbilled services for the community 1,407 1,248 Education and research provided for the community 18,248 16,192 Subsidized health services 91,616 75,923 Estimated cost of community benefits $ 188,857 $ 164,794 The 2021 amounts are estimated wh ile the 2020 amounts are based on the Hospital's Form 990 as filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The costs of charity care and other community benefit activitie s are derived from both estimated and actual data. The estimated cos t of charity care includes the di rect and indirect cost of providing such services and is estimated utilizi ng the Hospital's ratio of cos t to gross charges, whi ch is then multiplied by the gross uncompens ated charges associated with providing ca re to charity patients. The Hospital receives payments from the New Jersey Health Care Subsidy Funds for charity care and such amounts totaled approxim ately $1,400,000 and $1,000,000 fo r the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This amou nt is subject to change from y ear to year based on available state amounts and allocation methodologie s. Charity care subsidies an d distributions sub sequent to June 30, 2021 are presently unknown. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 12 3. Net Patient Service Revenue The composition of the Hospital's net patient care service reve nue by payor for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 2021 2020 Medicare and Medicaid $ 360,233 $ 287,512 Managed care 453,444 376,781 Commercial and other 61,678 52,222 Total $ 875,355 $ 716,515 The composition of net patien t service revenue based on the Hos pital's lines of business for years ended December 31 is as follows: 2021 2020 Hospital $ 715,680 $ 588,894 Physician practices 159,675 127,621 Total $ 875,355 $ 716,515 The Hospital has agreements with third-party payors that provid e for payment for services rendered at amounts different from its e stablished rates. A summary of t he payment arrangements with major third-party payors follows: Medicare and Medicaid Hospitals are paid for most Medicare inpatient and outpatient s ervices under the national prospective payment system and other methodolog ies of the Medicare program for certain other services. Federal regulations provide for certain adjustments to current and prio r years' payment rates, based on industry-wide and hospital-specific data. Medicare cost reports of the Hospital have been audited and settled for years through 2017 at December 31, 2021. Inpatient acute care services re ndered to Medicaid program bene ficiaries are paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge. O utpatient services rendered to Medicaid program beneficiaries are reimbursed under cost-based and fee schedule methodologies. The Hospital is reimbursed for outpatient services at a tentativ e rate with final settlement d etermined after submission of annual cost reports and audits thereof by t he Medicaid fiscal intermediary. Medicaid cost reports of the Hospital have been audited and settled for years through 2018 at Decembe r 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net patient ser vice revenue was increased by approximately $5,247,000 and $3,165,000, respe ctively, for favo rable adjustments and settlements related to prior years. There are various proposals at t he federal and state levels tha t could, among other things, significantly reduce payment rat es or modify payment methods. T he ultimate outcome of these proposals and other market changes, including the potential eff ects of health care reform that has been enacted by the federal gover nment, cannot pre sently be det ermined. Future changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and any reduction of funding cou ld have an adverse impact on the Hospital. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 13 Laws and regulations governing t he Medicare and Medicaid progra ms are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a rea sonable possibility tha t recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term. The Hospital believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pen ding or threatened investigations involving allegations of potentia l wrongdoing that could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements . Noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and exclusion from such programs. Other Third-Party Payors The Hospital also has entered in to payment agreements with cert ain commercial insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations. The ba sis for payment to the Hospital under these agreements includes prospectively determined rates per discharg e or days of hospitalization and discounts from established char ges. Some of these agreements ha ve retrospective audit clauses, allowing the payor to review and adjust claims subsequent to in itial payment. Generally, patients who are cove red by third-party payors are r esponsible for related deductibles and coinsurance, which vary in am ount. The Hospital also provides s ervices to uninsured patients, and offers those uninsured or under insured patients a discount, eit her by policy or l aw, from standard charges. The Hospital estimates the transaction price for patie nts with deductibles and coinsurance and from those who are uninsured ba sed on historical experience and current market conditions. The initial estimate of the transaction price is determined by reducing the standard charges by any contractual adjustment, discount s and implici t price conces sions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adj ustment to net patient service revenue in the period of the change. For the year ended December 31, 20 21, the impact of changes in the estimates of discounts and cont ractual adjustments for performa nce obligations satisfied in prior years was insignificant to the consolidated financial statement s. Consistent with the Hospital's m ission, care is provided to pat ients regardless of t heir ability to pay. Therefore, the Hospital has det ermined it has provided implicit price concessions to uninsured patients and other patient balan ces (for example, copays and de ductibles). The implicit price concessions included in estimating the transaction price repres ent the difference between amounts billed to patients and the amounts the Hospital expects to coll ect based on its collection history with those patients. 4. Investments and Assets Limited as to Use The composition and reported val ue of short-term investments an d assets limited as to use consist of the following: December 31, 2021 2020 Short-term investments: Cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, certificates of deposit and other $ 28,527 $ 30,942 U.S. government obligations and other fixed income securities 5,469 5,849 Total short-term investments $ 33,996 $ 36,791 Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 14 December 31, 2021 2020 Assets limited as to use: U.S. government obligations and other fixed income securities $ 17,641 $ 16,680 Proceeds available und er lease agreements 3,920 1,408 Total assets limited as to use $ 21,561 $ 18,088 Assets limited as to use are m aintained for the following purpo ses: December 31, 2021 2020 Mortgage reserve fund $ 17,641 $ 16,680 Proceeds available und er lease agreements 3,920 1,408 Total assets limited as to use $ 21,561 $ 18,088 Assets limited as to use are held by a trustee in a mortgage re serve fund under terms of the Hospital's mortgage loan agreement (see Note 8). For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, investment inco me, which consists primarily of interest income on short-term i nvestments and assets limited as to use, totaled approximately $812,000 and $1,612,000, respectively, and is included in other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations a nd changes in net assets. 5. Fair Value Measurements The Hospital follows the provis ions of authoritative guidance r elating to fair value measurements. This guidance defines fair value , establishes a framework for m easuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and enhances di sclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that wou ld be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to trans fer a liability in an orderly transaction between ma rket participants at the measurement date. The framew ork that this guidance establis hes for measuring fair value includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in determining valuations i nto three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is deter mined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the fa ir value hierarchy are as foll ows: Level 1 - Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in ac tive markets that are accessible to the Hospital for identical asset s. These generally provide the most reliable evidence and are used to measure fair value whenever available. Level 2 - Fair value is based on significant inputs, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable either directly or indirectly for subs tantially the full term of the a sset through corroboration with observable market data. Level 2 inputs incl ude quoted market prices in act ive markets for similar assets, quoted market prices in markets that are not active for identical or s imilar assets and othe r observable inputs. Level 3 - Fair value is based on significant unobservable input s. Examples of valuation methodologies that would result in Level 3 cla ssification include option pric ing models, discounted cash flows and other similar techniques. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 15 Financial assets carried at fair v alue, excluding assets in the defined benefit pension plan, are classified in the table below in one of the three categories described abo ve: December 31, 2021 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Reported at fair value: Money market funds and certificates of deposit $ 29,370 $ 29,370 $ - $ - U.S. government obligations 17,732 17,732 - - Mortgage-backed securities 4,470 - 4,470 - Total 51,572 $ 47,102 $ 4,470 $ - Cash and cash equivalents 65 Total investments $ 51,637 December 31, 2020 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Reported at fair value: Money market funds and certificates of deposit $ 29,195 $ 29,195 $ - $ - U.S. government obligations 19,947 19,947 - - Mortgage-backed securities 4,133 - 4,133 - Total 53,275 $ 49,142 $ 4,133 $ - Cash and cash equivalents 196 Total investments $ 53,471 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Hospital in estimating fair value disclosures for the consolidated financial statements: Money market funds and certificat es of deposit - The carrying a mount of money market funds and certificates of deposit approxim ates fair value due to the shor t-term nature of th ese instruments. Assets whose use is lim ited - The fair values for U.S. governme nt obligations and mortgage-backed securities included in assets wh ose use is lim ited are based on quoted market prices for identical (Level 1) or similar in vestments (Level 2). Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 16 6. Property, Plant and Equipment A summary of property, plant and equipment follows: December 31, 2021 2020 Depreciable assets: Land improvements assets: Land 181 181 Construction 7,710 8,980 Deposits on equipment 118 54 8,009 9,215 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 342,410 $ 338,939 Included in major movable equipment and accumulated depreciatio n are the following: December 31, 2021 2020 Assets acquired under capital leases $ 57,681 $ 81,703 Accumulated depreciation on assets acquired under capital leases 22,436 33,032 Substantially all property, plant and equipment is collateraliz ed under long-ter m debt agreements (see Note 8). Depreciation expense related to property and equipment amounted to approximately $41.9 million and $40.3 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Hospital capitalizes interes t on construction in progress. During 2021 and 2020, approximately $500,000 and $330,000, respectively, of net interest income was capitalized. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 17 7. Due From (to) Affiliates Amounts due from (to) affiliates were as follows: December 31, 2021 2020 Englewood Healthcare Properties $ 2,183 $ 2,320 Englewood Health 283 283 Englewood Healthcare Enterprises, Inc. (1,244) (2,638) Englewood Health Foundation 390 563 Due from affiliates, net $ 1,612 $ 528 The Foundation released from res trictions and contributed appro ximately $2.6 million and $3.3 million to the Hospital in 2021 a nd 2020, respectivel y, for operating purp oses. Those amounts are included in other revenue. Amounts due from affiliates resul t from the Hospital's payment of various expenses on behalf of these affiliates. These amounts are se ttled monthly or as funds becom e available. 8. Long-Term Debt, Lines of Credit and Capital Lease Obligation s Long-term debt and capital lease obligations consist of the fol lowing: December 31, 2021 2020 FHA Section 241 insured mortgage loan (a) $ 67,328 $ 69,501 FHA Section 242 insured mortgage loan (b) 40,129 44,510 Capital lease obligations (c) 38,174 40,204 Lines of credit (d) - 10,500 Other loans (e) 25,651 - 171,282 164,715 Less current portion (24,852) (36,075) Less deferred financing costs, net (1,783) (1,974) Total $ 144,647 $ 126,666 (a) In 2013 and 2015, a total o f three mortgage loans were made available and are payable to Prudential Huntoon Paige Associates, LLC. The loans are insured under the provisions of the Federal Housing Authority (FHA ) Section 241 program. The mortga ge loans are collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of the Hospital's assets. A loan evidenced by notes in the amount of $7,926,100, $20,00 0,000 and $50,000,000 shall bea r interest at the rates of 4.95 percent, 4.95 perce nt and 4.99 percent per annum, respecti vely, payable in monthly installments.

Pension Plan and Postretirement Healthcare Benefits The Hospital has a noncontribut ory defined benefit pension plan (the Plan). On December 31, 1998, an amendment to the Plan was approv ed which ceased the accrual of further benefits under the Plan subsequent to December 31, 1998 for nonunion employees. In June 2012, the Hospital amended the Plan to freeze all future benef it accruals under the Plan w hile preserving all benefits accrued as of December 31, 2012 for its union and nonunion employees. The Hos pital's funding policy provides that payments to the pension plan sh all be equal to the minimum fund ing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Ac t of 1974 (ERISA) plus additional amounts which may be approved by the Hospital from time to time. In addition to the defined benefi t pension plan, the Hospital m aintains a defined contribution retirement plan covering substantially all nonunion employees who have com pleted one year of service, have worked 1,000 hours or more durin g the year and have attained 21 years of age. This plan also covers Bargaining Unit (Union) employe es hired on or after January 1, 2007 who have completed one year of service, have worked 1,000 hours or more during the year and ha ve attained age 21. As of January 1, 2013, this plan also covers Bargai ning Unit (Union) employees h ired prior to January 1, 2007, who have completed one year of service, have worked 1,000 hours or more during the year and have attained age 21. Employees may contribut e a percentage of their annual s alary, which will be matched by the Hospital, at a rate of 50 perc ent. The required levels of servi ce and contribution percentages are as follows: Contributions Employee Employer Match Years of service: Less than 5 years 4.00 % 2.00 % 5 to 9 years 6.00 3.00 10 to 14 years 7.00 3.50 15 to 19 years 8.00 4.00 20 to 24 years 9.00 4.50 25 to 29 years 10.00 5.00 30 to 34 years 11.00 5.50 35 or more years 12.00 6.00 Individuals may contribute in excess of the abov e employee cont ributions, up to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ER ISA) limitations, without Hospital match ing. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, pension expense related to the defined contribution plan was approximately $3.5 m illion and $3.3 million, respectiv ely. The Hospital also sponsors a defined benefit postretirement pla n which provides medical, dental and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees and their eligible depe ndents. Eligibility for this plan is limited to a closed group of retirees who we re covered by the collective bar gaining agreement during employment and who met certain length of service requirements. The Hospital's medical and dental plan contribution for retiree s both under and over age 65 is fixed based on years of service. The re tiree's contribution is based on the difference between the Hospital's fixed contribution and current p remium, as determined annually by the carrier. The medical and dental insurance plans contain other cos t-sharing features such as ded uctibles and co-insurance. The life insurance benefit is provided on a noncontributory basis. The H ospital's funding policy is to pay the cost of medical and dental benefits as incurred.

The current portion of postretir ement health benefits approxima ting $105,000 and $109,000 are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accomp anying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 21 The projected benefit obligation , accumulated benefit obligatio n and fair value of plan assets at December 31 are as follows: 2021 2020 Projected benefit obligation $ 136,624 $ 145,339 Accumulated benefit obligation 136,624 145,339 Fair value of plan assets 120,234 117,846 Net periodic benefit cost includes the following components: Pension Benefits Postretirement Healthcare Benefits 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost * $ 870 $ 1,080 $ - $ - Interest cost 3,844 4,571 34 32 Expected return on assets (6,386) (6,685) - - Amortization of unrecognized gains and losses 2,746 2,912 (212) (215) Net periodic benefit cost $ 1,074 $ 1,878 $ (178) $ (183) Pension Benefits Postretirement Healthcare Benefits 2021 2020 2021 2020 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31: Discount rates 3.01 % 2.73 % 2.99 % 2.67 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 5.45 6.50 - Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate 2.73 % 3.50 % 2.67 % 3.50 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 5.45 6.50 - - * Includes Pension Benefit Guarant ee Corporation and other admi nistrative fees The expected long-term rate of r eturn on plan assets assumption of 5.45 percent was selected using the \"building block\" approach described by the Actuarial Standa rds Board in Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 27, Selecting Economi c Assumptions for Measuring P ension Obligations. Based on the Hospital's investment policy fo r the pension plan in effect as of the beginning of the fiscal year, a best estimate range was determined for both the real rate of return (net of inflation) and for inflation based on historical 30-year period rolli ng averages. An average inflatio n rate within the range equal to 3 percent was selected and added to the real rate of return range to arri ve at a best estimate. Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 22 The Hospital's investment polic ies and strategies for plan asse ts include allocations of a diversified portfolio of equity investments , fixed income securities and ca sh equivalents. Though these assets are long term in nature, a reasonable amount of liquidity should be maintained. Although there is no minimum funding requirement for 2021, the Hospital will eval uate the appropriate level of voluntary contribut ions to be made during 2022. The Hospital expects to pay fu ture benefits under the pension a nd postretirement benefits as follows: Pension Benefits Postretirement Health Benefits $ 9,423 374 Total $ 87,929 $ 861 For measurement purposes, the following annual rates of increas e in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits were assumed for 2021: Year Medical Indemnity and Preferred Provider Hospitals Dental 2021 7.5% 5.0% The rates are assumed to decreas e gradually to 5.0 percent by 2 027 and remain at that level thereafter. The Hospital's contribution for postretirement medical and dent al benefits is fixed except for employee discounts and union retirees who retired prior to September 1, 1991. Therefore, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligati on and interest cost component o f net periodic benefit cost have a relatively low sensitivity to i ncreases in the health care cost trend rates . For example, incr easing the assumed healthcare cost trend rates by one percentage point in each yea r would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligati on by $685 for 2021. Decreasing the assumed healthc are cost trend rates by one percentage point in each ye ar would decrease the accumul ated postretirement benefit obligation by $590 for 2021. Financial assets ca rried at fair value included in the defined benefit pension plan are classified in the table below: December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Money market funds $ 1,281 $ - $ - $ 1,281 Corporate bonds 22,574 96,379 - 118,953 Total assets in the fair value hierarchy $ 23,855 $ 96,379 $ - $ 120,234 Englewood Hospital and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 and 2020 23 December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Money market funds $ 626 $ - $ - $ 626 Mutual funds 117,220 - - 117,220 Total assets in the fair value hierarchy $ 117,846 $ - $ - $ 117,846 Mutual funds are valued at the da ily closing price as reported by the fund.
