What is a vaccine? Think of a vaccine as a way for your immune system to practice for a virus. Vaccines give the body a preview of one or more key features of a virus before you get the actual virus. The immune system then develops a \"memory\" of how to react and stop the virus once you are exposed to it. 2. How will the vaccine for the new coronavirus work? The vaccine allows the immune system to produce antibodies that latch onto the spike protein that makes coronaviruses unique. (Coronaviruses got their name because the viruses have protein spikes that look like a crown.) . This allows t he immune system to quickly recog nize the actual coronaviruses and interfere with its ability to multiply . The idea is to stop SARS -CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19, from getting into cells, replicating itself and making a person sick. 3. How are COVID -19 vaccines tested for safety? COVID -19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials to assess their safety. No vaccine will receive approval to be used outside of a clinical trial unless at least two months have gone by after the final shot in order to monitor for safety concerns. It may take more time, and more people getting vaccinated before we learn about extremely rare side effects. That is why safety monitoring will continue even after it is approved for use, like all other vaccines . The Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) each have an independent group of experts that review all the safety data as it comes in and provide regular safety updates. If a safety issue is detected, immediate action will take place to determine if the issue is related to the COVID -19 vaccine and determine the best course of action. Learn more about testing on the CDC website . Learn m ore about the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine clinical trials on their webs ite. 4. How do vaccine trials work in the United States? There are several stages to vaccine development, such as the exploratory, pre -clinical, clinical, review and approval, manufacturing and quality control stages. In the clinical development stage, there are three Phases where humans participate in the trials : Phase I - Small groups of people are given the vaccine to test for safety, early effects and dosage. Phase II - Hundreds of people with different characteristics (such as ag e and health status) are given the vaccine to further test for safety, effects and dosage. Phase III - Thousands of people are given the vaccine to test if it's safe and effective against the virus. During this time an independent Data Safety Monitoring Bo ard reviews any reported safety concerns. Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations Once all three phases are complete, the FDA reviews the trial results and conducts other important safety inspections before approving a vaccine for use. Once approved, the FDA continues to oversee production and m onitor activity to ensure safety. 5. What is the phase three trial for the COVID -19 vaccine ? A phase three trial is the last stage before FDA approval. It tests the vaccine's safety and effectiveness with thousands of patients. The first vaccines being tested in the U.S. will include 30,000 or more participants each, and the trials will follow them for two years. 6. In the trial, do all 30,000 COVID -19 vaccine trial participants receive the vaccine? No. These trials are randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials. In other words, some participants get the vaccine and others get a placebo injection of salt water. Which participants end up getting the drug or placebo is randomly assigned. Neither the participant nor the health care workers doing the injections know if the vaccine or placebo are in the vial. Even the researchers leading the trials do not know whether a given participa nt has gotten the vaccine or the saline injection. Which is why these trials are known as \"double blind\". The analysis of the data is done by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. 7. How can the COVID -19 vaccine be fast -tracked when other vaccines tak e years? Under normal circumstances, from pre -clinical testing to distribution, a vaccine takes roughly 72 months, or six years, to develop. Under the federal government's Operation Warp Speed (OWS), the timeline to develop a COVID -19 vaccine has been reduced to only 14 months. According to the CDC, OWS provide d the resources and fundin g needed from the federal government to create highly coordinated efforts, which accelerate development while maintaining standards for safety and efficacy. Specifically, clinical protocols that show the safety and efficacy of the vaccine are aligned, whic h allows the vaccine trials to proceed more quickly. Additionally, the protocols for the trials are overseen by the federal government, as opposed to traditional public -private partnerships, in which pharmaceutical companies decide on their own protocols. Rather than eliminating steps from traditional vaccine development timelines, the steps outlined under OWS advance simultaneously, such as starting manufacturing of the vaccine at an industrial scale well before the demonstration of vaccine efficacy and s afety as happens under normal vaccine development. This increases costs associated with development but does not risk the safety or efficacy of the vaccine and compresses the overall timeline, but not the clinical study timeline . Additionally, according to the CDC, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are two diseases caused by coronaviruses that are closely related to the virus that causes COVID -19. Researchers began working on developing vaccines for these diseases after they were discovered in 2003 and 2012, respectively. None of the SARS vaccines ever made it past the first stages of development and testing, in large part because the virus disappeared. One MERS vaccine (MVA -MERS -S) successfully com pleted a phase 1 clinical trial in 2019. Lessons learned from this earlier vaccine research have been used to inform strategies for developing a COVID -19 vaccine. Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations Clinical COVID -19 Vaccine Questions 8. Currently, w hat are the types of COVID -19 vaccines undergoing clinical trials? According to the CDC, there are three main types of COVID -19 vaccines that have, are or soon will be undergoing large -scale ( phase three ) clinical trials in the United States. Below is a description of how each type of vaccine triggers our immune systems to recognize and protect us from the virus that causes COVID -19. None of these vaccines can give you COVID -19, as they do not contain a live COVID -19 virus . mRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID -19. This material gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and trigger an immune response that will remember how to fig ht the virus that causes COVID -19 if we are infected in the future. Protein subunit vaccines include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that cause COVID -19 instead of the entire germ. Once vaccinated, our immune system recognizes that the proteins do n't belong in the body and begins making antibodies. If we are ever infected in the future, memory cells will recognize and fight the virus. Vector vaccines contain a weakened version of a live virus \u2014a different virus than the one that causes COVID -19\u2014that has genetic material from the virus that causes COVID - 19 inserted in it (this is called a viral vector). Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that prompts our bodies to build immunity that will remember how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future. 9. What is the difference between a live vaccine and an inactivated vaccine? Live vaccine s contain a version of the living virus or bacteria that is weakened so it does not cause a serious disease in people with healthy immune systems. These vaccines are a good teacher for the immune system because they are the closest thing to a natura l infection. None of the vaccines currently being studied today for COVID -19 are live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are made by inactivating, or killing, the germ during the vaccine making process. This type of vaccine produces an immune response in a different way than a live vaccine. Multiple doses are often necessary to build or maintain an immunity. 10. How will we k now the COVID -19 vaccine is safe? Vaccines undergo at three phase testing process involving thousands of subjects. They receive approval from the FDA only after they demonstrate safety and meet at least the minimum standard of effectiveness. Monitoring con tinues after they hit the market; effectiveness and any rare side effects or safety issues become more apparent after millions of doses are given. The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how federal partners are working together to ensure the safety of COVID -19 vaccines . 11. What level of immunity is obtained by either catching COVID -19, or getting the vaccine? The protection someone gains from having an infection (called natural immunity) varies depending on the disease, and it varies from person to person. Since this virus is new, it's not yet known how long natural immunity might last. Some early evidence \u2014based on some peopl e\u2014 seems to suggest that natural immunity may last at least 6 -8 months . Regarding vaccination, it's also not known how long immunity lasts until more data is available on how well it works. Both natural immunity and vaccine -induced immunity are important a spects of COVID -19 that experts Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations are trying to learn more about. 12. What is herd immunity? Herd immunity is when enough of a population has immunity against a disease that it can no longer spread. The herd -immunity threshold for coronavirus is not known. However, it is thought to be between 60 and 80 percent of the population. Herd immunity can be reached through vaccine immunization or through natural infection. 13. How do you know a vaccine is effective? Vaccines are tested for safety and effectiveness thr ough clinical trials. Some people in the trail are given the vaccine, and some are given a placebo shot. The participants are then followed to see who gets COVID -19. By comparing how many people given the actual vaccine get sick to how many people who get the placebo get sick, we can tell how g ood the vaccine is in preventing COVID -19. In the case of the Moderna and Pfizer COVID -19 vaccines, both were near 95 percent effective in preventing COVID -19 illness in those vaccinated compared to those who got a placebo shot. 14. Why do the COVID -19 vaccine s need to be stored in such cold conditions? Vaccines are stored in specific conditions to avoid losing effectiveness of the ingredients. In particular, mRNA vaccine technology requires cold temperatures to preserve the vaccine and its properties. Pfizer's vaccine needs to be kept extremely cold \u2014minus 70 degrees Celsius \u2014 requiring special freezers, or the use of dry ice. Moderna's vaccine needs to be frozen too, but at only minus 20 Celsius \u2014more like a re gular freezer. 15. When will the COVID -19 vaccine be available? The Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine was approved by the FDA and is in route to hospitals, arriving the week o f Dec. 14. Currently , there are not enough doses available for all adults , and we will begin vaccinating those in all roles across the continuum who spend most of their day face to face with patients, fo llowed by others as supplies increase . Supplies will be shipped weekly, with quantities increasing over time. The FDA is reviewing the emergency use authorization application for Moderna's vaccine on Dec. 17. It is expected that t here will be 100 million doses distributed by the end of February 2021 - enough to vaccinate health care colleagues, residents of long -term care facilities, and essential workers such as firefighters, corrections officers and transportation workers. All adults should be able to get vaccinated later in 2021. 16. Is it possible for the COVID -19 vaccine to give me the virus? Because none of the COVID -19 vaccines currently in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID -19, getting the vaccine cannot give you COVID -19. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. 17. Will getting vaccinated cause me to test positive on COVID -19 viral tests? Vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States won't cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection. If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, you will likely test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection or that you have been vaccinated successfully and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currentl y looking at how COVID -19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results and how long immunity lasts after vaccination . Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations 18. I've already had a flu shot. Will it also protect me from getting COVID -19? No. A flu vaccine will not protect you from getting COVID -19, but it can prevent you from getting influenza (flu) at the same time as COVID -19. This can keep you from having a more severe illness. While it's not possible to say with certainty what will happen this winter, the CDC believes it's likely that flu vir uses and the virus that causes COVID -19 will both be spreading during that time. That means that getting a flu vaccine is more important than ever. 19. Does a person who has previously been sick with COVID -19 still need to be vaccinated? Due to the severe hea lth risks associated with COVID -19 and the fact that re -infection with COVID -19 is possible, people may be advised to get a COVID -19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID -19 before. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected f rom getting sick again after recovering from COVID -19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long. Experts won't know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until more data is available on how well it works. 20. Can my child get the vaccine? The COVID -19 vaccine has been approved for those ages 16 and older. Additional studies are underway to determine safety and effectiveness for younger children. 21. Can a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding receive the vaccine? Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should talk with their doctor about the vaccine. 22. I am immunocompromised . Should I receive the vaccine? Discuss your medical condition and the vaccine with your doctor for a personalized recommendation. 23. I have a history of allergic reactions to vaccines, like the flu vaccine. Should I get the vaccine? If you have a history of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to vaccines, talk with your doctor before receiving the vaccine . 24. Is the Pfizer vaccine safe for people with egg or tree nut/peanut allergies ? The Pfizer vaccine does not contain egg or nut products so people with a history of egg or nut allergies should not be concerned about having a reaction. 25. What are the Pfizer vaccine ingredients? Inactive ingredients in the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine are shown here: 26. Does the Pfizer vaccine have preservatives? No, it is preservative free. Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations 27. My family member lives in a senior care facility, when will they get the vaccine? Those living and working in senior care facilities will be among the first, along with frontline healthcare worker s, to receive the COVID -19 vaccine. You should contact the care facility for additional information. 28. Do COVID -19 vaccines have side effects? The most common side effects are pain/redness at the injection side, headache, fatigue, muscle/joint aches and low -grade fever. The side effects respond well to Tylenol and non - steroidal anti -inflammatory medications like ibuprofen. Most side effects last less than 24 hours and those ages 55 and older reported fewer side effects. 29. How many vaccine doses will be needed? The approved Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine requires two doses, 21 days apart. Similarly, the Moderna vaccine , for which there is an emergency use authorization application to the FDA, also uses two different injections with four weeks between each one. The same vaccine brand must b e used for both shots. Two shots are generally needed to provide the best protection. The first one primes the immune system, helping it to recognize the virus, and the second one strengthens the immune response. 30. Assuming there will be other vaccines appr oved in addition to the Pfizer one, will I be able to choose which one I want? It is recommended that people receive the vaccine as soon as supplies are available to them - no matter the brand . Because the vaccine is being distributed by the sates, we will get shipments weekly but do not yet know how much of each brand. 31. Can I get the vaccine if I am not feeling well? If you are not feeling well, it is recommended that you wait until you are feeling better to get the vaccine. 32. Once vaccinated, how long does it take before I develop immunity? The vaccine requires two doses three or four weeks apart, depending upon vaccine. Immunity takes some time to develop - at least one to two weeks after last the last injection. For example, someone vaccinated with the first dose in late December won't be fully protected until late January or early February. 33. Once I've been vaccinated, do I need to continue to wear a mask and practice socia l distancing? Yes. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID -19 vaccines provide under real - life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mou th and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others. Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID -19 vaccines provide before deciding to change recommendations on steps everyone should take to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID -19. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision. 34. Vaccine distribution would seem to pose many logistical challenges. What has been done to plan for distribution of the COVID -19 vaccine? The federal government is overseeing a centralized system to order, distribute, and track COVID - 19 vaccines. The states are charged with many of the details of distribution, tracking, and follow - up. All vaccines will be ordered through CDC. Vaccine providers, such as Trinity Health, will receive vaccines from CDC's centralized distributor or directly from a vaccine manufacturer . Planning efforts are very detailed and include among many things a focus on: Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations Establishing and testing logistics plans with manufacturers and commercial partners that are part of CDC's centralized COVID -19 vaccine delivery system. Coordinating the first d istribution of vaccines and needed supplies from centralized locations. Reporting on vaccine inventory, administration, and safety using a variety of new and enhanced data systems. Expanding safety surveillance through new systems and additional informatio n sources, as well as scaling up existing safety monitoring systems. 35. What has Trinity Health been doing to prepare for the logistical challenges of such widespread vaccine distribution? We have a vaccine operations workgroup looking at the many factors related to how to vaccinate lots of people quickly while still maintaining physical distancing. Also, because at least one of the vaccines needs to be kept very cold before use, we are developing the workflows and proc esses to make sure the vaccine is handled properly until used. Another vaccine advisory group is developing recommendations around who should be vaccinated first, as vaccines will be in short supply initially. In addition, each region has its own vaccine o perations group planning specific locations for vaccination (for example, drive -through vaccination sites) in each local market. COVID -19 Vaccination for Trinity Health Colleag ues 36. As a Catholic health organization, what considerations have been given to a COVID -19 vaccination program? The Catholic Health Association (CHA) has asserted six principles to effectively and justly develop and allocate COVID -19 vaccines: Vaccines should be demonstrably safe and adequately tested Vaccines should be demonstrated to be scientifically effective Vaccines development must respect human dignity Vaccines should be equitably distributed with priority to those at most risk Efforts to develop and distribute an effective vaccine should emphasize solidarity Cons istent with the principle of Subsidiarity, the distribution of effective vaccines should involve local communities 37. Is Trinity Health mandating that I receive the COVID -19 vaccine? No, r eceiving the COVID -19 vaccine is voluntary for Trinity Health colleagues currently . 38. Will Trinity Health be offering the COVID -19 vaccine to colleagues? Yes, we are offering the vaccine to colleagues in accordance with recommendations from the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and guidance from the CDC, and other federal and state agencies. Eventually, all colleagues who are interested in receiving the vaccine will have an opportun ity to be vaccinated. We strongly encourage everyone 16 years or older to receive the vaccine to continue protecting themselves and help end the pandemic. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding , those who are immunocompromised, and those with a history of severe allergic reactions to vaccines should first speak with their doctor. 39. Which vaccine will Trinity Health receive? Trinity Health will receive all vaccines approved by the FDA emergency use authorization process. Because t hey will be distributed from the federal government to the state and then to us, it is likely that different vaccination locations will have different vaccine at different times. Once you start with the first shot it is important that you get the second sh ot made by the same vaccine Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations manufacturer, and we are working to be sure the second appointment can be made at the time of the first vaccination 40. How will I know when I can receive the vaccine? Will you let me know when it's available to me? The first supply of the vaccine will be available the week of December 14. Initially, the vaccine will be available to those at highest risk for COVID -19, including front line healthcare workers and people who live or work in senior care facilities. Supplies will in crease over time, and all adults should be able to get vaccinated later in 2021. You will receive frequent update s about vaccine availability and distribution at your Health Ministry. 41. How do I sign up to receive the vaccine? The process varies by state. We will continue to keep you informed about availability, and the process to sign up to receive the vaccine when the supplies are available for you . We are committed to mak ing it easy for colleagues ; some Health Ministries have online tools for scheduling colleague vaccines . 42. Who will get vaccinated first? Per CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (CDC -ACIP) guidance, f rontline health care workers and long-term care facility residents and staff will get the first dose s. It is expected high-risk populations including older adults and people with underlying medical conditions will be next. States have been given the flexibility to modify these depending upon their local populations. 43. Is there a level of vaccine prioritization among health care workers? Vaccine prioritization for health care workers is broken out per the following groupings: 1a (i) - Health Care Personnel (HCP) who provide direct patient care to or are face -to- face with large numbers of suspected or confirmed COVID -19 patients (all roles in all locations across the continuum, including, for example, ambulatory sites, home care, etc.): o COVID - designated areas/locations, including monoclonal antibody infusion centers o Emerg ency Departments and urgent care o Testing centers and vaccinators o Fever, Upper Respiratory Infection ( FURI ) clinics o ICU 1a (ii) - HCP who provide direct patient care to or are face -to-face with large numbers of patients NOT suspected of having COVID -19 (al l roles in all locations across the continuum, including, for example, ambulatory sites, home care, etc .) o Includes all direct patient care facing roles and those interacting directly with patients including registration, transportation, dietary, etc. 1a(iii) - Other HCP providing essential services throughout the healthcare delivery system: (all roles in all locations across the continuum, including, for example, ambulatory sites, home care, etc.): o HCP who handle infectious materials (e.g. , environment al services, laboratory workers) who are not direct patient care facing and cannot work from home 1a(iv) - All other HCP, including those who can currently work remotely (all roles in all locations across the continuum, including, for example, ambulatory sites, home care, etc.). States may also modify this according to their local populations. Note that this includes all roles across all health ca re workers and all sites of care in Trinity Health . Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations 44. How much will it cost to get the vaccine? As a Trinity Health colleague, you can receive the vaccination for free. Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the Am erican people at no cost. However, vaccination providers will be able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone. Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient's public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patie nts, by the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. 45. Where can I get vaccinated? Will Employee Health Services (EHS) /Occupational Health be responsible for vaccinating colleagues as part of the employment relationship? Vaccines will be available at pharmacies, doctor's offices, public health clinics, mobile clinics, etc. EHS (also known as Occupational Health in some ministries) will not manage the vaccine process. Trinity Health, in its role as a provider of health care services, will provide vaccines for colleagues who choose to receive it. Colleagues will follow established patient vaccination processes to register as a patient and receive a COVID -19 vaccine. In doing so, we will ensure a consistent and efficient proce ss for both colleague and community vaccination, which is critical during a mass vaccination. However, to the extent that EHS colleagues are available and willing to assist in the actual vaccination process, their participation and support will be welcomed . 46. Do I need to wear a mask when I receive the vaccine? The CDC recommends that during the pandemic people wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth when in contact with others outside their household, including when in health care facilities, and when receiving any vaccine, including a COVID -19 vaccine. 47. If I get the vaccine, do I still need to follow all the Trinity Health COVID 19 policies? Yes, your choice to get the vaccine is a personal one and does not impact how you are expected to behave regarding our COVID -19 policies. It is anticipated that until enough people get vaccinated, we will continue to require masks at work and encourage all the things we have been doing to try to decrease transmission including physical distancing, w earing masks in public, avoiding large crowds and hand hygiene, at least until most people in the U .S. have been vaccinated. 48. What happens if I experience a need to be off work following my voluntary COVID -19 vaccination? Following vaccination, mild side -effects such as fever, muscle aches, heada che, joint aches, or chills have been reported . If you experience fever, muscle aches, headache, joint aches, or chills within 1 calendar day of vaccination , you can work if you are well enough to work. Follow your Health Ministry's established process with Employee/Occupational Health if you : do not feel well enough to work or experience a cough or Experience inability to taste or smell or Have symptoms consistent with COVID -19 that last beyond 1 calendar day You should also follow up with your primary care provider. If time off is needed, Trinity Health provides a comprehensive time away from work program for colleagues to use, generally referred to as Paid Time Off (PTO) in most ministries. 49. There is a lot of misunderstanding about the vaccine. How can I help educate people I know about the vaccine? As health care professionals, we have the responsibility to continue to be leaders in our communities. Please encourage everyone to get educated about the vaccine's safety and efficacy by directing them to our information page and to the CDC and state vaccine information pages. Version # 4 December 13, 2020 COVID -19 Response Team Owner: Clinical Operations Our colleagues, families, friends, neighbors and acquaintances look to us for guidance and are influenced by our words and examples w e set. COVID -19 Vaccine for our Patients and Communities 50. Will Trinity Health offer the COVID 19 vaccine to our patients? Yes. We will participate in this national effort to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible as it is our best weapon to stop this pandemic. We will follow the federal and state guidelines on vaccination priorities in order to assure those with the most risk of getting infection and being hospitalized or dying from COVID -19 are vaccinated first. 51. Will Trinity Healt h offer the COVID -19 vaccine to our broader communities? Yes, effective and efficient community vaccination is critical during a mass vaccination. We are eager to participate in this national effort as it presents the best weapon for stopping the pandemic. 52. Where can I get more information?
