To mitigate digital overload, people are using healing stones to reconnect with nature, prioritize self-care, practice meditation, and enhance their well-being. Who can resist the undeniable beauty of healing stones? But they are much more than eye-candy. Healing stones have powerful energetic properties that harmonize the mind, body, and spirit. Crystals align the seven chakras, which are energy centers in the body that promote the flow of healing life force. But there are so many types of crystals; it's hard to know where to start. Sound familiar? If you're embarking on a crystal healing journey, you likely have many questions. Allow us to be your guide! We're breaking down all of the crystal healing basics, including 45 essential healing crystals, to lead you toward high-vibes and happy times. Ready to ascend? Let the journey begin! There's a lot to learn about the basics of healing stones, but people use them for help with calming, grounding, and energizing. And that's been the story since early antiquity. Healing crystals date back to ancient times when our earliest ancestors used them as natural medicine. How can a simple stone contain a vast vibrational current of healing energies? In Traditional Chinese Medicine, healing stones promote the flow of Qi (also called Prana in Hindu), which is positive life force energy. The practice comes from ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophies that rely on the natural elements to tap into a higher frequency of mindfulness, self-acceptance, and inner peace. Healing stones break through physical, emotional, and metaphysical blockages to cleanse the body and soul of negative energy. And while our lives starkly contrast those of our ancestors, we still use crystals today! So, who first discovered crystals, and how did they transition into the mainstream? Let's find out! Crystals date back to 4500 BC, when Ancient Sumerians first introduced and documented them in mystical serums and elixirs. As human civilization evolved, healing stones migrated into early Egyptian, Mexican, and Greek society. The history of healing crystals is long and diverse \u2014 from protective battle armor to medicinal talismans to conduits to the divine portal to navigational devices and royal trinkets. What thread ties all of these crystal uses together? While every type of crystal has unique properties, they all serve to heal and help you access intuition and consciousness. While the practice was a fundamental element of primitive tradition, it didn't crossover into modern medicine until the early 17th century, when a German astronomer observed the flawless symmetry of snowflakes. Recording his discovery as a [\"six-cornered snowflake,\" Johannes Kepler](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/johannes-kepler-the-sixcornered-snowflake-oxford-clarendon-press-1966-pp-xvi-75-illus-21s/1F13F0D507D88FFDB343C722B5C8FCA2) crafted the earliest mathematical formula for crystallography as a packed spherical structure. But enough of the history lesson; let's talk about the role healing crystals play in our fast-paced, modern lives. You've heard of gemstones, crystals, and healing stones, but are they all the same? Sometimes, but not always. Gemstones are rare, pure \"gem quality\" minerals, and their higher prices reflect that distinction. For example, [diamonds](https://www.gemrockauctions.com/learn/a-z-of-gemstones/diamonds-information) are strictly gemstones for their high purity and quality. But what about a rose quartz crystal or tourmaline? Crystals are pure minerals with geometrically shaped molecules. Crystals tend to be raw, rough, and inexpensive. One reason is that crystals don't exhibit sparkle and brilliance like gemstones. Leaving a raw mineral untouched amplifies its natural properties. How does a gemstone become a healing stone? The same chemical composition can produce either a gemstone or a crystal. For instance, leaving amethyst raw and uncut results in raw, jutting crystal. But send it to a lapidary (gem cutter) and you'll get back a sparkling, gem-quality amethyst jewel. Additionally, the rock's crystal system categorizes it by either gemstone or crystal. So if a stone has a cubic, tetragonal, or hexagonal-shaped crystal structure, it will fall into the crystal category. So then, what gemstones are considered crystals? To answer that, let's go down the list of crystals and their meanings to give you a better understanding. The mineral kingdom is broad and filled with hundreds of species. There are raw and rough crystals, clusters and geodes, slices, points, and wands. Every healing stone has properties that stimulate emotional and spiritual well-being. Below, we've compiled an extensive list of the most popular types of crystals and their meanings.
