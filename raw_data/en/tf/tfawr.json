Also called Indian lilac in English, and \"neemba\" in Sanskrit, the plant - scientific name Azadirachta indica - teems with 130 biologically active compounds, some of which have antiviral and antibacterial qualities, some of which boost immunity, and lots more. As a child I remember my grandfather - who lived to the age of 93 - not ever having to buy a toothbrush or toothpaste. Every morning he'd snap a twig from a neem tree growing in our courtyard and brush his teeth with it. He would also chew neem leaves to boost his immunity, apply neem oil to his hair, and sprinkle boiled neem bark water in his room to ward off pests and mosquitoes. He knew what he was doing. Ayurvedic experts have for centuries promoted neem as the most versatile medicinal plant in the world, with each of its parts brimming with health benefits. \"From its bark to leaves, flowers, fruits, twigs, seeds and root, neem is full of health-giving properties,\" says Bharti Raghav, a yoga and Ayurvedic expert based in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Neem's antimicrobial properties make it effective against several types of bacteria, viruses and fungi, Raghav adds. \"Ayurvedic texts describe how neem treats skin disorders, hair problems, enhances appetite, boosts digestion, tackles diabetes, facilitates healing of wounds, relieves nausea and much more.\" [What is third-generation yoga and Ayurveda expert, says neem is a rich source of antioxidants, which may make it effective in managing cancer. \"Dried and powdered neem has a good shelf life, which also makes it ideal for carrying along while travelling or in places where the tree doesn't grow. It can be preserved for months without spoilage,\" he adds. Though the tree grows predominantly in the Indian subcontinent, it is now being cultivated in similar climates across the world for people to tap its potent therapeutic powers. Modern research has also spotlighted neem's healthful properties, in particular a 1992 report from the US National Research Council called \"Neem: A tree for solving global problems\" that recognised neem's medicinal and other values. The preface of that report is gushing in its praise of neem's potential: \"Neem is a fascinating tree ... it seems to be one of the most promising of all plants and may eventually benefit every person on the planet. Probably no other yields as many strange and varied products or has as many exploitable by-products. \"Indeed, as foreseen by some scientists, this plant may usher in a new era in pest control, provide millions with inexpensive medicines, cut down the rate of human population growth, and perhaps even reduce erosion, deforestation, and the excessive temperature of an overheated globe.\" [5 immune system superfoods used in Ayurvedic medicine](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3091045/five-immune-system-superfoods-used-ayurveda-indian?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) In the three decades since that review there have been many studies of neem's potential medicinal value in treating illnesses, from cancer to the coronavirus. A 2014 study in the journal Leukemia and Lymphoma examined neem leaf extract in treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and concluded it \"demonstrates clinical efficacy, warranting further investigation as a potential therapy\".
