Now that your cancer treatment has finished you are probably looking forward to moving on and getting back to normal everyday life. Some people feel very anxious about their cancer returning or feel that any ache or pain they get may be related to their cancer. You will feel less like this as time goes by and focusing on things you like doing can help. Also looking at other ways to relax such as meditation or complimentary therapy can be worth exploring even if it's not something you did before you were diagnosed with cancer. Signs and symptoms There are some signs and symptoms of cancer recurrence that you should be aware of such as: - Any bleeding from your bottom or stoma that does not go away and persists for more than 2 weeks. - A change in your bowel pattern that persists for more than 2 weeks. - Any unexplained loss of weight, lack of appetite and/or a constant feeling of nausea - Extreme increasing fatigue or lethargy - Pain in your tummy which is severe, or lasts more than two weeks or is associated with abdominal swelling/vomiting/ not passing stool or wind If you experience any of these signs or symptoms then call the helpline and a nurse will return your call as soon as possible.
