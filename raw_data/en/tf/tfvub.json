Security Information Passing the District of Columbia Juri sprudence Examination is required in order to receive your license to practice as a physical therapist. The D.C. Board of Physical Therapy (the \"Board\") requires ALL applicants for licensure to pass the Jurisprudence Examination in order to demonstrate minimal understanding of the statutes and regulations that govern the practice of physical therapy in the District of Columbia. Requiring a passing score on the Jurisp rudence Examination is one assurance that anyone granted a license to practice physical therapy in D.C. possesses the necessary knowledge to treat patients with skill and safety. Understandably, you will want to take advantage of all available re sources when prep aring for this important examination. While a student, you may have considered fellow students to be good resources for learning about questions that were on examinations . However, according to \u00a76704.9 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) i t is illegal and unethical to recall (memorize) and share questions that are on the examination or to solicit questions that are on the Jurisprudence Examination from other applicants who have taken the exam. What Do You Mean by \"It's Illegal to Recall Questions\"? Each candidate who sits for the Jurisprudence Exam must accept the Security Agreement. The Security Agreement states that the exam an d items contained therein are owned by the D.C. Board of Physical Therapy and the Federation of Stat e Boards of Physical Therapy and protected by Federal Copyright Law. It also informs applicants that no part of the examinat ion may be copied or reproduced in part or whole by any means whatsoever, including memorization. Recalling questions from t he examination and sharing them with anyone else vi olates both the Federal Copyright Law and the FSBPT Security Agreement that applicants must accept bef ore taking the District of Columbia Jurisprudence Examination. ITEMS FROM THE EXAM ARE NOT TO BE RECALLED FOR ANY PURPOSE. Why is it Unethical to Ask Someone Else for Recalled Questions? Soliciting recalled questions from applicants who have previously taken the examination is unethical for several reasons. The primary reason is obvious; you are expected to pass the test based on your own merit without assistance. The members of the public who will entrust you with their well-being expect that you are a trustworthy and competent individual. You are encouraging applicants to commit illegal acts if you are soliciting questions from previous test takers who have accepted the FSBPT Security Agreement. ITEMS FROM THE EXAM ARE NOT TO BE SOLICITED FOR ANY PURPOSE. What Happens If I Do Share or Solicit Recalled Questions? The Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy will continue to actively prosecute individuals who violate the Security Agreement. The Federation will also report any incident s of applicants requesting questions or sharing questions to the D.C. Board of Physical Therapy. Applicants who are prosecuted by the Federatio n or who are reported to the D.C. Board of Physical Therapy for soliciting or sharing quest ions will severely damage their chances of being licensed pursuant to \u00a76704.10 of the DCMR. Protect Your Reputation and Your Career! 4II. The Examination Special Accommodations You must submit appropriate documentation of your request for special accommodations to the D.C. Board of Physical Therapy at the time that you submit your application for licensure. Only those applicants who have been granted approval from the Board will receive special accommodations during testing. For further information about how to request special accommodations, contact the Board liaison at (202) 724-8745, or e-mail at maulid.miskell@dc.gov . Examination Fee, Method of Payment and Registration Applicants must apply and be approved before they can take the Jurisprudence Examination. In order to avoid delays, applicants should register with the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy (FSBPT) for the Jurisprudence Examination at the time of application by Examination or by Endorsement to the D.C.

FSBPT will send you an \"Authorization to Test\" (ATT) letter containing instructions on how to schedule an appointment with Prometric Testing Center. 4. Questions regarding registration processing may be directed to examregistration@fsbpt.org . 5. Schedule an appointment for the examinatio n with Prometric by calling the telephone number listed in your ATT letter or you may schedule on-line at http://www.prometric.com .

Content Overview The Jurisprudence Examination consists of fifty ( 50) multiple-choice questions, 40 of which are scored and 10 that are pre-test questions that are not scored.

The Jurisprudence Examination will cover: District of Columbia Official Code Title 3, Chapter 12 (HORA) \u00a73-1201.01 et seq. Title 17, District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR), Chapter 67. APTA Code of Ethics. These materials are attached as Appendix A, B, and C, respectively.

The purpose of including pre-test questions on the examination is to expand and impr ove the bank of questions from which future examinations will be drawn. This is a common practice used by many national and state examination programs and is a critical step in ensuring the continued reliability and validity of an examination. Pre-test questions are NOT identified so that they will not be skipped by the candidate thereby rendering the results invalid. The development of a valid examination requires accurate candidate response information for the pre-test questions. III. Scoring Information and Notification Passing Grade and Results After the administration of the examination, your examination will be scored by the FSBPT. The results will then be transmitted to the D.C. Board of Physical Therapy. The Board office will notify you of your results in writing, no later than 1 week after receiving your score report. A scaled score of 600 is required in order to pass the examination. Re-Examination Information An applicant who fails to achieve the required passing score on the Jurisprudence Examination shall be required to be re-examined by completing the scheduling of the examination process, as previously outlined on page 4, and submitting the same fees. Test-Taking Advice The advice offered here is presented primarily to help you demonstrate your knowledge and maximize your chances of passing the examination. Read all instructions carefully. Before selecting the correct answer, read all options carefully. You should answer all questions; do not omit an answer for any test question. For best results, pace yourself by periodically checking your progress and the time. This will allow you to make any necessary adjustments. Remember, the more questions you answer, the better your chances of achieving a passing score, so you should select an answer for every question. Alert the examination supervisor of any problems that may occur during the examination. Do not wait until the exami nation is over to inform someone of a problem. Be sure to select an answer for each question, even the questions about which you are not completely sure. You can skip the questions you wish to reconsider and return to them later. 7IV. Admission to the Examination Supplies and What to Bring You must arrive 30 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment with two forms of acceptable identification. Acceptable identification is: 1) A currently valid, military or government -issued photo ID (passport, driver's license, etc.) with pre-printed name and signature. 2) A currently valid, pre-printed identification with your name and your signature such as a credit card or check cashing card. You will have to be checked in before taking the examination (i.e., sign in and present the appropriate identification). Once at the Prometric testing center, you will be thumb-printed and photographed at the center. All testing sessions are videotaped. On both forms of ID your signature must match your pre-printed name. Your first and last name on both forms of ID must exactly match the first and last name on your ATT letter issued by FSBPT. A Social Security card is not an acceptable form of identification. What Not to Bring Unauthorized supplies, including those not listed below, will be subject to removal by the examination supervisor at the examination site. The following items are NOT allowed in an examination room: 1. Purses, briefcases, portfolios, fanny packs or backpacks; 2. Cameras, tape recorders, calculators or computers; 3. Cellular phones, pagers, electronic transmitting devices or telephones; 4. Any bound or loose-leaf reference materials, notes, or books; 5. Dictionary, thesaurus, or other spelling aids; 6.

For security reasons, Prometri c does not allow bulky jackets to be worn. V. Administrative Policies Rules For The Examination 1. No examination materials, documents, or memoranda of any kind are to be taken from an examination room. 2. Computer knowledge is not required to take a computerized examination. Before the examination begins, a simple introductory lesson (tutorial) is presented that explains the process of selecting answers and moving from question to question. The time you spend on the tutorial does not count against the time allotted for the examination. You may select your answers using either the keyboard or the mouse. You are strongly encouraged to take the tutorial prior to taking the examination. 3. You should alert Prometric staff immediately to disruptions occurring within the testing room or computer malfunctions while taking the examination. 84. You are permitted to sign out and leave the room for a break. However, the time remaining on your examination will continue to elapse. This means any time you spend on a break is time that you are electing not to spend on the examination. 5. Do not bring food or drink into an examination room.
