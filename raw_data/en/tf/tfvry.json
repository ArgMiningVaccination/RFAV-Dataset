These chiropractors saw the need for standardization in Acupuncture Training of Chiropractic Physicians. By bringing the leaders and top educators in chiropractic acupuncture together, the CCA was developed to encourage improved inter-professional and intra-profession relations, and sharing of knowledge with all doctors of chiropractic for the benefit of the public and the profession. Today, the CCA is the sole chiropractic-only professional acupuncture society in North America accepting members from a diversity of training backgrounds. The CCA continues to expand its membership rapidly. In addition, the CCA works in conjunction with other acupuncture disciplines and acupuncture organizations with the goal of improving inter-professional communications and providing quality continuing educational opportunities. The CCA was able to develop a standardized curriculum of post-graduate training, and founded the American Board of Chiropractic Acupuncture (ABCA), as its credentialing arm. The American Board of Chiropractic Acupuncture administers a Board Certification program to recognize those physicians who have achieved high levels of training, experience and knowledge in the field of chiropractic acupuncture, and to re-credential those chiropractic physicians to ensure that their training continues to be at the highest levels.
