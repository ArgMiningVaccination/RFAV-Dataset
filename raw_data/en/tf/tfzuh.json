In girls and women, it is also used to prevent cancer of the cervix/vagina/vulva and abnormal tissue growth in these areas that can lead to cancer. These conditions are commonly caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Vaccines work by increasing the body's natural defense (immunity) against the virus.This vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV, only the types in the vaccine. It is used to prevent the diseases and will not treat active anal/cervical/head/neck/vaginal/vulvar cancer, genital warts, or other diseases caused by the types of HPV in the vaccine. HOW TO USE: Read all vaccine information available from your health care professional before receiving the vaccine. If you have any questions, ask your health care professional.This vaccine is given by injection into the muscle of the thigh or upper arm by a health care professional.This vaccine is usually given as 3 separate doses. The second dose should be given 2 months after the first dose, and the third dose should be given 6 months after the first dose. For children younger than 15 years, this vaccine may also be given as 2 separate doses with the second dose given 6 to 12 months after the first dose. The vaccination schedule should be followed closely for the vaccine to be most effective. SIDE EFFECTS: Redness, itching, swelling, bruising, and pain at the injection site may occur. Fever and headache may also occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your health care professional promptly.Rarely, some people have symptoms such as fainting, dizziness, vision changes, or ringing in the ears just after getting a vaccine injection. Seizure-like movements may also rarely happen after injection with this vaccine. Tell your health care professional right away if you have any of these symptoms. Sitting or lying down may help, since these symptoms usually don't last long.Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your health care professional has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects.
