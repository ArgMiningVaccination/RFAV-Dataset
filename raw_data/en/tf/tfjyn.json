Once downloaded, you can easily add the vaccination record to the Wallet app on iPhone. That vaccination record is then automatically added to your Apple Watch (iOS 15.1 and watchOS 8.1 and later; supported by certain healthcare providers and authorities). Present the card when you need to show proof of vaccination. For more information, see [Download verifiable COVID-19 vaccination and test result records on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphc30019594) in the iPhone User Guide. Show a vaccination card On your Apple Watch, double-click the side button, scroll to the vaccination card, tap it, then present the QR code to the reader. You may be asked to verify your identity by showing a photo ID, such as your driver's license. Note: Your vaccination card may contain sensitive information such as your birthdate. To review the information stored on your card, scroll down, then tap Pass Information. Remove a vaccination card Double-click the side button, then tap the vaccination card. Tap Remove. Note: Removing a vaccination card from Apple Watch also removes it from the Wallet app on your iPhone. However, it doesn't remove the corresponding vaccination record from the Health app on iPhone.
