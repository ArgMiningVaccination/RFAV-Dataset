Everything starts with plants and plants have a knowledge that is hard to replicate in pharmaceutical drugs. Plants are ever adapting to the changing environment so they are always one step ahead of our needs. If we were to look at many pharmaceutical drugs, a lot of the formulas started with extracting certain constituents from plants to then combine them with chemicals so companies could patent and market their \"wonder drug\". However, what holistic medicine is showing us is that, we're missing out on some fundamental benefits by not using healing herbs or medicinal herbs as they come with a whole host of healing properties that work together to help us heal. Take for example curcumin extracted from [turmeric, curcumin ](https://www.authenticapets.com/en/blog/turmeric-for-cats-and-dogs)has some amazing healing properties but by only using this extraction of the plant we're missing out on the full healing properties of turmeric.

Foods and herbs treat a broad spectrum of issues in the body and everything that enters your dog or cat's mouth either heals or causes imbalance. The energetics of a plant or herb are based on three main areas. Food therapies work best when you match the energetics of the herb or food, with the energetics of the season, the energetics of your cat or dog and the energetics of any illness, disease or condition that is being treated. You want to chose herbs that balance the energetic of your pet and the illness or condition being treated.

[To read more about your pet's hot or cold energies click here.](https://www.authenticapets.com/en/blog/hot-cold-energies-in-your-dog) For example using ginger or tumeric to treat your pet's inflammation instead of a prescription medicine is a great holistic way of treating your pet but before you start, you need to consider if your cat or dog is more inclined to a cool or hot energy. For example is your dog always seeking out warm places and your cat cool places or vice versa? The individual energetics of your pet will determine how effectively they work with the energetics of the healing herbs. Warm or hot herbs such as [ginger](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/ginger) and turmeric could make you hot energetic dog feel worse and exacerbate the condition or imbalance.

At the heart of herbal medicine is personalising the treatment to the person or animal not the actual disease or illness. Herbs and illnesses have energetics but choose herbs for your individual pet rather than for a particular problem. Be aware and observe how herbs effect your pet. If you match the wrong energetics of the herb to your pet, you'll likely see little to no benefit or unwanted effects.

Herbs are ranked on a safety scale of 1 to 5 depending on their gentleness or potency. So unless you working with your herbalist vet aim to stick with and plant herbs that are level 1 and level 2.

Serving or supplementation will depend on what herb you choose, the ailment and the size of your pet.
