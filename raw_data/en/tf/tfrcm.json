I just wish I had known then what I know now. As a teenager and young adult I suffered with numerous sinus infections. The chosen course of treatment, without any knowledge of the repercussions, was dangerous antibiotic drugs. The drugs would seem to help initially, but the sinus infection would always return more violently. Having a mother who guided me towards chiropractic saved me years more of discomfort and actually helped me to realize that this amazing profession would also be my calling. I saw a chiropractor and he revealed some very interesting information to me. He told me my neck was so misaligned that it was severely damaging my nerve system which in turn drastically weakened my immune system. The chiropractor starting adjusting and I immediately felt relief from the sinus pressure. I was educated that the symptoms would be the first thing to disappear then the spine would gradually start to correct. I followed his recommendations to continue chiropractic beyond symptoms to achieve optimal health and wellness and I am glad I did. I have never had to suffer with any sinus headaches that severe ever again and I am stronger and more fit then I have ever been because of chiropractic. During my years of poor health I was in the Air Force and then became a Physical Therapy Assistant. Four years active duty military and 9 years Air National Guard gave me the discipline I needed to pursue my passion to help humanity. I decided to go to Physical Therapy Assistant school in Harrisburg, Pa because I could live with my parents and it was the quickest way for me to start helping people. I worked in a sports medicine clinic for 4 years and learned many techniques for exercise and rehabilitation but I always had a thirst to know and learn more. I starting researching different health care fields and that is when I met the chiropractor that changed my life. My Chiropractic Education Choosing chiropractic colleges was not difficult because I needed to stay close to home in order to drive back to Pennsylvania for National Guard duty. I attended [New York Chiropractic College](http://www.nycc.edu/) in 2003 but had to take Chemistry prerequisites in order to start the regular curriculum. Chemistry was by far the most difficult course I had ever taken up to that point. I remember crying some days thinking that these courses would possibly hold me back from achieving my dream of becoming a Doctor of Chiropractic. But, I made it through and began my chiropractic studies. [Read more...](javascript:void(0)) Chiropractic college flew by because it was a tremendous amount of work and it was configured into trimesters with just 2 week breaks in between. The first year was a lot of science and physiology with an emphasis on Anatomy. We actually had an entire lab dedicated to cadavers. I still remember the pungent odor of the formaldehyde which preserved the bodies and the smell which absorbed into our scrubs. At the end of the year and a half we spent in the cadaver lab we had a ceremony to burn the scrubs we used. It was a huge relief because it symbolized our next phase of school to learn the science, art and philosophy of chiropractic. My most memorable instructor in school was an older chiropractor from a technique class. He moved so slow but he could analyze, detect, and correct spinal misalignments from practically across the room. I learned many techniques from him but the most valuable piece of information I learned was to trust my heart and instinct when it came to patient care. On a personal note... Going into Chiropractic college I was a bit older then the rest of my classmates. I had been through the dating scene and was tired of the \"game\" of meeting and relationships not working out. I believed I would meet someone wonderful at school with similar passions and a true love to serve humanity through natural drug free health care. I went through 3 years at the main campus in Seneca Falls, NY and was ready to go onto my internship in Buffalo when three weeks before our Christmas break I met someone; her name was Gali. I was in a lab class and she would pass by the room I was in and \"check me out\" with a friend of hers. I would then proceed to find out where she was studying and check her out. Gali says I was stalking her and I claim she was stalking me......that fact is that she was stalking me (that's my story and I am sticking to it). We finally met, went on several dates, and the rest is history. My health and my family's health is the greatest asset that we have. We realize the importance of building your health through proper lifestyle choices. I receive weekly chiropractic adjustments and I check my family's spines multiple times per week. We chose organically grown fruits and vegetables and do not eat or drink dairy and consume a minimal amount of grains. We recognize that we are apart of nature not outside looking in like most have been taught to think. Because of that we know that God put the most amazing healing power within our minds and bodies and that we just have to supply it with genetically raw materials needed. No vaccines, no medications (unless there is an emergency), good thoughts, lots of fresh air, exercise, clean food, clean filtered water, and healthy spines. I consider myself an excellent listener and hope I get the opportunity to meet you in person and discuss your specific health challenge.
