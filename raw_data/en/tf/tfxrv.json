Curriculum Vitae 241Index 309PrefacePreface The late Dr. David B. Larson was a principal figure in the develop - ment of the religion and health field within academic medicine and public health. Along with the two of us, and several others, Dave wasinstrumental in the establishment of the field, its fertile growth andexpansion, and what is coming to be its mainstream acceptance. Butwhile we focused on our own scholarly careers, Dave devoted him - self tirelessly to the work of field building. That the religion and health field is indeed a field is mostly Dave's doing. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to state that the heightened awareness of thehealth effects of religious faith and participation among both clini-cians and the lay public and the institutionalization of coursework onreligion and spirituality within undergraduate and graduate medicaleducation are owed in large part to Dave's vision and efforts. When Dave died on March 5, 2002, at the age of fifty-four, the reli- gion and health field lost its greatest proponent. As founding presi-dent of the International Center for the Integration of Health andSpiritua lity (ICIHS), formerly the National Institute for Healthcare Research, Dave sponsored conferences, symposia, research mono-graphs, medical education funding programs, a speakers'bureau, andmedia outreach that served to raise faith-based issues to a prominentplace in the consciousness of health professionals, biomedical re-searchers, social and behavioral scientists, journalists, and laypeople.The work of Dave and his beltway-based think tank extended consid-erably beyond promoting the role of faith in health and health care.He explored the impact of religious faith and identity on a wide swathof social issues, including criminal behavior, substance abuse, mentalillness, juvenile delinquency, reproductive decisions, marital satis - faction and family functioning, and quality of life. In putting together Faith, Medicine, and Science, we seek to honor the memory of our friend and colleague, and, more important, to doc - ument Dave's sweeping and encyclopedic contributions to science, medicine, and society. This book will serve both as a festschrift forDave and as a permanent record attesting to the powerful role of reli - xxiiigion, spirituality, and faith in God as potential resources for good in the lives of human beings. Many people have generously devoted their time and energies to the production of this book. Festschrift books are not typically best - sellers, and so to keep expenses down this book was created without any budgeted funds. All of the nearly three dozen contributors offeredtheir glowing words about Dave gratis, without any honoraria. SusanLarson's Oskar Pfister Award address and her essay about life withDave are beautiful tributes to her late husband; words cannot expressour gratitude for her generosity in allowing us to include these in thisbook. Likewise, our sincere thanks go to Dave's children, Chad andKristen, whose beautiful eulogies to their father are also included.Tom Smith, Roz Brown, and Mary Milano, Dave's colleagues atICIHS, were of invaluable assistance to us in so many ways, begin-ning when this book was just an idea and continuing through thewriting, editing, and publishing stages. The publisher of Faith, Medicine, and Science, The Haworth Press, graciously went ahead with this project despite a presumablylimited audience. We would like to acknowledge the support and helpof several people at Haworth. First, we owe a debt of gratitude to thepublisher Bill Cohen, who agreed to publish the book and encour-aged us throughout. We also thank Vice President of Publications BillPalmer and his staff, Robert Owen, Amy Rentner, Rebecca Browne,Jillian Mason, Katy Kempf, and Peg Marr, for all of their help in pre-paring the manuscript and getting it into production. This book couldnot have been published without key contributions from each of thesepeople. Their generosity, helpfulness, and patience are deeply appre-ciated. Finally, we, the editors, have paid for our time and work on this project out of pocket, and are donating all royalties to an annual lec - ture fund named in Dave's honor at Duke University Medical Center. Every year forthcoming, the David B. Larson Memorial Lecture inReligion and Health will be given on March 5, the anniversary ofDave's passing, supported by the proceeds from Faith, Medicine, and Science and by the generosity of individual donors. The first Larson Memorial Lecture, \"Religion, Health, and Healing: Controversies,Crossroads, and Cutting-Edges,\" was delivered in 2003 by Jeff Levin,one of the editors of this book. The other editor, Harold Koenig, is incharge of the lecture series, which is sponsored by the Duke Univer -xxiv FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEsity Center for Spirituality, Theology, and Health, for which he serves as director. Both of us owe more to Dave Larson than we could ever fully de - tail. Less than twenty years ago the entire religion and health field was basically the three of us, and sometimes a few others, huddled to - gether in a corner somewhere at various professional meetings. More soon followed, but we always felt a sort of unspoken kinship as theonly three researchers reckless enough to actually devote our entirecareer to this field. Dave's passing is not only a devastating loss tomedicine and science, to his colleagues, and to his fa mily and loved ones, but to us personally, leaving us with a uniquely felt professionalloneliness. That gap is unfilled. More than ever, our resolve is steeled togo forth and honor Dave's commitment by picking up where he left offand redoubling our efforts to spread the message that became the im-plicit byword of his life's work: faith matters. I (Jeff Levin) would like to thank my beloved wife, Lea, for the blessing of her love and support as I took on the challenge of compil-ing this book. Also, I owe a great debt of gratitude to Harold Koenigfor taking time from his incredibly full schedule to work with me onthis project. It might come as a surprise to others in the field, butFaith, Medicine, and Science is the first collaboration of any type that Harold and I have ever published. That this belated venture shouldoccur in a book honoring Dave Larson is only fitting. Finally, I offerthanks and praise to Almighty God for, to paraphrase the sheheche- yanu prayer, giving me life, sustaining me, and enabling me to take part in this special project. I (Harold G. Koenig) would like to thank Jeff Levin for his concept for this book with which he approached me shortly after Dave'sdeath. It is such a privilege to be collaborating with Jeff, who has agift for writing and power of expression that few possess, and is pri - marily responsible for crafting and editing Faith, Medicine, and Sci - ence. I immediately recognized that compiling this book was not only what we ought to do, but what we must do to honor this giant of a man. We both loved David and owe him more than mere words canever express. He single-handedly opened doors that enabled us topursue our dreams. Without Dave, those dreams could not have be -Preface xxvcome a reality. Dave served God by serving others and sometimes sacrificed himself in the process: What greater legacy could anyoneleave? I thank God for Dave and take comfort in knowing that now heis reaping his reward for that life of service.xxvi FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEChapter 1 Faith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work Faith Matters: Reflections on the Life and Work of Dr. David B. Larson Jeff Levin Harold G. Koenig INTRODUCTION Scholarly writing on the interface of religion and health is not a new development. While recent epidemiologic and clinical researchstudies have attracted the attention of scientists, physicians, and thepopular media, discourse on the important connections between reli-gious faith and religious institutions, on the one hand, and medicine,the healing arts, and the promotion of health, on the other, have beenongoing for more than a century. Published work in many fields, in-cluding psychology, pastoral care, psychiatry, and the history of med-icine, has explored the valuable functions served by personal and col-lective expressions of religiousness for the advancement of mental andphysical health and for the establishment of caregiving institutionsand organizations. Historians of medicine, science, and religion have documented in great detail the long-standing interconnections between religious andhealing institutions. Discourse on matters related to human physiol - ogy, health, and medical treatment has always occupied a central place in both canonical and noncanonical writing within respectivefaith traditions, 1and religions and religious organizations were the earliest sponsors of medical care institutions. Within the past two de - cades, several scholarly works have detailed these connections that have existed throughout recorded history between medicine and or - ganized religions, East and West. Macmillan's two-volume Caring 3and Curing2andHealing and Restoring3comprehensively detail this rich heritage of attention to health, healing, and medicine within Ju - daism, nearly twenty denominations of Christianity, and a dozen of the world's other religious traditions. Among Western religions, renewed attention has focused on reli - gion-health and religion-medicine linkages. The Park Ridge Center for Health, Faith, and Ethics sponsored a series of monographs titled,\"Health/Medicine and the Faith Traditions,\" which explored theseconnections within several major Christian denominations and Juda - ism. 4In the Jewish tradition, especially, religious and medical author - ities have written about the indivisibility of religion and medicine for centuries. Maimonides, for example, was a physician as well as a phi-losopher, and his writings on Jewish perspectives on the body, onhealth, and on medicine have been studied by scholars for more than800 years. 5In that time, a library of academic and popular writing on these topics has appeared, ranging from erudite commentaries onhalakhah (or Jewish law) to midrashic commentaries to kabbalistic speculation. Most notable is Preuss' classic Biblical and Talmudic Medicine, 6a 600-page compilation of biblical texts and commentar- ies organized like a medical textbook, which was translated intoEnglish by Rosner and republished in the United States and Europe. Within Christianity, especially American Protestantism, the early to middle twentieth century witnessed the beginning of scholarly dis-cussion of mental health, health care, and healing by prominent fig-ures in the Christian pastoral counseling field. Important booksinclude Hiltner's classic Religion and Health, 7Oates' Religious Factors in Mental Illness,8Wise's Religion in Illness and Health,9Crowle- smith's Religion and Medicine,10and McCann's The Churches and Mental Health,11among many others. This work drew upon, and grew out of, earlier writing at the interface of medicine, psychology,and Christian theology that sought to identify etiologically and thera - peutically significant factors in the religious life of Christians. This writing comprises the beginnings of what has come to be knownin the clinical pastoral field as the \"religion and health movement.\"Notable works in this genre date from Brigham's Observations on the Influence of Religion upon the Health and Physical Welfare of Man - kind, 12in the nineteenth century, to Worcester and colleagues' Reli- gion and Medicine: The Moral Control of Nervous Disorders,134 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEWeatherhead's Psychology, Religion and Healing,14Walsh's Religion and Health,15and Holman's The Religion of a Healthy Mind .16 The latter work, and others in that vein, owe an obvious debt to phi - losopher William James, who contrasted the religion of \"healthy- minded\" and \"sick-minded\" souls in his The Varieties of Religious Experience,17a seminal work in psychology. James was by no means alone among early psychologists and psychiatrists in considering thevalue of religion and personal religiousness for human well-being.Freud, while antipathetic toward religious beliefs, nonetheless recog - nized their salience, for better or worse, for the psychological well-being of individuals. 18Among psychiatrists, Jung19and Fromm20 recognized the potentially salutary role of a religious outlook on lifeand of humanistic (as opposed to authoritarian) religion, respectively.Among psychologists, Allport 21hypothesized that intrinsic religion serves an integrative function and thus benefits mental health, andMaslow 22proposed that transcendent experiences (defined as peaks or plateaus of unitive consciousness) are more common among emo-tionally healthy individuals. Despite the historically well-documented connections between re- ligion and health and religion and medicine, and despite the traditionsof writing on this topic within Judaism, Christianity, and psychologyand psychiatry, as just noted, scholarly momentum waned by the late1950s. This is not to say that nothing of importance was publishedduring that period. Interesting symposia proceedings, 23-24committee reports,25-26histories,27and edited books28and impor- tant such Paul Tillich's classic essay on\"the meaning of health\" 30continued to appear. But absence of a con- certed collective effort to explore, empirically, the interconnections of religion, health, and medicine seemed to mirror the contempor - aneous drought of academic writing in the psychology of religion.31 By contrast, another scientific field, gerontology, since its incep - tion had paid considerable attention to religion and its ability to influ - ence human lives for the good. Gerontology, the study of older adults and of the aging process throughout the life course, is a multidisci - plinary field, and gerontological research typically has an applied or practical life focus. Accordingly, some of the earliest empirical stud - ies in social gerontology, namely the stellar pioneering research of David O. Moberg32in the early 1950s, examined the impact of reli - gion on the general well-being of older adults. Small-scale studies onFaith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work 5this topic continued to appear over the next three decades,33but, as in psychology, systematic investigation was lacking. Throughout this writing in gerontology, psychology, psychiatry, and other fields, once in awhile a published article or book wouldmake reference to an actual empirical study of the putative effects ofreligion on physical or mental health. Such studies, it was presumed,were few and far between, and they were eagerly cited as evidencethat a connection between religion and health might not only exist intheory but be empirically supported by data. A few groups of epidemiologic studies garnered occasional atten - tion through the years, according to a comprehensive review by Levinand Schiller. 34These included investigations of rates of cancer and of colitis and enteritis in Jews, mortality patterns in the clergy, the mor-bidity of Parsis, Protestant-Catholic-Jewish differences in occupa-tional-related morbidity, and the health of Latter Day Saints and Sev- enth-Day Adventists. Earlier epidemiologic reviews, as well, had included discussion of religious exposures as factors in morbidity ormortality, notably Kennaway's \"The Racial and Social Incidence ofCancer of the Uterus,\" 35one of the finest review papers ever pub- lished in epidemiology. Within psychiatry, likewise, a few studies of religious differences in certain disorders had become somewhat well known. An entirechapter of the book reporting on the famous Midtown ManhattanStudy, published in 1962, documented differences in a variety ofprevalence rates among Protestants, Catholics, and Jews by religiousorigin, parental religious-group identification, and parental religios-ity. 36An earlier study, published in the American Journal of Psychia - tryin 1954, identified similar religious-affiliational differences in a variety of psychiatric diagnoses.37Enough of this kind of research and writing had accumulated by 1980 that the National Institute ofMental Health (NIMH) was able to publish Religion and Mental Health: A Bibliography . 38 This type of research among epidemiologists and psychiatrists took its cue from some of the key pioneers of Western biomedicine.Benjamin Travers, an early British surgeon, first noted differences inrates of cancer between Jews and gentiles, 39in 1837. John Shaw Bill - ings, founder of Index Medicus, published one of the earliest epidem - iologic studies of religious affiliation, in 1891.40William Osler, the father of U.S. medical education and instrumental in the establish -6 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEment of the medical school at Johns Hopkins University, offered re - flections on \"the faith that heals,\"41in 1910. The American Medical Association's official journal, JAMA, published an outstanding three- part series of articles on the topic of \"religious healing,\"42in 1926. But, again, as in other fields, systematic empirical exploration of apossible religion-health association appeared to have entered a stateof limbo for the next several decades. Throughout that time, a few thoughtful efforts were made to sum - marize existing findings and/or make sense of their meaning. Begin - ning in the middle 1970s, several prominent scholars and scientists, having encountered bits of this body of research and writing, soughtto interpret and understand just what it was about religion that mightbe health promoting. Some of these reviews and theoretical papersmade vital contributions and continue to be cited to this day. These in-clude Vaux's 43comprehensive effort to identify aspects of religious belief and practice that influence health-related behavior, Vanderpool'sdiscussions of the possible \"therapeutic significance\" of religion 44 and of six major areas of interaction between religion and medicine,45 Kaplan's46conceptual exploration of \"the relevance of heart disease,\" Bergin's47data-based \"critical reevalua- tion\" of the salutary role of for mental health, and Frank's48 revisiting of Osler's \"faith that heals.\" DAVE LARSON, THE PIONEER Aside from this handful of articles and books, there things sat for decades, until the middle 1980s when three scientists almost simulta - neously\u2014and completely independently\u2014began to uncover, review, and write about existing studies of religion and health programmati - cally. One was an epidemiologist, one was a physician, and one was both. These three individuals were the two editors of this book andDave Larson. Contrary to popular presumptions, we discovered, much research had been done. An almost unbelievable amount of research, to beblunt. Despite commonly heard assertions that \"nothing had everbeen done\" in this area, we found quite the opposite. The total in - cluded a couple of hundred epidemiologic studies of religion, as sum - marized in the Levin and Schiller review mentioned previously; an -Faith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work 7other couple hundred studies of religion in psychiatry,49and nearly 300 scholarly publications about religion on topics related to aging,geriatrics, and clinical medicine. 50According to another review of some of these studies that appeared about the same time,51the scope of published research on religion's impact on morbidity and mortalitywas broad, to say the least: studies had been conducted among Prot - estants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Seventh-Day Adventists, Latter Day Saints, Parsis, and Hutterites, among others, and in the generalpopulation. Oddly, epidemiologists and physician researchers, whohad authored most of this work, seemed especially oblivious anddismissive. Our responses to this treasure trove of information were quite dif- ferent. One of us wrote detailed literature reviews, offered method-ological critiques of existing studies, and developed a model ofalternative theoretical explanations for findings, while conducting origi-nal empirical work among ethnic minority populations emphasizingthe use of sophisticated social and epidemiologic research methods.Another of us emphasized the study of clinical populations and geri-atric patients with medical and psychiatric illness, while producingtwo dozen books for clinicians, mental health providers, pastors, andlaypeople, mostly written from a Christian perspective, and also es-tablishing an academic center at Duke University. The third pioneersought no less than to build a field from scratch\u2014a network of clini-cians, educators, and scholars from fields as diverse as medicine,nursing, public health, the social and behavioral sciences, religiousand theological studies, ministry, bioethics, and the humanities\u2014andto facilitate and promote the research and writing of all involved. The first two people mentioned previously are the two of us, Jeff Levin and Harold Koenig; the third is Dave Larson. Although wewould like to fall back on the scientist's conceit that the growth andinstitutionalization of the religion and health field are a direct resultof our early research and of the outstanding studies by those otherswho have since taken up the call, the plain truth is that these effortssimply cannot account for all that has followed. As mentioned in thepreface to this book, the fact that the religion and health field has in - deed become a field is owed mostly to the vision, commitment, and single-minded dedication of Dave Larson. It is a sign of Dave's hu - mility that, more than likely, he would vigorously protest this charac -8 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEterization and would attribute the emergence and growth of this field entirely to others and to God's grace. Dave's curriculum vitae (see Chapter 16) details a remarkable, and strange, career trajectory. Twice in his professional life he radicallychanged course, undeterred, taking a huge leap of faith in order topursue his dreams. First, in the early 1980s, he gave up a successfulacademic career for government service, leaving Duke University toenter the Public Health Service as a commissioned officer and towork in various policymaking and administrative capacities for theDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), including stintsat both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the NIMH. Nearlya decade later, in 1991, he founded the National Institute for Health-care Research (NIHR), and in 1993 he left the government to servefull-time as NIHR's president, remaining there until his passing in2002. Yet despite nearly two decades of only adjunct appointments inacademic medicine, Dave's scholarly output exceeded almost every-one else in the religion and health field. Dave and the two of us have several unusual shared connections. Each of us is part of the extended Duke University family. Dave cameto Duke in 1974, completed his postgraduate work in psychiatry in1977, followed by a postdoctoral research fellowship in 1979 and aclinical geropsychiatry fellowship in 1981, and then joined the fac-ulty, rising to the rank of Adjunct Professor in 1985. Harold Koenigcame to Duke in 1986, where he subsequently trained in geriatrics,biometry, psychiatry, and geropsychiatry, and has been a facultymember since 1992. Jeff Levin came to Duke in 1977 and is an alum-nus of both the religion and sociology departments, class of 1981.Dave and Harold also have the additional connection of both beingpsychiatrists. Dave and Jeff have an additional connection as well:both are graduates of the University of North Carolina School of Pub - lic Health, Dave in 1982 and Jeff in 1983; both were trained in epide - miology; and both benefited from the mentorship of Berton H.Kaplan. Finally, all three of us, as so many others in the religion and health field, became gerontologists. This is all worth mentioning because, despite these many connec - tions, we stumbled into this area of research completely independ - ently and without even knowing one another. Our work at Duke, for example, did not overlap and we only first met through professionalcircles. We have often speculated that perhaps something was in theFaith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work 9air at the time, in the middle 1980s, as several other researchers be - sides us also began systematically to study religion and health. While the three of us each had been publishing scholarly papers on religionand/or health in peer-reviewed journals for several years, our firstwidely read articles on religion and health appeared almost simulta - neously. Dave's famous literature review of religious research in psy - chiatry was published in 1986; 52Jeff's much-cited literature reviews of epidemiologic studies of religion were published in 198753; and Harold's well-regarded first three research papers on religion and ag - ing were published in 1988.54-56 Around the same time, Robert Jo - seph Taylor and Linda M. Chatters published the first of their collab - orations in this field in 1986,57Ellen L. Idler published her first key paper on this topic in 1987,58Christopher G. Ellison59(also a Duke graduate, incidentally) made his first important contribution in thisarea in 1989, and David R. Williams 60published one of the first lon- gitudinal epidemiological analyses of religion, co-authored with DaveLarson, in 1991. These papers had overlapping themes and content,were gerontological in focus, and were written by investigators whohad come to work in this field independently of one another. For each of these scholars, the objective was that of the typical aca- demic scientist: to further the field through advancing our own indi-vidual research efforts. Dave's objective, on the other hand, was tofurther the field by advancing the individual research efforts not ofhimself but of all of the rest of us, and of the countless others who fol-lowed. He became the tireless captain of a team of beleaguered soci-ologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, gerontologists, and physi-cians who shared not much else but a desire to do scholarly work,sometimes in collaboration and sometimes alone, in an area that mosteveryone else in academic medicine, public health, and the medical,social, and behavioral sciences, it seemed, derided or ignored. Davein fact had a great sense of humor about this. In published writings, hemore than once referred to this overt antipathy as a \"taboo,\" 61-62one in which religion had become the unspoken \" Rword\"63and, for aca - demicians, something akin to an \"anti-tenure factor.\"64 A short decade and a half later, a thriving field is in place. Empiri - cal research on religion and health, if not yet fully accepted as main - stream in all disciplines, is fast becoming an accepted topic of investi - gation in several large fields of study. If peer-reviewed publications and funded research studies are good indications, these fields include10 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEgerontology and geriatrics, medical sociology, health psychology, public health, family medicine, and psychiatry. According to theHandbook of Religion and Health, 65which Dave co-authored, by the year 2000 more than 1,600 scholarly publications had addressed therole of religion in health, mental health, general well-being, or qualityof life, including at least 1,200 empirical studies. Besides the names already mentioned, other prominent figures have devoted considerable time and effort to researching the connec - tions between religion and health. These include Neal Krause, Diane R. Brown, Kenneth F. Ferraro, William J. Strawbridge, Kenneth I.Pargament, Linda K. George (a Duke graduate and professor), andMargaret M. Poloma. A second generation of scholars has emerged, aswell, led by Michael E. McCullough, Marc A. Musick (a Duke gradu-ate), and Amy L. Ai. Furthermore, especially within gerontology,dozens of other researchers with principal research foci elsewherehave nonetheless made important contributions to furthering thestudy of religion and health. This includes senior figures such as Da-vid O. Moberg, whose contributions to the field began in the 1950s;Dan G. Blazer and Erdman B. Palmore (both Duke professors), whostarted writing on the topic in the 1970s; Kyriakos S. Markides, whoinitiated a series of studies conducted both alone and in conjunctionwith Jeff Levin in the early 1980s; and George W. Comstock, dean ofAmerican epidemiologists, whose consideration of religious vari-ables in his studies dates back decades. Also deserving of mention, inno particular order, are Stephen C. Ainlay, Andrew Futterman, DanaE. King, Keith G. Meador (a Duke graduate and professor), Byron R.Johnson, Herbert Benson, Harold Y . Vanderpool, George Fitchett, Dale A. Matthews (a Duke graduate), Stephen G. Post, Lawrence E. Gary,Preston L. Schiller, Andrew J. Weaver, Kimberly A. Sherrill (a Dukegraduate), Gail Ironson, Peter H. Van Ness, Anthony Walsh, ChristinaM. Puchalski, Stanislav V . Kasl, Peter C. Hill, Elisabeth McSherry,and Harvey Jay Cohen (a Duke professor), each of whom has contrib - uted significantly to the advancement of the field. Perhaps an under - appreciated common element of so many important scholars in this field is a connection to Duke University! Many of these named individuals now have endowed chairs or are department chairpersons, center directors, or deans. Most are tenuredfull professors. Thanks to Dave's tireless efforts to use NIHR to raisethe profile of scientific research on religion and health and to foster itsFaith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work 11legitimization, taking time to conduct studies and publish in this area is no longer considered career suicide or a ticket to the academicfringes. Thanks also to his generally unrecognized efforts at DHHSbeginning in the mid-1980s, the NIH and the private-foundation sec - tor have come to acknowledge religion and health as a worthy topic for research funding and have supported the studies of many of thefield's leading investigators. By virtue of Dave's work both behindthe scenes and in the public eye, the once \"anti-tenure factor\" hasbeen transformed more or less into a pro-tenure factor. DAVE LARSON, THE PERSON What kind of a man would put his own scholarly career off to the side in order to facilitate the work of others? This is a question thatthose of us who knew and loved Dave Larson have often reflectedupon, with a mix of curiosity and gratitude. Perhaps the best explana-tion is that Dave was magnificently blessed with a sense of selfless-ness, lack of ego, and nonattachment to worldly gain more befitting aBuddhist monk or a Mother Teresa than the caricature of an academicmedical scientist. He was completely committed to his life's work, his eye on the ultimate goal of transforming and respiritualizing the heal-ing arts and sciences, and was able to maintain the long view in theface of ongoing highs and lows far better than anyone else in the field.As a result, he truly did care less about whether his name was at-tached to key advances than that such advances occurred. He washappy to deflect the credit to others, even where he himself deservedthe lion's share. How and why does a man choose to live his life this way? Perhaps the most important motivating factor for Dave was one that he wasuncomfortable addressing in secular professional settings, althoughall of his colleagues were well aware of its salient presence in his life.Indeed, if Dave were still alive, he might wish we turned our attentionelsewhere. He was always sensitive that he, and by extension everyone of us working in the religion and health field, be seen as scientistsfirst and foremost whose scholarly work could not be undermined orimpugned by accusations of bias or speculations about our motives.Dave, we suspect, worried much more about this than any of the restof us in the field. After nearly twenty years of dealing with naysayers,most of us by now have developed pretty thick skin.12 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCESince Dave is no longer here among us in body, we will respect - fully blow his cover. The secret to understanding Dave's profound dedication, commitment, and selflessness can be found in the wordsof his friend, Reverend Andrew J. Weaver, in his tribute to Dave in - cluded among the remembrances contained in Chapter 2 of this book: \"Dave Larson was a Christian. He was not ashamed of the scandal ofthe Gospel. His piety was genuine and heartfelt. He had a desire forGOD.\" In terms familiar to evangelicals, Dave was \"sold out\" to Christ. His faith in God was unwavering and all-encompassing. For his col - leagues in the religion and health field, whose own faith commit - ments span myriad religious traditions and affiliations (including\"none of the above\"), Dave's love of God and devotion to being His faithful servant were never anything but an inspiration. For those ofus committed to following Bible-based Judeo-Christian paths, Davewas a true role model of how to be both a scientist and a person offaith without ever sacrificing or compromising either identity. Hissuccess at this difficult balancing act is a lasting testament to hisstrength of character and great integrity as a person. So, our apologies to Dave and to his wife, Susan, who has so care- fully guarded his scholarly reputation. But without speaking of hisChristian walk, the Dave Larson story would be terribly incomplete. Elsewhere among the remembrances in Chapter 2 are other clues to what made Dave tick. The many words and phrases used to de-scribe Dave paint a picture of a complex and exceedingly good per- son. Friends and colleagues spoke of his of discernment,\" and ine, engaging, humorous, person,\" \"eccentric, transparent, kind, insightful, of all, \"inimitable, irreplaceable, unstoppable.\" Dave Larson wanted little more than to be of service to his fellow scientists and clinicians in their quest to integrate faith and spiritual - ity into their work. In so doing, he hoped, the culture of medicine and of medical science could begin to experience a transformation and re-newal. Because of his constant efforts, and his selflessness, many ofus have been able to experience professional success and even a littlebit of celebrity while helping to fulfill Dave's dream. For those of usprivileged to be carrying on in his place, his legacy of kindness andsacrifice are ever-present reminders of the moral standard that he setfor scholars in the field that he helped to found. DAVE LARSON, THE SCIENTIST For someone who placed his own academic advancement beneath service to others, Dave actually was a very productive researcher. Hismost visible place in the scientific world was as a valued co-author toso many of us in the religion and health field. Dave gained a sterlingreputation as a \"manuscript doctor\" without equal. Colleagues withan unpublishable scholarly manuscript on religion or any other con-troversial topic knew that they could send their paper to Dave, whowould then work his magic and, in exchange for a co-authorship or anacknowledgment, produce a surefire gem. The two of us can person - ally attest to Dave's remarkable ability to see the good in an otherwise hopeless manuscript and bring it to the fore, resulting in a peer-reviewed journal article. We each benefited from Dave's magic. This reputation actually disguises and undervalues Dave's own original work, which was impeccable, historically significant, andvery influential. This, the reader will see, is a consistent theme of thisbook, underscored especially by the selection of many of his classiclead-authored papers included in Part II. Beginning with a series ofpapers written with William P. Wilson and published in the Southern14 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEMedical Journal starting in 1980,66-69Dave embarked on a program of research and writing focused squarely on elucidating the role of re - ligion, broadly defined, in preventing and treating psychiatric illness and in promoting mental health. Eventually, this body of work wasextended to include physical as well as mental health, and also a vari - ety of social and quality-of-life indicators impacted by religion. For more than twenty years, Dave was a nonstop source of theoretical es - says, scholarly reviews, and empirical studies arguing for a complete overthrow of the long-held belief that religion was on the whole a ma - lign influence on human life\u2014a tacit belief so characteristic of both psychiatry and the sorts of \"opinion leaders\" valued by the popularculture and by official Washington. Dave's work and its lasting influ-ence led to national recognition with his receiving the American Psy-chiatric Association's prestigious Oskar Pfister Award in 2002 (seeChapter 4). The first of Dave's scholarly articles reprinted in Faith, Medicine, and Science is his \"Religious Life of Alcoholics\" (see Chapter 5), one of several studies conducted with his mentor William P. Wilson.Together, this series of papers examined the impact of religiousteachings, beliefs, practices, and experiences on psychiatric patientsdiagnosed with alcoholism, narcotic addiction, schizophrenia, and af-fective disorders. The paper on alcoholism, published in the Southern Medical Journal in 1980, identified considerable religious differ- ences between alcoholics and nonalcoholics, especially developmen- tally. Although the fam ilies of alcoholics mostly attended conservative Christian churches, Dave and Dr. Wilson suggested that a failure of al-coholics and their families to practice what they preached, so tospeak, created a discordance or dissonance that contributed to theirgreater risk of alcoholism. The next paper included in this book is the classic systematic re - view that established Dave as the world's leading authority on the scope of published research on religion and mental health. Titled,\"Systematic Analysis of Research on Religious Variables in FourMajor Psychiatric Journals, 1978-1982\" (see Chapter 6), and pub - lished in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1986, this review was based on earlier presentations at the annual meetings of the SouthernPsychiatric Association and the American Psychiatric Association.Co-authored with colleagues at Duke, North Carolina, the MedicalCollege of Georgia, and the NIMH, this article summarized the useFaith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work 15and misuse of religious measures in the 2.5 percent of studies con - taining a religious measure out of 2,348 empirical studies published in four major psychiatry journals. The verdict: psychiatric researchwas not paying much attention to religion, and, when it did, it wasdoing a generally lousy job. This article set the stage for a series of reviews published over the next several years. Each examined a different aspect of the researchliterature on religion and mental health, and each was published in atop-tier psychiatry journal. \"Religious Affiliations in Mental HealthResearch Samples As Compared with National Samples\" 70(see Chap - ter 7) and \"Associations Between Dimensions of Religious Commit - ment and Mental Health Reported in the American Journal of Psychi- atryandArchives of General Psychiatry : 1978-1989\"71(see Chapter 8) were two of the most influential of these reviews. The first article,published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease in 1989, pointed out that study samples used in psychiatric research on reli-gion were typically unrepresentative of the general population. Thesecond article, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1992 and an extension of his 1986 paper in the same journal, exam-ined the results of three dozen studies that included measures of reli-gious commitment. In all, 72 percent of the analyses presented inthese studies pointed to a positive relationship between religion andmental health, contrary to the historic presumptions of many famouspsychiatrists. Dave's interest in connections between religion and mental health included involvement in effecting policy-level changes within thepsychiatric profession. He was one of many figures instrumental inshepherding the process that resulted in changes to how the Diagnos- tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) dealt with reli - gion, culminating in a \"religious or spiritual problems\" category in the DSM-IV. \"Religious Content the DSM-III-R Glossary of Tech - nical Terms\" 72(see Chapter 9), published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1993, identified blatant examples of insensitivity in how the DSM-III characterized religion. More often than not, whenreligion was broached in case examples and clinical reminders, reli - gious patients were characterized as psychotic, delusional, incoher - ent, illogical, and hallucinating, as well as in other ways that indi - cated psychopathology. This influential article was one of the final nails in the coffin that preceded changes to the DSM.16 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEDave was especially interested in fostering linkages between reli - gious and mental health professionals. He saw this as a means to many ends, notably improving access to and delivery of mental healthservices. His classic study, \"The Couch and the Cloth: The Need forLinkage\" 73(see Chapter 10), published in Hospital and Community Psychiatry in 1988, used data from all five sites of the first wave of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study to investigate differencesin the lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders by whether respon - dents sought care from mental health specialists only, clergy only, both, or neither. Dave and his colleagues found important differencesand similarities in patterns of care-seeking depending upon diagnos - tic category, using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. For example, individuals with major life-altering affective or anxiety disorderswere more likely to seek care from both mental health specialists andclergy; those with cognitive, abnormal bipolar, schizophreniform, orsomatization disorders were more likely to seek care from neither.These and the other results from this study underscored the need forformal linkages between mental health professionals and clergy. Dave's research as a graduate student in epidemiology at North Carolina was concerned with how religious practices and perceptionsof religion affected blood pressure. The major empirical results of hisstudy were presented in an article titled, \"The Impact of Religion onMen's Blood Pressure\" 74(see Chapter 11), published in the Journal of Religion and Health in 1989. This study's findings remain just as fascinating today as when they first appeared. Dave and his col-leagues found that respondents who considered religion somewhat ornot at all important had an average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of87.2 mmHg; those who rated religion as very important to them hadan average DBP of 84.0 mmHg. Furthermore, those who rated theirreligion as unimportant and infrequently attended church had the highest average DBP: 88.2 mmHg; those who considered religion tobe important andwere regular churchgoers had the lowest average DBP: 83.8 mmHg. This article has proved to be a classic in the epide - miology of religion, and has helped to inspire subsequent research on religion and chronic disease morbidity. Throughout his career, Dave applied his systematic review meth - odology to a variety of substantive topics besides psychiatric morbid - ity. As lead- or co-author, these reviews constituted a large share of his published scholarly output throughout the final decade and a halfFaith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work 17of his life. He reviewed the role and consequences of religion, broadly defined, for scientific and policy-related topics in fields as di - verse as pastoral counseling, gerontology, criminology, child devel - opment, psychology, health services research, medical education, and primary care. Specific reviews focused on outcomes rangingfrom juvenile delinquency to television content to the impact of abor - tion. Scanning Dave's curriculum vitae (see Chapter 16) shows how far afield his commitment to understanding the effects of religiousfaith took him from psychiatry, the medical specialty in which he wasformally trained. Two of the best of these reviews are characteristic of the detail and insight that can be found throughout this work, as well as of thebreadth of topics that Dave chose to investigate. \"A Systematic Re-view of Nursing Home Research in Three Psychiatric Journals: 1966-1985\" 75(see Chapter 12), published in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry in 1989, is typical of Dave's best work: a thor- ough, sophisticated, and damning critique of sampling, design, andanalytical shortcomings of published studies. This review was uniquefor Dave in that it did not focus on religion, but instead was a precisemethodological critique coupled with some sharp policy-related rec-ommendations. \"Mortality and Religion/Spirituality: A Brief Reviewof the Research\" 76(see Chapter 13), published in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy in 2002, summarized the epidemiological litera- ture suggestive of a protective effect of religion for longevity. Writtenwith his wife, Susan, and with the co-editor of this book, HaroldKoenig, the article was an \"old-style\" literature review, containing anarrative summary of key studies, existing systematic reviews, andmeta-analysis results, along with careful consideration of what thesefindings imply for scientific medicine. The final article of Dave's that is republished in Faith, Medicine, and Science exemplifies another of his many talents: writing for pop - ular audiences. Throughout his career, especially since founding NIHR, Dave consistently published interesting, provocative, and en - tertaining summaries of religious research in both professional and lay periodicals. \"Have Faith: Religion Can Heal Mental Ills\" 77(see Chapter 14), published in the newsstand magazine Insight in 1995, was part of a \"point-counterpoint\"-style debate with the notoriousskeptic, Albert Ellis. In his article, 78Ellis railed against the idea of a salutary effect of religion, yet demonstrated little familiarity with any18 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEresearch on the topic of religion and mental health more recent than a paper of his from 1948. Dave's response was cogent and to the point: What is perhaps most surprising about these negative opinions of religion's effect on mental health is the startling absence ofempirical evidence to support these views. Indeed, the same sci - entists who were trained to accept or reject a hypothesis based on hard data seem to rely solely on their own opinions and bi - ases when assessing the effect of religion on health. (p. 20) Dave Larson was a pioneering figure in medicine. He was also a wonderful friend and colleague, and facilitator of the research and ca-reer progress of others. But Dave's contributions to science extendedfar beyond his contributions to the work of others. It is our hope thathis valued gifts of service to others neither obscure what an excellentand important scientist he was nor focus attention away from the un-matched contribution of his own research, a body of work that wascentral to the establishment of the religion and health field. DAVE LARSON'S LEGACY Dave Larson was richly blessed. Strengthened and empowered by a loving family, by devoted friends and colleagues, and by his faith inGod, he devoted his life to healing the wounds left behind by the cen-turies-old divorce of the medical arts and the human spirit. Multiplycredentialed as a physician, epidemiologist, psychotherapist, uni-formed officer in the U.S. Public Health Service, and federal policy-maker, Dave used each of his talents in tandem to help fashion a newscientific field. Through his efforts, alone and in conjunction with thecolleagues he gathered around himself, Dave truly left his mark onthe world. Dave's contributions to medical and health-related research have already been documented in this chapter. Part II of Faith, Medicine, and Science contains, in full, the text of all of the important articles and studies synopsized in the last section. These ten papers are just adrop in the bucket\u2014about one-thirtieth of his total published output.They are, however, among his most important scholarly publications,and they accurately represent the contributions for which he is bestknown. Even in death, this scientific juggernaut continues: accordingFaith Matters: Reflections on Larson's Life and Work 19to the most recent list of his publications that we consulted in prepar - ing the version of his curriculum vitae that appears in this book (see Chapter 16), another sixteen scholarly manuscripts have been com - pleted and several of these are currently under peer review at aca - demic journals. Dave was also instrumental in changing how medicine and psychi - atry are practiced. He was avidly sought as a speaker at medical and psychiatry grand rounds, as well as at spirituality and medicine con - ferences throughout North America. He loved to speak and was a masterful teacher who mixed humor and research facts in a remark - able manner. For years he served as a key faculty member and speaker for Harvard Medical School's \"Spirituality and Medicine\" continu-ing medical education program. He also developed and directed formany years a speaker's bureau at NIHR, which provided other speak-ers for religion, spirituality, and medicine conferences. In 1997, heaccepted Jeff Levin's invitatino to co-author the first invited essayon the topic of religion and spirituality in medicine to appear inJAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) in over seventy years. 79 Finally, Dave's efforts to effect change in the education of young medical students and residents in training may come to represent hismost lasting contribution. In 1992, only three medical schools hadcoursework or instruction related to religion or spirituality. Then, in1994, Dave obtained a grant from the John Templeton Foundation tostart a curricular awards program that gave out $25,000 grants tomedical schools in order to fund undergraduate medical courses de - voted to the interface of religion, spirituality, and medicine. He put Dale A. Matthews in charge of running this program, which gave outits first awards in 1995. 80Today, nearly two-thirds of the 125 medical schools in the United States have such coursework, and this is almostentirely due to the results of this innovative program and to the con - nections that Dave established within the Association of American Medical Colleges. 81In addition, Dave developed training curricula for residents in psychiatry and primary care, which have been used asguidelines in many residency programs throughout the country, andstarted two additional curricular awards programs for the same con - stituencies. 82All of the curricular awards programs that Dave initi - ated continue to the present day, now housed at the George Washington20 FAITH, MEDICINE, AND SCIENCEInstitute for Spirituality and Health under the direction of Christina M. Puchalski. The last time that the principal editor of this book, Jeff Levin, spoke with Dave was during a radio panel interview conducted as partof the book tour for Jeff's God, Faith, and Health, 83in the summer of 2001. The name of the radio program, was \"Faith Matters.\" This verymuch could have been Dave's motto: faith matters. It matters for ourhealth and well-being and it matters for life in general; it matters forall of us individually and for our families and it matters for society asa whole. Faith mattered to Dave Larson, and, because of this, he wasdriven to live a life of service, committed to sharing the importance offaith in God to all who would listen. Unlike evangelists, who counttheir harvest in souls reaped, Dave was a scientist. For him, victorywas measured not in souls won or lives transformed, but in mindschanged. When Dave began researching and writing about the role of reli- gious faith in mental and physical health, few people in academicmedicine professed to believe that the two things were at all related.Now, two decades later, as a result of his life's work, the \"religion-health connection\" 84is close to tacit knowledge among identifiable segments of the medical world. More minds have been changed, andcuriosities awakened, than any of us who labored alongside Davecould have ever imagined would be possible. In the words of Christ'sparable recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, \"Well done, good andfaithful servant.\" 85 NOTES 1. Spector RE. (1996). Healing: Magicoreligious traditions.
