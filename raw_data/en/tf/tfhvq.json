For non-HR information, please see the Medical Center COVID-19 websites. AUGUST 4 UPDATE: Following the end of the Public Health Emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic, new guidance has been issued to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to no longer require the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers certified by that governing body. As a result, and to align with CMS's new guidance, UVA Health has ended its COVID-19 vaccination requirement, effective August 4, 2023. This policy change is effective for all UVA Health team members, inclusive of the Medical Center, UPG, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, Claude Moore Health System Library, UVA Community Health, and UVA Community Health Medical Group. Although UVA Health no longer requires the COVID-19 vaccine among its team members, it will continue to recommend that all eligible individuals receive both a primary COVID-19 vaccination and recommended boosters, as the COVID-19 vaccine has proven itself to be the safest and most effective tool to prevent severe illness caused by the virus. COVID-19 vaccinations are available through one's primary care physician or at local pharmacies, including within UVA Health. Although not required, team members are encouraged to submit their vaccination records with Employee Health. UVA Health no longer requires an exemption process for not receiving the vaccine. Team members, including those who do not get the COVID vaccine, must wear protective equipment consistent with UVA Health PPE policies. For more information on this policy change, and to answer some common questions, please reference the UVA Health summary article and FAQs on [Connect](https://uvaconnect.com/new-guidance-for-covid-19-vaccine/). Booster Guidelines: All team members are strongly encouraged, but not required, to receive a booster dose of vaccine six (6) months after completing primary vaccination with Pfizer or Moderna vaccine OR two months after receiving J&J vaccination dose and such other booster or additional doses as may be recommended by the CDC. Submitting Vaccination Documentation: Although not required, team members are encouraged to submit their vaccination records with Employee Health. Proof of vaccination shall consist of a scanned image or photo of a team member's immunization records, such as a CDC card or official medical record, submitted with UVA computing "}
