What you can experience during a cacao ceremony: We gather in a circle after blessing the Cacao from Ecuador which has been sourced with pure intentions. We will set intentions individually and as a group to unify our energy. As we hold our Cacao, you'll be guided in meditation to engage your senses with Earth medicine. We will mindfully sip our Cacao as we silently share divine energy. A Spirit message card will follow, and we will create a connection with the cards we choose for our Earth mother. Diving deep into transformation. Afterwards you will immerse yourself and enjoy a soothing Sound Bath from Yolanda Lozano. With the Christmas fast approaching, let's open our hearts to receive and give blessings and fill our hearts with gratitude toward Mother earth, ourselves, and others. This is an experience like no others. We hope you can join us for a deep mindful connection of the heart.
