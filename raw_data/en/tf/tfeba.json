It works well over Zoom, Skype, FaceTime or over the phone. Energy Healing with Hands or Orbs:Energy Healing works hands on, from a few inches away from the body, from the other side of the room, or from the other side of the Country, or the world. As a Shamanic Energy Healer and Reiki Master I use the Energy that comes from Mother Earth and the Universe. We all have an innate ability to heal. We just need focused intent and belief in ourselves. I create Energy Orbs that can calm and heal your nervous system, your organs, and your emotions. During the ceremonies you will also learn to heal yourself. How Energy Healing Works? - Distance Healing works on the principle that everything is connected. Everything is made of energy, including you and your Facilitator. - Remote ceremonies can be performed from anywhere in the world and do not require physical contact. - Non-invasive Distance Healing ceremonies do not require any physical manipulation of the body. Healing works through visualization, or meditation. - These ceremonies utilize energy, which transcends physical boundaries. We use intention, and focused attention to create a healing experience that transcends time and space. You already know Energy can be transmitted across any distance, you use your cell phone to send photos and print on a printer across town. - Focused intention is used to direct healing energy toward you. Your body innately knows what to do with Healing Energy, it will take what it needs. Nothing is forced upon you. - Distance Healing ceremonies offer a unique and powerful approach to healing. Energy Healing just might be a perfect fit, if you are seeking a holistic and non-invasive way to promote Physical, Emotional, Mental and Spiritual well-being. Benefits of a Energy Healing Ceremony? - Physical Healing: Ancient Ceremonies help alleviate physical ailments by addressing the root cause of the issue, going back years or decades to heal without reliving the event.

[Read More](#) Ana Doria-Quesada, HeARTist U.S.A This testimonial is especially fun to do because a couple of years ago I would not have put much faith in the kind of shamanic guidance Brenda Johnston provides. I am a concrete person, who wants proof before trying anything new. But I'm not the same person I was then and am I glad for that! I have decided to try new things without judgement or expectation. Brenda guided me through an amazing visualization that brought me imagery in the form of gifts that are still giving. The biggest result so far has been the completion of a design that turned into an amazing painting. This painting, as many I've done before, is a record of my evolution and harnessing of my higher self's purpose. The development and execution of this painting has congealed a path for me that makes sense, feels aligned, and may sustain me for years to come. I highly recommend Brenda's services.

[Read More](#) Dr. L. Botter I have been suffering from different ailments from edema to mild depression over the last two years. In late March I had a health scare that forced me to prioritize items in my life and I realized my holistic health was suffering. I reached out to Brenda Johnston ( [TorontoShaman.com](mailto:torontoshaman@gmail.com)). Brenda took her time to get to know me, to understand what issues I was managing and then helped put a plan together to clear blockages, to relieve stress and tension, and to make me feel that I could achieve the lifestyle I desire. She helped me understand medicine wheels and how they work. She helped me balance my chakras and strengthen my aura. She created a Sacred Space to enhance my sleeping. We worked on cutting the cords that inhibited growth and spiritual wellbeing. We completed a ceremony called \"The Gathering\", which helped me build my confidence as well as recognize my own strengths. I am now holding less stress and tension in my neck, there is no joint pain, and the swelling caused by the edema is slowly decreasing. All of our meetings have been done via Zoom in the privacy of my home. We will meet every two to four weeks and each time we meet I learn more about myself and how to enhance my lifestyle in general. The holistic wellness approach that Brenda uses is very comfortable, and she works at my pace. She is fair, ethical, and honourable. I am thrilled that Brenda is part of my health team and I highly recommend Brenda's services. She always makes you feel that you are her only client. She will send you meditations, and other items of interest to help you achieve your wellness goals. She is an amazing human being. Since I started working with Brenda, I have experienced positive changes in my life and look forward to a long-lasting professional relationship with Brenda because I trust her and know she has my best interests at heart.
