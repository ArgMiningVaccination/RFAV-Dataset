IUHPFL requests full disclosure from students and their guardians on this form. Living overseas requires adjustments to different climates, diets, levels of physical exertion, and living environment - all of which can cause stress and exacerbate preexisting conditions. Information regarding the student's health is invaluable to the onsite staff in anticipating and dealing with any problems that might arise during the student's stay abroad, particularly in case of an emergency. We thank you for taking the time to fill out this form as thoroughly as possible. The information provided on this document will be shared with the IUHPFL instructor team, onsite coordinator, and the student's host family on a needtoknow basis. Please email us at iuhpfl@iu.edu or call 812.856.2123 with any questions.
