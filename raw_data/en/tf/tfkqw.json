Before 15th century, matcha tea had a very bitter taste and it was really considered more of a medicine than a drink to be savoured or enjoyed. Then, during 15th and 16th centuries, tea growers in japan discovered that if the tea plants were kept in the shade for 3-4 weeks before being picked in the spring harvest, the flavor of the tea softened and became less bitter. Reducing the amount of sunlight the leaves are exposed to increases the natural amino acid and chlorophyll content in the leaves.
