In treatment, it is used as a process that allows emotions, thoughts, and bodily sensations to be experienced with acceptance and without judgment. It encourages the practice of being present and working through even very difficult thoughts or emotions. Practicing breathing exercises, emotional care and awareness as well as the support of a clinician, Mindfulness becomes an avenue to experience emotions, thoughts and bodily sensations without being overcome by them. Mindfulness Meditation is the practice of utilizing the mindfulness skills that are used daily but in meditative moments, allowing the quiet reflection of one's thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. In this practice, calming the mind and body allows for one to pay close attention to the moment that they're in without judgment. Why use Mindfulness and Mindful Meditation in Ketamine treatment? Both Mindfulness and Mindfulness Meditation help to rewire the brain. These practices provide clients with an opportunity to experience flexibility of their thoughts and provide an increase in positive emotions. Before, During and After Ketamine Treatment Before a treatment, clients learn and practice mindfulness and mindful meditation so that the client learns to sit quietly with thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations as a baseline of understanding their own personal emotions, thoughts, and sensations. During treatments the same strategies are utilized to encourage clients to review, acknowledge changes and become fully aware of the potential for change. In doing this through mindfulness and mindfulness meditation, the door is opened to increased dialogue about those changes and how to use them in developing long term goals and treatment outcomes so that once Ketamine treatments are complete, the therapist and client will utilize these for more positive treatment outcomes. Knowing your options Understanding the options for psychotherapy treatment is an important part of the process of making long term goals and meeting those effectively.
