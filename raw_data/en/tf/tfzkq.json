Introduction Colorectalcancer(CRC)isoneofthemostcommoncancers and a major cause of death due to cancer worldwide. Thefunctionalstateofthehostimmunesystemhasamajorprog-nostic and predictive impact on the fate of cancer patientstreatedwithconventionalortargetedchemotherapies[ 1]. Accordingtotheimmunoeditingtheory[ 2],cancercells and immune cells reciprocally modulate each other and thetwo possible outcomes are either the elimination or escapeof tumour cells. NK cells are considered to represent a first line of defence against the metastatic spread of tumour cells . Thisideaissupportedbythereportofanassociationbetweenthedecreased activity or low numbers of circulating NK cells with progression of cancers and correlation betweenan absolute decrease in the activity of the NK cells and anabsolute decrease in the lytic potential of these cells [ 3]. As effector members of the innate immunity, NK cells play amajorroleinanti-infectionactivityandtumoursurveillance.NKcellscandirectlykilltargetcellstowhichtheyarecapableof adhering within 1 to 4 hours without prior activation,primingorassistancebycytokines.NKcellshavebeenrecog-nizedasmajorproducersofcytokinesinmanyphysiologicaland pathological conditions, such as interferon (IFN), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), as well as growth factors such as granulocyte macrophage Hindawi Publishing Corporation Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2014, Article ID 217397, 9 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/217397 CORE Metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk secreteseveral chemokines, which are vital for their colocalizationwithotherhematopoieticcellssuchasdendriticcells(DC)inareasofinflammation. Recent studies [ 4] provide the notion that tumour- inducedalterationsofactivatingNKcellreceptorexpressionmayhamperimmunesurveillanceandpromotetumourpro-gressionandrevealthatNKcellactivityisreducedinpatientswith metastatic CRC, pointing out to NK cells as a first lineofdefenceagainstmetastasis. According to psychoneuroimmunology theory, psycho- logical and emotional stress induces several alterations indiverse biological responses. The activation of the hypo- thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) may generate a change in the immune cell traffics and promotes inflammation via multiple neu-roendocrine and immune pathways. Higher stress levelswere associated with poorer immune responses (low NK cell activity) and the stress reduction with improvement of immuneresponses,inwomenwithbreastcancer[ 5]. Humoraland,especially,cellularimmunefunctionshave been reported as being boosted by acupuncture and moxi-bustionincancerpatientswithsignificantincreasesinseveralTlymphocytesubsets.Immunesystemmodulationhasbeen noted also for various other conditions, such as asthma and autoimmuneandinflammatorydiseases[ 6,7]. A review on the ascribed immunomodulation of acu- puncture concludes that acupuncture treatment appears tobe able to modulate immunosuppressed or immunoacti-vated conditions through different mechanisms, including macrophages,neutrophils,NKcellsandlymphocytesstimu- lation,immunoglobulinproduction,andcomplementsystemactivation [ 8]. In fact, two possible implicated mechanisms were previously reported: NK-related gene expression in thespleen[9]andthesympatheticnervoussystem[ 10].Another study revealed that acupuncture enhances the NK cellsactivityandmodulatesthebalancebetweenTh1andTh2[ 11].

Patients and Methods 2.1. Selection of Patients. This study was approved by the EthicsCommitteeofS.Jo aoandVilaNovadeGaia/Espinho Hospital Centers, Oporto, Portugal. Written informed con-sent was obtainedfromall patientsbefore study enrollment.Patients were eligible for inclusion as follows: recently diag-nosed or recurrent colorectal cancer, regardless of stage,receiving chemotherapy, no regular use of acupuncturewithin 120 days prior to enrollment, ability to give informedconsent, and>18 years of age. Exclusion criteria were the following: (a) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than500/L, (b) platelet count less than 25,000/ L, (c) alteredmental state, (d) clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, and(e)otherunstablemedicalconditions. 2.2. Study Design. All patients enrolled were evaluated at baseline. Patients were randomized into one of two groups:active acupuncture (AcuMoxa) or nonacupuncture (controlgroup).Allofthestudypatientswereblindedtorandomiza-tionassignments( Figure1). Patients in the experimental group received 6 sessions of acupuncture, twice a week, beginning one week prior tocycle of chemotherapy and ending at the beginning of thefollowing cycle of chemotherapy ( Figure2). At the end of the intervention, patients in the active arm continued theirremaining chemotherapy cycles without any acupuncturetreatment.Patientsinthecontrolarmwereofferedtheactiveacupuncture protocol immediately after they completed thefourweeksofbloodsamplingasacourtesy. Basedonprevioustrials[ 12,13],bloodsampleswerecol- lectedatbaseline(preintervention)7daysbeforechemother-apyandthenevery7daysduringfourweeks.Bloodsamplesof both groups, experimental and control, were taken underthesameconditions. 2.3. Acupuncture Protocol. All acupuncture treatments were performedatS.Jo aoandVilaNovadeGaia/EspinhoHospital Centres, Porto, Portugal. The acupuncture treatments wereadministeredonlybyoneacupuncturist(themainresearcher;master degree on TCM by the University of Porto).

Studiesregardingtheeffectofacupunctureandmoxibus- tion on CRC patients scarce. fact, only two easternstudies have addressed modulation of NK cells activity inCRCpatients[ 22,23].

Firstly, we observed (1) a reduction on anxiety and depression and (2) consistent positive trends on the levelsof WBC, ANC, and B and NK cells in the AcuMoxa groupversus the control group. The increase on WBC and ANCresultedinapproximatelya1.5xreductioninleukopeniaandneutropeniarates.TheacupuncturegroupshowedatwofoldincreaseinNKcellsratecomparedtothecontrolgroup.These preliminary results indicate an immunomodulatory effect of acupuncture in CRC patients undergoing chemotherapy.Acupuncture stimulation may yield a myeloprotective effectas suggested by Lu et al. on a study on electroacupunctureEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 NK were similar to thoseobtainedbyLuetal. Secondly,ourpreliminaryresultsshowthatacupuncture benefits the emotional status by decreasing anxiety anddepressionlevels.Thiseffectmaycontributetoimprovementon NK cells activity. As reported recently on a study onwomenwithbreastcancer[ 24],theemotionalstateinfluences NKcellsnumbersandactivity. Thirdly, with respect to quality of life, our study did not reveal significant differences between the two groups.However, we observed a tendency for decreasing certainsymptoms on the AcuMoxa group, such as gastrointestinaland urological symptoms and chemotherapy side effectsas well as the improvement of sexual function in men.Th i si sp r o b a b l yd u et ot h es h o r tp e r i o do ft r e a t m e n t .I naddition, intragroupanalyses reveal a significant decrease ofchemotherapysideeffectsontheAcuMoxagroupindicatinganovertimeprotectiveroleofacupunctureforCRCpatientsduringchemotherapy. F o u r t h l y ,n oa c u p u n c t u r ea n dm o x i b u s t i o n - r e l a t e d adverse events were observed. Globally, these preliminary results indicate that our AcuMoxa protocol is feasible and safeforCRCpatientsundergoingchemotherapy. What may be the physiological explanation for the observedresultsofAcuMoxastimulation? It is generally accepted that acupuncture induces an increaseonthereleaseof-endorphin [ 5,23]viath es ti m u - lationoftheHPAaxis.-Endorphinsconsequentlyinfluence immunecellsbybindingtoopioidreceptorsonthesurfaceofthe cells, namely, on NK cells [ 25] promoting the expression of cytotoxic molecules and the production of IFN .I nt u r n , IFNwould further increase the expression of NK cells receptors and cytokine secretion by other HADS at beginning (0)andattheend(3)ofthestudy . The HPA axis and SNS are generally activated in cancer, resultinginhighlevelsofcatecholamineandglucocorticoids,which augments the sympathetic outflow and decreases NKactivityintheperiphery[ 25]. Therefore, we may hypothesize that acupuncture, by actingontheSNSandtheHP Aaxis,mayreducethelevelsofcatecholaminesandconsequentlyattenuatetheirsuppressiveeffectsonNKcells. There are limitations in our preliminary study to be considered. (1) Although the patients were randomly allocated in each group, there is the possibility that results mayhave occurred by chance due to the small sample8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 0246 81 0 7: Symptoms related to QOL questionnaires.
