Continue reading to learn more about what detox is, common withdrawal symptoms, what drugs are used to help detox, and the effectiveness of detox medications. What Is Medical Detox? [Detox](/addiction-treatment-ms/levels-of-care/medical-detox/) is the process of removing toxins, such as alcohol or other drugs, from the body. The goal of detox is to reduce physical consequences related to substance use and minimize medical complications.1 When a person is in detox, medical professionals may use certain interventions to help manage symptoms associated with acute intoxication and/or withdrawal.1 Common Withdrawal Symptoms Different substances can produce varied withdrawal symptoms; however, some withdrawal symptoms are common across different types of drugs and alcohol withdrawal. Some [common withdrawal symptoms](https://oxfordtreatment.com/addiction-treatment/detox/withdrawal-symptoms/) include:1 - Increased or decreased appetite. - Changes in mood such as increased anxiety, irritability, or depression. - Physical discomfort. - Nausea. - Vomiting. - Sleep difficulties. - Restlessness. The duration and intensity of withdrawal symptoms are often associated with the amount and length of time a person misused the substance or substances.2 Although the symptoms in the above list are common withdrawal symptoms, not every person going through detox will have them. Common Medications Used in Drug & Alcohol Detox There are several prescription medications that medical professionals may administer as drug withdrawal treatments, to help minimize a patient's discomfort during detox. Generally, a person taking medications that can be habit-forming (such as benzodiazepines or buprenorphine) is closely monitored by a medical professional. There are a variety of detox medications available both narcotic and nonnarcotic. There are benefits to including the appropriate medication in a patient's overall treatment plan. For example, medical supervision and administration of certain medications can help reduce life-threatening medical complications that could arise and be fatal if the person was left untreated.1 Common detox medications include: Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsant drugs are prescribed to help prevent seizures. They can be a helpful component of alcohol detox by reducing alcohol withdrawal seizures. Anticonvulsant drugs can also help reduce cravings for alcohol.4 Some commonly prescribed anticonvulsants used in alcohol detox include:4 - Gabapentin. - Vigabatrin. Benzodiazepines [Benzodiazepines](/prescription-drug-abuse/benzodiazepines/) are typically prescribed by medical professionals to help manage a person's anxiety symptoms. They also may be used to help manage the severity of alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.4 Benzodiazepines can help reduce alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom severity, as well as the occurrence of seizures and delirium tremens, when administered promptly when a person is in or at risk of alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.3,1 Some commonly used benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcohol or benzodiazepine detoxification include:4 - Librium Oxazepam. Methadone [Methadone](/addiction-treatment/detox/suboxone/vs-methadone/) is often used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan in medically supervised withdrawal from opioids. It is approved for the treatment of opioid use disorder and can be used for a long duration, not just the withdrawal phase.5 Methadone works by decreasing cravings for opioids and lessens opioid withdrawal symptoms. It can also prevent people who are addicted to prescription pioids from using illicit opioids such as heroin.5 Phenobarbital Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant sometimes used for sedative and alcohol withdrawal. However, its use is becoming increasingly rare. Barbiturates like phenobarbital can be highly addictive, and taking too much of them (i.e., a phenobarbital overdose) can be fatal. Use should be closely monitored by a medical professional. Suboxone [Suboxone](/addiction-treatment/detox/suboxone/) is a combination of an opioid agonist (meaning it activates opioid brain receptors) combined with an opioid antagonist (meaning it blocks or reverses the effects of opioids). Specifically, suboxone is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone.5,6 This differs from Subutex in that it includes naloxone, a medication that is used to quickly reverse an opioid overdose. Suboxone is used in the treatment of opioid use disorder.5,6 Subutex Subutex, consisting of only buprenorphine, works by reducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal and cravings. Subutex can help block the euphoric effects people often experience when taking illicit opioids. Other benefits of Subutex include increased safety in opioid overdoses and decrease the risk for opioid misuse.5,7 Post-Detox Medications Some medications may be prescribed as part of ongoing [addiction treatment](/addiction-treatment/) for [alcohol use disorder](/substance-abuse/alcohol/) and [opioid use disorder](/prescription-drug-abuse/opiates/). For various reasons, these medicines cannot be initiated during the detox phase of treatment and are typically used as maintenance medications once detox is complete. Common addiction treatment medications include: Acamprosate Acamprosate is a medication that is often used after a person has initiated detox to assist patients in maintaining abstinence from alcohol. Patients generally begin taking acamprosate around five days after their last use of alcohol.3 Since some individuals may not be fully completed with detox within a five-day timespan, they may begin acamprosate while still in detox based on their provider's recommendation. Acamprosate appears to be more effective after a person has completed detox and is abstinent from alcohol before beginning treatment.3 Disulfiram Disulfiram is one of three medications approved by the FDA to treat alcohol use disorder. It is also available under the brand name Antabuse.10 Disulfiram is not an anti-craving medication. It works by producing a series of adverse effects that occur if a person consumes alcohol while taking the medication. This so-called \"disulfiram-alcohol reaction\" can include nausea, sweating, vertigo, palpitations, rapid heart rate, and low blood pressure.10 Research indicates that the severe discomfort caused by these symptoms can be effective in discouraging alcohol use in people with alcohol dependence.10 Naltrexone Naltrexone is a medication approved to treat alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder.11 It is available in pill form, which can be taken daily as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for alcohol use disorder. Naltrexone can help curb alcohol cravings and must be started after a person finishes detox. Otherwise, it can cause symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.11 Naltrexone is also available in an injectable form, which is administered by a medical provider once a month, as determined appropriate for the ongoing treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorders.11 In the case of opioids, naltrexone works by blocking the euphoric and sedative effects of drugs like heroin and prescription painkillers. It can also help curb cravings and has no potential addiction or abuse.11 How Effective Are Detox & Treatment Medications? Detox and treatment medications are effective as a pharmacological intervention for drug and alcohol detox and may also help with withdrawal, ongoing maintenance, and cravings. For example, acamprosate can significantly reduce the likelihood of drinking and is associated with an increased duration of abstinence from alcohol.8 Medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone are effective in reducing symptoms related to opioid addiction and are associated with an increased likelihood of staying in substance use disorder treatment.9 Detox and treatment medications can be most effective when prescribed and administered by a medical professional. Although detox medications can be helpful when someone discontinues alcohol or drugs, this is just the beginning. These medications work best as one component in a comprehensive treatment plan that also includes various types of evidence-based behavioral therapies.
