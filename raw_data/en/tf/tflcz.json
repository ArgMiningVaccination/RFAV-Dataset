The oils are used to affect your mood and alleviate pain. How does Aromatherapy Massage work? The nostrils are attached to a part of the brain called the limbic system. The limbic system controls emotions and influences the nervous system and hormones. When you inhale essential oil molecules, messages are transmitted to the limbic system and affect heart rate, stress level, blood pressure, breathing, memory, digestion, and the immune system. Essential oils are also believed to be absorbed through the skin. Each essential oil has different healing properties. For example, some calm while others energize. What makes Aromatherapy Massage different? Aromatherapy massageis primarily slow, gentle, rhythmic movements .
