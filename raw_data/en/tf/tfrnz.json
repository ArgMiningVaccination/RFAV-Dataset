Vaccine acceptance among the general public and healthcare workers appears to have a decisive role in the successful control of the pandemic. The aim of this review was to provide an up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates worldwide. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on 25 December 2020. Results from 31 peer-reviewed published studies met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for the final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Survey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). However, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). Only eight surveys among healthcare workers (doctors and nurses) were found, with vaccine acceptance rates ranging from 27.7% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 78.1% in Israel. In the majority of survey studies among the general public stratified per country (29/47, 62%), the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination showed a level of 70%. Low rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were reported in the Middle East, Russia, Africa and several European countries. This could represent a major problem in the global efforts to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. More studies are recommended to address the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Such studies are particularly needed in the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle and South America. Addressing the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in various countries is recommended as an initial step for building trust in COVID-19 vaccination efforts.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-02-16", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Worldwide: A Concise Systematic Review of Vaccine Acceptance Rates [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020160](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020160) [Vaccine Hesitancy and Child Immunizations: Rationales, /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Vaccine_Hesitancy_Child_Immunization )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00160)]. Factors that affect the attitude towards acceptance of vaccination include complacency, convenience and confidence [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00160), [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00160)]. Complacency denotes the low perception of the disease risk; hence, vaccination was deemed unnecessary. Confidence refers to the trust in vaccination safety, effectiveness, besides the competence of the healthcare systems. Convenience entails the availability, affordability and delivery of vaccines in a comfortable context [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00160)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00160), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00160)]. Environmental factors include public health policies, social factors and the messages spread by the media [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00160), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00160), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00160)]. The agent (vaccine and disease) factors involve the perception of vaccine safety and effectiveness, besides the perceived susceptibility to the disease [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00160), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00160), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00160)]. Host factors are dependent on knowledge, previous experience, educational and income levels [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00160), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00160)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00160), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00160), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00160)]. The most common reasons included: perceived risks vs. benefits, certain religious beliefs and lack of knowledge and awareness [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00160), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00160), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00160)]. The aforementioned reasons can be applied to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, as shown by the recent publications that showed a strong correlation between intent to get coronavirus vaccines and its perceived safety [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00160)], association of the negative attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines and unwillingness to get the vaccines [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00160)], and the association of religiosity with lower intention to get COVID-19 vaccines [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00160)]. [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00160)]. This entails the existence of cognitive, psychologic, socio-demographic and cultural factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00160), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00160), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00160), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00160)]. Analysis of such factors is needed to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, following the assessment of the scope and magnitude of this public health threat [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00160)]. This can help in guiding interventional measures aimed at building and maintaining responses to tackle this threat [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00160)]. [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00160), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00160), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00160)]. Higher-income regions were the least certain regarding vaccine safety with 72%-73% of people in Northern America and Northern Europe who agreed that vaccines are safe. This rate was even lower in Western Europe (59%), and in Eastern Europe (50%), despite the presence of a substantial variability in Eastern European countries (from 32% in Ukraine, 48% in Russia, to 77% in Slovakia). However, the majority of people in lower-income areas agreed that vaccines are safe, with the highest proportions seen in South Asia (95%) and in Eastern Africa (92%) [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00160)]. A similar pattern was observed regarding vaccine effectiveness, with Eastern Europe as the region where people are the least likely to agree that vaccines are effective, as opposed to South Asia and Eastern Africa [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00160)]. The assessment of such regional differences can be invaluable in addressing and fighting public health threats posed by vaccine hesitancy [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00160)]. [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00160), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00160)]. The ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases can be driven by human factors, including attitude towards physical distancing and protective measures, while viral factors are driven by mutations that commonly occur in severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus viral factors can particularly be of high relevance considering the recent reports of resurgence in COVID-19 infections in UK due to a new variant of the virus [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00160)]. [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00160), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00160)]. Thus, huge efforts by the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry backed by governments' support, were directed towards developing efficacious and safe vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00160)]. These efforts were manifested by the approval of several vaccines for emergency use, in addition to more than 60 vaccine candidates in clinical trials. Moreover, more than 170 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in the pre-clinical phase [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00160)]. [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00160)]. To identify the scope of this problem, this systematic review aimed to assess the acceptance rates for COVID-19 vaccine(s) in different countries worldwide, which can provide an initial step to study the factors implicated in regional and cultural differences behind COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. 2. Materials and Methods [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00160)]. 3. Results [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00160-f001)). In addition, data collected in a recently published article that surveyed the general public residing in Jordan and Kuwait were added to the final analysis [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00160)]. 3.1. Characteristics of the Papers Included in This Review [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00160)]. [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00160), [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00160)]. Out of these 60 surveys, 47 were among the general public, eight surveys were among healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, or others), three surveys were among parents/guardians and two surveys involved University students ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00160-t001)). Surveys were most commonly conducted in June or July (23/60, 38%), followed by March or April (20/60, 33%). 3.2. Rates of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00160-t001). Classified per study, the highest vaccine acceptance rates (>90%) among the general public were found in four studies from Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). On the contrary, the lowest vaccine acceptance rates (<60%) among the general public were found in seven studies to be from Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). In [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00160-f002), COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates are shown per country, with the latest estimate used for countries with multiple studies. 3.3. Changes in COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance over Time in Countries with Multiple Survey Studies 4. Discussion [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00160), [77](#B77-vaccines-09-00160), [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00160), [79](#B79-vaccines-09-00160), [80](#B80-vaccines-09-00160)]. The huge leaps in developing efficacious and safe COVID-19 vaccines within a short period were unprecedented [ [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00160), [82](#B82-vaccines-09-00160), [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00160)]. Nevertheless, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy can be the limiting step in the global efforts to control the current pandemic with its negative health and socio-economic effects [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00160), [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00160), [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00160)]. [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00160)]. The latest estimates on COVID-19, pointed out a range of 60-75% immune individuals that would be necessary to halt the forward transmission of the virus and community spread of the virus [ [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00160), [88](#B88-vaccines-09-00160), [89](#B89-vaccines-09-00160)]. Vaccine cost, effectiveness and duration of protection appear as important factors to achieve such a goal [ [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00160), [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00160), [91](#B91-vaccines-09-00160)]. However, vaccine hesitancy can be a decisive factor that would hinder the successful control of the current COVID-19 pandemic [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00160), [92](#B92-vaccines-09-00160)]. Thus, estimates of vaccine acceptance rates can be helpful to plan actions and intervention measures necessary to increase the awareness and assure people about the safety and benefits of vaccines, which in turn would help to control virus spread and alleviate the negative effects of this unprecedented pandemic [ [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00160), [94](#B94-vaccines-09-00160)]. Evaluation of attitudes and acceptance rates towards COVID-19 vaccines can help to initiate communication campaigns that are much needed to strengthen trust in health authorities [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00160)]. [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00160), [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00160), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00160)]. Another two surveys on the general public in China reported vaccine acceptance rates of more than 80%, with an additional survey in South Korea that reported a rate of 79.8% [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160), [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00160)]. A later survey from Shenzhen, China, by Zhang et al., which surveyed parents/guardians who were factory workers, on their acceptability of children COVID-19 vaccination reported a lower rate of 72.5% compared to previous studies [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00160)]. Similarly, an online survey on Australian parents showed an acceptance rate of 75.8%, dropping from a rate of 85.8% in April among adults in Australia who were surveyed in April 2020 [ [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00160), [95](#B95-vaccines-09-00160)]. The lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate among the general public in the region was reported by Lazarus et al., in Singapore (67.9%) [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160)]. The relatively high rates of vaccine acceptance in the region were attributed to strong trust in governments [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160)]. Additionally, the only survey in India reported a vaccine acceptance rate of 74.5% [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160)]. The relatively high rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance might be related to stronger confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness, as reported previously in Asia [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00160)]. [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00160), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00160)]. Likewise, Kabamba Nzaji et al. reported a very low rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in the DRC (27.7%) [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00160)]. This issue is alarming considering the front-line position of healthcare workers in fighting the spread and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which put them at a higher risk of infection, and hence their higher need for protective measures [ [96](#B96-vaccines-09-00160), [97](#B97-vaccines-09-00160), [98](#B98-vaccines-09-00160)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00160)]. This was also seen in the survey from Mexico with a vaccine acceptance rate of 76.3% [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160), [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00160)]. The results in Italy and France can be viewed from the perspective of lacking confidence in the safety of these vaccines, since such a negative attitude was reported previously in these countries [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00160)]. In addition, low rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were reported among students and healthcare workers in Malta\u201444.2% and 52.0%, respectively [ [73](#B73-vaccines-09-00160), [74](#B74-vaccines-09-00160)]. Variable results were also reported in other European countries with rates as high as 80.0% in Denmark, and as low as 56.3% in Poland [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00160)]. The vaccine acceptance rates were even lower in Russia (54.9%), which needs further evaluation considering the heavy toll of COVID-19 on the country [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00160), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160)]. Variability in vaccine acceptance rates was also seen in the UK, US and Canada over the course of the pandemic [ [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00160), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00160), [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00160), [65](#B65-vaccines-09-00160), [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00160)]. Additionally, a drop in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was noticed in a few European countries, which is in line with the recent report by Lin et al. [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00160)]. Such patterns of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were consistent with a previous report that showed relatively high rates of vaccine hesitancy in Western and Eastern Europe, in addition to Russia [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00160)]. The aforementioned low rates can be linked to lower confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness in these regions [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00160)]. [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00160), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00160), [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00160)]. Such low rates can be related to the widespread embrace of conspiratorial beliefs in the region, with its subsequent negative attitude towards vaccination [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00160), [99](#B99-vaccines-09-00160), [100](#B100-vaccines-09-00160), [101](#B101-vaccines-09-00160)]. However, the highest vaccine acceptance rate was reported in Israel (75.0%); however, this rate was much lower among nurses surveyed in the same study (61.1%) [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00160)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00160)]. Early knowledge, attitudes and practices survey study towards COVID-19, from North-Central Nigeria, reported an acceptance rate of barely 29.0%, which highlights the need for more studies for an accurate depiction of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Africa due to possible large regional and sub-regional variations [ [102](#B102-vaccines-09-00160)]. Thus, more studies are recommended in Africa to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the continent. Despite the previous findings of an overall low prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Eastern Africa, the attitude towards the newer vaccines, including those of COVID-19, remains a study topic that has not been explored to a large degree [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00160)]. Besides Africa, more studies are needed from Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Central and South America to reach reliable conclusions about the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy around the globe. [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00160), [99](#B99-vaccines-09-00160), [101](#B101-vaccines-09-00160)]. These variables should be considered for an accurate interpretation of COVID-19 acceptance rates, since sampling bias, particularly in sex distribution, can affect the reported rates. [103](#B103-vaccines-09-00160)]. In addition, the research studies included in this review represented cross-sectional studies, which can be seen as snapshots of vaccine hesitancy status in each country/region, with different sampling strategies, which may partly explain the differences in vaccine acceptance rates reported in various studies from a single country. Thus, the results should be interpreted with extreme caution since they cannot predict the future changes in vaccine acceptance rates. The results of this study can be used as an initial motivation and guide for future studies and vaccine awareness campaigns. Finally, an important limitation was related to the different approaches used to express the willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines in various studies (i.e., some studies used a binary response of yes/no, while others used a scale of strongly agree/agree/neutral/disagree/strongly disagree to deduce the inclination towards vaccine acceptance, etc.); thus, this variable should be taken into account for accurate comparisons of vaccine acceptance rates between different studies. 5.
