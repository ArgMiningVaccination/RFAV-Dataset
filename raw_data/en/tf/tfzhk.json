If you ask for an IMR first, but do not agree with the decision, you can still ask for a State Fair Hearing later. But if you ask for a State Fair Hearing first, and the hearing has already happened, you cannot ask for an IMR. In this case, the State Fair Hearing has the final say. The sections below will provi de you with more information on how to ask for a State Fair Hearing or an IMR . Independent Medical Reviews (IMR) An IMR is when an outside reviewer who is not related to the health plan reviews your case. If you want an IMR, you must first file an appeal with Kaiser Permanente. If you do not hear from your health plan within 30 calendar days, or if you are unhappy with your health plan's decision, then you may then request an IMR. You must ask for an IMR within 6 months from the date on the notice telling you of the appeal decision. You may be able to get an IMR right away without filing an appeal first. This is in cases where your health is in immediate danger or the request was denied because treatment was considered experimental or investigational. The paragraph below will provide you with information on how to request an IMR. Note that the term \"grievance\" is talking about both \"complaints\" and \"appeals.\" 6 | Reporting and solving grievances Call member services at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711). The call is toll free.

Visit online at kp.org page 73 KP Cal, LLC The California Department of Managed Health Care is responsible for regulating health care service plans. If you have a grievance against your health plan, you should first telephone your health plan at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711) and use your health plan's grievance process before contacting the department.

You may also be eligible for an Independent Medical Review (IMR). If you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of medical decisions made by a health plan related to the medical necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments that are experimental or investigational in nature and payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical services. The department also has a toll -free telephone number (1-888-HMO -2219) and a TDD line (1 -877-688-9891) for the hearing and speech impaired.
