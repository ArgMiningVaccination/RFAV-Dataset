The project was conceived by Hod Norton, Ernest Erz, B.J. Palmer and about sixteen others\" (Turner, 1931, p. 177); BJ credits TJ Owens DC as the organizer of the UCA in a 1913 issue of the Fountain Head News (Nov 1; 2[38]: 9): One of the good old scouts who is still with us in heart, head and hand is \"T.J.\" Owens. \"T\" would often speak to \"B\" and \"T.J.\" and \"B.J.\" are might close friends; so close that we don't need to say so to each other.... T.J. Owens was the organizer; the FATHER of the U.C.A. flock. To him should be given credit for setting on the egg that hatched this noble organization that is doing so much for Chiropractors liberty. \"T\" certainly looked ahead, as \"Pud\" would put it. Yes, \"T\" is still with us; living in Davenport, c/o Hugh Harrison and would be glad to hear from any of the old scouts whom he knew and who knew him.... 1906: \"Years ago The UCA was born in the basement of 828 Brady. It was conceived by Hod Norton, Ernest Erz, and some seventeen others, including B.J. Palmer....B.J. Palmer was elected its first Secretary\" (Palmer, 1931a) DD Palmer's The Chiropractor Adjuster [1(2)] notes: \"'Dr. Newsalt, who has been elected as one of the board of directors [of the UCA] for the coming year, is ever ready to keep up the pace and call to order those who deviate from the tenor of their ways and are inclined to meandering. He was well chosen to fill the vacant position.' See page 90 of August and September number of The Chiropractor . \"He is ever ready and willing to be made a cats's paw, and burn his fingers to gather chestnuts out of the fire for others. He has already called to order a brother director, who was 'inclined to meandering' and do hiws own thinking. 'Dr. Newsalt was well chosen to fill the vacant position' of dictator. Sometimes Newsalt may be too fresh, thereby fail to save 'those who deviate from the tenor of their ways and are inclined to meandering.'\" (p. 56) 1909 (Feb 17): letter to DD from TJ Owens DC of Seattle ( The Chiropractor Adjuster 1909 [Mar]; 1[3]:14); Owens was apparently the first president of the (p. 122) 1910 (April): According to Dye (1939, p. 224), a 1912 graduate of the PSC: ....One of the ostensible reasons for the founding of the Universal Chiropractic College that I distinctly recall, being on the scene at the time,in April, 1910, was that a more exhaustive study be made of Diagnosis in conjunction with the study of Symptomatology and Pathology. There also came a competition among the existing schools to incorporate these additional courses or subjects, or to have a more exhaustive course in the subjects then prevailing, so they could be in a position in their advertising of holding themselves out to prospective students as having the most superior course of all.... 1910: PSC Announcement lists UCA Constitution, By-Laws and Directors -Geo.

PALMER SCHOOL OF CHIROPRACTIC PERSONALLY CONDUCTED BY THE ONE WHO DISCOVERED THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF CHIROPRACTIC, DEVELOPED ITS PHILOSOPHY, ORIGINATED AND FOUNDED THE SCIENCE AND ART OF CORRECTING ABNORMAL FUNCTIONS BY HAND-ADJUSTING, USING THE VERTEBRAL PROCESSES AS LEVERS. D.D. PALMER gave CHIROPRACTIC to the WORLD. ___________________ Santa Barbara, Cal., May 4, 1911. P.W. Johnson, D.C.; Yours of April 26th at hand. It contains an interesting and financial question, one which I think Old Dad hold the key of. Stop right now and read two sections in this enclosed circular, on pages 2 and 8 marked, and see if you cannot grasp the way out, that which I see that we are coming to. I want you to study those two items marked. The same ideas are in my book, altho not put out quite so plain as found in these two sections. I occupy in chiropractic a similar position as did Mrs. Eddy in Christian Science. Mrs. Eddy claimed to receive her ideas from the other world and so do I. She founded theron a religioin, so may I. I am THE ONLY ONE IN CHIROPRACTIC WHO CAN DO SO. Ye, Old Dad always has something new to give to his followers. I have much new written for another edition, when this one is sold. It is STRANGE TO ME WHY EVERY CHIROPRACTOR DOES NOT WANT A COPY OF MY BOOK. You write as tho you did not know of my change of location. I lived in this city nine years ago and have always had a hankering for its climate, fruits and flowers. I can edit, publish and place my book on the market as well here as elsewhere. I have not been teaching or practicing since leaving Portland, but have today placed an add in the city paper, of which I am sending you a copy, and will instruct by book or in person as the way opens. I have been and continue to watch your rights with \"The American Octopus\". I want you to STUDY the religious move.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating2 California has an organization with Miss Michelson as our attorney. Please drop me a few lines as soon as your trial is over, so that I may know how matters proceed. You ask, what I think will be the final outcome of our law getting. It will be that we will have to build a boat similar to Christian Science and hoist a religious flag. I have received chiropractic from the other world, similar as did Mrs. Eddy. No other one has lad claim to that, NOT EVEN B.J . Exemption clauses instead of chiro laws by all means, and LET THAT EXEMPTION BE THE RIGHT TO PRACTICE OUR RELIGION . But we must have a religious head, one who is the founder, as did Christ, Mohamed, Jo. Smith, Mrs. Eddy, Martin Luther and other who have founded religions. I am the fountain head. I am the founder of chiropractic in its science, in its art, in its philosophy and in its religious phase. Now, if chiorpractors desire to claim me as their head, their leader, the way is clear. My writings have been gradually steering in that direction until now it is time to assume that we have the same right to as has Christian Scientists. Oregon is free to Chiropractors. California gives Chiropractors only one chance, that of practicing our religion. The protective policy of the U.C.A. is O.K., but that of religion is far better. The latter can only be assumed by having a leader, a head, a person who has received chiropractic as a science, as an art, as a philosophy and as a religion. Do you catch on ? The policy of the U.C.A. is the best that B.J. can be at the head of, BUT THE RELIGIOUS MOVE IS FAR BETTER, but we must incorporate under the man who received the principles of chiropractic from the other world, who wrote the book of all chiropractic books, who today has much new matter, valuable, which is not contained in that book. If you will watch my book closely as you read, you will find it has a religion contained in it, altho I do not so name it. If either of the Davenport schools would take advantage of practicing our religion founded by D.D. Palmer , it will make the way of chiropractic as easy as it was for the S.C.'s. I have given you some special hints on the question which is uppermost in your mind, will you please give it consideration -- never mind if it is new. Truly, (Signed) D.D.

Then, you can see that it is a scheme to get us under their thumb and then crush us out of existence. First they make a pretense to approve a Chiropractic school, although they say 'that it was far from deserving such approval' then they withdraw that approval after we have been all led up to the chopping block and politically decapitated...

It was a playground for mixers who wanted the fruit of Chiropractic without earning the right to Chiropractic by helping to sustain it.\" (Palmer, 1931a, p. 5) 1922-1930: letter of 1/19/63 to Stanley Hayes DC from J. Lewis Fenner DC, PhC in Brooklyn speaks of ACA history (Hayes collection): Dear Doctor: ...Congratulations on reaching 72! I can remember so well when I was 'only' 72! I will round out 84 years next week, but I have five years yet to go to match my grandfather (one of my aunts reached 93) so I can afford to be chipper and brag about it a little - or can I? I quote from my letter of 17th to Dr. Cooley on receipt of the January magazine: 'I find particular interest in the broad principles that are developed by Thure C. Peterson , Stanley Hayes , Bill Brown and others'. And I well remember your activities in chiropractic circles and your writings on it in earlier years. You are always a staunch advocate. I am sorry not to be able to answer your question about Methods and Apparatus and perhaps the best way to tell you why is to recite some of the tiresome history that preceded the time you mention. You will perhaps remember the agitation I carried on in the UCC and National, Ross Journals when I was Secretary-Treasurer of The New York State Chiropractic Society against the abuses perpetrated on the profession by the UCA, then monopolizing the nation organizationally. I did not seek any such thing, but the upshot of it was my own motionto organize a body \" free from any school domination \" which became the ACA with me the first secretary. You will perhaps remember that it became necessary for Dr. John P. Phillips to resign and find himself another job when the ACA sponsors failed to finance their creation, with the result that I was made the chief executive, our lease were cancelled, the office was dumped into my Brooklyn office, whence I managed, as best I could, the bawling infant for two more years. You may remember that about that time one of the recent graduates of the National school [ Frank R. Margetts LLB, DC ] was making quite a noise orating at homecomings and since Phillips had been a graduate of the UCC, and so was I, it seemed to me that this National man might redress the balance and I, myself, secured his nomination and election to the office of president, he accepting it on the express stipulatin that it cost him no money and did not interfere with a practice he was setting up in Denver! The convention at the end of his first year bared the fact that he [Margetts ]did not know I had been made officially the executive officer and that the feelings that I had felt for him were due to the fact that some of his orders as president had not been carried out according to his wishes. The misunderstanding was his, not mine, but he had already picked out another as his candidate for secretary thought he did not get him elected. However, he had made up his mind and shortly after he called an executive meeting at which he demanded my ouster, threatening to resign himself if I di not get out. You are entitled to believe that the ACA would have died there and then if he had got out instead of me, but by that time he had given up his office and was giving his full time to the ACA under a guarantee by the UCC and the National school and a majority of the directors were in favor of his retention and I resigned. I never had anything to do with the ACA after that and I was far from the scene of action when the ACA was amalgamated with the UCA . I do not suppose a list of what I consider to be the important events of our professional history will have any special validity, but I think second only to the foundation of the practice by D.D. Palmer , the organization of the ACA is equal to any other. We insisted on making it \"Straight\" and most of the founders would be shamed by the scope the present successor of it has taken. It did not unify the profession - was not intended to - but it was an important and necessary step in that direction - and the perfection of it awaits our attention - and with what urgency! If you care to submit a list of questions as suggested in your letter, I shall be glad to answer what I can, but I have no inside knowledge of the ACA -NCA after 1924. If I were not a better chiropractor than I am a typist, I don't think I would still \"be in the business\" - but that isn't saying much.

Phillips, D.C., President , at 7 Fifth Ave, NYC (p. 7): Chiropractic now has its national organization, created by its practitioners and not controlled by any group or faction. This announcement, made so briefly, and placed before the profession through the courtesy of various Chiropractic papers, marks a step forward, the far-reaching value of which would be hard to estimate. For a long time it has seemed almost unbelievable to thoughtful Chiropractors that our science, with its undeveloped strength, its opposition and its need for constructive effort, should be without national organization. Every other profession of its size, and many smaller, has its national body, which speaks for it, which welds its members together, and which not only increases its prestige but offers the vehicle for its work of national scope. In Chiropractic, the only organization in any way national in its membership is an association established for insurance and protection and recruiting its members almost entirely from one of the many groups of chiropractic. For this organization we have neither opposition nor criticism. \"The American Chiropractic Association \" is not interested in the insurance company in which you insure your lives not your houses against fire, and its membership is open to all chiropractors (who are otherwise eligible) no matter where they buy their professional protection and insurance. For those who wish to buy such protection from it, or rather from a sound company, affiliated with it, such protection will be provided on a very broad and satisfactory plan, but this is separate and will be discussed separately. But let me say, in passing, that there could be no greater indication of the immediate need of this new organization than the fact that after 16 years, this prior insurance association, which has recently laid some claims to being representative, should have a membership of only about 3,000, thus leaving 80% of the profession today without national representation. The A.C.A. comes into the field on a constructive platform. It is \"against\" no individual and no organization already existing. It enters a field now unoccupied. No organiztion built on a negative foundation could live and the A.C.A., a lusty child at its birth, proposes to live long and happily and helpfully. It is indicative of the spirit of the new organization that it should have been created at a meeting suggested by a man who is not himself a chiropractor but whose interest brought him from Texas to New York for that purpose. To this meeting were asked many of the men recognized as the leaders of the profession, and those who have for a long time spoken and written of the need of national organization. It is my belief that a more sincere and enthusiastic meeting has never been held, and from it has come the announcement of the formation of theA.C.A., an association, not for the individual, not for the school, not for the group, nor the faction, but for Chiropractic, the science. The officers and directors include such men as John P. Phillips of Tennessee, President; Seth a Becker of New York, Treasurer; J. Lewis Fenner of New York, Secretary; C. A. Lenville, President of the Massachusetts Chiropractic Association; Charles Gatter, President of the Philadelphia County Chiropractic Association; S.T. McMurrian of Texas; Paul H. Strand H. Tunison of New York; F.X. Sauchelli of New York. The by-laws of the A.C.A. provide that no one, connected with a Chiropractic school can hold an office or be elected to its directorate. On the other hand, the new organization is already supported enthusiastically by five of the leading schools and the support of the others is assured. Membership in the A.C.A. is limited to those who can present to the membership committee adequate evidence of moral, professional and educated fitness. The building of a standard code of professional ethics is before the association for further action. These points cannot be discussed for want of space. They have been mentioned only because attempts have recently been made, by at least one prominent Chiropractor, to cloud the real issue of Chiropractic. A careful examination of the very cases presented in evidence will show that while the issue is of very great importance for consideration in the future, it is very far from being one requiring our immediate attention if we are to protect Chiropractic. Announcement of the plans of the A.C.A. in detail would be premature. The incorporation of the A.C.A. has been completed and its offices established. A Research Section proposes a comprehensive program which will include the establishment of a trust fund for this work, operated for the good of Chiropractic research by some bank or similar institution. Already two contributions have been made toward such a fund. A lecture bureau of well-trained and experienced speakers is planned, affilated only with the national organization. A department of practice building will interest the recent graduates more than the older members. A journal scientific in its articles, comprehensive in its news of the field, absolutely clean in its policy and whose accuracy may be unquestioned will follow. This list of activities is only a suggestion of the proposed activities, possible with the profession's support. Further details will follow. The A.C.A. is guilding slowly and surely. It asks the support of the profession and the indications before even this announcement, show us that we have this suport. The officers of the Association are: President - Dr. John P. Phillips, 7 5th Ave., New York City. Secretary - Dr. J. Lewis Fenner, 33 Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y. Treasurer - Dr. Seth A. Becker, 55 W. 83rd St., New York City. Vice-Presidents- Dr. A.B. Cochrane, 39 State Street, Chicago, Ill. Dr. Chas. A. Gatter, 304 West Olney Ave., Philadelphia, Pa. Dr. S.T. McGranaghan, 4095 18th Street, San Francisco, Calif. Dr. S.T. McMurrian, Linz Building, Dallas, Texas. Dr. E.H. Tunison, 99 Doscher Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1923 (May): National (College) Journal of Chiropractic [10(10)] includes: -Arthur L. Forster MD, DC childhood\" (pp. 2-3) -Barratt O'Hara, Chiropractic Association , organized September 22, 1922, continues to meet with the same misrepresentation and ridicule that characterized the opposition to its formation, and from the same source. I believe there is no reason to anticipate that it will ever grow less during the reign of autocracy in chiropractic, and we therefore expect that a certain preparedness on our part to deny false reports will always be more or less necessary.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating7 An attempt to create the impression that the A.C.A. is not in reality an independent organization of chiropractors is especially mischievous. The strongest refutation of this statement is the simple fact that at least two so-called leaders connected with certain schools have already been estranged from us because their own wishes did not prevail in the organization. We have the active support of the leading schools of chiropractic in the world, but none of them are dictating our policies nor in any way controlling our organization. One of the old gags that has been sprung on chiropractors from time immemorial to injure competitors is also being tried on us. It is so old that it will be promptly discredited among all chiropractors who have watched it long enought to realize (1) the general unreliability of its source and (2) the motive back of such misinformation. To answer the challenge more specifically: The A.C.A. is very much alive and stronger than ever. We have chose to go slow and not make claims and promises that we could not live up to just in order that we might win the confidence of all chiropractors and thus realize a larger success eventually. The sophistry about \"mixing\" is also getting to be pretty well understood and in danger of becoming threadbare. But for the sake of those who are not clear on it, a few words will clear it up. The American Chiropractic Association is a chiropractic organization and is interested in nothing else. Its purpose is single indeed as compared with such an organization as works for the interest of a man or a school while professing to be devoted to chiropractic. We no doubt have people in our membership who do other things than \"adjust the spine,\" but so does every other chiropractic organization that I know of. The distinction is just here: The A.C.A. realizes and acknowledges that it cannot entirely control the action of its members while engaged in the seclusion of their inner offices, while certain other organizations pretend that they can. All of us, of course, know better. But we do not intend to devote all our energies to denying false reports. Indeed we intend to continue to do so much else that it will soon be known that damaging reports from a certain interested source are untrue until it will no longer be necessary for us to deny them. One achivement alone will justify the existence of the organization in the minds of those who are not blinded to their own interest and the interest of their profession by their devotion to one man. I refer to our arrangement for the protection of our members. An early false step in this feature of our activities has now been corrected and we are now furnishing to our members the strongest protection ever offered to chiropractors. This includes legal defense and indemnity under Lloyd's of London . It is unnecessary to enlarge on the ability or stability of this concern. \"Lloyd's\" is a household word the world around. Doing something like thirty million dollars' worth of business annually in the United States alone, they have successfully protected almost every conceivable character of property and business and profession. They retain the best legal talent available and win their cases . The same business and brains and capital that have made them successful wherever they have gone will now be put behind the profession of chiropractic and the defense of A.C.A. members. Indemnity is also guaranteed. In case of fines being imposed, members are indemnified in any amount up to five thousand dollars on any one suit or action, and not to exceed a total of fifteen thousand dollars in any one year. In cases of judgment being secured for actual or alleged injury to a patient, such judgments under \"malpratice\" are also indemnified in any amount up to five thousand dollars on any single action, and not to exceed a total of fifteen thousand dollars in any one year. This service and protection and indemnity, to gether with all the privileges and benefits of membership in the American Chiropractic Association , are furnished for an annual fee of only sixty dollars - no assessments. We have now reached a point where our success is assured, and we expect to be of immense service to the chiropractic profession. If you desire to belong to an organization of chiroprators, national in scope, that has proven its independence of school influences, dominated by the desire to be of service to chiropractic as it is known in field practice, able to protect you in the practice of yourprofession, and in the control of men who are exclusively practitioners of chiropractic, join the American Chiropractic Association - there is none other that can measure up to these specifications.

Budden DC argue in the negative -reprint of presentation, \"A National Organization of Chiropractors is Essential,\" by Frank R. Margetts LLB, DC at Wichita KS on 5/4/23 (page?): First - It is essential that th profession may protect itself from the innumberable so-called chiropractic schools, which have sprung up like mushrooms over night, and from their product, many of them a great discredit to the profession.... Second - It is essential so that the profession may protect itself from leaders and schools who wish to dictate to it as to its legislation, practice, advertising, and in every other particular where freedom should prevail. There is no good reason why schools should have a right to dictate to the practitioners in the field. It is time the profession was telling the schools what it wishes, instead of the schools coercing the profession. At present there is no organiztion through which the profession can protect itself against the unjust encroachments of schools, schools which have national organizations of able politicians and national periodicals, spreading their propaganda throughout the whole profession. Third - It is essential that the profesion may protect itself against the nation-wide medical enemy, the A.M.A. Fourth - It is essential that the profession may protect itself by insurance against unjust malpractice suits. Fifth - In order to carry on research work. Sixth - To bring about reciprocity and fraternity among the chiropractors of different schools. Seventh - To carry on nation-wide publicity for chiropractic. Eighth - When called upon to aid in the passage of chiropractic legislation The A.C.A. Supplies the Need and Is Fundamentally Democratic First - It is not an \"anti\" organiztion. Every reputable chiropractor is welcome to its ranks. The liberty of the bona fide chiorpractor is not to be limited. Second - Its membership will be representative of all schools. No one school will have dominance. Third - ITs annual meetings, at which its officers will be elected and changes in its organic law decided upon, will not be held in a distinctively chiropractic school town, nor in connection with the annual hurrah of any chiropractic school. Fourth - No chiropractic leader is to have any dictatorship in its affairs. Fifth - Its officers will not be permitted to be connected with any chiropractic school or its faculty. Sixth - Provision is made for the Initiative, Referendum and Recall, and for calling Special Meetings, so its membership may at all times control its affairs.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating8 Seventh - It affords protection, provides for publicity, research work, legislative aid, and professional co-operation. Eighth - Every chiropractor who is 21 years of age, of good moral charactter and of recognized standing in the profession, is eligible for membership. There are three classes of membership: Class A, for those in non-licensing States, costing $60 per year, and joining fee of $10, affording legal protection, and indemnity to extent of $5,000, terms $30 down, $20 in two months, and $20 in four months; Class B, for license States, costing $45, and joining fee of $10, affording malpractice protection, with indemnity to $5,000, terms $25 down, $15 in two months, and $15 in four months, Class C, all rights and privileges, excepting malpractice protection, costing $20 per year, and joining fee of $10, terms $10 down, $10 in two months, and $10 in four months. But the legal protection feature of this organization is not its main purpose. The main purpose is that the chiropractors may have an organization of their own, national in scope, for the other, and higher, purposes heretofore referred to. It is yet in its infancey. Some may say, I'll wait until I see if it grows to manhood before I join. Ignoble thought. Such cooperation is about as valuable as where one who would say, \"If others will save the child from drowning, I'll help dry its clothes.\" There must be pioneers in all worthy undertakings. Are you going to be a pioneer in this movement, or a spectator of the pioneers. Will you play the game, or sit on the bleachers eating peanuts, while others win. The health of multitudes of the sick is at stake. The progress of Chiropractic is being blocked, by the discord, covetousness, bigotry and confusion in our ranks, and all because we have not had a national organization of the Chiropractors themselves, applying itself to constructive work, rather than destructive; sowing the seeds of fraternalism, instead of hatred; creating confidence in one another, rther than suspicion; making Chiropractors friends, instead of foes; making for peace, instead of strife, understanding rther than misunderstanding; emphasizing fundamental agreements, rther than petty differences. We who live in this day of our profession, are to be envied our privilege to invest ourselves in this splendid movement, that will make for peace, good will, prosperity, and, above all the most valuable, the spread of Chiropractic to the multitudes. 1923 (June); Chirogram [2(2)] reports: -Editorial by G.A. Fisk DC (p. 2): One of the finest articles it has been our pleasure to read for many a day was contained in the N.C.C. Journal recently, the author Dr. A.L. Forster. The subject was the necessity of raising the standards of chiropractic education, particularly the pre-chiropractic educational requirements. Some oppose this step. We shall try to believe that their motives are sincere. That the early pioneers in Chiropractic did not possess a high- school education or its equivalent is no argument to be applied to the present situation. As Dr Forster aptly states, in those days it was chiropractic that was subjected to a test. Because of its inherent merit, that method has won the public confidence to an extent that assures it a place in the healing art for all time. Now, however, it is not chiropractic but chiropractors who are under examination by the public. The fact that Chiropractic has won recognition in many states of the Union, instead of assuring it a protected future, as so many seem to assume, is, in fact, the greatest menace to its perpetuation. Herein Dr. BJ Palmer concurs, for he has consistently displayed in his utterances and writings a note of doubt as to the ultimate value of legal recognition to chiropractic. However, we believe his reason for believing so is incorrect. He is against raising the pre-chiropractic educational requirements because he evidently fears it will cut down the output of chiropractors, thereby permitting the opposition to maintain an eternal numerical supremacy. We believe there are enough chiropractors in the country to safeguard the privileges so far won. A sufficient number of people are believers in chiropractic to help defend those rights.1923: ACA convention is held in Chicago, according to Bulletin of the ACA 1925 (Apr/May); 2(3-4):6 1923 (June 11): BJ writes to Sylva Ashworth to say she should not be concerned that \"Lee\" (?Edwards?) is taking credit for revision in NE chiro law; he and Mabel know that Dr. A did the work; Edwards is taking credit for reduction in NE law from \"3 of 9\" to \"3 of 6\"; BJ says a of things I detest...\" (Ashworth papers-CCC/KC) 1923 (June 27): Willard Carver writes to TF Ratledge re: Alva A Gregory MD, DC who is operating in Los Angeles; re: possible donation of land to the ACA, says (Ratledge papers-SFCR Archives): That association is destined, if Chiropractors in this country take hold of it as they should, to become the dominant factor in the Chiropractic world. It really is organized along proper lines I would be very glad if you would take this matter up with Dr. J Lewis Fenner , 33 Lafayett Ave, Brookly NY. Please take it up with him....I will be most glad to cooperate in the matter in any way that I find possible. The woman who owns the land should deed whatever part of it she deeds to the American Chiropractic Association free and clear of all incombrance. The fact that it owns this land and establishes it as a playground and educational center for the Chiropractic world will add sufficiently to her other property that she can easily afford to remove any incumbrance. 1923 (July 23): form letter from BJ to \"All Members:\" praises members \"special assessment\" (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC) 1923 (Oct): National (College) Chiropractic [11(2)} prints: from the Chirogram; see National (College) Journal of Chiropractic for June, 1923; (p. 25-?): One of the finest articles it has ever been our pleasure to read for many a day was contained in the N.C.C.

We now have class A, B and C memberships, which are $60, $45 and $20 respectively. The $60 membership protects in states that have no legal recognition.

The field split on the question. A few saw its value and began to take it up at once. Some of THE FIELD held off and waited \"to see.\" Today - some 13 years later - it is an accepted form of technique by the entire field. Few chiropractors but what are for it.The schools split. On one side - THE PSC. On the other side - ALL OTHER schools. Loban became bitterly opposed, and wrote much against this 'form of mixing.' Forster wrote much and said much more against its use. Other schools took much the same attitude, all trying to stem the tide of the new movement, not because the movement was wrong, BUT BECAUSE ONE B.J. PALMER ADVOCATED IT. Today - some 13 years later - Loban writes for Spinography, teaches it, uses it, advocates it. Today - some 13 years later - Forster puts it first in value to detect subluxations. Now comes the Neurocalometer idea. Loban is neither for nor forninst, he is riding both waves, ready to jump either way that proves to be the most popular. Forster will come too on this the same as they did on Spinography. They move upward only as the field forces them to come in.

It is pointed out that free hospital or clinical treatment for veterans must be administered by physicians graduated from the recognized medical schools, and further, all government physicians must pass a civil service examination. The law further provides that the government is prohibited from paying other than recognized medical practitioners for services rendered veterans.

A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE PROFESSION As evidence of the fact that the control of Chiropractic can be in the hands of the profession itself, your attention is called to the fact that the legislature of the State of West Virginia has enacted a law which provides that a Chiropractor to be eligible for examination to practice his profession in the State of West Virginia must be a graduate of a chiropractic school or college recognized by the American Chiropractic Association . Were such laws as this written on the statute books of every state in the Union the profession itself would be in full control of its own destiny. The quality schools would then be assured the support they merit and the unscrupulous could not exist. The A.C.A. being an organization of the profession itself, a democratic organization in which no school can gain control, assures all schools a fair deal and places the profession itself in control. The West Virginia law is but a starter and the degree to which the profession can control its own destiny is limited only by the extent to which it will organize... -\"Westward Ho!\" notes ACA's 1923 convention was held in Chicago, 1924 convention held in Atlantic City (p. 6) -John N.

Second - That I feel it best for any chiropractic organization, that an officer of a school should not hold an executive office.

But realizing that the ACA being a young organization is scarcely able to undertake the financing of such a tremendous and expensive project, I have decided to continue to carry the financial burden myself. Therefore, the ACA is hereby released from its finanical obligations in this fight. It has cost me many thousands of dollars already and will no doubt cost me at least ten thousand dollars more during the coming session of Congress. But since we have already won so closely to victory we must not stop until it is ours. Had the short session of Congress last year been a long one our legal battles would already be over. This year we must not falter at any price. But if we would win to victory we must have the moral support of every Chiropractor. -James N.

I've been accused in this State of being for Basic Science Boards, and my words have been distorted -- twisted -- taken out of context. When you don't answer a man you ballywack him. You lie about it -- yhou haven't got the real answer. The real answer was -- I made that statement before Congress, I said that I had written the Basic Science act in Connecticut. And I did. I wrote it. I wrote it on my own little typewriter. Why? Because there had been a terrific scandal in the eclectic profession and a man had been killed on an operating table and the whole state of Conn. was in furor, and nineteen ?prefectors? in the State demanded some sort ofThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating16 qualifications for all practitioners, and Liberty magazine and Colliers were writing articles about Conn. and when I saw the powers that be they said, \"Now look Doctor, we're supposed to be political leaders in this state but we can't stem this tide. There's got to be some sort of device. The State Chambe of Commerce, Kiwanis Club and all the Civic Clubs were up in arms about it and we were going to get a Basic Science Law. So I said to Mr. Roarback, who was the political boss of the State who was a Chiropractic patient -- I said to him, \"Well, if we have to have the damn thing then let's have a fair one.\" He said, \"Can you write such a bill,\" and I said \"yes.\" And I wrote that bill.

Practically all of the membership of the ACA and probably most of the UCA favored it. Why did it fail? The profession expects an answer, and should be told. Mr. Morris has made a statement on the subject, which seems to make desirable an additional statement from the ACA. All Amalgamation Initiative by ACA How thoroughly committed to amalgamation the ACA and its officers have been is shown by the fact that it has taken the initiative in every move that has been made for it. Dr. Margetts was the originator of the movement. He talked it in chiropractors' meetings all over the country. Then influential chiropractors took it up. Dr. Margetts took a special trip to Omaha, where Mr. Morris was trying a case, to see him and if possible win him to the idea. Mr. Morris Pessimistic on Subject Mr. Morris was pessimistic as to it. He stated the idea of getting the profession together was purely a dream and could never be anything else. Dr. Margetts argued the advantages and asked if he could quote Mr. Morris as favoring amalgamation. The latter said, No, that he had a following in the profession, and he did not want to jeopardize it by being quoted as favoring anything they might not want. He finally consented, it might be stated, that, if the UCA wanted it, it was alright with him. Dr. Margetts told Mr. Morris that Dr. Paul Strand and himself were willing to meet with Mr. Morris and Dr. Lundy, at Milwaukee, some Sunday, to see if something could be planned for submission to the boards and memberships. Mr. Morris was to see Dr. Lundy and have him notify Dr. Margetts . The latter did not hear from them.ACA Convention for IT Next we set apart at our 1926 annual Convention a whole afternoon and evening for amalgamation consideration by the whole profession, and sent special invitations to the UCA officers, and guaranteed an impartial and courteous meeting. None came. Our Convention unanimously selected a committee of seven, giving them power to act in the matter with a like committee to be named by the UCA. UCA Action Evasive A similar resolution was offered in the UCA Convention. After conference by some of the UCA leaders with the mover, it was withdrawn. That resolution, if passed, would probably have resulted in amalgamation. Their Convention left it to their directors, they, in turn, pased it up to Mr. Morris and Dr. Schillig , with no power to do anything except find out all they could about the ACA, for purposes best known to themselves. They allowed about six weeks to elapse before they even advised us of the action of the Convention and directors. Pigeon Holed by the UCA Mr. Morris and Dr. Schillig met with our committee November 9th. We gave them written proposals, which they agreed they would submit at once to the members of their Board, and without delay advise us of their views. More than three months have elapsed and we have no word from them. Why Amalgamation Failed We believe amalgamation has failed because some of the UCA leaders do not want it. Some of the proof: 1.Their repeated procrastination in the matter. 2.Their effecting at their Convention the withdrawal of the amalgamation resolution similiar to that of the ACA appointing a committee with power to act. 3.Their Board, having been given power to act, failin g to meet with the ACA committee, which also had power to act, but instead passing the matter over to a sub-committee composed of Mr. Morris and Dr. Schillig , and withholding from it any power to do anything except find out what they could about their competitor, the ACA.... 1927 (Mar 3): CS Cleveland writes to BJ, notes his \"local\" perspective on efforts to eliminate physio-therapy from chiropractic profession; notes local attitude of DCs is that battles among schools retards passage of chiro legislation; believes state boards (including \"Ellsworth of Oregon or Washington\", Anna Foy of KS, mother-in-law Dr. Ashworth of NE) will pass broad scope laws \"use the whip\" unless straight schools unite under CHB or PSC; believes if this unification of straight schools took place and \"Model Bill\" with standard curriculum were adopted, the osteopaths and medical boards would be less contentious towards chiropractic; notes \"Gruenewald of the Seattle College, and Harring of the Missouri saw the necessity of such an alliance a few months ago....I believe that Palmer, Texas, Eastern, Missouri, Lincoln, Ross, Universal, Seattle, Doughty-Marsh, Standard, Ratledge and this school could agree.

He replied that he would and named Dr. FR Margetts , President of the ACA. When questioned as to proof of his assertion he replied that Dr. Margetts had made such a remark in his private office in the presence of Dr. Frank Elliott and himself and that Dr. Margetts had also made such a remark, privately, to Attorney Fred Hartwell of the CHB, at a Wisconsin Convention. No other proof was offered....Dr. Margetts denied the charges made by Dr. Palmer , and classed the entire affair as nothing more than a dastardly frame-up on the part of the two individuals named, and as an effort on their part to discredit him before the Chiropractic profession.

At the organization meeting some fifteen or sixteen states were represented. Since, we are informed, a number of other states have affiliated. The 1927 meeting of the Congress is to be held at Memphis, Tennessee, on September 8th, 9th and 10th, and in a letter recentlysent to members and past members of the Chiropractic Examining Boards, by Dr. Harry Gallaher , Secretary of the Congress, all such are invited to attend this meeting. Undoubtedly, many matters of importance will be considered. It is the opinion of the officers of the ACA that such a body as the International Congress of Chiropractic Examining Boards can in many ways render invaluable service to the Chiropractic profession.... It seems reasonable to suppose that the members of the International Congress of Chiropractic Examining Boards can do much toward bringing about unity in the Chiropractic profession; unity in Examining Boards; unity in schools; unity in the profession intself and unity of each one with the other. -ICCEB is encouraged by BA Sauer DC to consider license reciprocity among states (pp. 10-11) -Homer G Beatty DC authors \"Done with the Hand\" (p. 19) -(p. 25): Schools Unite In keeping with the spirit to merge forces for greater strength, it is announced that the Eastern Chiropractic Institute and the New York School of Chiropractic have joined forces and are now operating as one.

The outcome was the formation of the Congress of School Heads on Sept. 7, 1927, whose secretary, on Sept. 8th, filed a report on recommendations with the Boards. During this same meeting a committee, composed of Drs. Harry Vedder of the Lincoln College and Bera Smith of Carver College , made further recommendations. Both reports were adopted. The substance of the reports was, 'that 2000 hours with a minimum of three hours per day and not over eight hours per day to be the minimum number of months of three years of six months each.' Unanimously carried. It was later reconsidered and the following addition adopted: \"BE IT RESOLVED: That the International Congr ess classify the major subjects such as Anatomy, Physiology, Histology, Symptomatology, or Diagnosis, Principles of Chiropractic and Chiropractic Art. \"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: That the Congress defer for further investigation by thier School Classification Committee a definite commitment of the number of hours and the sub-classifications under these major subjects. \"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: That the Board of Directors of School Investigation Committee of the Congress be given power to act and instructed to consumate their conclusions at the earliest possible moment. The resolution was adopted unanimously.\" Elementary Bacteriology and Chemistry were added at the Denver meeting, July, 1930.

We cannot forget the many trying times that the developer of our science went through to keep it alive and to bring it to a point where it could stand on its feet. To him we owe more than we can ever repay and to him is due the fact that the Science of Chiropractic is where it is today. He took us through the Dark Ages of the development, but now the time has come when once again the Natural Law must be taken into account and the leader of old must either sit at the council table and consult with the minds of the many or take his place on the side lines and let the march of Progress pass. We need him but we need as much and more the ideas that result from the clear thinking of the interested members of our profession. We must have the cool logic of the best minds and the greatest brains of the entire profession. The dictates of the one, no matter how sincere and honest they may be, can serve no more. No one mind can see and appreciate the wants and needs of the Chiropractic profession. We may need a general to guide and direct us but we need a staff to do the planning. Nature is not a pleasing master and Natural Law is many times cruel, but it is the result of truth and it will prevail. It is not the nicest spectacle to see the old leader of the herd beaten and his leadership taken by a younger and stronger opponent and it is not the most pleasant thought to know that, sooner or later, the old leader must place his mantle on the shoulders of the best minds of the many. It is a fact and facts must be faced....There is nothing the matter with Chiropractic. There is a great deal the matter with Chiropractors. They have never been used to thinking for themselves.

He was probably one of the best known men in Chiropractic and was a brilliant attorney. His death coming only a few months after that of his former partner, Fred H. Hartwell, who was attorney for the CHB, is doubly tragic. Mr. Morris was from Wisconsin and had received signal political honors from the voters of that state. The following article concerning his death is taken from \"The Chicago Tribune\" of September 18, 1928. New York, Sept. 17. - (Special) - Thomas S. Morris, former lieutenant governor of Wisconsin and long a political power in that state, died suddenly of acute indigestion here today. He was sixty years old. The body will be taken back to LaCrosse, Wis., the Morris home, for burial. Mr Morris was long a political associate of United States Senator 'Battling Bob' LaFollette. Twenty-five years ago he was rated as one of the triumvirate with LaFollette which ran Republican politics of the state. He served as speaker of the state senate for two terms, was a member of the state board of university regents at one time and held a number of other state offices. Since his retirement from active politics, some ten years ago, he had devoted himself to the practice of law, being a member at the time of his death of the law firm of Morris, Winter and Holmes of LaCrosse. Among the firm's clients was the Universal Chiropractors' Association . Mr. Morris died at the home of a friend, Joseph P. O'Donnell, on Riverside drive. He is survived by his widow ans seven children 1928: \" Tom Morris Sr., former lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, for the last twenty-five years of his life was general counsel for the Universal Chiropractors' Association.

It is reported that death followed an attack of acute indigestion. Mr. Morris, who was known throughout the Chiropractic profession as \" Tom,\" had been Chief Counsel for the UCA for about twenty-five years, and at the time of his death was also Business Manager of that organization. The sudden passing of Mr. Morris, following but by a few months that of Mr. Hartwell , who at one time was associated with Mr. Morris and who, at the time of his death, was Chief Counsel for the CHB, takes from the Chiropractic ranks two men who grew up with Chiropractic; two men who contributed much towards winning Chiropractic's legal battles, especially during the infancy of the profession. At the age of sixty Mr. Morris' death must be considered as very untimely. Our sincere sympathy is extended to the family of Mr. Morris, his business associates and friends, and those who depended so strongly upon his legal ability. -\"UCA Convention: A UCA Committee has requested that we announce in The Bulletin their annual meeting to be held at San Antonio, Texas, October 26, 27 and 28.

This sad news was flashed to us by wire that day. It came like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Tom was one of the very few real, genuine friends that I have ever had. For twenty years we palled, traveled, chatted, chinned, early and late; here and there. For twenty years we were as brothers. We knew each others intimate secrets. 'Tis a blow to lose one that close. For twenty years we had been close, intimate business friends. Fred Hartwell, Tom Morris and myself were the triange that started to, and did, build The UCA up to its pinnacle. Fred faded out of the picture after many years of faithful service. Tom stayed in The UCA to the very end. He was one of the four best friends Chiropractic ever had. Fred was an other. Tom gave up a glorious future in politics, a future in building up a private law business, to take on the cares, worries, troubles, vicissitudes of travel, to assume the problems of helping Chiropractic to grow and live. He directed the campaigns, assisted and counselled with and helped put Chiropractic where it is. He was the friend to all with whom he counselled and those who counselled with him. He laid aside a great future as a brilliant lawyer, to spend all those talents in favor of Chiropractic. He died in harness on the job.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating24 Circumstances over which seemingly neither he nor I had any control, separated us a few years ago. We were both the victims of false and traitorous friends. He went his way, I went mine. He remained with The UCA. Our friends formed The CHB. Never did my friendship nor loyalty to Tom waver. Never did Tom['s friendship or loyalty to me waver. That which was rooted after twenty years could not be dug up in twenty days. Never have I ever heard of Tom saying an unkind word about his friendship for B.J. Nobody has ever heard me saying aught but the kindest for my friend Tom, whether it be inpublic groups or by private conversation. Ours was a mutual, carrying on, friendship of understanding after twenty years of knowing each other thoroly. Chiropractic could not have been where it is today, had it not been for the first twenty years of The UCA - the result of study and application of that original trio - Fred, Tom and BJ. First Fred passed out of the picture. Now it is Tom gone. Tom devoted the best years of his life working for ChiropracTIC. The ChiropracTOR was a passing issue in the equation to Tom. The TOR was merely a means to an end. TOM never lost sight of the great objective - the right of the sick to get well! Frank Elliott was in New York City at the time of Tom's death, so I wired him to call and convey our sympathies. The next day I received this wire from Frank: \"B.J.

It has a membership of about fifteen hundred , and for some years has, to the extent of its resources, and to an important extent, carried on a program of service, legislative, educational, legal aid, scientific, and in organizing the profession, which service in character answers to all the needs of the profession, so far as they can be supplied, through organization. For six years I have been its President, and during that time almost continuously I have travelled all over the United States, and into Canada, securing members, addressing conventions, delivering public lectures, engaging in legislative contests, rendering assistance in legal matters, carrying on a rather voluminous correspondence, writing articles, etc.....supporting me was the additional conviction that the ACA was also necessary for the proper development of a great drugless group , whose cardinal offering for the health of the peopleThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating25 was Chiropractic , a method which has proved its great merit in, so to speak, countless cases....

Ohio lost its Chiropractic bill by an unfavorable vote in the house. A petition to the people is being again considered. The New York legislature adjourned with no new enactments to change the situation.

Congratulations, Wyoming! ....A handful of practitioners, about forty in the State, the first real legislative attempt, their first Chiropractic State organization less than a year old, and the legislature of the State of Wyoming passes a Chiropractic bill providing for a Chiropractic Board, and this bill is signed by the Governor and becomes a law! Here, too, the ACA was pleased to co-operate. Through our Legislative Department we offered considerable help to the Wyoming State Association. Here, too, Dr. Margetts contributed valuable personal services. In a telegram received from Dr. CH Elliott, President of the State Association, January 12th, he stated: 'Dr. Margetts has been a wonderful help to us.' We later, after the passage of the bill, received thanks for the part played by the ACA.

I still believe in a united profession. But I am not an advocate of amalgamation without regard for the price that is to be paid. The desired goal sought to be attained by amalgamation is being reached by the continuing growth of the ACA. There is one status that is worse than the state of being single, and that is being linked in an unhappy marriage. There is a worse condition for the profession than the existence of competitive organizations, and that is, an amalgamated organization, with amalgamation effected at the price of the loss of the splendid democracy and program of service that has characterized the ACA in the past. -\"Obituary: Harry Rabinovich, D.C.\" (p. 10):Dr. B.A. Sauer, Syracuse, N.Y.

The lectures are of great value to our profession as they are educational and interesting. Chiropractors should inform their patients and friends of these radio talks and should encourage them to write to the station and thank them for their efforts toward the education of the public in a progressive science of healing. If every chiropractor will boost the ACA programs it cannot but help to popularize chiorpractic in the interests of every practitioner. Tune in, doctor, on your radio every Tuesday evening for the ACA program. The American Chiropractic Association has representatives in California at the present time to encourage enrollments for memberships in their organization. The ACA is the largest national organization of chiropractors in existence today and is a good organization, controlled by chiropractors, for chiropractors, no individuals or schoolheads having any supervision over its policies, which are progressive and for the interest and welfare of our profession. That there is need of such organization as the ACA no sensible chiropractor can doubt, as we must have such an organization to assist our general welfare. Every chiropractor should be a member of a national organization. We have several functioning and no doubt each one is doing good work. One of which is the old UCA, which did such valiant work in the past that it is doubtful if chiropractic could have succeeded in many states in maintaining its position had it not been for this organization, as the UCA protected and defended our practitioners who were persecuted by the medical trust. While the writer has the greatest respect for the efforts being made by all the different national organizations, he feels it incumbent upon himself to favor the ACA over and above the other organizations, for the ACA has a more definite progressive plan of organization, is more democratic, has the largest membership and is in a better position to further the progress of our profession. It is to the advantage of every chiropractor to become a member of the ACA and secure the malpractice protection and such other legal help as is given, and also to benefit by the ethical and moral standing that is very naturally the result of the policies of this great organization. Another feature of ACA membership is that one can belong to any other organization of Chiropractors and at the same time become a member in good standing in the ACA by adhering to its rules and regulations.

The students are also getting instruction through visits to the American Museum of Natural History , the New York Public Library reference rooms, and other institutions. Clinic patients under t he new plans, receive their adjustments privately, thus enabling the senior students to apply some of the principles taught in the course on office conduct and practice building. Two additions to the faculty have been made. Dr. George B. Brown will teach gynecology and Dr. Raymond E. Hummel, spinal analysis.

Adelman DC, PhC of Brockton MA announces \"Chiropractic at Harvard\" (p. 27): Dear Dr. Sauer: August 16, 1930 I am enclosing a copy of the first paper ever read before Harvard University on Chiropractic. I have been a student and just completed my third year at the school of Physical Education. On Tuesday, August 12, 1930, in the class of Prescription of Exercises given to us by Mr. Norman Fradd, Director of Hemenway, I delivered the first lecture that was ever given on Chiropractic at Harvard University or, to my knowledge, any recognized University in America. I gave a history of spinal treatment all over the world, for which I owe you thanks; the discovery of Chiropractic in America; I mentioned the twenty-seven cases of blindness cured by Dr. Butler of San Bernadino, California, and I read the enclosed paper which I am sending to you as the first paper on Chiropractic ever read before any University in America. The article on the sunburn was discussed with one of the professors at Harvard and later on I will get the works of an authority who received the Nobel Prize for his work on capillaries and in it he had a description similar to mine, only minus the Chiropractic end of it. I would sometime in the future like to write an article using his experiment, mine, and correlate between the Chiropractic end of it and the uncompleted medical viewpoint. Before I finish I must take my hat off to Mr. Fradd. He is the recognized authority in America on posture and the lecture was received, in fact, recognized by him, with such open-mindedness and with such fairness that it elated me. I take my hat off to him and thank him for the opportunity to allow me to present this subject. The real scientific men have no prejudice against progress. They are open-minded and willing to investigate. The class, comp osed of about fifty students from all parts of America, received the lecture with much applause and very favorable comment. While I feel proud that I was the first to deliver a lecture on Chiropractic at Harvard University, it was more refreshing to realize that the attitude of the world is becoming open-minded towards our theories. There is no more ridicule as in the past, but rather, discussion.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating31 Very truly yours, George N.

The writer is firmly convinced that the National Chiropractic Association is the outstanding National Chiropractic organization and that its past performances and accomplishments entitles this organization to the support of chiropractors of all schools. The National Chiropractic Association , which is the old UCA and ACA amalgamated, has the background of the former usefulness of both named organizations and every chiropractor must admit that both the ACA and the UCA did a great deal for the advancement of Chiropractic. -Wood's hostility toward the ICC is presumably the result of the ICC's ouster of the California BCE -CH Wood says: \"I think the Lifeline program is a very good one, and if the chiropractic profession responds to the efforts of the NCA whichis attempting to put over this important program, the chirpractic profession generally will benefit.\" (p. 10) 1930-34: Lillard T.

Beatty DC, President, NCA CouncilThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating32 of School Deans , to American School of Chiropractic (Hayes collection): American School of Chiropractic 236 East 35th St. New York, N.Y. Attention Dean of School Dear Doctor: The annual meeting of the National Chiropractic Association is at Louisville, Kentucky from July 6th to 10th. At that meeting the Council of School Deans will hold its session the first day, July 6th, in order to make its report to the general assembly in time for any necessary action by that body. Every Chiropractic Educational Institution is a member of the Council of School Deans. The only requirement is that a representative, preferably the Dean or president, attend the Council, but any authorized representative is sufficient. The purpose of the Council is to consider problems of an educational nature and make recommendations to the general assembly of the National Chiropractic Association . A few of the many problems we might consider are: cl oser relationships of all instructors; housing, publicity; tuition; equipment; of students from one school to another; school endowments; new student getting programs; field support; number and location of schools; post graduate courses; research work; statistics. The N.C.A. and every Chiropractor is interested in our school activities and problems because our growth is their growth and our success is their success. They want to help but every one likes to see the fruits of his efforts grow and be of real worth. As we improve our schools they will strengthen their support and benefit will accrue to all. Come to the Council with suggestions and criticisms. Have your material in tangible form. If possible write me the gist of your suggestions as that our work may be arranged to expedite our business. I should also appreciate any other suggestions in regard to the Council Meeting. We have untold possibilities and opportunities ahead of us. We need each others support and co-operation as well as that of the N.C.A. and the entire profession. This Council can mean a great deal to us. Be sure to be there. Sincerely yours, President Council of School Deans P.S.The next issue of the N.C.A. will carry an article along school lines. It might suggest something further to you. H.G.B. PHOTOGRAPH C.O. Watkins, D.C. 1931 (Mar 20): CO Watkins' Montana Chirolite publishes his article, \"Organization\" (pp. 4-5), which suggests The National Chiropractic Association has organized our profession along lines similar to those of the AMA, but only for defense purposes. Much progress has been made in its work, especially during the year which has just passed. A new directory has been published. It is encouraging to note that it is just about double the size of its predecessor, and the number of states affiliated with this national organization has increased from eleven to eighteen....In the widelycirculated dictionary of the Literary Digest the editors had published a very poor description of Chiropractic. The NCA immediately demanded a correction of this definition, and was successful in securing permission to write the description of Chiropractic in all future issues. Also, we find the weekly, \"Time\", publishing favorable comment upon Chiropractic. Evidently they decided that our profession, though not to be feared, deserves respect. We also note that the International Congress of Chiropractic has affiliated with the NCA, thus giving it additional strength. We hope that other state associations will affiliate with the NCA, thus strengthening themselves as well as our national organization... The editor realizes the financial conditoins throughout the state, and would hesitate to ask anyone to spend money unless it were a good investment. However, I am convinced that though you may feel you cannot afford the cost of joining the state and National Associations, you cannot afford to be without their help and protection. You can be a member of the National and State Associations for $10.00 quarterly, and will thereby enjoy the privileges of NCA protection in malpractice suits, the details of which most of you know. It would be a pleasure for me to send your membership aplication to NCA headquarters. Let's let the NCA know that its Montana affiliate is a strong one. Join the Chiropractic Army now! -Watkins also notes that the straight chiropractic community is allied with medical organizations in blocking broad-scope legislation for chiropractic. 1931 (Mar 24): letter to Homer G. Beatty , DC from Stanley Hayes DC (Hayes collection): Dr. H.G. Beatty 1631 Glenarm Place, Denver, Colo. Dear Dr. Beatty: I have your kind letter of the 16th, and am more than pleased to supply, so far as I can, the data your request. I have deferred my answer for a few days in the hope that I might hear from the four schools which have not returned the Bulletin questionnair. But since these have had two letters sent them, followed recently by a registered letter stating that if they did not reply in a few days they would have to be listed as refusing to cooperate, I am convinced that they do not mean to reply. The Bulletin survey reveals that there are now 27 schools in actual operation in the United States. 23 of these have filled out and returned our questionnaire, but two did not state their enrollment. These are both small schools, however, so it does not matter much. The 21 giving their enrollment show a total of 1497 students. Of the four schools failing to rep ly, thre -- the Cleveland Chiropractic College, Kansas City, Mo., The Colvin College , Wichita, Kan., The Ratledge College, Los Angeles, Calif. -- are presumably comparatively smal schools. The other, the Palmer School, would not fill out the questionnair, but sent their catalog and said their enrollment was \"over 300\". By the way, if you happen to know anything about the three schools that have not replied, please let me know. I figure that the total number of students now in our various schools will not miss 2000 much either way. If any of the other four schools reply I will let you have the figures at once. The Council of School Deans should be a fine stabilizing influence in Chiropractic, and I shall be most happy to do anything possible for them. With many thanks for your kindnesses to the Bulletin, and assuring you that to serve you is always a great pleasure, I am, with every good wish, Sincerely yours,... 1931 (May): Journal of the NCA [1(4): includes: -letter to C.R.

Failing in this and with the rank and file of their own little group of followers demanding the entrance of the Progressive Association into the one state organization the Board and CH Wood became very desperate in devising ways of accomplishing the defeat of Chiropractic organizations in California, and were the objects of severe but honest criticism which was printed and circulated to the field by the CCA. Any criticism of Humason was not in any way personal but a denunciation of his acts which were believed to be under direction of the Board and CH Wood . The criticism of the Board and CH Wood was based on the contents of certain letters, statements, and acts of various individuals which, all together, made it appear that a conspiracy existed to do great harm to former Board Members, to certain highly respected and educated individuals (Chiropractors), to certain really Chiropractic Associations and certain of the better Chiropractic Schools. -letter dated Aug 8, 1931 to BCE from Drs.

Yes, the old boy is up to his old tr icks, but believe me, we've got him on the run when he takes the kind of a chance that he has now taken, and we've got a beautiful slap prepared for the next issue of the Journal, one that I think will just about be the straw that breaks the camel's back, so far as the Chiropractic profession and its opinion of B.J. is concerned. We've got some recent stuff that's a knock-out, and we're going to let him have it. Of course we have plenty more on hand anytime he wants it, and we're not going to let up in our efforts until such time as the Chiropractic profession is safe from the danger it has been facing and is at present facing. I am firmly convinced that the tough part is over. Very glad to have your wife's application, which I will submit to the Board for consideration and approval. I assume that she will come under the ruling of man and wife practicing in the same office where both are licensed, which means that membership benefits will be extended to you both merely by payment of dues on your part.

IT brings nothing else to the Chiropractors. It to is an insult to the Chiropractor who is interested in advancing Chiropractic and not in argumentation. The Chiropractors of the United States would be better off if they would refuse such papers and let Uncle Sam carry them back to the publishers who seem to enjoy such trash. The FHN reminds us of a very large whistle on an extremely small engine. From all indications the sponsors of the FHN have been dwarfed. Their following is limited to the few that enjoy mud- slinging. While the other colleges have been winning their way to the respect of the profession. While I do not claim to be an analyst, I believe that the \"Wolf! Wolf!\" cry is no longer feared nor the mud- slinging cared for by the Chiropractic profession (Watkins, 1932a, p. 4) -article entitled \"Some More Growing Pains (p. 7): There seems to be some trouble in the California State Board of Chiropractic Examiners . It seems that two members of the Board are members of one State Ass'n and three belong to the other state organization. It is very obvious that this is the wrong proportion; each Ass'n should be entitled to 2.5 members. As it now exists it is said that when the board was recently canvassed as to the relative uniformity of the climates of California and Florida three members voted for Florida (which, of course, is unusual for a Californian). Sometime ago the International Chiropractic Congress saved Chiropractic in California, and, of course, now it is saved. Even that did not answer their present problem. It seems to us that if they had seven members on the Board, having four from one Ass'n and...No, that wouldn't workThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating35 either.

State association affiliations with the N.C.A. is an important link in that program, and we are very happy to now announce that constructive articles of alliance between the International Chiropractic Congress and the National Chiropractic Association have been signed, sealed and delivered. We reported to you in the post-convention number of the JOURNAL that the International Congress appointed as their committee, Dr. J.E. Slocum, their president, and the N.C.A. appointed as their committee Dr. Lillard T. Marshall, their president; this joint committee to draw up and submit to the Board of Governors of the Congress and the Board of Governors of the N.C.A. for action, a suitable, friendly working agreement between the two bodies. The committee did refer to their respective Boards, article s of alliance between the I.C.C. and the N.C.A. These articles met with the approval of the respective boards, and the President of the I.C.C. and the President of the N.C.A. were then authorized and empowered to affix their signatures to these articles of alliance, each on behalf of his respective organization. Such action was immediately taken by Dr. Slocum and Dr. Marshall, and the two organizations referred to are now enjoying a closer fellowship under an allied working plan, under which more good can be accomplished for Chiropractic and for the Chiropractic profession. There is and always has been a most friendly feeling existing between the I.C.C. and the N.C.A., and the articles of alliance will help each body to still further cooperate with each other.

Notice of intention to move for a new trial has been filed and the final outcome of this case will be watched with much interest by the Chiropractic Profession. -\"News Flashes: New York\" (p. 9): One of the most impressive, inspiring and colossal affairs in the history of Chiropractic was the Annual Get-Together held in Madison Square Garden on Saturday, January 23, 1932. This wonderful meeting was sponsored by the American Bureau of Chiropractic and the New York State Chiropractic Society and there were more than 20,000 reservations made in advance. It is estimated that there were more than 15,000 people in actual attendance. Among the honored guests and speakers were: Lieutenant-Governor Chandler of Kentucky; Father Curran of Brooklyn, New York; Dr. Wm. Werner, President of the A.B.C.; and several others whose names we have not obtained. It was a most brilliant affair and augurs well for the future of Chiropractic in the State of New York. Much credit is due the American Bureau of Chiropractic and the New York \"boys\" for the successful culmination of many months of strenuous effort. The reward is here - It was a huge success! 1932 (Apr): Journal of the International Chiropractic Congress [1(5)] includes: -\"Editorial Comment\" by Loran M. Rogers , D.C. (p. 4): It has been called to our attention that Dr. B.J. Palmer has, in a recent issue of the F.H.N., criticized the I.C.C. JOURNAL for accepting advertising of modalities and adjuncts inorder to gets its message before the profession. It is ducedly inconsistent, to say the least, for B.J. Palmer to criticize others for advertising things other than \"straight Chiropractic\" when HE attempts to SELL such adjuncts as the NCM and such modalities as the BJ-WOC Exerciser to the profession, and particularly and especially when HE accepts strictly medical advertising, such as medicines, drugs and cough syrups over Radio station WOC which first announces that \"this program is coming to you from the Palmer School of Chiropractic Studios in Davenport\" and then comes glowing testimonials as to the efficacy of REM for COUGHS, ARZEN and MISTOL for COLDS, NUJOL for CONSTIPATION, BAYER ASPIRIN for PAIN, etc, among the conglomeration of MIXED and MEDICAL PROGRAMS. Chiropractors are having difficulty explaining to their patients why B.J. Palmer accepts advertising over Station WOC which directly challenges the Chiropractic Principle which HE professes to advocate. We give notice her and now, to all and sundry, that the I.C.C. JOURNAL intends to accept bonafide advertising of every nature which is presented, except that which is directly pro-medical, such as REM, ARZEN, MISTOL, NUJOL, ASPIRIN, etc., which proves that we have a great respect for the principles of CHIROPRACTIC and for DRUGLESS HEALING as against the DRUG METHOD regardless of the BJ-WOC paradox. We also know this is true: The I.C.C. Journal refuses to accept such medical advertising as is being broadcast over WOC right now !-\"Book Reviews\" includes \"The Year Book of Physical and Natural Therapy\" by Sinai Gershanek DC at NYC (p. 4) 1932 (Apr 20): CO Watkins' Montana Chirolite reports that NCA has distributed a questionnaire to the field\" (p. 4): ...1. Do you approve the action of BJ Palmer in dividing the Chiropractic profession? 2. Do you approve the action of anyone working with the Medical Boards against the Chiropractors? 3. Do you approve the action of anyone declaring to the public to the effect that Chiropractors who do not practice as he dictates are incompetent, insincere, and dishonest? 4. Do you approve of a Chiropractic Radio station advertising patent medicines? 5. Do you approve of letting the field decide these questions inhope that such controversies can be ended and their repetition prevented? You are to answer these questions 'yes' or 'no' and sign your name with date. If anyone fails to receive his questionaire, he should write the National Chiropractic Association , 528 Butternut St., Syracuse, NY for a copy as it is desired that all should vote.

Indications are that the Convention will be the finest yet given with an extensive educational program. Dr. A.K. Golden of the NATIONAL COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC will conduct the classes in \"DISLOCATIONS.\" Don't miss the educational treat! Schools, state associations, and prominent Chiropractors will assure good representation. No registration fee will be charged. The only expense will be the transportation and living costs of those attending. In connection with its Convention, the National Chiropractic Association is putting on a splendid contest to boost Chiropractic generally and gain new student material for the schools. The idea is for the various schools to offer scholarships to be awarded to high school students in the state of Michigan. The students of the high schools compete by writing compositions on Chiropractic, the winners to be awarded scholarships. The NATIONAL COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC has donated one eighteen months' scholarship of $650.00 The idea is a splendid one and will be productive of lasting benefit to the schools, the profession, and the public.... -includes message from Wayne F.

C. Woodward, Executive Secretary of the Bureau of Legal Medicine and Legislation of the American Medical Association , is generally given credit throughout the medical profession as the aluthor of what they term the model Basic Science bill, after which all Basic Science legislation is patterned. The Purpose What is openly claimed by the proponents of Basic Science legislation as the purpose for the enactment of such legislation and what the actual purpose may be are two widely separated matters. The open purpose stated by the proponents of such legislation is, to elevate and place upon a single standard of efficiency all who would practice the healing arts. That this is not the true purpose of the bill is plainly revealed by medical authorities themselves. They unquestionably substantiate by their own statements that the true purpose fo the Basic Science law is to eliminate competition to create an allopathic monopoly. ....Dr. Harold Rypens, Secretary of the New York State Board of Medical Examiners, is quoted as stating in discussion of Basic Science legislation, 'It is, of course, preposterous and absurd to substitute an examination for a course of study in a recognized institution....every state that puts in a Basic Science law put it in in order to create a peaceful compromise with the cults'... Dr. Samuel H. Boyer of Duluth, Minnesota, in discussing the Basic Science law in Minnesota, states, 'Our future efforts in Minnesota will be directed toward preventing any legislation legalizing any new or additional cults wishing to establish themselves within our borders. We believe we are in an advantageous position in this respect because of our Basic Science law. ....we find an article....from the Journal of the American Medical Association , wherein it is stated, 'States which have a single medical board to license all candidates have no need of Basic Science Boards....' Dr. C.B. Kelly of Trenton, New Jersey, states, 'Any state that has a composite board does not need a Basic Science law.' ....four out of five members of the Nebraska Basic Science Board, while not actively engaged in the practice of medicine, are closely associated with medical practice and teaching, and surely any examination questions prepared by them would be strictly along medical lines. That the medical profession is con cerned over who shall be appointed on such boards is apparent by the statement credited to Dr. Wm. C. Woodward of the American Medical Association, wherein he says, 'So far as the medical profession in any state is concerned, it should certainly be able to bring enough influence to bear on the Governor to see that the rights of non-sectarian medicine are not infringed in making appointments.' It being necessary to see that medical men's rights or interests are not infringed, would it not likewise appear that drugless practitioners' rights and interests are infringed by appointment of medically-minded individuals as examiners to boards that are to examine medical and non-medical applicants alike? The study of the various Basic Science subjects must naturally be approached differently by members of the different healing professions, in accordance with the difference in teachings and the difference in application of what might be known scientific facts. ....if the Basic Sciences are Basic Sciences , as the medical profession contends, and if all should be equally grounded in them and have the same viewpoint regarding them, why the fear of who should conduct the examination? Likewise, if the medical profession fears to take an examination in the Basic Sciences conducted by anyone other than themselves, haven't members of any other profession an equal right to fear discrimination at the hands of examiners made up of or influenced by physicians? It it is unfair for a Chiropractor or Osteopath to examine a medical practitioners, it is likewise unfair for a medical practitioner to examine an Osteopath or Chiropractor, whose science they are not familiar with....

I tendered my resignation as Executive Secretary to the Board the day after the convention, when the Board voted to move all of the business affairs of the Association into Mr. Holmes' office , taking them away from the Executive Secretary. I had no desire to continue merely as a figure-head and to draw down a salary as such, so therefore immediately did the only honorable thing I knew, and that was to tender my resignation, which the Board accepted, they setting October 1st as the date when same is to be effective. Of course, I'll miss the many activities a nd sorry to have to give up the extensive program that I have worked on for many years, but I just couldn't see it that way so feel that I had no alternative.

An opportunity is afforded the Chiropractic Profession to be among the first professions to submit a Professional Code for approval. If accepted, it will be enforced. The profession can, through mutual accord, do more to improve its invaluable service to humanity and increase its prestige through professional advancement than might otherwise be possible during the course of twenty years. Surely this is an opportunity and a privilege which we must not overlook nor neglect in spite of the many imaginary obstacles and difficulties with which we are faced.

Budden, D.C., N.D. circa 1934-36 : Budden (1951) recalls that: That the private ownership of the institutions in a measure militated against a generous and wholesale upsurge to finance this idea is true and must be taken into account in appraising the situation prevailing at that time. Only an optimist, however, and one quite unfamiliar with the economics of chiropractic schools and colleges would suggest that, by advancing scholastic requirements, more money could be made. The facts being quite the contrary, as we have intimated, the \"school men\" as a group hesitated. Some suggested that while the idea was a good one, the time was not yet. Nevertheless, Dr. E.J. Smith , young graduate of the National College and of Western Reserve University in 1921, gave the first real impetus toward what is now so far developed by establishing a four- year school in Cleveland, Ohio. The Metropolitan College of Chiropractic opened its doors to the first four-year students and the new era had begun. Shortly after this pioneer effort, the National College proclaimed that it would issue certificates of graduation \"cum laude\" to those who successfully negotiated its thirty-two months course. The writer of this article initiated this action and signed as \"Dean\" the first diplomas. It should be stated here, and with no sense of derogation of those who took a leading part in this advance, in the case of the N.C.C. certainly, the fact that a medical board of examiners held sway over chiropractic activities in Illinois, and to some extent in Ohio, tended powerfully to fertilize the soil in which the actual four-year course took root. Almost simultaneously with these events, the new idea appeared in Colorado. The late Homer Beatty , head of the college in Denver and author of the well-known text, \"Anatomical Adjustive Technique,\" now began to raise his voice calling for thirty-six months training. A vigorous advocate of any cause he espoused, the impact of his personality and propaganda soon began to make itself felt. Dr. Beatty, however, was not alone. Associated with him in this crusade were several of the teachers of the school, notably Dr. Niel Bishop, as well as a number of men \"in the field.\" Behind them all, however, and adding powerfully to the growth of the movement, loomed the figure of Professor Jones, dean emeritus of Northwestern University, School of Psychology, and doctor of chiropractic of National College .Now another voice from the far west was added to the growing debate. The pages of the National Journal began to reflect the views of C.O. Watkins of Montana. Logical, incisive persistent \" C.O.\" hammered away at the bulwarks of the short-course school of thought. There can be no doubt that his rapid rise to a leading place in the councils of the NCA brought powerful aid and comfort to the four-year idea. It was, however, to Dr. R.D. Ketchum , of Bend, Oregon, that credit must go for giving final impulse toward definite action by the NCA. The doctor was at that time state delegate for Oregon, and was generally admitted to be one of the most influential and respected members of the then House of Counselors . It was as such that he issued his call to arms. Said he at the close of a short but powerful exhortation, \"We have talked a lot about the four-year course, let us get busy and do something about it. Some time previous to this event, however, a committee appointed by the NCA had been at work attempting to evaluate the status of the schools. The outline of an accreditation system already had emerged. The groundwork was being laid for what was to come. The challenge from the West then was caught up and echoed by this committee and the wheels began to turn. At this point there strode into the forefront of the picture a stalwart figure. Already a leading member of the committee, he now took a commanding position. From that moment on, the incisive logic, the mordant sarcasm, the merciless dialectic, coupled with a calm, rock-like resistance to criticism and opposition that is J.J. Nugent, served as a rallying point in the conflict which suged and eddied around the four-year idea. Powerful aid now also came from members of the Executive Committee. The secretary, Dr. L.M. Rogers , as an executive, long a silent sympthizer, became effectively articulate ont he affirmative side. Drs. Gordon M. Goodfellow , of California, Downs, of Montana, Harriman, of North Dakota; men from Iowa, from Illinois, from Minnesota, from Wisconsin, stood up to be counted for the new day in education. Thus ended phase one. (Budden, 1951). John J. Nugent, D.C.

Rogers DC from Hector Lamont DC (PSC grad) in Wheeling WV (Hayes collection): Dear Doctor Rogers: Following the action of the NCA at the convention in Pittsburgh, I am enclosing herewith my check for five dollars for membership, together with my application which I trust you will find in order. This morning, on looking over the October issue of the Chiropractic Journal, I find several things upon which I wish to offer what I would call constructive criticism and I trust you will accept it as such. On Page 4, the first two editorial articles are unquestionably a tirade against the Palmer School and B.J. Palmer . You know, Doctor Rogers, you are trying to unite Chiropractors throughout the country regardless of what school they graduated from and such editorial articles as this certainly is not helping the policy of the NCA. (I, personally, am a graduate of the Palmer School of February, 1914). I certainly do not agree with Doctor Palmer on many things, but I do not feel that the statements in your editorial article are at all elevating to the science of Chiropractic; and you nor anyone else can deny that B.J. Palmer has done as much, if not more for Chiropractic, than any man living today; and I certainly do hope that in your efforts to unite the Chiropractic profession, you will take into consideration the fact that there are as many, if not more, Palmer School graduates in the United States today as there are graduates from all other schools put together; and that in the future you will use at least a little discretion in writing editorial articles. In reference to the number attending either the NCA convention in Denver of Pittsburgh, or those attending at Davenport, naturally there are conflicting statements, but why bring this up? It does absolutely no good and certainly cannot help but do a great deal of harm as it has a tendency to create still more unrest in the Chiropractic profession. I had been in hopes that after the Pittsburgh convention which I attended and was very much pleased to meet you personally, that let of this useless talk would be left aside and that you would go in for things really worth while in a big way. Who cares how many attended Davenport, Pittsburgh or Denver? Then, under the heading \"Voice of the Profession\" on Page 16, under the sub-heading \"A Basic Technician's report,\" you have what is purported to be a letter written in by one boasting Logan's Basic Technique . Now, I do not have any quarrel with anyone wishing to use Logan's BT or anything else, but it seems to me that -- as you are trying to unite the profession -- why not write up an article giving facts on the so-called Hole-In-One method of adjustment and the use of the Neurocalometer . It seems to me this would be only fair play, and particularly in view of the fact that the NCA is looking for new members and that the Chiropractic Journal is looking for new subscribers, that a few articles on the Hole-In-One, as stated above, or on Spinal Balance as taught at the UCC by Dr. Steinbach , or Dr. DeJarnette 's Sacro- Occipital Technique , would have a tendency to increase your subscriptions and membership of the NCA: Because, you know as well as I that Chiropractors using these methods are naturally interested in different phases of Chiropractic and are naturally going to subscribe to periodicals publishing articles on the subject or brach of Chiropractic that they are particularly interested in. I appreciate the fact that in order to make the Journal self- sustaining, it is necessary to procure considerable advertising; but I certainly do not feel that it is necessary to run Kolar's stuff on Page 25 and Logan's stuff on Page 29 as \"Special\". Why not mark this stuff advertising? It really is and you know it as well as I. No doubt you will recall, I brought this to your attention in Pittsburgh and upon talking to numerous persons at Pittsburgh I found that everyone spoken to was of the same opinion as myself in this regard. I do not knowThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating42 what, if any obligation the NCA is under to these two gentlement but it seems to me that the NCA should be bigger than any one or two people or any clique of people and should be an organization for the good of Chiropractors throughout the country. I assure you that had there been more of a clean-cut open and above-board policy during the past few years, many other Chiropractors (myself included) would have become members long before this time. This letter is rather long and no doubt somewhat rambling but I cannot refrain from expressing my opinion on the above subjects and I trust you will accept it in the same spirit in which it is written. With kindest regards, I am, Very truly yours,. .. 1934 (Oct 4): letter from L.M. Rogers DC to Hector Lamont DC (Hayes collection): Dear Dr. Lamont: This will acknowledge your letter of October 2 enclosing an application for general membership in the National Chiropractic Association . Your application will be submitted to the Board of Directors for their approval, and you will be notified within two weeks of their decision in the matter. I am very happy to welcome you into our large friendly family, and I assure you that it was a real pleasure to get your interesting letter. For the most part I agree heartily with the sentiment expressed. You are right! We are trying to unite the Chiropractic profession. However, we have foudn that it is impossible to unite them so long as we have someone like B.J. Palmer driving the wedge of dissention to prevent National unity. I am, myself, a graduate of the PSC, but I, like thousands of others of his graduates, thoroughly disapprove of his policy of dividing the profession for personal aggrandizement. It may be, as you say, that I should have used a little more discretion in writing about him editorially. However, when one reads the FHN month after month, and sees such ridiculous and far-fetched statements, it is difficult to let them pass without correcting the impressions left. I am, however, almost convinced that it might be the wise thing to ignore his activities completely and go on down the line building for National Chiropractic unity. So far as the \"Voice of the Profession\" page is concerned, you will note that that is a page or pages devoted to letters from the field which discuss many things with which we may or may not agree, and is so stated in the tile above the page. It is an \"Open Forum,\" and we publish the gist of many letters received with which we do not agree. I wish to advise you also that when our present contract with those mentioned runs out, should they desire further advertising, it will be so marked, as the new contract will specifically provide for such. I want you to know that I v alue your opinion very highly and I trust you will see my position in the matter. We are, as you probably know, attempting to please not just one group within the profession, but all of the groups, that it is possible to please, as only in this way can we bring about a National Chiropractic unity. I assure you that I shall be very glad to hear from you at any time. With kindest personal regards and best wishes, I am, Sincerely yours, Dr. L.M.

The officers at the time of its founder were as follows: President, Dr. A.A. Cole, now located at Newark, and licensed in New Jersey; Sec'y, Dr. J. Leslie Jones, now located at Baltimore and licensed in maryland; Treasurer, Dr. John E. Usher, now located at East Orange and licensed in New Jersey; Field Sec'y, Dr. R.C. Hunt, who is still located in New York, but who passed the Maryland Board in 1931. There are 40 active members at present in the association and the officers are: President, Dr. N. Fitzroy Inniss; Sec'y, Dr. E. Murcot Wiltshire; Treasurer and Field Sec'y, Dr. R.C. Hunt. In a letter dated September 29, 1934 and written by Dr. Warren L. Sausser, Secretary of the Chiropractic Council of New York, this Association was informed of its admission to the Council. The three members selected to represent this organization at the Council are - Drs. N. Fitzroy Inniss, E. Murcot Wiltshire and Acman Holland. The Interstate Association is interested in everything Chiropractic, and at all times stands ready to cooperate and work with any cause, which makes for the amelioration of Chiropractic. One dozen members of this association just attended a banquet-dance given by the Constitutional Appeal Committee to aid Dr. Lyndon E. Lee in his great fight for freedom for Chiropractic in New York. It is a pleasure to be able to state that our association was among the first to give check for $25.00 (with a promise of further help) towards this great cause. - Reported by R.C. Hunt, D.C., Field Secretary. -ANGEL and article (p. 47): The Official Emblem The National Chiropractic Association takes great pleasure in presenting to its many members a beautiful reproduction of the official emblem, in hand-hammered silver effect, in the form of an emblem plaque which may be displayed in the Chiropractic offices of its members, as concrete evidence that they are interested in sound professional advancement. NCA members will again have occasion to be proud that they are a part of this strong organization. This organization believes that militant and aggressive action is essential to gain the long-sought goal of equality with other professions of the healing arts. The FIRST step must be Chiropractic Unity - in thought and action! We will then be limited only by our own concept of the possibilities which the future holds for us. The House of Counselors has now made it possible for every chiropractor in the Nation to become a general member with all membership privileges, except legal protection, for only $5.00 per year. This memb ership includes a yearly subscription to The Chiropractic Journal and many other professional benefits. For those who recognize the need for professional protection, it is made available at the lowest rate possible commensurate with the high type of legal service which must be maintained. An application blank is pri nted elsewhere in this issue. Won't YOU join with your colleagues in this far-reaching movement for Chiropractic Unity - for your OWN protection? 1935 (Feb): The Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [4(2)] notes: Appreciates Cooperation of NCA! from Dr. Chas.

Wood , Note: We publish Dr. CH Wood 's letter of appreciation, written on September 14, 1934 so that the profession may not be mislead by the misinformation published in the FHN relative to Dr. Wood's Case. 1935 (Mar 14): letter from Stanley Hayes to L.M. Rogers DC in Webster City IA (Hayes collection): Dear Doctor Rogers: The program committee for the next annual convention of the West Virginia Chiropractors' Society, to be held at Wheeling some time in June, have asked me to present to the convention the facts regarding the advantages of affilaiation with the National Chiropractic Association . Naturally, I will be glad to do this, as I have waited several years for conditions here to ripen to the point where a resolution to affiliate would stand a fair chance of success without at the same time seriously disrupting our state organization. I could have forced a sufficient vote at any one of several past conventions, but to have done so would have been a strategic blunder. Such a premature move would have created a dangerous split in our Society, closed the avenue of conversion to the opposition, and led to a certain rescinding of the business later -- possibly at the very next convention. Thus the last state would have been worse than the first, and the sore spot created would have prevented constructive action for years to come. I have chose to work quietly, not to say insidiously, among the stronger element in the state. It may interest you to know that I have never once mentioned or hinted at affiliation to any of them. I knew that if my part was played right, affiliation would suggest itself to them. Apparently it did, for this program committee, who now start the ball rolling, consists of three men who have led the open opposition in previous conventions and elsewhere. Two of these were formerly strong bj-ites. The other, Dr. Remick, of Wheeling, used to be a member of the ACA, but has been a bitter \"anti\" since the big riot at Cleveland (I believe it was Cleveland) over Benny Sauer etc. some years ago. I am very glad and a little surprised to see that Remick is back in the fold. He went to the Pgh. convention last year, but only as an ardent worker for Logan and the Basic Technic organization, which then chanced to be his reigning obsession. Remick thought I was responsible for Logan's failing to organize a class in this state, and for his general fizzle in the various attempts he made to gain a foothold in this region for his purposes of exploitation. Remick had Logan on the program of our last convention to squirt the old sales spiel under the guise of a \"scientific lecture,\" one of his lieutenants slated for an X-ray lecture, had some private propaganda in circulation, and I am sure he had Tripplett and some of Logan's other Basic Tech . birds lined up to come from nearby states to \"visit\" our convention and help overwhelm the unwary with boundless praise of said technic. Whether Remick was to get a cut-back for all this clever (?) work on the program committee, I don't know, but I thought so then and still think so. At any rate, the stage was beautifully set. In the last monthly circular letter to our Society membership and all other chiropractors in the state, I gave a brief synopsis of the various attractions of the convention, the object being to get out a good attendance, which we did. But in mentioning Logan's part I let fall a phrase which was quite innocent --- so innocent, in fact, that nobody but the Logan crowd noticed it at all --- but which threw the Logan camp into a stampede. I never saw so much squirming about nothing. Remick frothed at the mouth and wrote me a hot letter demanding immediate apology to Logan, and as good as saying that he (Remick) and others would not attend the convention unless such abject and profuse apology was instantly forthcoming. Logan, of course, would never think of coming after such an insult unless all was retracted and Logan's boot well licked. Anyone with the least bit of naivete left in his hide would have concluded from the letter that the whole northern endof the state was in arms, that the convention would be a dead flop, and the state Society shot all to shreds if I did not at once mend matters. I merely reminded Remick that the guilty fle e when no man pursueth, and that if he was foolish enough to let others know the sinister significance he read into that innocent remark they would undoubtedly suspect that he had a guilty conscience, and might get very suspicious of him and Logan. I informed Remick how long he would have to wait for me to furnish him, Logan, or anybody else with an apology for that, and told him politely where he could go while he waited. I promised him grief without end if he attempted to carry out his insinuation that he would make an issue of his peeve at the convention and sow discord. He did not mention it at the convention, and Logan didn't come. The latter, to save his face, wired that he had urgent business in New York, and he was so sorry he could not be with us. Requiescat in pace! Logan, in line with his reputed boast that they would make a subsidiary of the NCA or break it up, had Remick spouting venom against the organization. I asked him at Pittsburgh why he did not belong anymore, and he replied that the NCA was \"too d----d dirty\" for him. Then, to the several who were in the group at the time, he launched forth into a diatribe against said organization in general and about the rough-and-tumble meeting at Cleveland (or wherever it was) in particular. I let him fill the air with anti- NCA propaganda and whisky fumes until he used up about all of his master's voice he could remember just then. At that juncture I told him very plainly that the NCA was too d----d dirty to suit me, too, but that it could never be cleaned by fellow who were soaking their fingers in filth ten times dirtier; and that as long as its membership consisted of weak brothers and sisters who could be seduced by every plausible profiteer and ephemeral adventurer who swooped down upon them there was no hope of making professional conditions any better. I reminded him that the NCA was and always had been the best bet the profession had; that every organization of human beings, from church boards on down (or should one say up?) the line had its portion of Judases and self- seeking exploiters; and that if a man quit an organization as soon as evidence of skullduggery bobbed up, he would belong to nothing and get nowhere. I reminded him further that the NCA had made a splendid effort to get out the financial which bad management had put it in, and that all along the line improvements of all kinds were being made. And, finally, that most of the best and biggest men we have are in the NCA, and if they can't eventually achieve the salvation of our profession through it, then the profession is sunk. I repeat that I am glad to see Remick back, for he is really a good fellow and an earnest worker, I have found his judgment flighty, but it could be worse. The fact that he is on this program committee, which (without even a hint from me) favors NCA affiliation is, I hope and believe, a good sign. At any rate, I believe I can promise you a favorable action at our next convention -- and no backfires later. If you will send me the \"dope\" I will at least do all I can to secure affiliation. Pardon the length and the gossip. I am worse than an old woman when I get started. Sincerely yours,... 1935 (Mar): The Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [4(3)] notes: -\"Steel case reversed!

Drain for the Schools and Drs. WF Crider of Maryland, CO Hunt of California and FO Logic of Michigan for the State Boards. The recommendations as to inclusions, rejections and modifications were incorporated. Visits were made to Chicago and Indianapolis, following the convention, consulting Drs. Schulze , Bader and Golden of the National , and Drs. Vedder , Firth and associates of the Lincoln , thus ironing out more of the scales' faults, and obtaining the general reaction after these groups had time to study copies of the scale. It has not been heretofore mentioned that similar tactics were practiced on the journey to the meeting. Universal of Pittsburgh and Metropolitan of Cleveland were given copies and they forwarded their approval, inprinciple, of the proposal. Dr. BJ Palmer was also contacted with similar intent. However, the astute qualities usually ascribed to him were evidently lacking upon this occasion as he was unwilling to even listen 'to anything that smacked of NCA' - in spite of repeated declarations that the Council of State Examining Boards on the contrary was separate and distinct from any and all other organizations.... The revised draft was completed and forwarded to members of the joint committee. Other incorporations and modifications were listed. However, it was not possible to incorporate all suggestions. It is interesting to note that the schools' opinions were still sharply defined and divergent - while the State Boards were unanimously in favor of higher standards. A synopsis of the Join t Committee's findings is as follows: 1. - It will be necessary to rate schools teaching the orthodox methods and those teaching the more liberal methods in separate categories as regards list of class hours and equipment. 2. - All authorities agree, two thousand sixty-minute hours is the maximum that can be taught in three years of six months. This basis, although somewhat less intent, is used in compiling the scale and setting it as regards to curriculum. 3. - It must be comparable with other professi ons' standards. 4. - The Schools being commercial in character (with very few exceptions) it is necessary to give due consideration to financial stability of the Institutions. 5. - In accordance with the tendency of all state laws, wherever amended, the trend being upward from the three years of six months level, it became obvious the scale minimum for grade A probationary rating must be twenty-four months for the fundamental course and four years of eight months for the liberal course. 6. - In order tha t all schools may have an opportunity to meet the final requirements of fundamental (three years of nine months) and the liberal (four years of nine), one calendar year - until Jan 1, 1937, is given for probationary ratings of all Chiropractic Schools and colleges. 7. - The scale must be so constructed as to include from the minimum of set requirements to the maximum as taught by an Chiropractic school of today. The Council of State Boards will not enter into a discussion of the definition of chiropractic. Suffice it to say that each type of thought is recognized and given opportunities to develop. We, therefore, have divided the schools into two groups - the Basic or Fundamental Schools (teaching only Chiropractic) and the Liberal or Physical Therapy Schools (teaching Chiropractic and Physical Therapy)...

Guy Cheatham ND, DC, dean of the Nashville College of Drugless Therapy (which includes the Nashville College of Neuropathy , the Nashville College of Naturopathy and the Nashville College of Chiropractic ) writes to TF Ratledge , notes his dissatisfaction with Wayne Crider, DC's recent publication of a list of schools recognized by the NCA Council of Examining Boards (Ratledge papers-CCC/KC) 1939 (June 29): letter from Guy Cheatham ND, DC to Wayne F. Crider DC (Ratledge papers, Cleveland Chiropractic College of Kansas City): Doctor Wayne F. Crider Hagerstown, Maryland Dear Dr. Crider: I have your letter of June 23, stating that you are, again, unable to secure any reply fromt he Tennessee Board of Chiropractic Examiners regarding the graduates taking the said Board from Nashville, or other Chiropractic Colleges. Last spring when you gave this same reason as your excuse for not properly accrediting Nashville College, we went to Dr. H.E. Carrick, President of the Board, and secured from him a written statement, as you will recall, of the number of Nashville Graduates that had appeared before the Board and that they had ALL passed and that this college turned out as good or beter graduates as ANY other school. Since that time we have sent three more graduates before the Tennessee Board, ALL of whom passed. Graduates of this college have passed the Examining Boards, and been licensed, in three states --- that you do not get those reports is, from now on, your problem and not ours. It is evident that ALL Examining Boards are NOT in harmony with your policies and are not cooperating with your Council. So far as this college is concerned, you can do whatever your please, we are not going around beseeching Examining Boards to furnish you data, because you have not played fair with us in the past, and we have no assurance that you will in the future. We shall, however, hold you strictly accountable for any statements you may make, and shall hold the Chiropractic Journal, or any other publication accountable for ANYthing it may publish, that in any way reflects on our standing or damages the prestige of Nashville College. This irresponsible writing-up your opinion of schools has gone far enough, Dr. Crider. Other schools can do as they please, but we just aren't going to stand for it. And we believe you will find plenty of other good schools in exactly the same frame of mind. You have started out on the wrong log, and are working contrary to a well established principle of English Law. Before the law, a man is PRESUMED to be innocent, UNTIL he can be PROVED guilty. but you START OUT by assuming that a school is a \"son of gun\" --- unless it happens to stand in with you or some of your buddies --- and then the school extricates itself as best it can. So far as we are concerned, we have done all the extricating we are going to do. From now on, we are going to let you do the extricating. Since you have raise this subject again, I want to call your attention to the inconsistency of your \"Committee.\" You claimed to have DEgraded us, because you couldn't hear from the Tennessee Board, and as you thought all our students were licensed in Tennessee, you said you were not justified in grading us A- 1 --- EVEN THOUGH WE MORE THAN MET ALL YOUR STANDARDS . Alright then, WHY did you fail Texas? They met your standards as to experienced faculty, sufficient equipment to meet yourrequirements --- and with hundreds of graduates in the field --- in MANY states --- certainly you could get reports on them? And with thousands of good chiropractors in the field WHY was Carver College, the Alma Mater of several NCA officers, \"failed\"? Why Ross-O'Neil with one of the best Chiropractic teachers in the U.S., and with graduates in every state in the Union? Why has EVERY school in the state of California failed? And, for that matter, why EVERY school South of the Mason and Dixon Line? Now Dr. Crider, some people still contend, in spite of the unfair things you have done, that you are just a good man gone wrong. Your friends insist you meant well when you started out, but that you got in water over your head and began to flounder, and that you have been influenced by others who did not mean well, etc. Whether you started out meaning to do right, is not for me to say--- in any event, you haven't played square nor been on the level in your analysis. And, it seems to me, you have come to the place where it's time to sit down and take careful inventory of YOURSELF AND of YOUR methods, because something is wrong SOMEWHERE. So long as you were on the Maryland Board, you had a certain amount of authority IN the state of Maryland, but now you are utterly WITHOUT authority ANYwhere, and have, absolutely unauthorized, (at least by anyone with proper authority) pulled off a very damaging high-handed and uncalled piece of business. Then, in an attempt to save your own face, you have tried to lay the fault on the schools you badly damaged and evidently tried to ruin--- which schools were NOT in ANY MANNER bothering YOU, and most of which were in operation when you started practising. Now for just one school to raise a rumpus might indicate that the fault lay with them but for more than HALF THE SCHOOLS in the U.S. to raise up, doesn't look good for you or your fair intentions. No school, worthy of the name, has the slightest intention of standing for this situation. We are merely waiting until they see whether the NCA is going to rectify this, and give you the spanking you deserve, or not. But if the NCA backs your past attitude and conduct, without correcting the injustice you have done, we will immediately have a situation that will NEVER be patched up, and that will ultimately see the end of Chiropractic --- or at least, of the NCA. You can take these remarks for what they are worth. We were once one of the warmest supporters you had --- and worked, tooth and nail, to defend both your INTENTIONS AND your plan. Today, I have lost every bit of confidence I ever had in you, or the fairness of your purpose. Some months ago I asked you to resign, to save the situation from irreparable harm, and you refused, but shortly afterwards the Journal made a half-hearted, almost hidden, apology for your article, and then your Council was dropped from the Directory. So I thought you'd have the good judgement to get out of this thing, but here you are again with one of those sublely irritating and unreasonable demands of yours. Now enough of anything is enough. Besides it seems to me, knowing our frame of mind, and how all we schools --- at which you had already made a deceitful and false dig in your article --- felt --- it seems to me, I say, that you would have had the good judgement to have, at least, left us alone, until we saw what could be patched up at Dallas. Since you haven't, I'm going to tell you, for once and for all --- this college is through with you. You get yourself out of our affairs and leave us alone. If our recognition has to come through you, we don't want it --- we'd rather go free lance than to accept recognition from your hands. I believe you'll find PLENTY of other schools that feel the same way. And since your letter has thoroughly re-aroused my antagonism, I am going to join ANY movement I can find to put a stop to this confounded meddling. Very truly yours, WGC/mh W. Guy Cheatham, N.D., D.C.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating49 1939 (Aug 19): letter to BJ Palmer from TF Ratledge (Ratledge papers, SFCR): Dear B.J.: I attended the meeting called by Carver in Dallas on July 22, 1939, for the purpose of organizing those schools which teach only chiropractic. After several sessions we organized an adoption of motion by Dr. Jacobs of the Eastern College \"that we do now organize ourselfes into the ALLIED CHIROPRACTIC EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS with the idea and purpose of preserving chiropractic in its purity for posterity and that we are reseolved to cooperate with all chiropractic organizations with similar purposes.\" It becomes my duty as Secretary to invite all chiropractic schools who are willing to promulgate chiropractic alone into the association, and as you were not represented at the time of organizing, you are hereby invited and urged to join us and help us to better serve the great cause for which we have, too much, separately strived in the past. It is my personal opinion that whenever and wherever we find a group of men or institutions committing themselves to the task which is also ours, that we may do well to lend them encouragement by our cooperation. The membership, to date, includes Carver, Cleveland , Eastern, O'Neil, Ratledge and Texas, all of whom were personally represented at the time of the organization and the Columbia Institute , N.Y., New York School , Standard School of N.Y., and the University of Chiropractic , Seattle. The issues transcend personalities and though any of us might not have the kindliest feeling toward, or interest in, some of the individuals or institutions so associated, I still believe that it is a step in the right direction and will bear fruit sufficient to compensate the effort which we may severally put into it. Personally, B.J. I would enjoy your association in the work of such an organization and I hope that you do join. May I have your reply as soon as you have had time to give the matter careful consideration. Dr. Weiser of Texas College was elected President of ACEI and Dr. Jacobs of the Eastern Vice President.

Chiropractors alone could say what was chiropractic. Because most chiropractors then practiced only one drugless method, spinal adjustment, they defined chiropractic legally as adjustment of the spine. The great majority of chiropractors now use other drugless methods in addition to spinal adjustment. In some states chiropractors have included these other drugless methods in the legal definition of chiropractic . They can do the same in other states. They can broaden their definition as they have broadened their practice of Chiropractic. Neither a judge of any court, jury, legislature or layman is qualified to say what chiropractic is, except by reference to the chiropractors' own definition. Today, as always, only chiropractors can define chiropractic . \"Chiropractic is what chiropractors practice' recently wrote Dr. CO Watkins, Member, Executive Board, National Chiropractic Association .

A delegation headed by Dr. Walter Sturdy, Vancouver, conferred with Hon. J.L. Ralston, minister of national defense, and Brigadier Meakins, assistant director general of medical services. Following the interview, Dr. Haldeman said Dr. Sturdy and his delegation reported that \"chiropractors could not hope to be better than orderlies under the military medical organization. Hardly Recognized Brig. Meakins told the delegation, Dr. Haldeman said, that in the South African war, even dentists were hardly recognized, but that in the last war they made a large contribution, which was followed by the formation of a dental corps in this war. The idea was conveyed that in the next war chiropractors may have a separate classification,\" Dr. Haldeman said in his report on the interview with the brigadier and Col. Ralston. Dr. Haldeman said the chiropractors were despondent because this feeling on the part of military authorities would not allow them to enter the army in the post to which they were best suited. Instead, they had to enlist as combatants. This was particularly disappointing, the chiropractors stated, because the Dominion is short 300 doctors. In Russia, it was pointed out, chiropractors and medical doctors are placed on a par. -photo of new Canadian organization; caption reads: \"Pictured above are Directors of the recently organized Dominion Chiropractic Council , representing all Provinces in Canada.

The gratitude expressed by chiropractors in the armed forces for this service of the National Chiropractic Association's American Society of Military Chiropractors makes us wish we could write a book to each one of them every day. But that's a project we can all work on a chapter at a time. The Kessler Field (Miss.) 'Wing Talk' recently devoted a couple of sticks of type to Dr. L.G. Harrison of Roanoke Rapids, N.C., who is a Volunteer Officer Candidate at that southern training base. Wing Talk said that Harrison may have thought he had left his profession behind him but such was not the case. The xtory related that 'Men from Bk. 15 come in from the obstacle course, long marches, or athletics and yell for 'Doc\".

Some sixty persons, representing various branches of practice gave their views to the commission at the hearings which lasted all afternoon. The hearings will be resumed tomorrow. The commission, which was directed by the assembly to 'make inquiry into and investigation of a comprehensive plan for examining and licensing all persons seeking to practice any branch of the healing art in this state, and for effective means of preventing unqualified persons from practicing any brach of the healing art in the state,' elected Delegates Stuart B. Campbell, of Wytheville, as its chairman before opening the hearing. Representative of the Medical Society of Virginia and the State Board of Medical Examiners were the first group to be heard at sessions int he Senate Chamber this afternoon. They urged the commission to maintain Virginia's standards designed to protect the public against unqualified practitioners and 'cults.' Need Chiropractic Board Spokesmen for the Virginia Chiropractors' assocition and the National Chiropractors' assocition declared that there was need for a state board of Chiropractic examiners, separate from the present state board of medical examiners. Dr. I.C. Riggin, state health commissioner, declared that no steps should be taken which might lower the protection now afforded by the state. He pointed out that the work of his department depended on the cooperation of qualified doctors, who must make reports on certain dangerous and communicable diseases, and stated that if 'cults' that do not believe in germs are allowed free rein, the public health would suffer. -\"And Thus We Serve\" includes photo of Earl I.

(2) Chiropractic can be established and defended as a separate science only so far as we organize our own clinical research to find our own specific facts and general laws as they apply to chiropractic methods. (3) Regardless of how well chiropractic is substantiated by good basic theory, it does not establish chiropractic as a separate science. (4) It is only through clinical research in which all methods and theories are tested for specific facts that we can ever hope to synthesize chiropractic knowledge and eliminate cultism from chiropractic. To state it another way: Until the chiropractic physician can base his chiropractic practice methods upon specific knowledge obtained through clinical research there will be numerous cults and systems such as are not found in medicine or other organized clinical sciences. If we are to eliminate the cult from chiropractic, practice methods cannot be based upon basic theory anymore than they could be based upon philosophy. (5) The average chiropractic physician is not primarily interested in basic sciences, nor is he qualified to carry on research in them even if it were his responsibility to do so, but, given proper leadership every chiropractor would be able to do clinical research within the scope of his practice. (6) We have neither the specific facts to base our practice methods upon nor the specific facts to give to the public and its agencies. We are continually expecting the public and its agencies to accept chiropractic upon a basis of chiropractic theory or philosophy. The foregoing facts should be thoroughly considered by the leaders of chiropractic. They are the most important consideration of chiropractic organization today . Recently, Mr. Bernard Baruch, a layman, gave a large sum of money to the medical profession to test and find the specific facts concerning chiropractic methods. The fact that it has become necessary for a layman to ask organized medicine to do clinical research upon our methods in order to determine their scientific worth should cause every chiropractic leader who has opposed the development of a scientific organization and the organization of profession-wide clinical research to hang his head in shame. If we will not develop a scientific organization to test our own methods, organized medicine will usurp our privilege. When it discovers a method of value, medical science will adopt it and incorporate it into scientific medical practice. One would think that the mere mention of these facts to chiropractic leaders would be sufficient to persuade them to develop a scientific organization to organize our science. However, these facts have been called to their attention again and again in the past few years with meagre results. Chiropractic government of yesterday was dominated by the philosopher who believed a sound, philosophical argument was sufficient basis for chiropractic methods. Cultism developed and thrived under this leadership. Chiropractic government of today is dominated by those who feel that good, basic theory is sufficient of substantiate chiropractic methods of practice. But recognized sciences base their methods not upon philosophy or theory but upon specific facts demonstrated in practice through clinical research. By its failure to build a scientific organization to organize profession-wide clinical research to scientifically test our methods,chiropractic leadership has throughout the years failed to give chiropractic methods of practice a scientific foundation. The present situation is criti cal, and unless something definite is done to provide an organization such as will establish chiropractic upon a scientific basis, chiropractic as such will soon cease to exist. In such an event, we should not blame medicine for stealing our methods but rather, we must blame our own leaders whose imprudent leadership has failed to provide the scientific organization essential to the development of an organized science of chiropractic. If the publication of this booklet is instrumental in brining about a profession-wide movement demanding that the leaders give this situation their immediate attention, it will have achieved its goal.... What is Chiropractic, Legally Speaking? When we consider this question we find a real chiropractic problem, one which has been created largely by our own imprudent leadership.... There are a number of ironical facts regarding Chiropractic Practice Acts. First, many of our laws were written by legal counsel which specialized in chiropractic legal matters. Yet, the laws written by this specialized counsel have caused more trouble and placed greater legal restriction upon normal chiropractic progress as a science than those written by independent counsel. Second, while Chiropractic Practice Acts are of four different types as far as definition is concerned of which only one type could be considered as approaching the ideal, only the law containing a narrow specific definition has caused much embarrassment to the profession which strives to advance the science. Third, most of the effort to shackle normal chiropractic progress as a science by means of legal barriers has come from \"would-be\" leaders within our own profession. Fourth, while chiropractic is a science and could be well defended as such if it were better organized, chiropractic legal talent has based their defense in the past upon chiropractic as only an art. The plea of \"prior art rights\" is a meaningless gesture in a science since the art is subservient to the science. Further, the science of chiropractic is a separate branch of science today, but because of lack of scientific organization the fact is not as easy to prove as in other better organized sciences. Fifth, although man-made laws have little effect upon the progress of science it should be the first responsibility of our legal counsel to draw up laws and to construct substantial argument which would defend the right of the sciences to progress unmolested without legal barriers. Sixth, the one and only method of making chiropractic readily demonstrable and defensible as a separate science; namely, the organization of the science, has in the past and even today receives scant consideration by chiropractic organization. It is an absolute necessity if chiropractic is to enjoy normal progress and be enabled to fully demonstrate its claim legally as a separate branch of science. Many of the problems which have harassed the chiropractic profession throughout the years have been the result of the bungling of legal matters by our legal counsel. While Osteopathy is little better organized as a science than is chiropractic, its legal matters have not been bungled as have ours. The science of osteopathy has had far fewer legal restrictions placed upon it. What is needed in chiropractic today is legal counsel capable of defending the right of chiropractic scientific progress. Unless this need is met our science can progress only in the face of continued legal harassment. It is the duty of our legal counsel to keep the scientific frontiers of chiropractic free of legal barriers... 1944 (Jan 31): note from Willard W. Percy DC, secretary of the California BCE, indicates (Ratledge papers, CCC/KC): TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: This is to certify that the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners will not accept for examination, any student matriculating after March 31, 1944, that does not have 4,000 certified class hours to his credit. 1944 (July 10): letter from CS Cleveland to T.F. Ratledge, D.C. (Ratledge papers, SFCR): Dear Dr. Ratledge:The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating53 In introducing Chiropractic Corp Bi ll H.R. 4533, Murphy and Nugent and the N.C.A. Board unless they are just stooges\" have shown their Intent and Purpose. They asked that more than 99% of the Chiropractors of America be disqualified to serve as Chiropractors in the Armed Forces. They have overstepped. They have shown their real hand. A Program to Put the Schools out of business raised little objections. NOW they HAVE ASKED CONGRESS to disfranchise 99% of all Chiropractors. Fishbein would not have dared asked for as much, but Murphy and Nugent did. Let's Pull back the Curtain and tell the Chiropractors constantly that Murphy and Nugent asked Congress to disqualify them. Murphy and Nugent are in the Hot Seat NOW. In our opinion the folloiwng sheet puts them over the Fire. They have disqualified themselves for any right to lead. See that every Chiropractor in California and the West Coast gets this Sheet and Do It Now! There is nothing to lose and Everything to Gain. Reprint it there, cutting off bottom lines or we can print it here as it is already set up, if you wish. California Federated Chiropractic Ass'n or Ratledge College could send it out. You possibly need to contact the Chiropractors with some mailing piece. This would show that you were open, alert and active in the interest of Chiropractic and still available to receive their students. Sincerely, C.S. Cleveland P.S. With Murphy and Nugent and the N.C.A. leadership obviously betraying the profession, surely this would be the time to discredit such leadership in California and obtain members in your group. Use this if you wish. Alter if you see fit. Add to or anything but do it. Am investigating vocational training as suggested. 1944 (Aug): The Chirogram [11(4)] includes: (pp. 12): \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\" The Chiropractic profession has been becoming increasingly conscious of the need for unity. This has been exemplified by the nerger of the associations of California into the present harmonious California Chiropractic Association. For the past year the though has been milling around in the minds of the Chiropractors of California, and gradually gaining momentum, that there should be an amalgamation of the schools in the North, and of the schools in the South . The ultimate outcome of which would be one big, progressive institution of learning and research for each end of the State. In any amalgamation there must be some few who will take the \"bull by the horns,\" undertake the preliminary steps, and lay the groundwork to bring about the materialization of the original idea. Therefore, knowing that it was in the interest of Chiropractic and the wish of the profession that such a move be made, Dr. George H. Haynes and Dr. Henry G. Higley, principal stockholders of the Southern California College of Chiropractic , and I have laid such necessary groundwork. Due to lack of time, it has been necessary that a great deal of the preliminary planning be already completed before consulting many in the profession. However, a few of the more active doctors, Drs. Goodfellow, Eacrett, Montenegro, etc., have been told of the plans. The curriculi of the two schools have been carefully scrutinized and it has been found that the students of both schools can be carried through the remainder of their courses with practically no rearrangement of classes, and no delay of the time of graduation. In fact the students will profit by the increased faculty and the combined efforts and facilities of the two schools. The Southern Califor nia College of Chiropractic and the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic have both, in the past, been at a loss to properly accomodate those in the profession who have sought to obtain post graduate instruction. It is part of the plan of the amalgamation to make available to the members of the profession a post-graduate course separate and distinct from the under-graduate school . The graduate course will be a progressive one and will afford an opportunity for research and development of new phases of diagnosis and treatment.While the final arrangements have not been completed, it was felt that the amalgamation would not be endangered by giving out this advance information. Those who are earnestly interested in doing that which is for the best interests of the profession cannot help but support such a program. It has been gratifying to find such a unanimity of thought and desire for the advancement of Chiropractic as manifested by them up to now, complete lack of criticism of opposition to this worthwhile movement. The ultimate goal is, of course, that the Chiropractic institutions shall be owned by the State Association. And it is to this end that everyone is working. It is only a matter of time before the Association will be in a position to consummate such plans. 1945 (Sept): Chirogram [13(5)] includes: -Wilma Dr. York\" (p. 5): Dr. Homer York, Chairman Council on Education California Chiropractic Association Los Angeles, California Dear Dr. York: It is my belief that California should have a college that is acceptable for accrediting by any group or body that sets itself up as capable of such accrediting. And for that reason, on April 8, 1943, the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic made formal application to the National Chiropractic Association for accrediting. I believe that the California Chiropractic Association should be interested in making an impartial survey to ascertain why this college was not accredited. I believe that such a survey would disclose that it is entitled to such recognition. The L.A.C.C. is one of the oldest chiropractic colleges in existence. It has, as near as I can determine through recent investigation, as many students as all of the other chiropractic colleges put together. It is accredited for the education of Veterans of World War II, and was so accredited before World War I. Its scholastic requirement is now 400 hours greater than the N.C.A. standard. It has taught the recently proposed N.C.A. standard of hours since 1920. It is the only chiropractic college of which I know whose buildings were built for that purpose and are now so used exclusively. Its full-time faculty is greater than that of any other college. Its scholastic records are unimpeachable. Its percentage of failures before the California State Board of Examiners is at a minimum. Its faculty are deeply interested in the welfare and education of its students. I give you these facts not to belittle other chiropractic colleges, but to state the cause of the L.A.C.C. I believe that it has not had a fair hearing. I believe that the men who have represented California have not impartially presented facts concerning this college to the N.C.A. And so, I, as a member of the C.C.A. and the N.C.A. ask you, Dr. York, to present this matter to the Board of Directors of the C.C.A., and seek authority to investigate the conclusions of the N.C.A. in regard to this college as well as all other chiropractic colleges that have applied for accrediting, so that a full report may be made to California and I may receive the cooperation I am seeking. I feel sure that a constructive program could be worked out whereby the profession as a whole would benefit.

Hart of LaCrosse, Wisconsin, that she passed away on April 27 in the hospital at LaCrosse. Mrs. Hart, or \"Cele\" as she was familiarly called by most everyone who knew her, was not a chiropractor, but was more intimately associated with its problems than any other lay person in America for nearly thirty years. She started to work for Morris, Hartwell and Holmes in 1918, and became secretary to Hon. Tom Morris , then chief counsel of the old UCA. When the offices of the UCA were moved to LaCrosse, in 1926, Mrs. Hart took charge of the office. In 1928 following the death of Mr. Morris, she was elected secretary, which position she held until the amalgamation of the UCA and ACA in 1930. Since that time Mrs. Hart has served as secretary to Hon. A.T. Holmes, chief counsel of the NCA. During the twenty years she attended conventions of the UCA ad NCA, she learned to know thousands of chiropractors by their first names and many of them will remember her sunny smile and constantly helpful attitude. Hundreds of chiropractors throughout America will truly miss her pleasing personality and inspirational spirit which endeared her to them. 1947 (June 15-17): National Chiropractic Journal for August [17(8): 41- 2] reports: The Oregon Association of Chiropractic Physicians held their annual convention at the Multnomah Hotel in Portland June 15, 16 and 17.

Gilman, DC: CHIROPRACTIC LEADER PASSES AWAY Benjamin F. Gilman, a pioneer chiropractor, a former director of the American Chiropractic Association and president of the New York State Chiropractic Society, Inc., from 1925 to 1931, died recently after a brief illness. Dr. Gilman was a graduate of the Palmer-Gregory Chiropractic School in 1915 and a post-graduate of the New York School of Chiropractic . He practiced in Brooklyn, N.Y., at 23 Flatbush Avenue, for a period of thirty-two years. As president of the New York State Chiropractic Society, Inc., he also served as its legislative representative in Albany battling tirelessly for state recognition of chiropractic, at great personal sacrifice in time and substance. He was also a prolific writer on chiropractic subjects and was well known as a lecturer on subjects relating to organization and legislation. Dr. Gilman was a native of Woodbury, Connecticut, and prior to pursuing his chiorpactic career, was an ordained Methodist minister and at one time pastor of the Sixth Avenue Methodist Church in Brooklyn. He also had held pastorates in Amityville, Hartford Conn., and in Ansonia, Conn. He was a graduate of Drew Theological Seminary, Madison, N.J. To his fellow practitioners h e was best known as \"Dad\" Gilman and his passing was a source of extreme regret to the entire New York profession, who will remember him for his sympathetic understanding, his humaneness, and all of the lovable qualities of a deeply spiritual individual. Surviving are his widow, Mrs. Gladys K. Gilman; a daughter, Mrs. Helen Rencher; a son, Wallace Gilman; and a grandson, William Rencher. - Reported by Dr. S.

Cochrane , 39 South State Street, Chicago, Illinois Dear Dr. Rogers: In the August issue, bottom of page 22, you published the picture of Little Eileen Ohlson, Dr. Sylvia Ashworth and myself with the comment in parenthesis (both past 80). Correction PleaseThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating55 I was born January 19, 1873, which makes me 75. I still practice six days a week, by appointment only, have a good income from practice without working too hard. I love my work, feel good and look in the mirror occasionally to remind myself that I am past 70. A letter from Dr. Sylvia Ashworth states that she got a good laugh out of the Journal saying we were both past 80. Dr. Ashworth was born November 27, 1874, and I was born January 19, 1873, so she is 74 years old and I am 75. It was very remarkable how much benefit Sylvia received attending the convention. 1949: Cleveland College Homecoming is occassion for misquote of John J.

I've been accused in this State of being for Basic Science Boards, and my words have been distorted -- twisted -- taken out of context. When you don't answer a man you ballywack him. You lie about it -- yhou haven't got the real answer. The real answer was -- I made that statement before Congress, I said that I had written the Basic Science act in Connecticut. And I did. I wrote it. I wrote it on my own little typewriter. Why? Because there had been a terrific scandal in the eclectic profession and a man had been killed on an operating table and the whole state of Conn. was in furor, and nineteen ?prefectors? in the State demanded some sort of qualifications for all practitioners, and Liberty magazine and Colliers were writing articles about Conn. and when I saw the powers that be they said, \"Now look Doctor, we're supposed to be political leaders in this state but we can't stem this tide. There's got to be some sort of device. The State Chambe of Commerce, Kiwanis Club and all the Civic Clubs were up in arms about it and we were going to get a Basic Science Law. So I said to Mr. Roarback, who was the political boss of the State who was a Chiropractic patient -- I said to him, \"Well, if we have to have the damn thing then let's have a fair one.\" He said, \"Can you write such a bill,\" and I said \"yes.\" And I wrote that bill. I put it in my pocket and that's the Bill that came out. Yes I wrote thathing -- and I wish that I'd had an opportunity to write every other one of the Basic Science bills too. 1949 (June): ICA International Review of Chiropractic [3(12): 2] includes: WARNING to Chiropractic Students Enroll in schools recognized by International Chiropractors Ass'n.

Will you kindly send a copy of your letter denying that I made that statement at K.C. to the following: Dr. Warren Roepke 201.5 No. Cedar St. Owatonna, Minn. and Dr. Geo F. Kelley Kelly Bldg White Bear Lake, Minn. You might also stat e that Dr. Carl played the wire recording back in the presence of a group and they did not hear any such statement. Haven't much time to write further. Will see you in K.C. first opportunity. Thanks, Yours, John NugentThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating56 1950 (July): National Chiropractic Journal [20(7):8] publishes article by George A. Smyrl of Springfield MA, vice-president of NCA, who suggests: KEEP ACCURATE RECORDS First you must start keeping records which will prove to the world that what you do to your patients causes the improvement in their health. The greatest drawback today is lack of proof behind our claims. Keep exact records of the patients you treat showing the improvements as they take place in the patients body during the time the patient is under your care. \"USE MODERN LITERATURE To help build chiropractic in your state, it is essential that you distribute modern reading matter acceptable to the public of today. We live in a world today where even the worker in every factory is as well, or better, educated then most of the white-collar workers. Some of the workers in factories around my county make from $100 to $125 per week. These people do not believe the ordinary testimonial folders. They want to read something more substantial, something based on facts. When the CHIROPRACTIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION published 350 Nervous and Mental Cases Under Chiropractic Care, I ordered 275 copies and am passing these out to people interested in this type of treatment. This folder has been praised more than any piece of literature I have ever used in my office. This proves that the public wants facts, and the higher educated working class we have today requires that we provide more substantial information as to what the patient can expect from our profession - not what we happened to do on one case of a certain disease, but rather what percentage of cases get well under chiropractic in a certain disease. Good, sound, conservative literature not only attracts people to our profession, but it helps to give them the faith to stay with chiropractic treatment long enough to get results despite the laughter of their friends who tell them to go back to medicine. BROCHURE ON POLIO Recently the CHIROPRACTIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION brought out a folder on polio. It is brief and yet complete on Prevention and Correction of Polio. You can still order this folder and it will bring you a great deal of respect in your community. This is the type of literatuer which can be followed up with HEALTHWAYS Magazine and bring everlasting prestige from you patients and friends. 1950 (Aug): front cover of the Journal of the NCA features Floyd Cregger DC's photo; LM Rogers DC's editorial [20(8): 6] front cover this month honors Dr. Floyd Cregger of Los Angeles, California, president of the NCA Key Member Club. Dr. Cregger is really one of the 'show me boys,' having first seen the light of day in Tipton, Missouri, on July 28, 1900. He received his preliminary education in Missouri and later moved to California where he met and married Peggy Casad in October, 1920 at Merced, California. They have been blessed with three fine children, F. Merton, Alta Reese, and Gary. Dr. Cregger graduated from the Ratledge Chiropractic College in 1925 and will have practiced his profession a quarter of a century this year. He has been eminently successful in his Los Angeles clinic and now has his son, Dr. F. Merton, associated with him. He is the past president of the Los Angeles District Associaton (1935), California Chiropractic Association (1936), NCA State Delegate (1937-1944), Vice-President of the NCA (1946-1947), and Trustee of the CRF since 1948. He has also served for several years as a member of the NCA Committee on Radio Publicity. He has been active in civic and fraternal affairs, serving as District Officer of the Lions International for two years and as District Chairman for four years. He is a veteran of World War I, and a member of the American Legion Post No. 715. Dr. Cregger has always been in the forefront of all progressive movements in the profession and provided an enviable leadership forthe NCA during his terms of office. He sponsored the NCA Key Member Club at Toronto in 1946, was elected president at Omaha in 1947, and has served efficiently since that time. The NCA Key Membership Club is one of the most exclusive organizations in the NCA, since membership is limited to those who have enrolled three or more new members in one year. Its membership now comprises nearly 100 members, all of whom have rendered yeoman service to the NCA. His most charming and capable wife, Peggy, has indeed been a helpmate to him, having served as President of the National Women's Chiropractic Auxiliary (1944-1946), and being still active in the councils of the organization. We acknowledge, with grateful appreciation, the outstanding example of service to the NCA that 'Dr. Floyd' and his wife, Peggy, have given unstintingly to the organization and the profession generally. May his enviable record inspire others to a life of service, which brings its own satisfaction and rewards.

Nugent DC and Raymond Houser DC (p. 19); caption reads: DR. NUGENT AND LT. GOVERNOR KNIGHT OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVE DEGREES On June 9, 1950 at the Greek Theater in Los Angel es' Griffith Park, Dr. John J. Nugent received the degree of Doctor of Humanities conferred by the president of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic . Dr. Nugent has been director of education for the National Chiropractic Association since 1940. Under his guidance and leadership an accrediting agency has been established for the chiropractic profession. This was accomplished by the creation of the National Council on Education of the NCA which now recognizes and approves twelve leading chiropractic colleges of the nation. Lt. Governor Goodwin J. Knight, of California, also received the degree of Doctor of Humanities. Clifford B. Eacrett received the degree of Doctor of Chiropractic Science. 1950 (Sept): the Journal of the NCA (20[9):68] reprints article from the Cleveland College Bulletin: The Truth Will Out! WHAT DR. NUGENT DID NOT SAY AT OUR LAST CLEVELAND COLLEGE HOMECOMING Cleveland College has received letters, telephone calls and wires from chiropractic leaders all over the United States asking this question: Question - Did Dr. Nugent say, at the Cleveland College Homecoming, that chiropractors should be taken off chiropractic examining boards and be replaced by laymen? Answer - Dr. Nugent made no such obviously ridiculous statement. Speech Carefully Reviewed A committee from our alumni officers and the executive board have twice very carefully reviewed Dr. Nugent's transcribed speech in its entirety and nothing, even remotely, resembling such an utterance was made. Cleveland College believes that repeating such a false and slanderous statement is damaging to our profession, our chiropractic laws and our legislative standing. We do not believe that chiropractic leaders should be so partisan and factional in their viewpoints that they would endanger our profession by wilfully spreading lies and malicious gossip to accomplish their own selfish objectives. A Word of Explanation We had believed that such a false and ridiculous statement could not be believed by any rational and clear thinking chiropractor and were reluctant to publish a public denial. HOwever, at the last Missouri convention a few weeks ago we were confronted several times by people who had been told the above statement and believed it. Also, we were told that certain chiropractic leaders were stillThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating57 circulating such a statement. For that reason, we arrived at the conclusion that our past policy of answering individual letters was not sufficient and that a public denial was necessary. Your Law Can Be Jeopardized Please bear in m ind when the above false statement is made by certain leaders, that Dr. Nugent made no such statement. If such a false statement is quoted in your next legislative session and your laws is jeopardized thereby, put the blame on those who concoted and are circulating the false statement, NOT DR. NUGENT. As a school it is our desire to co-operate with both national associations . In our opinion, it is essential that the officers of both national associations sit around the council table and establish a unified program in Washington, D.C., and generally. This cannot be accomplished by engaging in childish personalities, but only by a sincere and honest evaluation of problems and by a co-operative effort by both groups of leaders. Only too often do we listen to eloquent outbursts and 'tear- jerking' appeals for unity by certain chiropractic leaders and then watch them retire to their rooms with their henchmen so they can work out further details of a more effective, factional, smear campaign against the other association and their brother chiropractors. Engendering hate, spreading lies, engaging in personalities, widening the gulf between national leaders can only lead to chaos and failure in national accomplishments. - Cleveland College Bulletin. 1951 Dr. Emmett J.

Your prompt Response to this request will aid my efforts in Washington to effect rulings favorable to our schools. Sincerely.... 1951 (July 6): John J. Nugent DC writes from New Haven CT to (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Doctor:- You have no doubt heard thru Dr. Murphy of the happy outcome of our efforts in Washington to gain fair treament under the Selective Service Act (Senate Bill #1) for students in our schools. The arguments used in presenting our case to the different Senators and to General Hershey's office were presented in the form of a letter and two pamphlets entitled The Chiropractic Profession and Educational Standards for Chiropractic Colleges. The purpose was to give a complete picture of our profession; its history; development; practice; legal, social and economic status; and the level of our education and schools. These pamphlets proved very effective in Washington. They were prepared by me at the express request of General Hershey's Chief of Staff. It was my thought that you might find them not only interesting but valuable in many local circumstances. I am, therefore, sending these pamphlets to you under separate cover. The first thing that will strike the reader's eye is the adoption of the word \"chiropraxis\" as a noun instead of using the adjectival form \"chiropractic\". It is high time, I think, to stop being illiterate. We have been constantly embarrassed in our conferences and correpondence with federal bureaus and educational authorities who cannot understand why we use an adjective as a noun. I would suggest that all of us try to use the correct form of the word in our correspondence and speech and in time its usage will be generally accepted by the profession and the public. It will also be noted that I used a \"broad\" definition in descri bing the practice of chiorpractic in the pamphlet \"The Chiropractic Profession\". Aside from other considerations I was rather compelled to do this because the prime object of the pamphlet was to convince Selective Service and the Congress that chiropractors could fill the void left by the general medical practitioners called into Service. The Osteopaths were rated \"necessary men\" during the last war because they convinced Congress and Selective Service that they did obstetrics, surgery and general practice. We have not yet been able to convince anyone in Washington that a Chiropractic manipulist is a substitute for the general practitioner. Hence the broad definition of practice. As will be observed I have borrowed freely from other writers. Where a trite or nicely turned phrase expressed the exact meaning or color of an idea I used it gratefully. It is my hope that the Executive Board will authorize the printing of these pamphlets to supplement such publications as Chiropractic a Career etc. If that is to be done I shall want to change some of the subject matter and add a few more chapters to fit it for publicThe Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating58 consumption. Any suggestions along this line will be gratefully received. Cordially yours, J.J. Nugent, Director of Education 1951 (Aug): JNCA [21(8)] includes: -photo of Ernest M. Gustafson , D.C. (cover) -L.M. Rogers notes: (p. 6) Our front cover this month honors Dr. Ernest M. Gustafson , one of the pioneer chiropractors of Washington, D.C. Dr. Gustafson was born in Sweden (at an early age, he declares) and came to the United States at the age of twelve. They settled in Minnesota where he received his preliminary education. Being a lover of natural science, he enrolled in the PSC, graduating in June, 1916, with the degrees, D.C., Ph.C. He opened an office on Thomas Circle in Washington, D.C. in August, 1916, where he established a large and influential clientele, and is still engaged in the practice of his profession there. Dr. Gustafson has been an ardent supporter of all movements for the good of the profession. He was a founding member of the Chiropractic Research Foundation and has contributed liberally to its support through the years. Just recently he was among those stalwarts who joined The Century Club, which was founded to assure perpetuation of the aims and ideals of the Chiropractic Research Foundation . He is past vice-president of the National Capital Chiropractic Society, past member of the Executive Board of Directors of the NCA, 1936-40, and is now serving as vice-president of the National Council of Past Executives. Dr. Gustafson is a member of the Washington Board of Trade, a Mason and a Shriner, and served as deacon in the Calvary Baptist Church in Washington for some twenty years. He married Gertrude Fisher, of Washington, D.C., in 1920 and they have been most happily married for lo these thirty yers. His charming and gracious wife has been an ardent and loyal supporter of her husband's profession and was most active in church and club organizations until September, 1939, when she sustained a bad fall which crippled her for life. In spite of her handicap, these two fine personalities are enjoying the autumn of life in the best tradition in their beautiful Rock Creek Park home, which provides every convenience for living life to its fullest in accordance with the laws of God and man. -John J.

Peterson DC from LM Rogers DC (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. Peterson: Pursuant to our previous correspondence and recent telephone conversation, we have decided to make available to all of the accredited colleges on an equal basis the center spread in the Journal of the National Chiropractic Association starting with the January issue, which will go to press on December 10. The center spread is, of course, the most desirable in the entire Journal, and we have always used it for our own purposes in promoting Healthways and other important projects. Since the accredited colleges have, as I understand it, come to the conclusion that they wish to eliminate their competitive advertising in the Journal, we have set up what we believe to be the ideal way to present the accredited colleges to the profession from month to month through the Journal of the National Chiropractic Assocaition, and at a minimum of cost to the colleges - the total cost for the use of the center spread for the entire year - 12 issues - is $2,880.00. If the 14 fully accredited, provisionally approved, and associated colleges each will go along with the project, as I was informed, the cost to each of them will be only $205.00 per year. Further, we willgrant a 5% discount for payment in advance, which will make the cost to each college only $195.00 total for the 12 issues. Should the 8 f ully accredited colleges decide they wish to use this space by themselves, the cost would be $360.00 each per year. We will grant a 5% discount for payment in advance which would make the total cost to each college only $342.00. I trust the fully accredited colleges, as well as the provisionally approved and associated colleges, will go along witht he first proposal, since it will make a much more imposing picture to present to the profession each month. I am depending upon you to write each of the colle ges, as you agreed to, at the very earliest convenience, since we must have the contracts in on or before December 1, as otherwise we will have to make other plans for the use of this space. Is it your understanding that the colleges will not use any space in the Journal other than this, for example in advertising their homecomings, or post graduate courses at specified times during the year if they desire to do so? I would appreciate clarification on this point and the date you plan to contact the colleges listed. I am sending you sufficient copies of the proof of the advertisement under separate cover so that they may know exactly how their ad will look in the proposed new set-up. I think it is important that you contact them at once since I, too, as editor of the Journal, will plan to write tm on the same subject at an early date. Thanking you for your cooperation, and trusting to hear from you at your earliest conventience, I am, Sincerely yours.... 1951 (Nov): Journal of the NCA [21(11)] includes: -photo of Cecil Martin DC (cover) DC's editorial re: Cecil L.

This flank movement is a medium of \"protection\" to the schools rather than a guarantee that they will give the profession a high quality of instruction befitting a professional school. As individuals they have every right to \"protect\" their investment. What more prestige could such an association give them than that which they already enjoyed by being recognized by the ICA? Or is this just a smoke screen behind which they are attempting to hide in their effort to \"accredit their own schools\"; and achieve a measure of respectability equal to that accorded the accrediting agency of the National Chiropractic Association? The question in my mind Vinton is this, why did YOU associate your school with this group which has standards and facilities inferior to yours? I cannot blame some of those schools for some of them will never meet any standards other than their own, and others cannot meet even that. Your school is a non-profit institution. It has the qua lifications of a professional school. It has the following and promise of a permanent Chiropractic College; therefore for you to be associated with schools of lesser stature will not, in my estimation and belief, enhance your position. Perhaps they wanted color, standing and physical equipment to back up their association claims. However, I am thinking Vinton, why did you not seek \"a mail order education\" for your degree? Because, you wanted your degree to mean something after your received your diploma! Likewise, those boys of ours who graduate from our schools would like to have a good diploma which has a meaning behind it. An approval and recognition of a college of their choice -- not a profit bearing institution that may not exist a few years from now. I do not mind telling you that the entire field looks toward the day when, like the medical profession, we will count our schools with sufficient laboratories, staffs and equipment to constitute a profession. Your school with the PSC is among thos e tht will carry on the educational work of the Chiropractic world. As a friend, and as one who has alw3ays spoken to you frankly and from the heart, I say to you, regardless of where the student graduates, Chiropractors at large are tired of divisions and pretense. They want the profession united as chiropractors, their schools operating as educational units, and they as the electors of their destiny. They want control of the situation and the time is not far distant when this will come to pass. When selfishness and profit motives will no longer divide and conquer, when slander and villificaiton will not prevail, and when Chiropractic will enter its own era of UNITY in matters of national importance, instead of personal differences. When that time comes, your school should be among the permanent institutions. So I say again to you Vinton, steer your ship to a straight course regardless of the little vexations. Like Farragut say with earnestness and vigor \"Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead!\" for progress and better Chiropractic world. You have attended the Schools Council long enough now to know that they are trying to pattern their course of accreditation after the recognized schools and colleges of our country. Upon that day our Colleges must have enough standards to be admitted among the various accredited colleges of the country. We MUST have the institutions with the physical equipment and staffs comparable to those colleges that accord degrees of highest merit. All must take their place in this council and with equal standing. I say to you, YOURS can easily be one of those schools! Why not work toward this goal. Do not let us down in our expectations of you. All this is written from the heart and in a most sincere and friendly spirit. I am sincere and interested in you. You are valuable to our profession and its growth. We need fine leadership. Don't let othersuse you to accomplish their own ends to the detriment of your profession. Sincerely,... 1952 (May 8): letter to Carl Jr.on NAACSC stationery from Vinton Logan DC (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. Cleveland: Recently a letter from Selective Service found its way to our Association. I am taking the liberty of suggesting to all of the members that we form the same opinion relative to this matter of students being drafted. I feel that in order to have some degree of surety that our students have fair consideration, that we should request the following: For colleges that do not have one or two years of pre-Chiropractic training, (1)the student, in his last year of high school, must have been in the upper half of his class. (2)the student, in his first year of professional training, must be in the upper half of his class. This might be the answer to deferring our students from the draft. Would appreciate your opinion forwarded to Dr. Paul Parr, so that he may write Selective Service giving our recommendation. The above is my recommendation. Sincerely yours,... 1952 (May 10): letter to Carl Jr.on NAACSC stationery from Vinton Logan DC, who encloses George Hariman's letter of 4/25/52 (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. Cleveland: I am interested in the Chiropractic situation nationally more than ever. I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Dr. Hariman which is for you. Please keep it confidential; you may send it on to your father if you like. The longer I study the national picture, the more I feel that the tendency of the educational director to close Chiropractic colleges, the acceptance of Basic Science Boards, and a few other little items will provide for future trouble. Believe that the N.A.A. of C.S.C. should take upon itself the study of the future of our schools and our profession. Am sorry I will not be in Saint Louis during the coming convention. Hope that it runs smoothly and believe that you and yours are capable of handling the situation.

Cleveland Jr., President\" of CCC/KC on NAACSC stationery from Paul O. Parr DC (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. Cleveland: In this morning's mail I have a note from Mr. W.E. Belleau, a person who specializes in writing up guidance material for higher educational routing of persons seeking careers. I have had quite some correspondence with him directly and about him with Dr. Jacobs, Executive-Secretary of the Wisconsin Association, all of which seems to be favorable. He tells me in a recent letter that he has had replies to his questionnair from all the schools with the exception of Cleveland, California and Ratledge; also, unless he hears from them in the next ten days he will have to omit mentioning them in his booklet. This seems to me like too good an opportunity for free publicity of your school to be missed. I don't see how it could possibly do any harm, and quite probably would do considerable good. It might even result in a booklet that we may be able to use in the Association as one piece of literature. I strongly suggest that you look into this questionnaire, send him data concerning your school, catalog and other informtion and if you have lost the questionnaire, get together general information data and send it to Mr. W.E. Belleau, 4141 West Vliet Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating61 I am sending a copy of this to your Dad so he can do the same for Ratledge.

Shrader DC to T.F. Ratledge DC (Ratledge papers, Cleveland Chiropractic College of Kansas City): Dear Dr. Ratledge, A long while has passed since my leaving Los Angeles, and ninety-nine percent of that time has been devoted toward the building of a practice. I see, though, that the CCA convention is due to begin in a couple of weeks; so I will have to interrupt things long enough to take in a portion of that. Also, Dr. Irwin writes that the Forum will hold a special breakfast meeting at the Ontra Saturday, the 25th. Of course, I shall be on hand for that. Charlie Gorham just the other day sent what he considered to be final drafts of the articles of Incorporation for the Forum. How he ever got them so mixed up I'll never know, but they weren't at all what was wanted. I believe he must have copied them from the copies of the Chiropractic Research Foundation (NCA), which I had passed on to him strictly as consultation material. I took the assorted bits of information an dpieced them into that which you find enclosed; I have sent him one copy and am forwarding you the other. If those attending the Forum at present are still inclined to incorporate (and I certainly hope they are), perhaps this will get the ball rolling. Need for the Forum is even greater now. I have writt en for confirmation of this, to be sure it is accurate information, but I am told that the NCA's Research Foundation is presently inactive. If that is truly the case, then it leaves only the Palmer group as the \"Fountainhead\" of Chiropractic resarch. Perhaps there are others, but if so, I am unaware of it. I was in hopes that some written material would emmanate from the Forum before this. Without it circulating from time to time, people will get the idea that it, too, is a \"dead duck\"; and we went too far forward with it to permit such a thing to happen. What lies on its horizon at the moment? I'll greatly appreciate your returning this draft as soon as possible, for I would like to have it in my possession when I make the junt south on the 22nd. I'll make a point to see you, if you have any free time, that is, before the Forum's meeting on Saturday. Meantime, give my regards to Mrs. Ratledge and Jack. Hope all goes well with you.

First: Any Instructor may at the request of his College extend his academic studies to higher degrees for whatever length of time required and the NCA will pay for his tuition and books for the duration of the studies. They cannot compel anyone to continue until a degree is obtained, but it shall be up to the student to continue his academic accomplishment. Second: The Student Loan Fund will continue to assist the Schools by supplying the Junior Colleges and High Schools with Vocational guidance material and other means to enhance public minds toward Chiropractic study. Third: After the first year when money will be in the treasury - perhaps $100,000. - the Schools will make a request stating their need for equipment, laboratory facilities, student procurement Director - or whatever their special need may be. This rrequest will be given to the investigating committee -- and they will recommend the grant to the corporation Trustees who will approve and allow the grant to the school. Fourth: At the present time there is $45,200.00 available from the money transferred from the profits of the Insurance Company. It was felt that other schools beside the Los Angeles college should have the privilege of school student procurement advantages. This will be given to others upon request. Dr. Higgins stressed that unless something of an emergency nature is done there will be one less school to assist in the future. You of course know what he meant by this statement. I believe the Board will extend to the school of whom he spoke the same aid Los Angeles college received. I am stating these things to you to show how the inner circle operated and may I urge that you to avail yourself of all these plans.The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating64 The opportunity is there to improve the academic standing of your school staff. The assistance to student procurement is now available....and additional equipment will be available in the near future. If there is anything in your mind that I can clarify - or assist you in any way at all - you have but to ask or call upon me. One other thing I speak of with hesitation - I walked up on the the second floor of the school - I wish some money could be spent to tile the floors and paint the walls. The school will be used another year at least as such, - it is not worthy of you and your great efforts inits present state. I hope you will forgive me in this statement but your progress is dear to my heart. The school's standing must be maintained in its present location until the new school is ready. Belive me it was wonderful to be with you and draw upon your enthusiasm and love for the profession which you so freely give to all of us. Our love and appreciation of every kindness and courtesy. Believe me. Sincerely, George George E. Hariman, D.C. 1959 (July 17): letter to GE Hariman DC from Joseph Janse DC, ND, president of the NCC (Hariman file): Dr. George E. Hariman 2002 University Avenue Grand Forks, North Dakota Dear Dr. Hariman: Your confidential communication of the 15th was read with a deep sense of appreciation and awareness. W are more than sncerely grateful. It enables us to interpret the disposition of the administrative body of F.A.C.E. as well as the executive family. We want nothing but the best and the most honorable for everyone concerned. We sincerely feel that the great confidence exhibited by the House of Delegates and the membership of the N.C.A. in setting up a program whereby the accredited colleges will be subsidized must be surrounded by integrity and understanding on the part of each and everyone of us. I know, as you know, that there are differences of opinion as to who should administer the monies and I believe that only by virtue of great wisdom will it be possible to set up mechanisms of administration and distribution that will be fair and equitable to everyone. Our position as a college has been just a little difficult because it is belived by some that inasmuch as we are better off than others we should not necessarily expect as much consideration or assistance. May I hope that you will treat this letter as personal and confidential. All I want you to know is that we shall always seek to do the honest and the honorable thing. It is helpful to know how you good people feel and I want to assure you personally that this trust that you have extended us will not be abused. Thank you for a ll that you have done for us; for your participation during the ground-breaking affairs.

You see, I have had more than a speaking acquaintance with Chirorpactic - as you know -, and I cannot think of anyone, now living, who has taught Chiropractic LONGER than you have. If that does not make you THE Top Brass, what does? My memory of you goes back to the days when you first started the Ratledge College . And I have had the pleasure of knowing some of those early students of yours - some of the best chiropractors we ever had-, and I never knew any of them that did not have that something special in them that made REAl chiropractors. You will leave a heritage with the Chiropractic profession that will never be forgotten. You perhaps do not know it, but there are those of us of the Chiropractic profession who know you and love you and consider you as THE Top Brass. Your name and contributions to our science will go down in history as one of our immortals. God Bless You! Sincerely, C. Sterling Cooley 1963 (Jan 19): letter to Stanley Hayes DC from J. Lewis Fenner DC, PhC in Brooklyn; attached is a copy of the Bulletin of the Research Bureau, American Chiropractic Association 1924; 1[2] (Hayes collection): Dear Doctor: ...Congratulations on reaching 72! I can remember so well when I was 'only' 72! I will round out 84 years next week, but I have five years yet to go to match my grandfather (one of my aunts reached 93) so I can afford to be chipper and brag about it a little - or can I?I quote from my letter of 17th to Dr. Cooley on receipt of the January magazine: 'I find particular interest in the broad principles that are developed by Thure C. Peterson , Stanley Hayes , Bill Brown and others'. And I well remember your activities in chiropractic circles and your writings on it in earlier years. You are always a staunch advocate. I am sorry not to be able to answer your question about Methods and Apparatus and perhaps the best way to tell you why is to recite some of the tiresome history that preceded the time you mention. You will perhaps remember the agitation I carried on in the UCC and National, Ross Journals when I was Secretary-Treasurer of The New York State Chiropractic Society against the abuses perpetrated on the profession by the UCA, then monopolizing the nation organizationally. I did not seek any such thing, but the upshot of it was my own motion to organize a body \" free from any school domination \" which became the ACA with me the first secretary. You will perhaps remember that it became necessary for Dr. John P. Phillips to resign and find himself another job when the ACA sponsors failed to finance their creation, with the result that I was made the chief executive, our lease were cancelled, the office was dumped into my Brooklyn office, whence I managed, as best I could, the bawling infant for two more years. You may remember that about that time one of the recent graduates of the National school [ Frank R. Margetts LLB, DC ] was making quite a noise orating at homecomings and since Phillips had been a graduate of the UCC, and so was I, it seemed to me that this National man might redress the balance and I, myself, secured his nomination and election to the office of president, he accepting it on the express stipulatin that it cost him no money and did not interfere with a practice he was setting up in Denver! The convention at the end of his first year bared the fact that he [Margetts ]did not know I had been made officially the executive officer and that the feelings that I had felt for him were due to the fact that some of his orders as president had not been carried out according to his wishes. The misunderstanding was his, not mine, but he had already picked out another as his candidate for secretary thought he did not get him elected. However, he had made up his mind and shortly after he called an executive meeting at which he demanded my ouster, threatening to resign himself if I di not get out. You are entitled to believe that the ACA would have died there and then if he had got out instead of me, but by that time he had given up his office and was giving his full time to the ACA under a guarantee by the UCC and the National school and a majority of the directors were in favor of his retention and I resigned. I never had anything to do with the ACA after that and I was far from the scene of action when the ACA was amalgamated with the UCA . I do not suppose a list of what I consider to be the important events of our professional history will have any special validity, but I think second only to the foundation of the practice by D.D. Palmer , the organization of the ACA is equal to any other. We insisted on making it \"Straight\" and most of the founders would be shamed by the scope the present successor of it has taken. It did not unify the profession - was not int ended to - but it was an important and necessary step in that direction - and the perfection of it awaits our attention - and with what urgency! If you care to submit a list of questions as suggested in your letter, I shall be glad to answer what I can, but I have no inside knowledge of the ACA -NCA after 1924. If I were not a better chiropractor than I am a typist, I don't think I would still \"be in the business\" - but that isn't saying much. Please excuse the appearance of this letter - and accept my congratulations and good wishes - and my sincere thanks for your letter. Very truly yours,... 1963 (Mar 9): letter to Stanley Hayes from J. Lewis Fenner DC of Brooklyn (Hayes collection): Dear Dr. Hayes,The Social Origins & Early History of the National Chiropractic Association Keating66 You did even better than you knew. You sent me TWO copies of the February Bulletin; so perhaps you'd better double-check. Of course I shall be glad to do anything I can to set the record straight about the early history in which I participated, though I'm anything but an historian. My records are scattered and much of what appeared in then current journals is not availble to me. If you can get a file of the U.C.C. Bulletins, National School \"Progressives\" and Ross School Journals for 1919-20-21-22 you will read something of the struggles to get the ACA organized. I was one of the Directors of the Ill-fated Federation of Chiropractors which blossomed and folded in those years and wrote for these journals. Yes, I graduated from the UCC in February, 1912, helped to organize the New York Chiropractic Association in that year. Was the founder and first editor of 'The Messenger of the New York State Chiropractic Society, Inc.', successor to the NYCA, served as its Secretary-treasurer for half a dozen years or more and became the chief factotem and master of ceremonies in the organiztion of The ACA on September 21- 22, 1922, and ran the thing substantially alone for two years. Now, I think I have answered your questions and before going any further, I think I should await your further suggestions. I am enthusiastic about your activity and I think it may be crucial in these life or death times. Glad, indeed, you like my 'Basis'. Very truly yours,... 1963 (Apr 26): Governor Nelson Rockefeller signs a Chiropractic Act into law in New York (Goldschmidt letter, 1/20/92) 1963 (June): Digest of Chiropractic Economics publishes: -\"American Chiropractic Association : the ICA Position\" (p. 8) The attack against the principle, the straight chiropractor and ICA has been a possessing goal of certain NCA officials for decades. Even the newest ruse, romantically called the American Chiropractic Association , is not new.... Selected NCA strategists and a quintent of defecting ICA Board members, under the false guise of unity, will try to lure unsuspecting ICA members into a trap. This trap is the American Chiropractic Association, a trap that is scheduled to be closed within 90 days through absorption of these doctors as second class citizens into the NCA. The five defectors gave up their positions of trust as members of the ICA Board of Control to become membership chairmen for the NCA through the \"puppet state\" ACA. The fact is that even the NCA Executive Board does not have much confidence in this unholy marriage, as evidenced by its demand for a dowry of 1,500 members to be put up within 90 days before the marriage is consummated...Such doctors will soon realize the truth, that the ACA is part of the NCA \"master plan\" to divide and conquer, to destroy the ICA, to weaken the Chiropractic principle, and to gain membership and control of the profession. 1963 (June 19): National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) is founded (Goldschmidt letter, 1/20/92) 1963 (Sept): Frank W.

That fateful moment is now history. The case went to trial March 22 and ran three days. The use fulness of chiropractic was the central issue in the case. The corollary issue of equal importance was whether or not the requirement, that chiropractors possess a diploma from an accredited medical school teaching materia medica, theory and practice of medicine and surgery, and successfully stand an examination in these subjects was constitutionally permissible, as a condition precedent to allowing chiropractors to practice in Louisiana. The England case involves a constitutional attack against the Louisiana statute making such a requirement necessary... Dr. Janse was our chief witness and occupied the stand most of Monday....Accreditation of colleges prompted several questions. Etiology, diagnosis and treatment of most every disease problem came into the picture. Specific emphasis was placed on infectious and fatal disease processes, particularly those of great notoriety and fear- instilling quality, e.g., tetanus, polio, typhoid, cancer, etc. The subject of immunization was not ignored. Dr. Janse maintained his composure, forthrightness and dignity. We think his testimony was indeed an outstanding contribution. Let me say parenthetically; the allopath who advised and oriented defense counsel throughout the trial has represented the Medical Society at the legislature for the past ten years. In preparing himself to oppose the chiropractic bills he has accumulated a library representative of most of the authors of books on chiropractic printed during the past thirty years. He gets both national journals and keeps up to date. He is astute, capable, and not intellectually dishonest. He was thoroughly prepared for his part in this trial... When Mr. Simon learned at the pretrial conference tht the book, Anything Can Cause Anything, by Dr. W.D. Harper of the Texas College , would be used by the defense he called Dr. Harper and asked him to be present at the trial... The case concluded with his [Harper's] testimony. Mr. Simon described Dr. Harper's presentation as being the most dramatic court toom scene he had ever witnessed.... (p. 13, 44) -Herman S.

He died peacefully in his sleep on Tuesday, 6:30 a.m. April 13, surrounded by his beloved wife Frances and his family. The last months of his lingering illness were marked by a calm stoicism and courage, typical of his entire life. The measure of the man was made manifest by the tremendous outpouring of friends, acquaintances and those in high office in Labor and Government who came to pay tribute to a man whom they respected and held in great affection and esteem. May his beloved wife Frances find solace in the memory of a man beloved by all and who stands resplendent before his Maker in the good he did in life. The victories he won on behalf of chiropactic are legion. Chiropractic has lost a great champion. His passing doth indeed diminish us all, for none can replace him in his ardor, love and accomplishment in behalf of a profession that was part of his very fiber for some forty years. The thousands of chiropractors who passed through Washington in the course of his service to chiropractic shall always remember the open door and warm hospitality of his home. The myriad chiropractors who sought and received his professional advice and help shall never forget him. May the legacy of his undaunted courage spur us onward in his name toward the realization of all those objectives for which he gave so much and dreamed so ardently to attain. That would be our greatest memorial to one of the truly greats of chiropractic. -photo of Clarence Weiant (p. 39) and (pp. 39-40): NEW YORK Chiropractic Institute of N.Y.

Clark The Alumni Association of the Chi ropractic Institute of New York and its auxiliary honored the memory of one of the giants in chiropractic on Sunday, March 14, 1965. The first Benjamin A. Sauer Memorial lecture was delivered by Dr. C. Wolsey Weiant whose subject was \"Progress in Chiropractic.\" Dr. Weiant's lecture dealt with the increased recognition accorded chiropractic in scientific circles and stressed the necessity of enlarging our vision and activity in communicating the importance of basic princciples in chiropractic to men of education and science. Dr. Benjamin A. Sauer was one of several loyal individuals who contributed outstanding services to the profession, particularly in connection with legislative representation at the state capitol in Albany, N.Y., where he was active for more than a quarter of a century. He also served as executive secretary of the National Chiropractic Association and was honored by being awarded the only life membership in that organization. In the latter part of his life, Dr. Sauer became actively as sociated with the Republican Party in New York, served as a member of the Common Council of the City of Syracuse and at the time of his death was Majority Leader. Dr. Sauer passed away in 1959. Dr. Charles H. Clark served with great distinction in chiropractic organizations, notably as the state president of the Federation of Chiropractors of New York, Inc. and on many committees both in the state and district associations. He was a minister in the Church of God and executive secretary of the General Assembly of the Church of God in the Northeast. He passed away on October 19, 1964. Tablets in bronze on the Memorial Plaque at the Institute will always recall the outstanding services rendered by these two fine chiropractors in advancing the objectives of the chiropractic profession in the state and nation. The Dedicatory Address was rendered by Dr. Sol Goldschmidt, Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Institute. Dr. Joseph R. Mernick, Alumni Association President, presided. - Dr. Sol Goldschmidt, D.C.

The ACA board of governors authorized the establishment of a library last year to satisfy the needs of the profession for a centrally located source of pertinent chiropractic information.

Elliott, D.C. of Denver: Dear Editor: Finally I have found time in my new capacity as the executive secretary-treasurer of our state association to read the October 1967 issue of the Journal. Let me congratulate you on that issue...It is the best one that has appeared in print since I graduated in 1911! \"World Chiropractic Conference Report\"; 'Validity of Chiropractic Therapy Clearly Established'; and then the scholarly paper 'The Science of Chiropractic' by R.W. Hildebrandt , D.C. If the schools will unite and agree to Dr. Hildebrandt 's methodology and the ACA and ICA get behind it, there is yet hope that chiropractic can be accepted by HEW and if the general membership of of both associations let the colleges do the job along the lines that Dr. Hildebrandt outlined, we will be doing what D.D. Palmer said to me in 1911 when he lived next door to me in Los Angeles. I did not take much stock in what he said then as I was prejudiced by my close connection with B.J. and Mabel Palmer (She was my cousin). However, since being in the field, and having taken two semesters of general semantics at Denver University, I heartily agree with Dr. Hildebrandt and sincerely hope that something useful will develop. I wrote Dr. Rutherford sometime ago that he should make a move to adopt a proper scope and definition. We can afford two associations, but we cannot afford two different 'so-called definitions and scopes of practice.' There is now a pattern no one dares to deny as defining our position in the scientific field. Wishing you good luck in steering our good ship Chiro through to a successful triumph. Frank W.
