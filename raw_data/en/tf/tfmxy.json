Born in Los Angeles, the future trumpeter came of age in a house filled with music. At the age of eight, he was drawn to the trumpet in a music appreciation class in his elementary school. \"I was very fortunate that I had that exposure to music and was encouraged to stick with it. Years ago, when the arts programs were cut out of our public schools, so many kids stopped having that kind of opportunity.\" A legendary trumpet player, Alpert's extraordinary musicianship has earned him five #1 hits, nine GRAMMY\u00ae Awards, the latest from his 2014 album, \"Steppin' Out,\" fifteen Gold albums, fourteen Platinum albums and has sold over 72 million records. Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass propelled his sound into the pop music limelight, at one point outselling the Beatles two to one. In 1966, they achieved the since-unmatched feat of simultaneously having four albums in the Top 10- and five in the Top 20. Herb Alpert also has the distinction of being the only artist who has had a #1 instrumental and vocal single. "}
