Everything is connected, and everything is energy. Manifestation and energy healing involve working within this sea of energy to establish harmony and create positive change. That's why crystals - which vibrate with specific harmonizing frequencies - are extremely useful (and delightful!) tools for healing and manifestation. But how exactly does one employ crystals for healing and manifestation? In addition to being awake to which crystals naturally call to you and consulting books about their metaphysical properties ( [this is one of my favorites](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962819034/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0962819034&linkId=017dcfc890066e53069e1d83ca204536) and [this is another one of my favorites](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738732524/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0738732524&linkId=13dbd83228c2b63f986d155dc3143b54)), here are 10 practical, effective, and fun ways to use crystals in your spiritual and metaphysical work. 1. Keep a crystal with you throughout the day. First, [choose a crystal according to the type of healing or vibration-shifting you desire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962819034/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0962819034&linkId=4003f4cc06d3f0abad0e1316616c5e78). Next, cleanse it in cold running water, sea salt, [sage smoke](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OP6WU/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0012OP6WU&linkId=957c0b1b7bb99e8359e55482a30e06d1), and/or sunlight. Then hold it in both hands and bring to mind the feelings and conditions you'd like it to help bring into your life. Feel as if they're already present for you, and inwardly thank the crystal for supporting you in experiencing them. (This is a way of programing the crystal with your intention.) Then keep the crystal in your pocket, or in [a pouch around your neck](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q2W358R/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07Q2W358R&linkId=68785abdee79327d21fd931b641a4bab), each day until you feel you've adopted its vibration into your energy field. Be sure to cleanse it and re-empower it every few days. 2. Sleep with a crystal at night. My life has changed since I began sleeping with [a black tourmaline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C4WHW7K/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01C4WHW7K&linkId=7a4785ec5b5171e32b06b23b0be15dcf) in my hand. I can literally feel it relaxing me deeply while absorbing and neutralizing frenetic energies from wi-fi and electronics. Of course, [ there are many other crystals that help balance and harmonize you while you sleep.](https://tesswhitehurst.com/9-crystals-that-help-you-sleep/) 3. Place a crystal in an area or room. Let's say you want to create a very clear and organized vibe in your office. In this case, placing a cleansed fluorite on your desk would be an excellent idea. [A citrine quartz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GQK3GM/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B002GQK3GM&linkId=2b9ccd0e4311bdcc00628b0aafcf7a1a) in a retail store can help maximize the vibrations of wealth and happiness, and [an amethyst cluster](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007C31JSU/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B007C31JSU&linkId=3224eeff0c8ffeae0bb9f52565c79565) can bring a soothing spiritual vibration to any room. Bonus: beauty! When placed artfully, a crystal can obviously enhance the aesthetic of a room. 4. Place a crystal on top of a written intention or list of goals. When you write your intentions or goals in the present tense, as if they're already true (e.g. \"I am vibrantly healthy and strong\"), you can cleanse and empower [a clear quartz point](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07895RNHY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07895RNHY&linkId=4daa2d6a137ce3be3ce2365c76fc0c49) (or another crystal that matches the energy of your goal) in bright sunlight, and then place it on top of the folded intention(s) or goals(s). An altar would be a great place for this, or choose somewhere else that feels right. When you place a crystal on an intention or list of goals, the crystal acts as a battery and channel to clearly hold that intention and direct it toward its most ideal manifestation. 5. Cleanse your personal energy with a crystal (or crystals). [A selenite wand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5GUU7F/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N5GUU7F&linkId=c5fd6c6841797efc270922f2222f6804) is an excellent crystal tools for removing negativity from your personal energy field. Think of it like a lint brush that snags challenging patterns or energies, pulls them out of your field, and instantly neutralizes and dissolves them. Simply move [a selenite wand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5GUU7F/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N5GUU7F&linkId=c5fd6c6841797efc270922f2222f6804) around your body, a foot or so away from your skin, as if you are brushing your aura like a linty suit. Another way to cleanse with crystals is to hold a black crystal, such as a [tourmaline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C4YQQKC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01C4YQQKC&linkId=9ee3117541059fbe068337b3a9a33b0a) or [obsidian](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KL0F5GS/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KL0F5GS&linkId=5eb114655f6ce59cc369d267ae90722b), and to consciously direct any harsh, excessive, or unhealthy vibrations into it. Afterwards, set the crystal in the sunlight to evaporate and neutralize what it has absorbed. 6. Put gem elixirs (or crystal essences) in your drinking water. [A gem elixir](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWYNX2Y/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01LWYNX2Y&linkId=6970cbd5a287b74fb3a7fa7cae4899d2) doesn't contain any part of an actual crystal, but rather the vibration of a crystal. This vibration is preserved in water and something that keeps the vibration viable: often brandy. When you put a couple of drops of a gem elixir in your drinking water, you bring the crystal's vibration into your own personal vibration, which - while subtle and gradual - can shift things very powerfully. [Alaskan Essences is the most popular brand for gem elixirs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M0JJUWK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01M0JJUWK&linkId=5b23d9ef0c1fd06ff1d77605c6dfabc5), and I have had great success with their products. 7. Make a crystal grid. If you have a number of crystals in your collection, [creating a crystal grid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578636426/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1578636426&linkId=afaf93e56096bba979b9dda4e6c56890) can be a powerful act. Simply putting in the effort begins to shift vibrations, which reverberate back to you in the form of positive change. But added benefits of creating a crystal grid include the creative aspect, which instantly opens you up to divine energy, as well as the vibrational properties of the crystals themselves. [The sacred geometrical shape](https://tesswhitehurst.com/5-essential-sacred-geometrical-shapes-how-to-employ-them/) of the grid also adds its considerable power to the mix. 8. Use a crystal point as a wand to direct energy. Try using a crystal ( [like this moonstone wand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076HCMTM8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B076HCMTM8&linkId=32ab983eda62eed44c33162fea4f0865)) to direct divine energy and healing. Here's how: first, consciously connect with the energy at the core of the earth coming up through your feet and tailbone, as well as the energy of the cosmos coming down through the crown of your head. While holding the crystal in your right hand, feel this Universal energy flowing through your crown and feet, into your heart, down through your arm, and out through the crystal. You can direct energy in this way [to cast a magical circle](https://tesswhitehurst.com/how-to-cast-a-circle/), to empower an object with magic and positivity, to activate energy, or to send someone healing energy. 9. Bury crystals to empower a property or create a protective boundary. To empower a property with positivity or to create a protective boundary around a space, bury [ a quartz crystal point](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NOE3G64/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00NOE3G64&linkId=6e89a294155d0fd0bcdd5b35008c93c3) at each of the four corners of the lot. In this case, a substantially sized crystal is best. Be sure to cleanse each crystal in bright sunlight first, and to empower it with your intention to increase positivity and create a protective aura around the space. Then bury each crystal, point side up. 10. Use a crystal to heal, open, or activate a chakra. If you know that one of your chakras could use some healing, choose a crystal that corresponds with that chakra color: red for the root chakra, orange for the sacral, yellow for the solar plexus, green for the heart, blue or turquoise for the throat, indigo or royal blue for the third eye, and purple, lavender, or white for the crown. ( [Or get one of each](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NXZMH6Y/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tesswhitehurs-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07NXZMH6Y&linkId=95de4551a74153247b7ad8f6753beea8)!) Empower the crystal in sunlight, and then simply hold the crystal on your body at that chakra point. You can also recline and set the crystal directly on your body at that point. Relax, breathe deeply, and allow the crystal to affect the desired change. Did you try one of these crystal healing techniques? What did you think? You may also like "}
