Fauci, M.D., for his tireless efforts to educate and counsel health care providers and the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. The award is given to individuals or organizations in recognition of exemplary contributions to the health and well-being of our nation through leadership on major health policy or social initiatives. Dr. Fauci will receive the award during a ceremony on April 25 at the AHA Annual Membership Meeting in Washington, D.C. When Dr. Fauci joined the White House Coronavirus Task Force in January 2020, the impending breadth and depth of the virus's toll, plus the politicization of science and medicine, were still unknown. As cases of COVID-19 began to surge throughout the country, Dr. Fauci advised the administration, the health care field and the public about the evolving science of COVID-19 and how to slow its spread. \"Serving as a trusted and calming voice on COVID-19 for the nation, Dr. Fauci was relentless advising the government, the health care field and the public on ways to battle the pandemic,\" said Rick Pollack, AHA president and CEO. \"His expertise, courage and grit guided our nation through some our darkest days. We're honored to recognize his lifetime dedication to service and commitment to enhancing public health.\" Appointed as NIAID director in 1984, Dr. Fauci oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and applied research to prevent, diagnose, and treat established infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and malaria as well as emerging diseases such as COVID-19, Ebola and Zika. During his tenure as NIAID director, he has advised seven presidents on many domestic and global health issues. ### Contact: Marie Johnson, [mjohnson@aha.org](mailto:mjohnson@aha.org) Colin Milligan, [cmilligan@aha.org](mailto:cmilligan@aha.org) About the American Hospital Association The American Hospital Association (AHA) is a not-for-profit association of health care provider organizations and individuals that are committed to the health improvement of their communities.
