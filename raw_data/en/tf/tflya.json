The General Regulations made in terms of t he Medicine s and Related Substance s Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965 ), require Professional Information (PI) to be made available for each med icine (regulation 11). As such, the PI is required by the Authority to be included in the application for the registration of a medicine (regulation 16(3)(g)). The PI sets out the agreed position of the medicine as determined as an outcome of the assessmen t process. As such, the content cannot be changed except with the approval of the South African Health Product s Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA). The following g uidelines may be applicable to the PI (SAHPRA guideline s unless indicated otherwise) : 2.30 Biosimilar Medicines Guideline 2.20 Guideline on Standardised T ext for Professional Information 2.36 Scheduling of Medicines Guideline 2.15 Proprietary Names Guideline 2.40 Multiple Submissions of the Same Application for Registration with Different Proprietary Names 7.01 Quality, Safety and Efficacy Guideline for Complementary Medicines 7.04 Safety and Efficacy Guideline for Health Supplements EC Guideline on Excipients in the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use1 CHMP Guideli ne on the Pharmaceutical Aspects of the Product Information for Human Vaccines CHMP Guideline on the Description of Composition of Pegylated (Conjugated) Proteins in the SmPC EMA guideline on the Warning of Transmissible Agents in Summary of Product Charac teristics and Package Leaflets for Plasma -Derived Medicinal Products The intention of this guideline is to: help applicants with the correct way of presenting the PI for evaluation ; and 1 This guideline replaces SAHPRA's alcohol (2.03) and sugar (2.35) guidelines. However, note that the current regulations pertaining to alcohol a nd sugar will still apply , including the definitions of \"sugar\" and \"sweetener.\" These regulatory requirements take precedence over the content of the EU excipients guideline. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 4 of 39 enhance consistency in the content of the PI. The PI is regarded as the document that ensures the safe and effective use of the medicine under most circumstances. It presents a scientific, objective account of the medicine's use and limitation as established by the supporting evidence. The PI should not serve the purpo se of a general treatment guideline/manual of particular medical conditions. SAHPRA retains the discretion to require more or less detail under the various headings, or that information should be displayed in a more prominent format such as boxed and/or bo lded, as it may deem necessary, while the applicant may motivate for the inclusion or exclusion of information. Clinical judgement regarding an individual medicine on whether to include certain information remains important. Applicants should maintain the integrity of each section of the document by only including information in each section which is relevant to the section heading. However, some issues may need to be addressed in more than one section of the PI and in such situations the individual stateme nts may be cross -referenced to other sections when these contain relevant additional information. When referring to properties of the active ingredient such as its pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic properties the International Non -proprietary Name (INN) should be used, i.e. in section 5, Pharmacological Properties. When referring to properties relating specifically to the use of the medicine, the invented /product name should be used. Reference to the class of medicines may be referred to, when specific c linically relevant safety information is available only for the class, and then stated that it may occur with the medicine. Note: The INN name \"epinephrine\" should be followed in brackets by \"adrenaline\", and the INN 'lidocaine' should be followed in brack ets by 'lignocaine\". Applicants should regularly consult the WHO list of INN names to ensure correct/updated spelling of INN names. The PI may not contain : information which may be intended to promote the sale of that medicine ; any comparisons with other medicines or any reference to the product name of any medicine that is not the subject of the PI (with the exception of placebo); and any statements suggestive of any potential advantage over competitors. However, the following may be allowed: \"References to concomitant / sequential use, based on clinical evidence, without referring to dosages.\" When required to refer to dosages, these must be substantiated by clinical evidence. English language (United Kingdom ) should be used. Measurements: The PI should be in accordance with the Legal Metrology Act , 2014 (Act No. 9 of 2014 ), as amended (please refer to the 2.38 Guideline on International Metric System - SI). For plasma concentrations the SI system should be used, e.g. ng/m L, mg/m L, etc. Clinical chemistr y laboratory values should be expressed in SI units, e.g. mmol/litre. Blood pressure and blood gasses should be expressed as both millimetres mercury (mm Hg) and kilopascals (kPa), e.g. pCO 2 34 mm Hg (4,7 kPa). 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 5 of 39 The word \"medicine\" should be used and not t he word \"drug \" or \"medicinal product \" or \"agent\". The word drug generally indicates a substance of abuse. This does not necessarily apply to the use of concepts which include the word \"drug\", e.g. drug fever, pro -drug, drug eluting stent, reac tion, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID). Source references which may be allowed include the latest editions of: The most recent SAHPRA -approved Innovator PI (IPI - to be published electronically by SAHPRA) The most recently approved Innovator SmPC / PI from a recognised regulatory authority (RRA) (for generic applications: as a supplement for safety aspects only in instances where the local IPI is materially outdated) . o List of RRAs : US FDA, EMA (Centralised and Decentralised Procedure s only ), MHLW (Japan), Health Canada, Swiss Medic, TGA (Australia), and MHRA (UK) Information obtained from (e.g., rapporteur's reports) SAHPRA monographs for 'Old Medicines' Other references or information from peer -reviewed journals Martindale: The Co mplete Drug Reference (For safety information only, not for efficacy) In the case of Complementary Medicines, those references stipulated in the relevant guidelines (listed on page 3 of this guideline) For a multisource m edicine (MSM), the Therapeutic I ndications (section 4.1) and Posology and method of administration (section 4.2) must be exactly in line with that of the most recently South African approved IPI. If the innovator product is not marketed anymore, the most recently updated SAHPRA approved MSM PI (within the last 5 years) may be used as reference for the compilation of MSM PI. Applicants should ensure that all safety aspects are updated in line with the IPI and other acceptable source references. Any additional information as required by the applicant should be submitted with relevant clinical data. SAHPRA reserves the right to use information from the most recently approved relevant MSM PI. Information from a Company Core Data Sheet (C CDS) will only be considered if substantiated by relevant data on which it is based. The a pplicant should ensure that Posology and method of administration in the PI is in line with the dosage form and dosage strength(s) as applied for, including the abil ity to titrate where required and use in special populations if recommended. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 6 of 39 PRESENTATION OF PROFESSIONAL INFORMATION FOR EVALUATION PI presented for evaluation for a new chemical entity (NCE), for an MSM, or for a PI variation after registration is req uired to comply with the following: The PI should be typed in black print and should be in English (United Kingdom ); The PI should be provided to the Authority electronically in both MS Word and PDF format ; The language, spelling and grammar, punctuation and editorial correctness in the PI text should be checked thoroughly before submission of the applicatio n; Each section of the PI should first deal with those issues that apply to the core population for wh om the medicine is indicated followed - when necessary - by specific information for any relevant special popula tion (e.g. children or elderly) ; Consistent current medical terminology should be used throughout the PI; The PI provides information on a part icular medicine; therefore it should not include reference to other medicines (e.g. statement such as \"Like other medicines of the same class ...\") except when it is a class warning recommended by SAHPRA or a RRA ; and Applicants may apply the general formatt ing prescribed in the EMA SmPC guidelines , but must always comply with the font and language requirements provided above (e.g. QRD convention to be followed for the EMA -QRD template) . Each page of the annotated proposed amended PI and annotated proposed am ended Patient Information Leaflet ( PIL) should: Be numbered as page x of y ; Be dated ; Have its text lines consecutively numbered on the left , from the first to the last page ; and Have a header reflecting the Applicant / Holder of Certificate of Registration (HCR), product name, dosage form(s) and strength(s) . Changes to the PI/PIL should be indicated by single underlining for additions, strike through for deletions and broken underlining for re -wording or for text that has been moved . Applicants may use the 'Track Changes' functionality in MS Word to make these changes, provided that they comply with the formatting requirements above. All statements should be accurately referenced and cross -referenced. References for each statement should be in cluded in a broad margin on the right -hand side of each page of the PI. Alternatively , the reference numbers may be included in the text as in scientific publications. Every statement should be verified by a reference. The exact page(s) and location on the page 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 7 of 39 should be stated and, if possible, the column and line number. If an entire section is quoted from one source, the reference may be listed at the end of the relevant section. No references should, however, be included in the finalised PI. The clean proposed PI and PIL for registration should not include text line numbering. For a PI variation for a medicine after registration, the approved PI (for eSubmissions only) , the proposed PI with the variation(s) and the evidence/motivation for the variation(s) should be submitted together with the application form and schedule of amendments. Each PI must be accompanied by a PIL, reflecting the corresponding proposed variation(s). [Refer to t he 2.08 Variations Addendum for Human and Veterinary Medicines ] The principles set out in this guideline are applicable to all human medicines (categories A and D) . The application of those principles for a particular medicine will depend on the scientific knowledge on the medicine. PROFESSIONAL INFORMATION: CONTENT UNDER EACH HEADING In the case of a complementary medicine (Category D medicines) the following should be included: the words \" Complementary Medicine \"; a statement identifying the discipline or the wording \" Health Supplement \", as the case may be; which is not registered by the Authority, the following disclaimer: \" This unregistered medicine has not been evaluated by the SAHPRA for its quality, safety or intended use. \"; and containing at least 5 percent of genetically modified organisms the following wording, \" contains genetically modified organisms \". SCHEDULING STATUS The Scheduling Status as assigned by SAHPRA and published in the Medicines and Related Substances Act , 1965 (Act 101 of 1965), as amended. The scheduling status should be boxed above section 1, NAME OF THE MEDICINE. 1 NAME OF THE MEDICINE The (invented /product ) name should be followed by both the strength and the pha rmaceutical form (a s per the 2.15 Proprietary Names Guideline all strengths of the active substances must be quantified ). However, when otherwise referring to the medicine throughout the PI text, the strength and the pharmaceutical form do not have to be mentioned in the name. The INN or the usual co mmon name of the active substance should be used when referring to properties of the active substance(s) rather than those of the product. The use of pronouns (e.g. \"it\") is encouraged whenever possible. Strength The strength should be the relevant qua ntity for identification and use of the product and 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 8 of 39 should be consistent with the quantity stated in the quantitative composition and in the posology. Different strengths of the same medicine should be stated in the same way, e.g. 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg. T he use of decimal points should be avoided where these can be easily removed (e.g. 250 microgram, not 0,25 mg). However, where a range of medicines of the same pharmaceutical form includes strengths of more than one unit (e.g. 250 microgram, 1 mg and 6 mg) , it may be more appropriate in certain cases to state the strengths in the same unit for the purpose of comparability (e.g. 0,25 mg, 1 mg and 6 mg). For safety reasons, micrograms and millions (e.g. for units) should always be spelled out in full rather t han be abbreviated. Pharmaceutical form The pharmaceutical form of a medicine should be described by a single full Standard Term of the European Pharmacopoeia using the plural form if appropriate (e.g. coated tablets) (see section 3). If an appropriate standard term does not exist, a new term may be constructed. No reference should be made to the route of administration or container unless these elements are part of the standard term or where there is a particular safety reason for their inclusion or where there are identical products, which may be distinguished only by reference to the route of administration or to the container. For the expressi on of the name and strength of complementary medicines the declaration should be in accordance with existing quality or other relevant guidelines on complementary medicines. 2 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Full details of the qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of the active substance(s) , and excipients where knowledge of which is essent ial for proper administration of the medicine, should be provided in section 2 and as appropriate in section 4.3 or 4.4 (refer to EC Guideline on Excipients in the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use). The sugar status and qua ntity should also be included as part of composition (e.g. sugar free). Other composition requirements outlined in Regulation 11 (in addition to sugar status) should also be included in this section (e.g. name and quantity of sweetener, where applicable) . The following standard statement should be included at the end of the section, i.e. 'for full list of excipients, see section 6.1'. If a diluent /solvent is part of the medicine, information should be included in the relevant sections (usually sections 3, 6.1, 6.5 and 6.6). Qualitative declaration The active substance should be declared by its recommended INN, accompanied by its salt or hydrate form if relevant, or the European Pharmacopoeial name if that name represents an established name. If no INN exi sts, the European Pharmacopoeia l name should be used or if the substance is not in the pharmacopoeia, the usual common name should be used. In the absence of a common name, the exact scientific designation should be given. Substances not having an exact sc ientific designation should be described by a statement on how and from what they were prepared. References to the pharmacopoeial grade should not be included. Where the medicine is a complementary medicine, the qualitative declaration should be in accord ance with the existing quality guidelines on complementary medicines. When the medicine is a radiopharmaceutical kit, the qualitative declaration should clearly indicate that the radioisotope is not part of the kit. Quantitative declaration The quantity o f the active substance should be expressed per dosage unit (for metered dose inhalation products, per delivered dose and/or per metered dose), per unit volume, or per unit of weight and should be related to the declaration of strength in section 1. Quantit y should be 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 9 of 39 expressed in internationally recognised standard term s which could be complemented with another term if more meaningful to health care providers . Salts and hydrates Where the active substance is present in the form of a salt or hydrate, the quantitative composition should be expressed in terms of the mass (or biological activity in International (or other) units where appropriate) of the active moiety (base, acid or a nhydrous material), e.g. '60 mg toremifene (as citrate)' or toremifene citrate equivalent to 60 mg toremifene'. Where a salt is formed in situ during the preparation of the finished product (i.e. formed during the mixture of a solvent and powder), the quan tity of the active moiety should be stated, with a reference to the in situ formation of the salt. In the case of established active substances in medicines where the strength has traditionally been expressed in the form of a salt or hydrate, the quantitat ive composition may be declared in terms of the salt or hydrate, e.g. '60 mg diltiazem hydrochloride'. This may also apply when the salt is formed in situ. Note that salts or hydrates should be stated on the label , where applicable . Esters and pro -drugs If the active substance is an ester or pro -drug, the quantitative composition should be stated in terms of the quantity of the ester or pro -drug. When the active moiety is an active substance of an already approved medicine, the quantitative composition shou ld also be stated in terms of the quantity of this active moiety (e.g. 75 mg of fosphenytoin is equivalent to 50 mg of phenytoin). Note that esters and pro -drugs should NOT be stated on the label. Oral powders for solution or suspension The quantity of ac tive substance should be stated per unit dose if the product is a single -dose preparation or otherwise per unit dose volume after reconstitution; a reference to the molar concentration may also be appropriate in some cases. Parenterals excluding powders for reconstitution For single -dose parenterals, where the total contents of the container are given in a single dose ('total use'), the quantity of active substance(s) should be stated per presentation (e.g. 20 mg etc.) not including any overages or over fill. The quantity per mL and the total labelled volume should also be given. For single -dose parenterals, where the amount to be given is calculated on the basis of the patient's weight or body surface or other variable ('partial use'), the quantity of a ctive substance(s) should be stated per mL. The quantity per total labelled volume should also be given. Overages or overfills should not be included. For multi -dose and large volume parenterals, the quantity of active substance(s) should be stated per mL , per 100 mL, per 1000 mL, etc. as appropriate, except for multidose vaccines containing 'n' doses of the same dose. In this case, the strength should be expressed per dose volume. Overages or overfills should not be included. Where appropriate, e.g. for X-ray contrast media, and parenterals containing inorganic salts, the quantity of active substance(s) should also be indicated in millimoles. For X -ray contrast media with iodine -containing actives substances, the quantity of iodine per mL should be state d in addition to the quantity of the active substance. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 10 of 39 Powders for reconstitution prior to parenteral administration When the product is a powder to be reconstituted prior to administration, the total quantity of active substance in the container should be stated not including overages or overfills, as well as the quantity per mL when reconstituted, unless there are several means of reconstituting, or different quantities used, which result in different final concentrations. Concentrates The quantity should be stated as the content per mL in the concentrate and as the total content of the active substance. The content per mL when diluted as recommended should also be included unless the concentrate is to be diluted to within a range of different final concentrations. Transdermal patches The following quantitative details should be given: the content of active substance(s) per patch, the mean dose delivered per unit time, and the area of the releasing surface, e.g. 'Each patch contains 750 micrograms of estradiol in a patch size of 10 cm2, releasing a nominal 25 micrograms of estradiol per 24 hours'. Subcutaneous hormonal contraceptive implants The following quantitative details should be given: the content of active substance(s) per implant, the mea n dose delivered per unit time, and the area of the releasing surface, e.g. 'The implant is 4 cm in length with a diameter of 2 mm and consists of etonogestrel vinylacetate (EVA) copolymer core, containing 68 mg of the synthetic progestin etonogestrel (ENG ), surrounded by an EVA copolymer skin. Multidose solid or semi -solid products Quantity of active substance should be stated, where possible, per unit dose, otherwise per gram, per 100 g or percentage, as appropriate. Biological medicines Expression of strength The quantity of biological medicines should be expressed in terms of mass units, units of biological activity, or International Units as appropriate for the particular product, and reflecting European Pharmacopoeia usage where relev ant. For Pegylated proteins, the CHMP Guideline on the Description of Composition of Pegylated (Conjugated) Proteins in the SmPC should be referred to. The biological origin of the active substance The origin of the active substance should be defined briefly. Thus, the nature of any cellular system(s) used for production and, if relevant, the use of recombinant DNA technology should be specified. The entry should take the form: \"produced in XXX cells <by recombinant DNA technology>\". The following are examples of the application of this principle: \"produced in human diploid (MRC -5) \"produced in chick -embryo cells\", \"produced from 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 11 of 39 Special provisions for normal immunoglobulins In the case of normal immunoglobulins, the IgG subclass distribution should be stated in terms of percent of total IgG present. The upper limit of the IgA content should follow. Special provisions for vaccines In the case of vaccines, the content of active substance per dose unit (e.g. per 0.5 mL) should be stated. Adjuvants, if pr esent, should be stated qualitatively and quantitatively. Residues that are of special relevance (e.g. ovalbumin in egg derived vaccines) should be specified. Additional specific guidance is available in CHMP guidelines on biotechnological medicines, e.g. the CHMP Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Aspects of the Product Information for Human Vaccines. Complementary medicines The quantitative declaration should be in accordance with the existing quality guidelines on complementary medicines. 3 PHARMACEUTICAL FORM The pharmaceutical form should be described by a full standard term of the European Pharmacopoeia (see section 1) using the plural form. The term used in this section should be the same as the term used in section 1. However, where a short standard term of the European Pharmacopoeia is used on small immediate packaging material, the short term should be added in brackets in this section. A visual description of the appearance of the product (colour, markings, etc.) should be given, in a separate par agraph to the standard term, including information on the actual size of a solid oral formulation, e.g. 'Tablets, white, circular, flat, bevelled -edge tablets of 5 mm marked '100' on one side' In case of tablets designed with a score line, information sho uld be given on whether or not reproducible dividing of the tablets has been shown. e.g. 'the score line is only to facilitate breaking for ease of swallowing and not to divide into equal doses', 'the tablet can be divided into equal halves'. Information o n pH and osmolarity should be provided, as appropriate. In case of products to be reconstituted before use, the appearance before reconstitution should be stated in this section. Appearance of the product after reconstitution should be stated in sections 4.2 and 6.6. 4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications The indication(s) should be stated clearly and concisely and should define the target disease or condition distinguishing between treatment (symptomatic, palliative, curative or modifying the evolution or progression of the disease), prevention (primary or secondary) and diagnostic indication. When appropriate it should define the target population and/or the duration of treatment (i.e. short - or long -term treatment with reference to number of days, weeks or months as substantiated by the clinical data). It should be stated whether the medicine is to be used as mono therapy or in combination with other relevant medicine for the same condition or as an adjunct treatment to an existing treatment regimen. Where relevant, it should be indicated whether the medicine is to induce a remission, prevent a relapse or for maintenance 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 12 of 39 therapy. For antimicrobials: Therapeutic Indications should be linked to conditions caused by organisms known to be eradicat ed by the medicine in the clinical data submitted. Changes in the international and local antimicrobial resistance patterns should also be a consideration. Principles of antibiotics stewardship should be adhered to. Where results from subsequent studies p rovide further definition or information on an authorised indication, such information, provided it does not itself constitute a new indication, may be considered for inclusion in section 5.1. Mandatory conditions of product usage not covered more appropr iately in other parts of the PI may also be included when relevant, e.g. concomitant dietary measures, lifestyle changes, or other therapy. It should be stated in which age groups the product is indicated, specifying the age limits, e.g. 'invented/product name is indicated in <adults><neonates><infants><children> <adolescents> <aged x to y <years, months>>. If the product's indication depends on a particular genotype or the expression of a gene or a particular phenotype, this should be stated in the indic ation. 4.2 Posology and method of administration In case of restricted medical prescription, this section should be started by specifying the conditions. In case of specific safety need, any recommended restriction to a particular setting should also be sta ted (e.g. \"appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available\"). Posology The dosage should be clearly specified for each method/route of administration and for each indication, as appropriate. Where appropriate, a reference to official recommendations should be made (e.g. for primary vaccination and antibiotics as well as for booster dose). Dose recommendations (e.g. mg, mg/kg, mg/m2) should be specified per dose interval for each category whe re appropriate (specify age/weight/body surface area of subsets of the population as appropriate). Frequency of dosing should be expressed using time units (e.g. once or twice daily or every 6 hours) and, to avoid confusion, abbreviations e.g. OD or BID s hould not be used. Where appropriate, the following points should be addressed: The maximum recommended single, daily and/or total dose, The need for dose titration, The normal duration of use and any restrictions on duration and, if relevant, the need for tapering off, or advice on discontinuation, 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 13 of 39 Advice on action to be taken if one or more dose(s) is (are) missed, or e.g. in case of vomiting (the advice should be as specific as possible, taking into consideration the recommended frequency of dosin g and relevant pharmacokinetic data) Advice on prevent ative measures to avoid certain adverse drug reactions (e.g. administration of antiemetics) with cross -reference to section 4.4, The intake of the product in relation to fluid and food intake, togeth er with a cross - reference to section 4.5 in case of specific interaction e.g. with alcohol, grapefruit or milk, Advice regarding repeat use, with any information on intervals to be observed between courses of treatment, as appropriate, Interactions requ iring specific dose adjustments with cross -reference to other appropriate sections of the PI (e.g. 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2), and It may also be relevant to recommend not to prematurely discontinue a treatment in case of specific non -serious adverse react ion(s) that are frequent but transient or manageable with dose titration. Where relevant to the particular product, the following should appear 'The potency of this medicine is expressed in <invented name> units. These units are not interchangeable with t he units used to express the potency of other <active substance name> preparations'. Special populations Dosage adjustments or other posology related information in specific patient groups should be stated where necessary, in well -defined sub -sections o rdered by importance, e.g. regarding: Elderly population; it should be made clear whether or not any dosage adjustment is necessary in any subsets of the elderly population, with cross -reference to other sections providing information in elderly, e.g. 4. 4, 4.5, 4.8 or 5.2. Renal impairment; the dose recommendation should relate as precisely as possible to the cut -off values for biochemical markers of renal impairment in clinical studies and to the results of these studies; Hepatic impairment, specified a ccording to the patients included in studies, for instance 'alcohol -related cirrhosis' and the definitions used in the studies, for instance Child -Pugh score/grade of the patients; Patients with a particular genotype; with cross -reference to other relevan t sections for further detail as appropriate; Other relevant special population (e.g. patients with other concomitant disease or overweight patients). Advice relevant for dosage adjustment e.g. from monitoring of clinical symptoms and signs, and/or labor atory investigations, including blood concentrations of the medicine should be mentioned when appropriate with cross -reference to other sections where appropriate. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 14 of 39 Paediatric population The specific sub -section 'paediatric population' should always be included and the information given should cover all subsets of the paediatric population, using a combination of the possible situations presented below as appropriate. If the product is indicated in the paediatric populatio n, posology recommendations should be given for each of the relevant subsets. The age limits should reflect the benefit -risk assessment of the available documentation for each subset. If the posology is the same in adults and children, then a statement to this effect is sufficient; the posology does not need to be repeated. Dose recommendations (e.g. mg, mg/kg, mg/m2) should be specified per dose interval for the paediatric subsets where the product is indicated. Different subsets may require different dosing information. If necessary, recommendations in preterm newborns should be presented taking into account the more appropriate age e.g. gestational age. Depending on the subset, the clinical data and available formulations, the dose will be expressed ac cording to weight or body surface area, e.g. \"children aged 2 -4 years, 1 mg/kg bodyweight twice a day\". When appropriate, information on timing of intake of the product should consider children's daily life, e.g. school or sleep. Where a product is indi cated in children and no adequate paediatric formulation can be developed, detailed instructions on how to obtain an extemporaneous preparation shall be included in section 6.6 with a cross -reference in section 4.2. Doses and method of administration in the various subsets may be presented in a tabulated format. If there is no indication for the product in some or all subsets of the paediatric population, no posology recommendation can be made, but available information should be summarised using the fol lowing standard statements (one or combination of several as appropriate): The <safety> <and> <efficacy> of X in children aged x to y <months, years> <or any other relevant subsets e.g. weight, pubertal age, gender> <has><have> not <yet> been established. One of the following statements should be added: - <No data are available>. or - <Currently available data are described in section <4.8><5.1><5.2> but no recommendation on a posology can be made > 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 15 of 39 X should not be used in children aged x to y <year s, months><or any other relevant subsets e.g. gender> because of <safety> <efficacy> concern(s) <concern(s) to be stated with cross -reference to sections detailing data (e.g. 4.8 or 5.1) >. There is no relevant use of X in <the paedi atric population><in children aged x to y><years, other relevant subsets e.g. weight, pubertal in the indication(s) <specify indication(s)>. X is contraindicated in children aged x to y <years, months> < or any other relevant subsets e.g. weight, pubertal age, gender> <in the indication ...> (cross -reference to section 4.3). If there are more appropriate strength(s) and/or pharmaceutical form(s) for administration in some or all subsets of the paediatric po pulation (e.g. oral solution for infants), these can be mentioned in section 4.2 of the PI of the less appropriate one(s). E.g.: Other pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more appropriate for administration to this population. Method of administratio n Any special precautions related to the manipulation or administration of the product (e.g. cytotoxic products) by health care providers (including pregnant health care providers ), the patient or caregivers should be mentioned here under a specific sub -heading (<Precaution to be taken before manipulating or administering the product>), with a cross -reference to section 6.6 (or 12). The route of administration and concise relevant instruction for correct administration and use should be given here. Information on instructions for preparation or reconstitution should be placed in section 6.6 'Special precautions for disposal and other handling' (or in section 12 if appropriate) and cross -referenced here. When supportive data are available, information on alternative method(s) to facilitate administration or acceptability should be given as explicitly as possible (e.g. possibility of crushing tablet, cutting tablet or transdermal patc h, pulverising tablet, opening capsules, mixing with food, dissolution in drinks - specifying if a proportion of the dose can be given) particularly for administration via feeding tubes. Any specific recommendation for use related to the pharmaceutical fo rm should be explained, e.g.: \"The coated tablet should not be chewed because of <bad taste>, \"The enteric -coated tablet should not be crushed prevents <pH sensitive degradation><irritant effects> on the gut\", \"The coated tablet should not be broken because the coating is intended to ensure a prolonged release (see 5.2)\". For parenteral formulations, information on the rate or speed of injection or infusion should be provided. The compatibility of the medicine with IV fluids should be stat ed when it is to be added to IV fluids for infusion . For parenteral formulations - in children, especially newborns in whom quite often fluids have to be restricted - it would be useful to have information on maximal concentration that can be 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 16 of 39 safely admini stered (e.g. \"no more than X mg of Y/mL of solution\"). 4.3 Contraindications For generic applications, this section must be aligned with the local IPI approved by SAHPRA. Situations/scenarios/circumstances where administration of the medicine may cause potentially life -threatening complications, serious harm/morbidity, and/or death/mortality. Such circumstances could include a particular clinical diagnosis, concomitant diseases, demographic factors (e.g. gender, age) or predispositions (e.g. metabolic or im munological factors, a particular genotype and prior adverse reactions to the medicine or class of medicines). The situations should be unambiguously, comprehensively and clearly outlined. Other medicines or classes of medicine, which must not be used con comitantly or consecutively should be stated, based on either data or strong theoretical reasons. If applicable a cross -reference to section 4.5 should be made. In general, patient populations not studied in the clinical trial programme should be mentione d in section 4.4 and not in this section unless a safety issue which may potentially be life - threatening or may cause death can be predicted (e.g. use of renally eliminated substances with narrow therapeutic margin in renal failure patients). If, however, patients have been excluded from studies due to a contraindication on grounds of safety, they should be mentioned in this section. If applicable a cross -reference to section 4.4 should be made. Only if pregnancy or breastfeeding is contraindicated, should it be mentioned here. In section 4.6, a cross -reference should be made and further background information provided. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or residues from the manufacturing process should be included, as wel l as any contraindication arising from the presence of certain excipients (see EC Guideline on Excipients in the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use ). For complementary medicines, hypersensitivity extended to other plants of the same family or to other parts of the same plant should be labelled as a contraindication, where applicable. Lack of data alone should not lead to a contraindication. Where for safety reasons, the product should be contraindicated in a specific populat ion, e.g. paediatric or a subset of the paediatric population, it should appear in this section with a cross -reference to the section giving detailed information on the safety issue. A contraindication in the paediatric population should be listed without a sub -heading. Porphyria should be included if absolutely contraindicated. (Cross -reference to section 4.4) For combination products the contraindications for APIs must be presented for the combination. Contraindications are to be presented in bullet format where relevant. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The order of warnings and precautions should in principle be determined by the importance of the safety information provided. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 17 of 39 Specific safety issues, especially those which may b e fatal, life threatening or cause serious harm (adverse effects), may be required to be placed in a prominently displayed box and/or in boldface type. Such information may be displayed at the top of this section, or may be displayed elsewhere in the PI, as deemed appropriate The exact content of this section will be different for each product and the therapeutic conditions it is intended to treat. It is however suggested that the following items should be included where relevant to the specific product. Information on a specific risk should be given in section 4.4 only when the risk leads to a precaution for use or when health care providers have to be warned of this risk. Patient groups in which use of the medicine is contraindicated should be mentioned in section 4.3 only and not to be repeated here. The following should be described: The conditions, in which the use of the medicine could be acceptable, provided that special conditions for use are fulfilled. In particular, specific risk minimisation measures requested as part of a Risk Management Plan to ensure safe and effective use should be described in this section. ( For example; \"Liver function should be monitored before initiation of treatment and monthly thereafter\", \"Patients should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation\", \"Women of childbearing potential should use contraception\" ,) Special patient groups that are at increased risk or are the only groups at risk of experiencing product or product cla ss-related adverse reactions (usually serious or common), e.g. elderly, children, patients with renal or hepatic impairment (including the degree of impairment, e.g. mild, moderate or severe), patients having an anaesthe tic or patients with cardiac failure (including in this case the NYHA Classification for example) For renal impairment in adults, if the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is used to indicate the impairment, use the following: mild renal impairment: CrCl impairment CrCl<30 ml/min . For calculation of creatinine clearance use the South African Renal Society modification of the Cockroft and Gault formula: eCrCl mL/min=[(140 -age) x by serum creatinine (micromoles/ litre). For hepatic impairment use Child -Pugh classification or modification thereof. Cross -reference to section 4.8 on the differential effects in terms of frequency and severity of the specified adverse reaction should be provided. Serious adverse reactions to which health care providers need to be alerted, the situations in which these may occur and the action that may be required, e.g. emergency resuscitation. If there are particular risks associated with starting the medicine (e. g. first dose effects) or stopping it (e.g. rebound, withdrawal effects), these should be mentioned in this section, together with the action required for prevention. Any measures which can be taken to identify patients at risk and prevent the occurrence, or detect early the onset or worsening of noxious conditions. If there is a need for awareness of symptoms or signs representing early warning of a serious adverse reaction, a statement should be included. Any need for specific clinical or laboratory mo nitoring should be stated. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 18 of 39 Recommendation for monitoring should address why, when and how the monitoring should be conducted in clinical practice. If dose reduction or other posology is recommended in such circumstances or conditions, this should be includ ed in section 4.2 and cross -referenced here. Any special warnings and precautions necessary for excipients , or residues from the manufacturing process. For complementary medicines containing alcohol, information about the ethanol content in the medicine should be included in accordance with the EC Guideline on Excipients in the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicines for Human Use. Any warnings necessary with respect to transmissible agents (e.g. Warning of Transmissible Agents in Summary of Product Ch aracteristics and Package Leaflet s for Plasma -Derived Medicinal Products ). Subjects or patients with a specific genotype or phenotype might either not respond to the treatment or be at risk of a pronounced pharmacodynamic effect or adverse reaction. These may arise because of non -functioning enzyme alleles, alternative metabolic pathways (governed by specific alleles), or transporter deficiencies. Such situations should be clearly described if known. Any particular risk associated with an incorrect route of administration (e.g. necrosis risk with extravasation of intravenous formulation, or neurological consequences of intravenous use instead of intramuscular use), should be presented, with advice on management if possible. Any adverse reactions described in this section or known to result from conditions mentioned here should also be included in section 4.8. Specific interference with laboratory tests should be mentioned when appropriate, e.g. Coombs/antiglobulin test and beta -lactams. They should be cl early identified with a subheading, e.g. \"Interference with serological testing\". In general, descriptions of warnings and precautions regarding pregnancy and breastfeeding, ability to drive and use machines, and interference with mental and/or physical a bilities to perform/execute daily tasks/activities requiring mental alertness, judgment and/or sound coordination and /or vision and other aspects of interactions should be dealt with in sections 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 , respectively. However in specific cases of major clinical importance it might be more appropriate to describe specific precautionary measures in this section, e.g. contraception measures, or when concomitant use of another medicine is not recommended, and with cross reference to section 4.5, 4.6, or 4.7. If relevant, include whether the medicine may lead to a positive test for a prohibited substance in competitive sport activities. In case of anaesthetic medicines or medicines used for conscious sedation, the following warni ng should be included: \"I nterference with daily activities may continue for up to 24 hours and no legal/contractual decisions should be entered into for 24 hours after receiving anaesthetic/conscious sedation. Alcohol use should also be avoided for the sam e time period. \" Include whether the medicine may affect the performance of child and adult learning in schools and other institutions of education, learning and training. For combination products the special warning and precaution for use of APIs must be 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 19 of 39 presented for the combination. Include risk management/minimisation measure were relevant. For co -packed medicines the special warning and precautions for use of each of the APIs co - packaged should be presented separately if is to be taken sequentially and for those co - packed medicines containing multicomponent fixed drug combination and a monocomponent medicine to be taken at the same time, the special warning and precaution for use of the APIs must be presented for the combination of the APIs contained in the co -pack. Paediatric population When the product is indicated in one or more subsets of the paediatric population and there are warnings and precautions for use that are specific to the paediatric population or any subset of the paediatric population, they should be identified under this subheading. Any necessary warning or precaution in relation to long -term safety (e.g. on growth, neuro - behavioural development or sexual maturation) or specific monitoring (e.g. growth) in the paediatric po pulation should be described. When long -term safety data are necessary but not yet available, it should be stated in this section. Warnings should be included in case of possible significant or long -lasting impact on children's daily activities, such as le arning ability or physical activities, or in case of impact on appetite or sleep pattern. If measures are requested that are specific to the paediatric population for which the product is indicated (e.g. as part of a Risk Management Plan), these measures s hould be described in this section. 4.5 Interaction with other medicines and other forms of interaction This section should provide information on the potential for clinically relevant interactions based on the pharmacodynamic properties and in vivo pharma cokinetic studies of the medicine, with a particular emphasis on the interactions, which result in a recommendation regarding the use of this medicine. This includes in vivo interaction results which are important for extrapolating an effect on a marker (' probe') substance to other medicines having the same pharmacokinetic property as the marker. Interactions affecting the use of this medicine should be given first, followed by those interactions resulting in clinically relevant changes on the use of others . Interactions referred to in other sections of the PI should be described here and cross - referenced from other sections. The order of presentation should be contraindicated combinations, those where concomitant use is not recommended, followed by other s. The following information should be given for each clinically relevant interaction: a) Recommendations - these might be: Contraindications of concomitant u se (cross -refer to section 4.3); Concomitant use not recommend ed (cross -refer to section 4.4); and Precautions including dose adjustment (cross -refer to sections 4.2 or 4.4, as appropriate), mentioning specific situations where these may be required. b) Any clinical manifestations and effects on plasma levels and AUC of parent compounds or active metabo lites and/or on laboratory parameters. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 20 of 39 c) Mechanism, if known. For example, interaction due to inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 should be presented as such in this section, with a cross - reference to 5.2 where in vitro results on inhibition or indu ction potential should be summarised. Interactions not studied in vivo but predicted from in vitro studies or deducible from other situations or studies should be described if they result in a change in the use of the medicine, cross -referring to sections 4.2 or 4.4. This section should mention the duration of interaction when a medicine with clinically important interaction (e.g., enzyme inhibitor or inducer) is discontinued. Adjustment of dosing may be required as a result. The implication for the need for a washout period when using medicines consecutively should also be mentioned. Information on other relevant interactions such as with complementary medicines, food, alcohol, smoking, or pharmacologically active substances not used for medical purpose, should also be given. With regard to pharmacodynamic effects where there is a possibility of a clinically relevant potentiation or a harmful additive effect, this should be stated. In vivo results demonstrating an absence of interaction should only be men tioned here if this is of major importance to the prescriber (e.g. in therapeutic area where potentially problematic interactions have been identified such as with anti -retroviral medicines). If no interaction studies have been performed, this should be clearly stated. Additional information on special populations If there are patient groups in which the impact of an interaction is more severe, or the magnitude of an interaction is expected to be larger e.g., patients with decreased renal function (in case the parallel pathway is renal excretion), paediatric patients, elderly etc., this information should be given here. If interactions with other medicines depend on polymorphisms of metabolising enzymes or certain genotypes, this should be stated. Paediatric population Information specific to a subset of the paediatric population should be given here if there is an indication for the particular age group. The resulting exposure and clinical consequences of a pharmacokinetic interaction can differ between adults and children, or between older and younger children. Therefore; Any identified treatment recommendations should be given in relation to concomitant use in the paediatric subset(s) (e.g. dose adjustment, extra -monitoring of clinical effect ma rker/adverse reactions , therapeutic drug monitoring). If the interaction studies have been performed in adults, the statement 'Interaction studies have only been performed in adults' should be included. If the extent of an interaction is known to be simi lar in a paediatric age group to that in adults, this should be stated. If this is not known, this should also be stated. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 21 of 39 The same applies to pharmacodynamic drug interactions. In cases of food interaction leading to a recommendation on co -administra tion with a meal or specific food, it should be specified whether this is relevant for paediatric use (especially newborns and infants) whose diet is different (100 % milk in newborns). Overall , section 4.5 should be presented in the simplest possible way to highlight the interactions resulting in a practical recommendation regarding the use of the medicine. Presentation in a tabulated format may help where interactions are numerous and various, such as with anti -viral products. For combination products the interactions for individual active pharmaceutical ingredient must be stated and characterised according to severity. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation General principles : Efforts should be made by the applicant /HCR to provide the reasons for the rec ommendations for use in pregnant or lactating women and in women of childbearing potential. This information is important for the health care providers informing the patient. In the overall assessment, all available knowledge should be taken into account, including clinical studies and post -marketing surveillance, pharmacological activity, results from non - clinical studies, and knowledge about compounds within the same class. Efforts should be made to update the recommendations for use during pregnancy a nd lactation on the basis of increasing human experience in exposed pregnancies which eventually supersede the animal data. In case of contraindication, this should be included in section 4.3. The following should be mentioned: Women of childbearing pote ntial / Contraception in males and females Recommendations on the use of the medicine in women of childbearing potential should be given when appropriate including the need for pregnancy test or contraceptive measures. Where an effective contraception is r equired for patients or partners of patients during treatment or for a defined period before starting or after ending treatment, the rationale should be included in this section. If contraceptive measures are recommended, there should also be a cross -reference to section 4.5 (and possibly 4.4) in case of interaction with oral, injectable and implanted contraceptives. Pregnancy In general, clinical and non -clinical data should be followed by recommendations. With respect to non -clinical data, Only conclusions of the reproductive toxicity studies should be included in this section. Further details should be provided in section 5.3. With respect to clinical data, The section should include comprehensive information on relevant adverse events reported in the embryo, the foetus, neonates, delivery/birth process and pregnant women, when appropriate. The frequency of such events (for example the frequency of birth defects) should be specified when available. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 22 of 39 The section should specify the extent of the human experience if no adverse events have been reported in pregnancy. With respect to the recommendations: o Recommendations on the use of the medicine during the different periods of gestation, including the reason(s) for these r ecommendations, should be given o Recommendations for the management of exposure during pregnancy when appropriate (including relevant specific monitoring such as foetal ultrasound, specific biological or clinical surveillance of the foetus or the neonate) should be given. Cross -references can be included in sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8, as appropriate. Statements such as \"where the benefit outweighs the risk\" or \"at the discretion of the prescriber / medical practitioner\" or \"should not be used unless clearly necessary\" will not be allowed. Counsel ling for both partners may be indicated. If the API presents a risk to the labour/delivery process , and/or newborn /neonate , this information should be included under additional sub -headings in this section. Breastfeeding If availa ble, clinical data should be mentioned (exposed breastfed infants) as the conclusions of kinetic studies (plasma concentrations in breastfed infants, transfer of the active substance and/or its metabolite(s) into human milk...). Information on adverse reacti ons in nursing neonates should be included if available. Conclusions from non -clinical studies on the transfer of the active substance and/or its metabolite(s) into milk should be given only if no human data are available. Recommendations should be given to stop or continue breastfeeding and/or to stop or continue the treatment in cases where treatment or breastfeeding discontinuation is recommended, and the reason should be provided. Fertility The main information on the possible effects of the medicin e on male and female fertility should be included. This section should include: Clinical data if available; Relevant conclusions from non -clinical toxicity studies, if available. Further details should be included in section 5.3; and Recommendations fo r the use of the medicine when pregnancy is planned but fertility might be affected by treatment. Cross -references could be included in section 4.3, if appropriate. If there are no fertility data at all, then this should be clearly stated. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 23 of 39 4.7 Effects on a bility to drive and use machines On the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, reported adverse reactions and/or specific studies in a relevant target population addressing the performance related to driving and road safety or using mac hines, specify whether the medicine has a) no or negligible influence b) minor influence, c) moderate influence or d) major influence on these abilities. Other important factors that affect the ability to drive and use machines should be considered if know n, e.g. duration of the impairing effect and the development of tolerance or adverse reactions with continued use. For situations c and d, special warnings/precautions for use should be mentioned here (and also in section 4.4 for situation d). Include whet her the medicine may affect mental and/or physical abilities to perform or execute tasks or activities requiring mental alertness, judgment and/or sound coordination and vision. 4.8 Undesirable effects This section should include all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post -authorisation safety studies and spontaneous reporting for which, after thorough assessment, a causal relationship between the medicine and the adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, based for example, on their comparativ e incidence in clinical trials, or on findings from epidemiological studies and/or on an evaluation of causality from individual case reports. Adverse events, without at least a suspected causal relationship, should not be listed in the PI. The content of this section should be justified in the Clinical Overview of the application for registration based upon a best -evidence assessment of all observed adverse events and all facts relevant to the assessment of causality, severity and frequency. This section should be regularly reviewed and, if necessary, updated with the aim to ensure ap propriate information to health care providers on the safety profile of the product. In addition, the whole section could be revised at the renewal of the regist ration, where the safety profile of most products is likely to be well established, and after evaluation of time specified at PSURs/PBRERs. It is important that the whole section is worded in concise and specific language and does not include information such as claims regarding the absence of specific adverse reactions, or statements of general good tolerability. Statements on lack of proof of causal association should not be included. In order to provide clear and readily accessible information, section 4.8 should be structured according to the following recommendations: a) Summary of the safety profile b) Tabulated summary of adverse reactions c) Description of selected adverse reactions d) <Paediatric population> e) <Other special population(s)> a. Summary of the safety profile The summary of the safety profile should provide information about the most serious and/or most frequently occurring adverse reactions. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 24 of 39 If known, it may be helpful to indicate the timing when adverse reactions occur. Fo r example, in order to prevent early discontinuation of a treatment, it may be important to inform about non-serious adverse reactions that are frequent in the beginning of the treatment but may disappear with its continuation. Another example would be to inform about adverse reaction associated with long -term use. Frequencies of cited adverse reactions should be stated as accurately as possible. This summary of the safety profile should be consistent with the important identified risks mentioned in the Saf ety Specification of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) . The information should be consistent with the Table of Adverse Reactions (see section b). Cross -reference should be made to section 4.4 if relevant risk minimisation measures have been proposed in that s ection. An example of an acceptable statement is given below: 'At the beginning of the treatment, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhoea, headache or vertigo may occur; these reactions usually disappear within a few days even if treatment is continued. The mo st commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment are dizziness and headache, both occurring in approximately 6% of patients. Serious acute liver injury and agranulocytosis may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients)' b) Tabulated list of ad verse reactions A single table (or structured listing) should list all adverse reactions with their respective frequency category (note the exceptions to the use of a single table below) . In some cases for common or very common reactions, and when it is n ecessary for the clarity of the information, frequency figures may be presented in the table. Separate tables are acceptable in exceptional cases where the adverse reaction profiles markedly differ depending on the use of the product. For example, it migh t be the case for a product used for different indications (e.g. an oncology and a non -oncology indication) or at different posologies. Adverse events reported with post -marketing clinical studies (phase IV studies) should be reflected in a separate table . The table should be presented according to the MedDRA system organ classification. The system organ class (SOC) should be presented in the order shown in the annex ure. Adverse reactions descriptions should be based on the most suitable representation wit hin the MedDRA terminology. This will usually be at the Preferred Term (PT) Level, although there may be instances where the use of Lowest Term Level (LTL) or exceptionally group terms, such as High Level Terms (HLT) may be appropriate. As a general rule, any adverse reactions should be assigned to the most relevant SOC related to the target organ. For example, PT 'Liver function test abnormal' should be assigned to the SOC 'Hepatobiliary disorders' rather than to the SOC 'Investigations'. Within each syste m organ class, the adverse reactions should be ranked under headings of frequency, most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions should be presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. The names used to describe each of the frequency groupings should follow standard terms established in each official language using the following convention: Very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon to (1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000). Presentation of ADR information relative to placebo should be presented as absolute percentages (not as placebo subtracted). In exceptional cases, if a frequency cannot be estimated from the available data, an additional 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 25 of 39 category frequency 'not known' ma y be used. In case the expression \"Frequency not known\" is used, the following text should be added in the list of terms explaining the frequency categories: \"not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\". The expressions isolated/single cases/r eports should not be used. Where additional details about an adverse reaction are described in section c), the reaction concerned should be highlighted, for example with an asterisk, and, \"see section c)\" should be included as a footnote. Guidance on how to estimate the frequency of an adverse reaction is provided at the end of this chapter of the guideline. If there are only a few adverse reactions in total in this section, classification by SOC may be unnecessary. For combination products the side effe cts must be first presented for the combination, and then separately for each API. c. Description of selected adverse reactions This section should include information characterising specific adverse reaction s which may be useful to prevent, assess or manage the occurrence of an adverse reaction in clinical practice. This section should include information characterising individual serious and/or frequently occurring adverse reactions, or those where there have been reports of particularly severe cases. The information should provide frequency and may describe for example reversibility, time of onset, severity, duration, mechanism of the reaction (if of clinical relevance), dose relationship, relationship with durati on of exposure or risk factors. Measures to be taken to avoid specific adverse reactions or actions to be taken if specific reactions occur should be mentioned under section 4.4 and cross -referenced here. Information on the occurrence of withdrawal reacti ons may be mentioned here with cross - reference to section 4.2 in case of need for tapering off or advice on discontinuation of the product. Mention should be made here of any differences between different dosage forms in respect of adverse reactions. In the case of combination products, information should be included in this sub -section pointing out which particular adverse reactions are usually attributable to which active substance of the combination, where known. Any adverse reactions resulting direc tly from an interaction should be mentioned here and cross -referenced to section 4.5. This section should also inform on adverse reactions with very low frequency or with delayed onset of symptoms which may not have been observed in relation to the produc t, but which are considered to be related to the same therapeutic, chemical or pharmacological class. The fact that this is a class attribution should be mentioned. Any adverse reaction specific to excipients or residues from the manufacturing process sho uld be included. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 26 of 39 d. <Paediatric population> A paediatric sub -section should always be included (unless irrelevant). The extent and age characteristics of the safety database in children should be described (e.g. from clinical trials or pharmacovigilance data). Uncertainties due to limited experience should be stated. If the observed safety profile is similar in children and adults this could be stated: e.g. \"Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are <expected> to be the same as in adults\". Similarly, it is appropriate to state whether the safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets are similar or not. Any clinically relevant differences (i.e. in nature, frequency, seriousness or reversibility of adverse reactions) between the safety profiles in adult and paediatric populations, or in any relevant age groups, should be described and presented by age group. If there is a need for specific monitoring, this should be highlighted by cross -referencing to section 4.4. For clinica lly relevant differences, a separate table listing such adverse reactions by frequency can be added and presented by relevant age groups if appropriate. If some paediatric adverse reactions are considered common (1/100 to <1/10) or very common (1/10), th e frequencies should be provided in parentheses. In case of major difference with the safety profile in adults, a summary of the safety profile in children could be presented to facilitate the presentation of the information. Available information, from an y source scientifically validated, on long -term safety in children (e.g. on growth, mental development and sexual maturation) should also be summarised, whether positive or negative, with cross -reference to section 5.1 if appropriate. Any risk factors such as duration of treatment or period at risk should be specified. If relevant, symptoms of neonatal withdrawal should be listed in a separate paragraph with cross reference to section 4.6. e. <Other special populations> This section may include information on any clinically relevant differences (i.e. in nature, frequency, seriousness or reversibility of adverse reactions, or need for monitoring) specifically observed in other special populations such as elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients with hepatic impairment, patients with other diseases or a specific genotype. Cross -reference to other sections such as 4.3, 4.4 or 4.5 may be added as appropriate. Adverse reactions may also be related to genetically determined product metabolism. Subjects or patients deficient in the specific enzyme may experience a different rate or severity of adverse reactions. This should be mentioned and where relevant correlated with data from clinical trials. Further guidance on the estimation of frequency of adverse reactions The estimation of the frequency of an adverse reaction depends on the data source (i.e. clinical trial, post -authorisation safety study or spontaneous reporting), the quality of data collection and causality evaluation. If the choice of the freq uency category is based on different sources, the category representing the highest frequency should be chosen unless a more specific method has been applied and thus resulted in an estimate of clearly higher validity, e.g. a pooled analysis across suitabl e studies. Sources of data should use population exposed to the doses and treatment duration as recommended in the PI. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 27 of 39 Reactions that are reported under different terms but represent the same phenomenon (e.g., sedation, somnolence, drowsiness) should ordinarily be grouped together as a single adverse reaction to avoid diluting or obscuring the true effect. Similarly, reactions that represent a syndr ome complex should ordinarily be grouped together under an appropriate heading to avoid obscuring the full range of respective symptoms. Adverse reactions from clinical trials Safety data from several studies should be pooled to increase the precision of adverse reaction rates as appropriate without introducing bias (e.g. major difference in population characteristics or exposure to the product). The frequency of adverse reactions should be derived from pooled placebo -controlled studies if these data are available and the databases are sufficiently large to be informative. If these data are unavailable or not sufficiently informative, active -controlled data or possibly single - arm or add -on trials databases could be used to estimate frequencies. Frequency should represent crude incidence rates (and not differences or relative risks calculated against placebo or other comparator). When a common, very common or serious adverse reaction (e.g. suicide) also occurs in the placebo group with a relevant frequenc y, both incidence rates can be stated to put the risk into perspective (e.g. in subsection c). Adverse reactions from safety studies The choice of the frequency category to which any adverse reaction will be assigned is based on the point estimate of the crude incidence rate derived from a study designed in such a way that specific adverse events occurring in patients within a defined observation period would have been detected and reasonably attributed to the medicin e. In this situation, it is possible to calculate a point estimate of the crude incidence rate using standard statistical methods. In cases where the original information is expressed as an incidence density (denominator expressed as person -time), an appro priate transformation into an incidence proportion should be performed for choosing the frequency category. Normally, incidence proportions for the most representative exposure period (e.g. 1 week, 3 months, 1 year) should be used to derive the frequency category. However, this may not be appropriate if the hazard function increases over time; in this case, the adverse reaction and its frequency pattern, when clinically relevant, should be properly described in section c). The frequency category to be ch osen for each adverse reaction should not be based on differences calculated against a comparator. However, when data are derived from a study with a non -exposed group and the rate difference attributed to the medicine is smaller than the baseline or backg round incidence rate, and if the adverse reaction is considered important, the background incidence may be provided (e.g. in section c). Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting The number of spontaneous reports should not be stated because the numbe r can quickly become outdated. Frequencies based on reporting rates from a spontaneous reporting system should not be used to assign frequency category. In case of an unexpected adverse reaction detected from spontaneous reporting, each adequately designed study where this adverse reaction could have been detected should be reviewed to choose a frequency category. If the adverse reaction has never been observed in clinical trials, then the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is not higher than 3/ N with N representing the total sample size summed up across all relevant clinical trials and studies (e.g. those with a follow -up long enough to 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 28 of 39 detect the adverse reaction). For example, if a particular adverse reaction has not been observed among 3 600 su bjects exposed to the product in clinical trials and studies, then the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate is 1/ (1 200) or less and the frequency category should be \"rare\", based on worst value of the point estimate. The rati onale for the frequency category for that particular reaction could be explained in sub -section c). For data from sources other than clinical trials/studies data: When the frequency of occurrence of adverse events is not available from clinical studies, the terms \"frequent\" or \"less frequent\" should be used. The following guide should be applied for frequency information obtained from sources other than clinical be sourced from PI approved by other RRAs or may be obtained from reference sources that the Authority recognises. The term reporting the highest frequency should always be used and all information must be clearly referenced. The appropriateness of the source(s) remains at the discretion of the Authority. When no frequency data are available for a specific ADR, the statement \"frequency not known\" or \"frequency unkno wn\" may be added, with justification provided in the applicant's cover letter for the lack of information and providing the reference sources consulted. Note: For a MSM PI without its own clinical trial data, ADRs should be categorised according to the fre quency classification: 'Frequent' and 'Less frequent'. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicine is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medici ne. Health care provders are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions to SAHPRA via the \" 6.04 Adverse Drug Reaction s Reporting Form \", found online under SAHPRA's publications: https://www.sahpra.org.za/Publications/Index/8 Applicants may include additional, dedicated contact details for the reporting of side effects directly to the HCR. 4.9 Overdose Describe acute symptoms and signs and potential sequelae. If no information is ava ilable, include the statement \"In overdose, side effects can be precipitated and/or be of increased severity.\" and cross reference to section 4.8. Taking into account all relevant evidence, describe management of overdose in man, e.g. in relation to monito ring or use of specific agonists/antagonists, antidotes or methods to increase elimination of the medicine such as dialysis [gastric lavage should be excluded]. However, there should not be any dosage recommendation of other medicines (e.g. antidotes) as i t could create conflict with the PI of those other products, unless this is specifically indicated by SAHPRA (e.g. standardised text). If applicable, counteractive measures based on genetic factors should be described. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 29 of 39 Additional information on special populations Information specifically observed in special populations such as elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients with hepatic impairment, other concomitant diseases etc. should be included. Paediatric popul ation If there are specific paediatric considerations, there should be a sub -section entitled 'paediatric population'. Special mention should be made of those medicines/strengths of a formulation for which ingestion of only one dose unit by children can cause fatal poisoning. 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Sections 5.1 - 5.3 shou ld normally mention information which is relevant to the prescriber a nd to other health care providers , taking into account the approved therapeutic indication(s) and the potential adverse drug reactions. Statements should be brief and precise. The sections should be updated regularly as new information becomes available, especially in relation to the paediatric population. 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties This section should start w ith the class of the medicine (previously pharmacological classification ), in accordance with Regulation 9 of the General Regulations made in terms of the Medicines a nd Related Substances Act (Act 101 of 1965). [Note: SAHPRA intends to replace this current nomenclature and system of class with the pharmacotherapeutic group and World Health Organisation (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, as per the EMA SmPC Guideline. This change will only come into effect once the associated regulation amendments have been published in the Government Gazette .] In case of medicine authorised as similar biological medicine, the following statement will be included: < Product Name> is a biosimilar medicine. Mechanism of action (if known) Pharmac odynamic effects. Clinical efficacy and safety. It may be appropriate for an applicant of a New Chemical Entity (NCE) to provide limited information, relevant to the prescriber, such as the main results (statistically compelling and clinically relevant) re garding pre -specified end points or clinical outcomes in the major trials, and giving the main characteristics of the patient population. Such information on clinical trials should be concise, clear, relevant and balanced, and should summarise evidence fro m relevant studies supporting the indication. The magnitude of effects should be described using absolute figures. (Relative risks or odd ratio should not be presented without absolute figures). Clinical efficacy studies of a known molecule should be remov ed from the PI. In the exceptional cases when clinically relevant information from subgroup or post -hoc analyses is presented, it should be identified as such in a balanced manner reflecting the 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 30 of 39 limited robustness of both positive and negative secondary ob servations. Any relevant pharmacogenetic information from clinical studies may be mentioned here. This should include any data showing a difference in benefit or risk depending on a particular genotype or phenotype. For combination products the pharmaco dynamic effects of each API must be presented separately. For antimicrobials: Do not include antimicrobial sensitivity data derived from in vitro testing, but include data on inherent resistance . Paediatric population The results of all pharmacodynamic (c linically relevant) or efficacy studies conducted in children should be presented under this sub -heading. Information should be updated when new relevant information becomes available. Results should be presented by age or relevant subsets. When there are data available, but there is no authorised paediatric indication, data should be presented and a cross -reference should always be made to section 4.2 and, as appropriate to 4.3. In presenting results of studies, particular attention should be given to include the relevant safety data. For exploratory studies, the results of the main endpoints should be given with the main characteristics of the population studied and the doses used. When they are available, inf ormation and results of confirmatory studies should usually supersede and replace those of exploratory studies. For confirmatory studies, the objectives, the study duration, the doses used (and the formulation used if different from the marketed one), the main characteristics of the patient population st udied (including age and number of patient s), and the main results regarding pre -specified endpoints should be provided, whether positive or negative. If data are considered inconclusive, this should be stat ed. The objective and the main results or the conclusion of any specific clinical safety study should also be given. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Pharmacokinetic properties of the active substance(s) relevant for the advised dose, strength and the pharmace utical formulation marketed should be given in this section. If these are not available, results obtained with other administration routes, other pharmaceutical forms or doses can be given as alternative. For combination products the pharmacokinetic prope rties of each API must be presented separately. Basic primary pharmacokinetic parameters, for instance bioavailability, clearance and half -life, should be given as mean values with a measure of variability. Pharmacokinetics items, which could be included in this section when relevant, are given below. a) General introduction, information about whether the medicine is a pro -drug or whether there are active metabolites, chirality, solubility, information on the population in which general pharmacokinetic data were obtained, etc. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 31 of 39 b) General characteristics of the active substance(s) after administration of the medicine formulation to be marketed. Absorption : complete or incomplete absorption; absolute and/or relative bioavailability; first pass effect; T max; the influence of food; in case of locally applied medicine the systemic bioavailability; involvement of transport proteins. If available, information on the s ite of absorption in the gastro intestinal tract should be stated (as it may be important for administ ration by enteral feeding tubes). Distribution : plasma protein binding; apparent volume of distribution per kilogram body weight (L/kg); tissue and/or plasma concentrations; pronounced multi - compartment behaviour; involvement of transport proteins. Biotra nsformation : degree of metabolism; which metabolites; activity of metabolites and contribution to effect and toxicity; enzymes involved in metabolism; site of metabolism; results from in vitro interaction studies that indicate whether the new compound can induce/inhibit metabolic enzymes. Elimination : elimination half -lives, total clearance; inter and/or intra -subject variability in total clearance; excretion routes of the unchanged substance a nd the metabolites including the relative portion of the hepati c and renal eliminated fraction; involvement of transport proteins. Linearity/non -linearity : linearity/non -linearity of the pharmacokinetics of the active substance with respect to dose and/or time; if the pharmacokinetics are nonlinear with respect to dose and/or time, the underlying reason for the non - linearity should be presented. Additional relevant information should be included here. c) Characteristics in specific groups of subjects or pa tients Variations with respect to factors such as age, weight, gender, smoking status, polymorphic metabolism and concomitant pathological situations such as renal failure, hepatic disease, including degree of impairment. If the influence on pharmacokinet ics is considered to be clinically relevant, it should be described here in quantitative terms (cross -reference to section 4.2 when applicable). d) Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) Relationship between dose/concentration/pharmacokinetic param eter and effect (either true endpoint, validated surrogate endpoint or side effect). The population studied should be described. Paediatric population Results of pharmacokinetic studies in the different paediatric age groups should be summarised, with a comparison to adults if available. If appropriate, the dose producing similar product exposure as in adults could be given. The pharmaceutical form(s) used for pharmacokinetic studies in children should be stated. Uncertainties due to limited experience should be stated. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 32 of 39 5.3 Preclinical safety data Information should be given on any findings in the non -clinical testing which could be of relevance for the prescriber, in recognising the safety profile of the medicine used for the authorised indication(s), and which is not already included in other relevant sections of the PI. If the results of the non -clinical studies do not add to the information needed by the prescriber, then the results (either positive or negative) need not be repeated i n the PI. The findings of the non -clinical testing should be described in brief with qualitative statements as outlined in the following example s: Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development. Effects in non -clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little re levance to clinical use. Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows. Findings of non -clinical studies relevant for use in the paediatric population, including juve nile animals and peri - or post -natal studies, should be presented with a discussion of their clinical relevance, under a sub -heading if necessary. <Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA)> Where relevant, co nclusions on the environmental risk assessment of the product should be included, with reference to section 6.6. SAHPRA will indicate in which instances the ERA is required. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients A list should be given of the exc ipients, expressed qualitatively only. All excipients, which are present in the product, should be included, even those present in small amounts, such as printing inks. Further details on the excipients to be declared may be found in the section on definit ions and examples in the EC Guideline on the Excipients in the Label ling and Package Leaflet of Medicines for Human Use. For transdermal patches, all ingredients of the patch (including the adhesive, release liner and backing film) should be mentioned. The active substance itself, residues of substances used during manufacture of the finished product (for example, solvents, head -space gases or antibiotics in vaccine manufacture), lubricants for prefilled syringes and constituents of capsule shells for inha lation powders not intended to be taken should not be included. However, certain residues such as residues of antibiotic or other antimicrobial medicines used in production that are known allergens with a potential for inducing undesirable effects should be mentioned in section 4.3 or 4.4 as appropriate. Excipients should be referred to by their recommended INN if existing, accompanied by the 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 33 of 39 salt or hydrate form if relevant or by their European Pharmacopoeia name. If an excipient has neither an INN nor E uropean Pharmacopoeia name, it should be described by its usual common name. References to the pharmacopoeial quality should not be included. E numbers should be given along with the common name of the excipient where they exist and when necessary for prop er use, e.g. when the excipient is listed in the EC Guideline on the Excipients in the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicines for Human Use (as having recognised action or effect). The ingredients in excipient mixtures should be listed individually. In cases where the full composition of a flavour or fragrance is not known to the applicant or is too complex, it may be declared in general terms (e.g. 'orange flavour', 'citrus perfume'). However, any of the components, which are known to have a recognis ed action or effect, should be included. Ingredients that may or may not be added for the pH adjustment should be followed by the parenthesis '(for pH -adjustment)'. pH adjusters should be listed, even if not present in the final product. All other excipie nts not present in the final product should not be listed. Invented names or general descriptive names such as 'printing ink' should not be used in place of the common name of an ingredient or of a mixture of ingredients but may be used in conjunction with the name(s) of the ingredient(s), so long as it is clear which ingredients are described by the name. Chemically modified excipients should be declared in such a way as to avoid confusion with the unmodified excipients, e.g. 'pregelatinised starch'. In the case of a product containing a covert marker for the purpose of tracking, tracing and authentication, a general term such as \"authentication factor\" should be included in the list of excipients instead of the name of the excipient, unless the excipient is one that is known to have a recognised action or effect. For clarity, it is recommended that each excipient be listed on a separate line. It can be useful to list excipients according to the different parts of the product, e.g. tablet core/coat, capsul e contents/shells, etc. For products that are presented in more than one container or in dual - chamber containers, the excipients should be listed per container or per chamber. Abbreviations for excipients should not be used. However, where justified for space considerations, abbreviations for excipient names may appear on the labelling, on condition that these abbreviations are designated in section 6.1. 6.2 Incompatibilities Information on physical and chemical incompatibilities of the medicine with other products with which it is likely to be mixed or co -administered should be stated. This is particularly important for medicines to be reconstituted and/or diluted before paren teral administration. Significant interaction problems, e.g. sorption of products or product components to syringes, large volume parenteral containers, tubing, in -line filters, administration sets, etc. should be stated. Statements concerning compatibili ty of the product with other medicines or devices should not be included in this section but in section 6.6. Statements concerning pharmacological and chemical/physical incompatibilities with food should be included in section 4.5. If appropriate, the stan dard statement, 'Not applicable' (e.g. solid oral pharmaceutical forms) , should be included. For certain pharmaceutical forms, e.g. parenterals, either of the following standard statements should be included as appropriate: 'In the absence of compatibil ity studies, this medicine must not be mixed with other medicines.' 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 34 of 39 'This medicine must not be mixed with other medicines except those mentioned in section 6.6.' 6.3 Shelf life The shelf life should be given for the medicine as packaged for sale and, if ap propriate, after dilution or reconstitution or after first opening. A clear statement of the shelf life should be given, in an appropriate unit of time. Storage conditions should be specified according to the Note for Guidance on declaration of storage conditions in the product information of medicinal products . For statements to be inclu ded regarding in -use shelf life of sterile products, consult the Note for Guidance on maximum shelf life for sterile products for human use after first opening or followi ng reconstitution. An in -use shelf life may need to be stated for other medicines if development studies have found it to be necessary. Additionally, if different concentrations need to be prepared, e.g. for use in children, the physicochemical stability throughout the entire concentrati on range should be stated, e.g. \"The stability has been demonstrated between x mg/mL and y mg/mL for t hours/days at 25 \u00baC and 2-8 \u00baC\". In case of a paediatric indication, if no age appropriate formulation is available for children but an extemporaneous formulation could be prepared from an existing formulation, relevant physicochemical data on storage and stability should be included here with a cross -reference in sections 6.4 and 6.6.\" In case of specific temporary stora ge conditions need ing to be provided to health care providers or patients, e.g. for the purpose of ambulatory use (e.g. shelf -life 24 months at 2 - 8\u00b0C of which 3 months could be below 25\u00b0C), specific additional guidance should be provided as appropriate. Su ch information should always be based on stability data. In particular, the recommended temperature range and maximum duration of temporary storage should be specified. This guidance may also include the action to be taken after the product has been store d under the temporary storage conditions (e.g. discard immediately). Statements such as \"These data are not recommendations for storage\" should not be used. No reference should be made to the container unless there are different shelf lives for differen t containers. Storage conditions should not be included, except for the storage conditions after opening (see the corresponding guideline). Statements such as 'Do not use after the expiry date' should not be included. When a device is supplied together w ith a medicine, the in -use shelf -life of the device should be given where applicable. 6.4 Special precautions for storage Storage warnings should use one or more of the standard statements from the Note for Guidance on declaration of storage conditions in t he product information of medicinal products . When such a standard statement is used, an explanation specifying whether the product is sensitive to light and/or moisture should be added. For storage of sterile products that have been opened , diluted or reconstituted, a cross - reference should be made to section 6.3. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 35 of 39 Note that if a specific storage warning is required, the warning should be consistent between the PI, label and PIL. A warning to keep the product out of the reach and sight of children should not be included in the PI. If there are no special precautions for storage, the statement \"This medicine does not require any special storage conditions\" should be included. 6.5 Nature and contents of container Reference should be made to the immediate container using the European Pharmacopoeia standard term; the material of construction of the immediate container should be stated ( e.g., 'glass vials', 'PVC/Aluminium blisters', 'HDPE bottles'); and any other component of the product should be listed, e.g. needles, swabs, measuring spoons, syringes inhaler devices, desiccant. The graduation on measuring devices should be explained. The container of any solvent provided with the medicine should also be described. Excessive detail, e.g., conce rning the colour of the stopper, the nature of the heat -seal lacquer, should usually not be included. For parenteral preparations, when enclosure colour is used to differentiate between the presentations of a product, this should be stated here. If approp riate, it should be indicated if the container closure is child -resistant. Examples on the text in this section: '<Volume> mL suspension in a pre -filled syringe (glass) with plunger stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) with or without needle in pack sizes of 5 or 10.' 'HDPE bottle with a child -resistant closure and a silica gel desiccant. Pack -sizes of 30, 60 or 90 film -coated tablets.' All pack sizes should be listed. Pack sizes mentioned should include the n umber of units, number of doses (for e.g. multi -dose vaccines, inhalers, etc.), total weight or volume of the immediate container, as appropriate, and the number of containers present in any outer carton. If appropriate, a standard statement, 'Not all pac k sizes may be marketed', should be included, in order to alert health care providers to the fact that not all listed pack sizes may be available for prescribing or dispensing. Multiple unit packs for distribution purposes only do not constitute new pack sizes for marketing of the product and should therefore not be included in this section. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal <and other handling> Instructions for disposal should be included here, if appropriate for the product. Where special precautions fo r the handling and disposal of certain products such as cytotoxics and some biological products or waste material derived from it are advised, e.g. in the case of products containing live organisms, these should be stated in this section, as should, where relevant, the disposal of items which come into contact with the product, or spoons used to administer oral vaccines. If relevant, a cross -reference to conclusions on the environmental risk assessment described in section 5.3 can be included. If applicabl e, e.g. for cytotoxics, the following standard statement should be included, 'Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.' If there are no special uses or handling instructions for the pharmacist or ot her health care 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 36 of 39 providers , the standard statement, 'No special requirements.' should be included. Any directions necessary for the accurate preparation of certain products such as cytotoxics and some biological products and/or necessary for the protectio n of persons including parents or caregivers preparing or handling the product should be stated. In section 4.2, instructions on handling of the product by the doctor, other health care provider , or patient should be included, as well as general informati on concerning the administration of the product (whether administered by the patient or the health care provider ). If instructions for use/handling are needed where the medicine has to be prepared before use, e.g. where it must be suspended or diluted, thi s information has to be given here. For clarity, a cross -reference in section 4.2 to the relevant information in section 6.6 could be included, e.g. 'For instructions on dilution of the product before administration, see section 6.6.' It is recommended t hat only information necessary for the pharmacist or other health care provider to prepare the product for administration to the patient should be included here. Information on the preparation (e.g. the suspe nsion of a powder for injection or preparing a dilution) of the medicine should be included in section 6.6, regardless of who prepares the product (e.g. pharmacist, doctor, other health care provider , patient, parents or caregivers). In the case of products for reconstitution, the appearance of the pr oduct after reconstitution should be stated. Statements concerning compatibility of the product with other medicines or devices can be given here provided the data have been provided in the dossier. In the exceptional cases where a product is indicated in children and where no adequate paediatric formulation can be developed (based on duly justified scientific grounds), information on extemporaneous formulation should appear under a sub -heading \"Use in the paediatric population\" and should cross -refer t o section 4.2. Detailed instructions for the preparation of the extemporaneous formulation from the appropriate \"adult\" or other \"older children\" dosage form and additional information on extemporaneous formulations for use in younger children shall be pro vided and, where appropriate, the maximum storage time during which such preparation will conform to its specifications. When necessary, the required packaging material and storage conditions should be stated here. Any specific warnings for the handling o f the product should be in section 4.4. Information on risks due to occupational exposure should be included in this section, with cross -reference to section 4.4 or 4.8 if there is information in that section. 7 HOLDER OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION Name and permanent address or registered place of business of the Holder of Certificate of Registration. Telephone, fax numbers or e -mail addresses may be included (not websites or emails linking to websites). 8 REGISTRATION NUMBER(S) Item to be completed by SAHPRA or by the Holder of Certificate of Registration once the authorisation has been granted. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 37 of 39 9 DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION The date on the registration certificate of the medici ne. 10 DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT Leave blank in the case of a first application for registration . The date of the most recently revised PI as approved by SAHPRA [for example date of approval of a variation, Urgent Safety Restriction notice, or any other variation that has been approved/considered approved according to the timelines stipulated in the 2.08 Variations Addendum for Human and Veterinary Medicines ]. 11 DOSIMETRY (IF APPLICABLE) Full details of internal radiation dosimetry should be included in this section for radiopharmaceuticals. For all other products, this section should be excluded. 12 INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS (IF APPLICABLE) For radiopharmaceuticals, additional detailed instructions for extemporaneo us preparation and quality control of such preparation and, where appropriate, maximum storage time during which any intermediate preparation such as an eluate or the ready -to-use pharmaceutical will conform to its specifications. Special instructions rel ating to the disposal of containers and unused contents should also be included. 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 38 of 39 ANNEX THE MEDICAL DICTIONARY FOR REGULATORY ACTIVITIES TERMINOLOGY (MedDRA) All ADRs should be grouped according to the following order based on the MedDRA system organ cl asses (SOC). As a general rule, MedDRA terms should be classified according to the most relevant SOC related to the target organ. A pragmatic approach to the location of terms should be taken in order to make the identification of adverse reactions simpl er and clinically appropriate for the reader. For example, it may be helpful on some occasions - solely in the context of the PI - to use secondary SOC locations of some MedDRA Preferred Terms (PT), or sometimes to use locations that do not strictly accord with the MedDRA architecture. For example, if the PT 'Liver function test abnormal', ' Hepatitis' and ' Hepatic encephalopathy ' are to be included in a PI, it would be acceptable to include them all under the SOC 'Hepatobiliary disorders' instead of distrib uting the Hepatobiliary disorders', 'Nervous system disorders' and 'Investigations' as dictated by their primary location in MedDRA. SOC LIST Infections and Infestations Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cyst s and polyps) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Immune system disorders Endocrine disorders Metabolism and nutrition disorders Psychiatric disorders Nervous system disorders Eye disorders Ear and labyrinth disorders Cardiac disorders Vascular disorders Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Gastrointestinal disorders Hepato disorders Skin subcutaneous tissue disorders Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 2.16_Guideline for Professional Information for Human Medicines (Categories A and D)_Jul19_v2.docx Page 39 of 39 Renal and urinary disorders Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal condi tions Reproductive system and breast disorders Congenital, familial and genetic disorders General disorders and administration site conditions Investigations Injury, poisoning and procedural complications Surgical and medical procedures Social circumstance s Product issues Adverse reaction descriptions should be based on the most suitable representation within the MedDRA terminology. This will usually be at the PT level, although there may be instances where the use of Lowest Level Terms (LLT) or group terms , such as high -level terms (HLT) may be appropriate. It is acceptable to adapt the names of the MedDRA group terms if this makes their meaning more transparent to the reader of the PI; e.g. the use of the suffixes NEC and NOS are not appropriate for inclus ion in the PI. The adverse reaction term should be expressed in natural word order, e.g. 'Interstitial pneumonia' in preference to 'Pneumonia interstitial'. It may be appropriate to modify MedDRA terms in other ways in the interests of comprehensibility. T he most widely recognised term for a particular condition should be used, e.g. the use of 'Churg Strauss syndrome' might be more appropriate than the use of 'Allergic granulomatous angiitis'. Within each MedDRA SOC, adverse reactions should be classified according to their frequency of occurrence. Prior to estimating frequency of occurrence of adverse events from systematic studies (clinical trials or other sources), appropriate levels of the MedDRA hierarchy should be used in order to group together clini cally related conditions in a meaningful way. For example, if 'postural dizziness', 'exertional dizziness' and 'unspecified dizziness' were each reported by 2% of patients, this might reasonably be represented in the PI as 'Dizziness' occurring in 6% of pa tients (assuming that only one report of dizziness applied to each patient). It may also be appropriate to use ad hoc groupings of terms, or to adapt MedDRA group terms if the established MedDRA group terms are not completely suitable, e.g. reports of adve rse reactions all reasonably be represented as the single term 'Diarrhoea' in the interest of making the PI relevant and comprehe nsible to patients. The total number of those cases should be used to estimate the "}
