All rights reserved.Extending beyond genomic explorations that have successfully identified proatherosclerotic pathways such as LPA and PCSK9 , several landmark papers this year reported on the identification of novel and rare genetic variants that highlight the involvement of additional processes in lipid metabolism which influence atherosclerotic risk (FIG. 1) . Nioi and colleagues described genetic determinants that contrib ute to variations in the level of atherogenic lipoproteins1. Apolipoprotein Bcontaining particles can be captured globally by measur ing non HDL cholesterol (non HDLc; cal culated by deducting HDL cholesterol from total choles t erol). Non HDLc is superior to LDL cholesterol in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, and the year 2016 marked the important discovery of a genetic associ a tion between variants affecting non HDLc and CAD and the protein asialo glycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1)1. ASGR1 is a lectin sub un it of the transmembrane protein asialoglyco p rotein receptor that has a critical role in serum glycoprotein homeo stasis. In genetic discovery studies that initially involved approximately 400,000 Icelandic individuals, which were then validated in case-control studies from five European ances try cohorts of a pproximately 300,000 individ uals, c arriers (approximately 1 in of noncoding 12basepair dele tion in intron 4 of ASGR1 were found to have reduced non HDLc levels, and an accom panying marked reduction in risk of CAD1. Carriers of this lossoffunction genetic variant had a mean 15 m g/dl reduction in non HDLc, a ~34% reduction in myocardial infarction risk, Hypertriglyceridaemia is another well established cardiovascular risk factor. The important role of angiopoietin related pro tein 4 (ANGPTL4) in modulating triglyceride levels by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and in reducing the risk of CAD were validated in two separate large scale genomic analyses in 2016 (REFS 2,3). had than noncarriers; these mutations were also associ ated with protection from CAD 2. Furthermore, a lossoffunction variant mutation in LPL (p.D36N) was associated with increased CAD risk, whereas a gainoffunction vari ant (p.S447*) was associated with reduced risk of CAD2. In an independent investiga tion reported this year, carriers of the E40K variant and 13 other monoallelic inactivating mutation variants of ANGPTL4 all had lower triglyceride levels and higher HDLc levels than noncarriers, and were less likely to have CAD 3. In addition, monoclonal antibody inhib it ion of the ANGPTL4 protein in both mouse and nonhuman primate models resulted in a reduction in triglyceride levels 3. and a lifespan prolonged by 1.5 years compared with noncarriers 1. The mechanisms under l ying the pronounced athero p rotective effects of this variant, however, are unclear. This study thus reported that lossoffunction mutations in ASGR1 result in non HDLc reductions and marked protection from CAD, and identify ASGR1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment and/or p revention of CAD1. ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN 2016 Advances in new therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis W. H. Wilson Tang and Stanley L. Hazen In 2016, advances in atherosclerosis research were focused on the discovery and validation of new targets with genetic and mechanistic links to atherothrombotic heart disease. Novel targets include proteins involved in glycoprotein recognition and clearance, regulators of triglyceride-rich particle metabolism, inflammatory pathways that impair efferocytosis, and the gut microbiome. Nature Reviews Thrombosis Figure 1 | Newly discovered mechanistic pathways leading to development and progression of atherosclerosis. Large-scale genomic studies revealed rare variants that alter the function of novel proteins involved in glycoprotein clearance (asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 [ASGR1]), triglyceride-rich particle metabolism (angiopoietin-related protein 4 [ANGPTL4]), and defective efferocytosis (CD47), which are linked to coronary artery disease. Gut microorganism-associated metabolism of dietary nutrients that are abundant in Western diets lead to the generation of the metabolite trimethylamine N -oxide (TMAO) , which is associated with enhanced coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden, heightened platelet responsiveness, and thrombotic complications. Therapeutic interventions with antibodies against PCSK9 in humans reduce LDL-cholesterol levels, inhibit coronary atherosclerosis progression, and promote plaque regression, whereas anti -CD47 therapy in animal models provides proof -of-concept validation for inhibition of atherosclerosis. mAB, monoclonal antibodies. MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 1 CARDIOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.Despite the strong inverse association between HDLc and CAD risk, results from therapeutic intervention trials targeting HDLc levels have yielded frustratingly negative findings. Perhaps some of the confusion sur rounding HDLc was clarified through genomic analyses published this year of rare variants in individuals with high HDLc. Mice with a Scarb1 knockdown have markedly el evated HDLc levels and paradoxically increased risk of atherosclerosis 4. Targeted sequencing of coding regions of lipid modifying genes in 328 individuals with high plasma HDLc levels led to the identification of a homozygote muta tion for a lossoffunction variant impairs post tra nslational pro cessing of the scavenger receptor class B mem ber 1 protein and abrogates selective HDLc uptake in transfected cells 4. Carriers of this SCARB1 variant showed paradoxically elevated HDLc and an increased risk of CAD. Progress has also been made this year in interventional studies for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Findings from the GLAGOV study 5 suggest that PCSK9 inhibition might reverse coronary atherosclerosis via incre mental LDL c holesterol lowering, even in the presence of aggressive statin therapy. Statin treated patients ( n = 938) with angiographic CAD were prospectively randomly assigned to subcutaneous evolocumab (a PCSK9 inhibitor) or placebo for 76 weeks and assessed by serial intravascular coronary ultrasono gra phy5. Compared with placebo, the evolocumab group had lower LDL c holesterol levels (as low as 20 mg/dl), had a greater decrease in ather oma volume, and showed plaque regression in a greater proportion of patients, without serious adverse effects. Although the study was not powered to assess clinical outcomes, major adverse cardiac events were numerically reduced with evolocumab therapy. These findings suggest that PCSK9 inhibition in the setting of intensive statin therapy can influ ence plaque progression and foster reversal of atherosclerosis. Further mechanistic links between inflam mation and atherosclerosis have also been explored 6. Advanced lesions at risk of rup ture are characterized by accumulation of diseased vascular cells and apoptotic cellular debris; why these cells are not cleared within atheroma remains unknown. Upregulation of CD47, an antiphagocytic molecule (a 'don't eat me' signal) known to render malignant cells resistant to programmed cell removal (effero cytosis), occurs during atherogenesis (FIG. 1) . Impaired efferocytosis might have a patho genic role in cardiovascular disease. In a 2016 study, CD47 was upregulated in both human coronary and and NFB1dependent process that results in inhibition of efferocytosis6. Moreover, administration of CD47blocking antibodies reversed the defect in efferocytosis, normal ized the clearance of diseased vascular tissue, and ameliorated atherosclerosis in multi ple mouse models through the TNFdriven programmed cell removal process6. Multiple advances were reported this year on the role of the gut microbiome in athero thrombosis. A link between gut microorganisms and atherosclerotic plaque development was first established in 2011, in which untargeted metabolomic and functional studies led to the discovery of the athero genic metabolite trimethylamine Noxide (TMAO)7. In a 2016 study of patients with stable CAD undergoing coronary angio gra phy and plaque characterization, elevated plasma level of TMAO was shown to predict coronary athero sclerotic burden more powerfully than traditional cardiac risk factors8. Microbial prod uction of TMAO was also reported to serve as a novel mech anism linking diet and specific gut microbiota with induction of heightened plate let responsiveness and enhanced thrombosis potential in vivo in both humans and other animals 9. Initial clinical studies (n = 4,007) reported that plasma levels of TMAO indepen dently predicted the risk of thrombotic events, and subsequent mechanistic studies showed that TMAO enhanced submaximal stimulus dependent platelet activation by multiple ago nists through augmented Ca2+ release from intracellular stores9. Complementary animal model studies employing dietary choline or TMAO, germ free mice, and microbial trans plantation collectively confirmed a role for gut microbiota and TMAO in modulating platelet hyper responsiveness and thrombosis potential in vivo , and plasma thrombosis poten tial9. In another study, nonlethal inhibition of the rate limiting microbial enzyme involved in generating TMAO from dietary choline was also shown to serve as a novel approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis 10. These studies highlight the potential of targeting TMAO levels for the pr evention and treatment of atherothrombosis. In summary, numerous notable advances in atherosclerosis research were made in 2016. The power of genomics and other 'omics' tech nologies for discovery of new pathways linked to CAD development has begun to be realized, and has the potential to expand the number of therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis.

NGS has a detection rate approaching 100% and a false positive rate of almost 0%, but NGS is currently too expensive for population scale screening. Although FH prevalence has historically been estimated at 1/500 in outbred populations, the true prev alence of FHcausing mutations now seems to be between 1/250 and 1/300. In Denmark, 98,098 participants from the Copenhagen General Population Study 1 were genotyped for three common LDLR mutations and the most common APOB mutation1. The prevalence of the four mutations was 1/565, accounting for about 39% of all pathogenic mutations in the country, and representing an estimated prev alence of FHmutation carriers of 1/217 in the general population 1. In the UK, Wald et al. aimed to identify adults with FH by measuring cholesterol levels in 10,094 children at routine immuniza tion v isits (median age 12.7 months)2. The investigators identified 45 children with FH; 37 had total cholesterol levels >5.31 m mol/l (205 m g/dl; 95th percentile) and a detected FH mutation, and eight had repeated LDLC recordings 5.90 m mol/l (228 m g/dl; 99th percentile) and no detected mutation. Mutation carrier prevalence was 1/273 (37/10,094). We previously demon strated that such individ u als without a monogenic cause of FH probably have a polygenic aetiology for their FH phenotype, with coinheritance of a greater than average number of common LDLCraising alleles of m odest effect3. When testing parents of children with confirmed FH, Wald et al. identi f ied 40 parents who also met the criteria for FH diagnoses2, demonstrating the feasibil ity of the approach in primary care. In the UK, in patients with FH in whom a monogenic cause is found, approximately 93% have a mutation in LDLR, 5% in APOB, and 2% in PCSK9 . Mutations in other genes have been proposed, but none has been independently confirmed. By contrast, 40% of the detected FH mutations in the Wald study were the APOB (p.R3527Q) mutation \u2014 a recognized cause of less severe FH than most LDLR mutations. Universal screening, therefore, identified many individuals with a genetic predisposition to milder hypercholes terolaemia, but who might be at less elevated risk of CHD than LDLR mutation carriers. Thus, although universal screening has value in identifying new f amilies with FH, this approach can also identify individ u als at com paratively low risk of cardio va scular disease, and guide decision making in s tatin t herapy where the risk-benefit balance is equivocal. The elevated risk of CHD in patients with FH with a detected mutation was confirmed in a population study4. Khera et al. used NGS for the known FH genes in 20,485 individ uals without CHD, of whom 1,386 levels >4.9 m mol/l (190 m g/dl), and of these, 24 (1.7%) had a known FH mutation. Individuals with an LDLC level >4.9 m mol/l and no FH mutation had a six fold higher risk of CHD than individuals with an LDLC level <3.7 m mol/l (130 m g/dl) and no mutation, but individuals with both an LDLC level >4.9 m mol/l and an FH muta tion had a 22fold higher risk. This increased risk is explained by the substantially higher accumulated 'LDLC burden' in patients who have had g enetically determined, lifelong, high LDLC levels. Dilated cardiomyopathy is found in up to 1/250 in the general population, and is commonly caused by truncating mutations in the titin gene (TTN ). TTN truncating variants occur in about 1% of the general population, but not all carriers develop dilated cardio myopathy.

Swerdlow and Steve E. Humphries Much of the progress in cardiovascular genetics in 2016 has been driven by next-generation sequencing studies, and the clinical utility of knowing an individual's genotype for predicting their risk of cardiovascular disease is gaining credibility, both for monogenic and polygenic disorders. Additionally, phenotype data are increasingly abundant, although databases linking genotype with clinically relevant phenotypes require optimization.

All rights reserved.this 'vari able penetrance' , Shafer et al. used rat models and human cardiac imaging and genomic data5. TTN truncating variants caused nonsense mediated degradation of the mutant protein and altered cardiac metabolism in the rat model, and cardiac physiology was normal in young mutant rats but became impaired during stress. To define cardiac effects in the general population, Shafer et al. sequenced TTN in 1,409 healthy volunteers, and examined cardiac morphology and function with cardiac magnetic resonance. TTN truncating variant carriage was associated with a phenotypic continuum of eccentric cardiac remodelling from healthy to severe disease 5. As with FH, rare, highly penetrant mutations lead to severe disease, but less dele terious variants in the same gene cause a spectrum of cardiac dysfunction. Using a genetic risk score (GRS) with 50 variants identified in genome wide associ ation studies (GW AS) to be associated with risk of CHD, Khera et al. compared genetically det ermined and lifestyle r elated risk of CHD in three prospective, USA and Swedish cohorts (n 56,000; 5,103 CHD events)6. Healthy lifestyle was a composite of no current smoking, no obesity, regular phys ical activity, and healthy diet. Results were consistent across studies and between ancestral groups, and risk of incident CHD was 91% higher among individuals in the high est compared with the lowest GRS quintile 6. The association between GRS and a family history of premature CHD was modest but significant. Unsurprisingly, an unhealthy lifestyle (absence of at least three of the four factors above) was related to a substantially higher (80%) risk of CHD, and the genetic and lifestyle risk scores had essentially cumu lative effects. Individuals at high genetic risk who had a healthy lifestyle had lower over all risk of CHD than those with high genetic risk and an unhealthy lifestyle. In a substudy of 4,260 individuals, both genetic and life style factors were associated with coronary artery calcification 6.The debate over the relationship between blood lipids and risk of CHD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to intensify as results of outcome trials of novel pro protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are awaited. Little doubt remains that reducing LDLC levels dimin ishes the risk of CHD, and doing so with statins increases the risk of T2DM 7 (FIG. 1) . White et al. used Mendelian randomization to explore the causal relationships between the three major lipid fractions \u2014 HDL cho lesterol (HDLC), LDLC, and triglycerides \u2014 and risk of CHD and T2DM 8. Importantly, these analyses were executed with novel meth ods and with publicly available GW AS data. As expected, both LDLC and triglycerides had positive causal relationships with risk of CHD, but higher HDLC was not associated with lower risk of CHD after accounting for pleiotropy of the genetic instruments 8. Higher LDLC and HDLC levels were associated with lower risk of T2DM, suggesting that altered lipid fractions per se , rather than speci fic therapeutic me chanisms, can mo dulate glucose homeostasis. The risk of T2DM associated with individ ual, therapeutic, lipid mo dulatory mech anisms remains an area of interest9. Given the now confirmed increased risk of T2DM with statins, attention rests on whether a simi lar risk increase will be observed in phase III trials of PCSK9 inhibitors. Identification of functional gene vari an ts in proposed cardio vascular disease aetiological pathways has allowed focused exploration through Mendelian randomization of causal contrib utions of cardio vas cular disease as sociated lipid traits. Schmidt et al. showed that common PCSK9 variants, used as proxies for pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme, were associated with lower LDLC levels, higher blood glucose levels, higher body weight, and higher risk of T2DM (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.50 per 1 mm ol/l reduction in LDLC level)10. These findings were confirmed in other genetic analyses, and emphasize the importance of diabetes outcomes in ongoing PCSK9 inhibitor phase III trials. The year 2016 has brought substan tial advances in our understanding of the genetic architecture of cardiovascular dis ease, although much uncharted territory remains, perhaps most strikingly in common, nonmonogenic heart failure. The HERMES consortium on heart failure genetics is set to address this issue in 2017 and its findings, along with those of many other ongoing efforts, are hotly awaited. Daniel I.

ARRHYTHMIAS IN 2016 Arrhythmia treatment \u2014 evidence catching up with technology Benjamin A. Steinberg and Jonathan P . Piccini Clinical cardiac electrophysiology has evolved rapidly over the past 2 decades. Although the fast pace of technical and therapeutic advances has occasionally outpaced evidence supporting widespread effectiveness, the highlights of electrophysiology research in 2016 illustrate the emergence of robust evidence for implementation of several important therapies. The implantable cardioverter- def ibrillator (ICD) has been available for >2 decades, but our understanding of the patients who benefit most from primary prevention ICD therapy continues to evolve. Historically, randomized trials have provided the most robust evidence and support for its use in patients with stable ischaemic cardiomyo p athy complicated by symptomatic heart failure. However, on the basis of the findings from the SCD HeFT study1, primary prevention ICDs are also routinely used in patients with non i schaemic cardio myopathy2. Nonetheless, the clinical benefit of ICDs in patients with non i schaemic cardiomyopathy is less c ertain. The publi cation of the DANISH trial3 in early 2016 provided additional evidence to help guide primary prevention therapy in this popula tion. The investi g ators randomly assigned 1,116 patients nonischaemic cardio myopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction <35% to usual clinical care with or without an ICD. The overall study showed no signifi cant bene f it of ICD therapy for the primary end point of all cause mortality at median followup of 67.6 months. However, there are important caveats to consider when evaluat ing these results, particu l ar when comparing with earlier studies of primary prevention ICD therapy in non i schaemic cardio m yopathy3. First, guideline dir ected medical therapy for heart failure was ideal: >90% of patients received b lockers and hirds received mineralo co rticoid receptor antagonists. Despite their proven benefits, <30% of patients with heart failure receive mineralocorticoid r eceptor antago nists in clinical practice4. More importantly, nearly 60% of patients overall received cardiac resynchronization therapy \u2014 a therapy with proven survival advantage in this population 5. Additionally, findings from the DANISH study3 showed substantial hetero g eneity across patient age groups \u2014 younger patients seem to benefit from ICD therapy, and the risk of s udden cardiac death was signifi cantly reduced in the overall trial population. Taken together, these data indicate that over all treatment of patients with non i schaemic cardio m yopathy has improved dramatically, including both better pharmacological and device based interventions. Primary preven tion ICDs are likely to be beneficial in this context, in which com p eting risks of non sudden cardiac death are low. Additional stud ies should help to identify how to tailor ICD therapy to best balance the risks and benefits. Given that ICDs prevent sudden cardiac death when ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation has occurred, preven tion of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias is a critically important goal. Antiarrhythmic therapy has been shown to be beneficial, but is frequently inadequate and clinicians often turn to catheter ablation in patients with medically refractory VT, despite limited data from headtohead randomized comparisons between antiarrhythmic therapy and cath eter ablation. Investigators in the V ANISH trial 6 enrolled 259 patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy complicated by VT despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy. They were ran domly assigned to ablation ( n = 132) or escal drug n = 127; amiodarone or amiodarone plus mexiletine), and followed up for a mean of 27.9 months for the primary composite end point of death, VT storm, or appropriate ICD shock 6. Importantly, the pro tocol allowed for broad approaches in the ablation arm (FIG. 1 ), including activation map ping and substrate based ablation in patients with haemodynamically unstable VT, and recommended targeting of all induced VTs. Patients assigned to ablation had a significant reduction in the primary end point (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98, P = 0.04), w hich was pri marily driven by arrhythmia reduction6. Therefore, the V ANISH trial6 findings provide important confirmatory evidence for the use and effectiveness of catheter ablation to treat refractory ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Future trials should clarify whether catheter ablation might be preferred to antiarrhythmic drugs for first line therapy given the risks and toxicities associated with these medications. The past year has also brought additional evidence to guide management of the most common sustained arrhythmia, atrial fibril lation (AF). Occasionally, AF manifests in the setting of a perceived 'reversible' cause, such as acute medical illness, thyrotoxicosis, or cardiac surgery. In this setting, AF treat ment has generally been conservative, with few data to guide management. In early 2016, the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network published the results of a randomized trial of rate control versus rhythm control for post operative AF 7. Notably, one third of patients without AF before the procedure subsequently developed AF after elective bypass or valve surgery ( n = 695). T hese patients were then Key advances Primary prevention with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for nonischaemic cardiomyopathy should be individualized on the basis of competing risks 3 Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia should be recommended for patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia refractory to drug therapy 6 Conservative management is appropriate for patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation complicating cardiac surgery; however, long-term surveillance is important given increased risks of future atrial fibrillation 7 Cryoballoon ablation seems to be as safe and effective as radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 10... clinicians often turn to catheter ablation in patients with medically refractory VT , despite limited data...

However, roughly one qu arter of each group crossed over to the opposite treatment arm. In total, 24% of patients in the rhythm co ntrol group did not receive the full course of amiodarone and reverted to rate co ntrol medications, and 26.7% of patients in the rate control group eventually received amiodarone and/or direct current cardio v ersion7. The primary end point of hospitaliza ti on days within 60 days of randomization was not significantly dif ferent between the two groups. Perhaps more importantly, >80% of all patients did not have AF after discharge, and >90% of all patients were in a stable rhythm without AF after 30-60 days. Though the trial was not without limitations, the overall data provide support for a conservative approach in these patients, with strong reassurance that AF is unlikely to recur during short term fo llow up . However, additional data are needed to clarify the use of long term surveillance, given that patients who develop AF after ca rdiac sur gery are at high risk of re current AF. The use of catheter ablation to treat symp tomatic recurrent AF is increasing, and guide lines have evolved to include catheter ablation as first line treatment in selected patients8. Ablation technologies have also improved, allowing for more efficient and effective pulmonary vein isolation, and now include cryo balloon catheters. This approach previ ously compared favourably to antiarrhythmic therapy among patients with symptomatic paroxys m al AF9, but until this year, there were few trials comparing cryoablation with stan dard radiofrequency ablation. In 2016, the FIRE AND ICE trial10 reported the noninferiority of the cryo ba lloon approach compared with radiofrequency ablation. The investigators randomly assigned 762 patients with drug re fractory, symptomatic, paroxysmal AF to ablation with tradi ti onal radiofrequency ablation method; the primary end point was the first arrhythmic recurrence after a stand ard 90day blanking period (mean followup of 1.5 years). The noninferiority margin was predefined at a hazard ratio of 1.43, and the trial met this threshold for equivalent effi cacy (34.6% P <0.001 for noninferiority)10. Importantly, the safety end point of death, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, or treatment related adverse events (including phrenic nerve palsy), was not significantly different between the groups. These data prov ide reassurance that a potentially simpler ablation approach might be equally safe and effective in selected patients. However, the trial included only patients with paroxysmal AF, and although the mean duration of AF was >4 years, the patients' left atrial diame ters were fairly small (40 mm) a nd the over all cohort was fairly young (70% were aged 65 years), with low CHA 2DS2V ASc scores (1.8-1.9)10. Cryoablation in older, higher r isk Figure 1 | Point-by-point activation mapping for ablation of scar and border zones. The VANISH trial6 utilized several different methods of ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. In the case of haemodynamically significant VT , point -by-point activation mapping and/or entrainment mapping was performed. When haemodynamically unstable VT (300 ms) was induced, bipolar voltage mapping in sinus rhythm was used to identify scar and associated border zones. Pacemapping from border zones was used to guide linear ablation along the border zones until the tissue was unexcitable. When VT with a cycle length <300 ms or ventricular fibrillation was induced, substrate modification was performed via elimination of late potentials within areas of voltage map scar.patients with symptomatic, longstanding, persistent AF is unlikely to be as effective. Additionally, both radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation technologies have evolved considerably during the course of this trial, and now include contact force sensing radio frequency catheters, and a redesigned, second generation cr yoballoon catheter. In summary, 2016 brought us several well conducted clinical trials representing some of the best quality evidence in contempor ary clinical cardiac electrophysio lo gy. Future trials in the coming years should build on their progress, helping clinicians to apply these tech nologies where they are most likely to have the greatest effect. Benjamin A.

Among these strategies were the optimal time for revascularization and optimal time for stenting in patients with STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These questions have been addressed two the FRISC II1,2 g relor) showed superiority over clopidogrel for patients with ACS in the TRITON TIMI 38 (REF. 4) and the PLATO5 studies; however, the two agents had not been directly com pared in a randomized study. Accordingly, the PRAGUE18 trial6 was conducted to compare prasugrel and ticagrelor anti p latelet therapy in patients with STEMI. Finally, the role of monitor in g antiplatelet therapy to optimize the anticoagulation regimen for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting remains in question after studies demonstrated that the strategy did not add value to the management of these patients 7,8. The ANTARCTIC trial9 was designed to explore the utility of platelet function monitoring for elderly patients with ACS undergoing coronary stenting. Over the past 2 decades, no consensus has emerged on the optimal time for inter vention in patients with ACS. The FRISCII study 1 was among the first to address this important question. The FRISCII trial1, con ducted in Scandinavia from 1996 to 1998, showed that early invasive treatment within 7 days of admission for the index event in patients with nonSTsegment elevation ACS significantly reduced the risk of death and myocardial infarction (MI) compared with noninvasive treatment 1. After 15 years of followup, the investigators now report that early revascularization postponed death or new MI (the primary end point) by an aver age of 18 months (mean of 549 days; 95% CI 204-888 days; P = 0.002) c ompared with the noninvasive strategy2. This effect was larger in patients who were nonsmokers, had elevated troponin T levels, or high concentrations of growth differentiation factor 15. The differ ence in the primary end point was driven mainly by delay of a new MI, because the early difference in mortality was not sustained over time. Early revascularization postponed death or readmission to hospital for ischaemic heart disease by a mean of 1,128 days (95% CI 830-1,366 days; P <0.0001), a benefit that was similar across all subgroups. The FRISCII study 1 suggests that an early invasive strat egy is the preferred option in most patients with nonSTsegment elevation ACS, and supports the need for early intervention in patients with ACS. As with STEMI, the focus should be on providing early intervention to optimize outcomes. PCI of the culprit lesion in patients with STEMI and multivessel disease is the common practice. PCI can often be associ ated with thrombotic complications and embolization that might complicate the procedure. This issue led to the hypothesis that deferring stent implantation in these patients might improve outcomes. The DANAMI 3DEFER trial 3 was designed to assess whether deferred stenting reduced the risk of impaired coro n ary blood flow and improved the clinical course of patients with STEMI compared with conventional PCI. Among 1,215 patients with chest pain lasting 12 h and STsegment elevation in whom a stabilized TIMI flow 2-3 was achieved with minimal lesion manipulation, deferred stenting did not improve the com posite primary end point of all cause death, hospitalization for heart failure, recurrent infarction, or target v essel revasculariza tion after a median of 42 months compared with immedi a te stenting. Mortality and hospitaliza t ion for heart failure numerically favoured deferred stenting, but this differ ence was compensated by a significantly higher rate of target vessel revascular iza tion, mainly owing to 11 patients who had either recurrent symptoms or STsegment e levation and returned prematurely for stent implant ation. At 18 months after treatment, an echo cardiographic evaluation in two t hirds of the patients showed left ventricular function was slightly better in the deferred stenting group than in the conventional PCI group (60% versus 57%; P = 0.04). Procedure related complications were not significantly different between the groups. The investi gators concluded that routine deferred stent implan t ation did not reduce the inci dence of death, heart failure, MI, or repeat revascular iza tion in patients with STEMI compared with conventional PCI3. These results are not surprising, and show that fear of complications should not deter us from stenting patients with STEMI. Instead of deferring stenting, other measures should be explored to prevent distal emboliza t ion, including minimiz i ng manipulation at the culprit lesion by direct stenting and optimal anti c oagulation. These strategies should be assessed in future studies. In the past decade, two second generation antiplatelet drugs \u2014 prasugrel and t icagrelor \u2014 became available for the treatment of patients with STEMI.

To compare the two med i cations directly, the trial6 investi g ators with ticagrelor in patients with acute STEMI who had undergone PCI. However, the trial was halted prematurely because an interim analy s is showed no difference between the two drugs for the primary end point of death, reinfarction, urgent target vessel revascular ization, stroke, serious bleeding requiring transfusion, or prolonged hospitalization at 7 days. The occurrence of the secondary end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or stroke at 30 days was also similar between both groups. The investigators concluded that these findings do not support the hypothesis that either prasugrel or ticagrelor is more effective or safer than the other in preventing ischaemic and bleeding events in the acute phase of MI in patients treated with primary PCI 6. However, the results of this study cannot be substantiated owing to the lack of statistical power and the early termination of the trial, and the rationale of a cutoff at 7 days rather than 30 days for the primary end point is in question. The results of this study confirm previous indirect com parisons between the two drugs and indicate a drug class effect, suggesting that physicians can use either prasu g rel or ticagrelor for the treatment of patients with STEMI.Platelet function testing has been pro posed to guide antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing PCI. Nevertheless, previous stud ies such as the GRAVITAS 7 and ARCTIC8 trials showed no benefit of platelet f unction testing with treatment modification in a low risk patient population and in stable patients undergoing elective stenting. However, the lowrisk patient population in the ARCTIC trial8 might have led to low event rates that were insufficient to demonstrate a signifi cant difference, and the antiplatelet therapy used was predomin a ntly clopidogrel. In the ANTARCTIC trial9, the investigators sought to show a benefit of platelet f unction test ing and treatment modifi c ation in a high risk patient population by using prasugrel, a more potent antiplatelet agent. A total of 877 patients with ACS, aged 75 years, who had undergone coronary stenting, were assigned to receive prasugrel (5 m g per day), with 442 patients randomly assigned to no monitoring or adjustment of medica tion, and 435 patients randomly allocated to monitor in g with a two step, platelet f unction testing with the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (Accriva Diagnostics, USA) at 14 days after randomiza t ion and at 14 days after treat ment adjustment, with treatment adjustment after each monitoring. Patients with high on t reatment platelet reactiv i ty (208 P2Y12 reaction units) had their prasugrel dose increased to 10 m g per day; patients with low ontreatment platelet reactiv i ty (85 P2Y12 reaction units) were switched to clopi dogrel (75 m g per day); and patients with 85-208 P2Y12 reaction units continued to receive prasugrel 5 m g per day. After the first platelet function testing, 182 patients (42%) were in the target range of platelet inhib i tion. After the two step treatment adjustment strategy, an additional 105 patients reached the prespecified target of platelet inhibition. A total of 171 patients (39%) in the monitor ing group were switched from prasugrel to clopidogrel for low on t reatment platelet reactivity, and only 16 patients (4%) had high platelet reactivity. Although 5 m g prasugrel was safe for the elderly population, the pri mary end point (a composite of cardio va scular death, MI, stroke, stent thrombosis, urgent revascular iza tion, and further bleeding com plication at 1 year), as well as rates of major and minor bleeding, occurred at a simi l ar rate in both arms of the study. The trial investi gators concluded that treatment adjustment on the basis of platelet function monitor ing did not improve the clinical outcome of elderly patients treated with coronary stent ing for ACS 9. These findings do not support the recom m endation in current guidelines to perform platelet function testing in patients at high risk of coronary artery disease, and will probably result in a change to the guidelines and a decline in the use of platelet function testing to individualize a ntiplatelet therapy. Overall, the 2016 data on ACS support early and complete intervention (if possible) in patients with ACS and STEMI. Either of the second generation antiplatelet therapies, prasugrel or ticagrelor, should be utilized in these patients, and probably routine platelet function monitoring during PCI no longer has a role in the management of these patients.

Vincent Rajkumar Data obtained in the past year underscored the benefit of a triplet regimen comprising bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma, and have provided high-level evidence supporting the safety of adding daratumumab to standard-of -care doublets for those with relapsed and/or refractory disease. As a result, achieving minimal residual disease-negativity at any stage of myeloma is now a realistic possibility. In 2015, we witnessed the approval of four new antimyeloma agents \u2014 panobinostat, elotu-zumab, ixazomib, and daratumumab \u2014 with vastly different mechanisms of action. By any measure, 2015 was a groundbreaking year for the multiple myeloma (MM) community; an encore performance would be no easy task, but 2016 undeniably passed muster as another year of breakthroughs, with the publication of a series of practice-changing studies 1-4. One overarching theme emerging from three major trials with results published in the past year is that the use of three-drug combination (tri - plet) regimens provides prolonged durations of remission compared with those achieved with doublet regimens in patients with either newly diagnosed or relapsed MM. A second impor - tant implication is that very deep therapeutic responses can be achieved in both of these patient populations, necessitating a revision of the assessment of response to therapy in MM 5. Until recently, considerable confusion sur - rounded the optimal approach to therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM6. Results from a few randomized trials had shown sur - vival benefits with certain novel regimens, but in these trials, newer regimens were compared with older melphalan-containing regimens 7; data showing an unequivocal survival benefit from trials that compared two modern regi- mens were not available. In the past year, we finally received evidence for a clear 'winner': the results of the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S0777 study 1, a phase III trial in 525 patients with newly diagnosed MM, decisively demonstrated marked improvements in the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival with the use of a bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexameth - asone lidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd; TABLE 1 ). Importantly, the findings demonstrated a median overall survival in excess of 6 years with use of the VRd regimen (75 months, compared with 64 months with Rd) 1, high - lighting a major improvement in the outcome of patients with MM. As a result, this triplet regimen is our recommended standard of care for initial therapy ( www.mSMART.org). Impressive as the results of the SWOG S0777 trial1 are, they do not fully capture the progress that has been made in MM therapy since that trial completed accrual in early 2012. Notably, we now have several new active regi - mens with which to treat relapsed disease 8, and thus the median overall survival observed in the S0777 cohort might underestimate the true therapeutic benefits that patients with MM can expect today. In this regard, daratumumab, a fully human IgG monoclonal antibody target - ing CD38, exemplifies the advances made to a much greater extent than any other new devel - opment. Daratumumab was initially approved by the FDA in 2015 based on the results of a small phase II study 9 that demonstrated the impressive activity of monotherapy with this agent in patients who had exhausted virtually all other available treatment options. The impli - cations were obviously vast, with the results serving as a 'springboard' for the initiation of trials to evaluate a host of daratumumab-based combination regimens. That the consequences of such integration would yield unprecedented results became evident only when the findings of the CASTOR 2 and POLLUX3 studies were released in rapid succession in 2016.

KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 9 CLINICAL ONCOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.In the CASTOR study2, 498 patients with relapsed MM were randomly assigned to receive daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexa - methasone (DVd), or bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd). The patients had received a median of two prior lines of therapy (range 1-10); about one -third were refractory to their previous treatment2. A prespecified interim analysis demonstrated substantially longer PFS and a higher ORR with the daratumum - ab-based triplet (TABLE 1) . These outstanding results led the independent data and safety monitoring committee to recommend offering daratumumab monotherapy to the patients in the control arm upon disease progression. The larger POLLUX trial 3 (n = 569) was published soon after CASTOR2, and confirmed that daratumumab is a seminal development in MM therapy. In the CASTOR study 2, Vd was used in both arms for a fixed duration ( \u00b1 dara - tumumab), after which the trial essentially became a comparison of continuous daratu - mumab (in the DVd arm) versus no therapy (in the Vd arm). POLLUX 3 had a superior design that enabled testing of the continuous use of a daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexa - methasone (DRd) triplet regimen versus the Rd doublet in patients with relapsed MM. The results were striking, and removed any doubts about the substantial activity of daratumumab: use of DRd resulted in an unprecedented 63% reduction in the risk of progression or death compared with that associated with Rd therapy 3 (TABLE 1 ). An important finding from both CASTOR and POLLUX2,3 was that a benefit of adding daratumumab to established doublets persisted irrespective of the number of prior lines of therapy \u2014 although, inarguably, greater benefit was noted when the triplet regimen was used earlier in the disease course. Another noteworthy finding of these two studies was that daratumumab-related infusion reactions occurred in 45-48% of patients, but >90% of these events occurred only upon the first infu - sion2,3, indicating that repeated dosing is safe. On the basis of these studies, DRd (in patients not refractory to full-dose lenalidomide) and DVd (in those refractory to lenalidomide) are our preferred treatment options at first MM relapse ( www.mSMART.org ). Both regimens were approved in November 2016 by the FDA for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. An impor - tant unknown factor is the relative effectiveness of these triplets in patients previously treated for a prolonged period with lenalidomide as initial therapy \u2014 a growing population that was not well-represented in CASTOR and POLLUX 2,3. With such substantive advances in MM therapy, updating of the 2008 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria to reflect the effectiveness of the newer combinations, and particularly to uniformly categorize the increased depth of response seen with these modern regimens, was inevitable 4. The advanced platforms of next- ge neration sequencing (NGS) and next-generation flow cytometry enable the detection of one MM cell among 10 5-106 cells present in the bone-marrow compartment. Additionally, the use of PET-CT enables comprehensive assessment of complete eradication of both intramedullary and extramedullary disease. Acknowledging the promise of new analytical methods to detect minimal residual disease (MRD), in 2016, the IMWG issued revised response criteria that, among other changes, include new MRD categories to standardize reporting across clinical trials 4. For a patient to be considered MRD-negative, they must have no phenotypically aberrant clonal plasma cells detectable in bone-marrow aspirates by either next-generation flow cytometry or NGS assays with a minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10 5 nucle - ated cells4. Two other MRD categories with additional requirements of normalization of PET-CT findings (imaging MRD-negative) and sustained negativity for at least 1 year (sustained MRD negative) were also defined 4. These changes reflect the importance of MRD status as a key prognostic marker, but this infor - mation alone is insufficient: response-adaptive trials are needed to determine whether results of MRD testing can guide treatment decisions, such as adding new drugs for MRD-positive patients, or stopping or reducing the duration of therapy for MRD-negative patients. The valuable information gleaned from these key studies in the past year has provided fresh perspectives and many moments of clarity in the increasingly complex field of MM ther - apy. For a patient diagnosed with MM in 2017, we now have treatments that can provide dura - ble remissions both in the newly diagnosed and Key advances The use of triplet regimens substantially improves the duration of remission compared with doublet regimens in the treatment of both newly diagnosed 1 and relapsed multiple myeloma (MM)2,3 In particular, the antiCD38 antibody daratumumab has emerged as an importantnew treatment option for patients with relapsed MM, and can be combined effectively with existing therapies 2,3 Achieving very deep responses to treatmentis now possible in patients with MM, necessitating the development of tools to assess minimal residual disease, and prompting revision of the response criteria 4relapsed settings. Daratumumab might, in the future, be added to several existing treatment regimens in three-drug and four-drug com - binations, and might soon be advanced to the frontline setting. We are very pleased with this progress, but also cognizant that much more needs to be achieved. The type of MM therapy we describe is unavailable in most parts of the world owing to regulatory and cost issues; this is simply unacceptable, as the survival benefits are striking 6,10. Conspicuously absent from MM studies performed to date are data regarding incremental costs and quality-of -life implica - tions related to managing MM with relentless therapy for many years. We have limited data on simultaneous, rather than the classic sequential, integration of newer drugs to the backbone regi - mens, as well as on the consequences of the fre - quent use of more-sensitive tools for response assessment. Finally, we need to continue to improve on outcomes because, as good as the results with novel regimens are, they still fall short of a cure. We are confident that ongoing trials in patients with MM are poised to move us in that direction, and anticipate the speed of progress to accelerate in the coming years. Prashant Kapoor and S.

SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER IN 2016 Shining light on novel targets and therapies Charles M. Rudin and John T. Poirier In 2016, the pace of biological insights into small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) was reflected in new treatment approaches that have suggested meaningful clinical benefit to patients. We focus on three highlights of 2016: preclinical studies defining NFIB as a putative driver of metastasis, and two clinical studies; one that assessed the efficacy of an agent targeting the Notch ligand DLL3, and the other that explored T - cell checkpoint-blockade therapies targeting PD -1 and CTLA -4. S. Bradbrook/Macmillan Publishers LimitedSmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been an extremely frustrating cancer for the oncologist to tackle \u2014 although tantalizingly chemo - responsive, and seemingly at the cusp of cure, this aggressive tumour type is typified by rapid recurrence, extensive metastatic dissemination, and a consistently dismal prognosis. The clini - cal armamentarium for patients with SCLC has changed minimally over several decades. In the past few years, however, we have witnessed an accelerating pace of biologi c al insights into the disease which, excitingly, began to bear fruit in 2016, with new treatment approaches showing meaningful clinical efficacy. Herein, we focus on three select highlights of 2016: preclinical studies defining the transcription factor NFIB as a putative driver of metasta - sis 1-3; and two clinical studies, one that assessed targeting the Notch ligand, delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) 4, and the other of drugs targeting the T-cell checkpoint receptors programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD T-lymphocyte-associated (CTLA - 4)5. A hallmark of SCLC is the predilection for early metastatic spread. Three studies1-3 were published in short succession in 2016, in which the use of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of metastatic SCLC, driven by lung-specific Cre-mediated inactivation of and Rb1, helped to elucidate putative drivers of metastasis. In this model system, tumours spontaneously acquire additional genetic alterations that are associated with acceleration of tumour progression and metas - tasis. Recurrently observed alterations include loss of the tumour suppressor gene Pten , as well as copy number gain of the o ncogenes Mycl and Nfib. All three studies focused primarily on the role of Nfib in tumour progression and metastasis. Data from previous studies showed that spontaneous amplification of Nfib is a common secondary genetic alteration in this model, and that Nfib expression is associated with an elevated risk of metastasis in patients, although amplifications of this gene are rarely observed in human cancers 6. All three groups found that Nfib drives a neural transcription programme that included genes regulating cell proliferation and migration. Semenova et al.2 and Wu et al.3 showed that spontaneous Nfib amplification was more common in metasta - ses than in primary tumours, and both groups demonstrated that enforced expression of Nfib accelerated tumour growth and metastasis, while also broadening the spectrum of meta - static sites. Semenova et al.2 further showed that while Nfib overexpression can cooperate with Mycl in accelerating tumour growth, the capacity to dramatically enhance metasta- sis and chromosomal instability was unique to Nfib. Denny et al. 1 introduced a fluorescent Cre reporter into the Trp53/Rb1 knockout mice to facilitate isolation of cancer cells from primary tumours and liver metastases at ultra-high purity. Strikingly, SCLC tumour clus-tered into distinct accessibility states, hyperaccessible state being associ - ated with Nfib amplification and metastasis. Delving deeper, the researchers demonstrated that binding of Nfib to gene-distal regulatory regions of the genome maintains site-specific chromatin accessibility and seems to increase expression of nearby genes. Together, these reports highlight the value of high-fidelity mouse models of cancer, especi - ally in a disease context (metastatic SCLC) in which human samples are rare. At present, the therapeutic implications of these findings remains unclear; historically, transcription factors have typically been recalcitrant thera- peutic targets. Further investigation into factors cooperating in the interaction between Nfib with chromatin, and a better understanding of how Nfib expression is induced and regulated is warranted to identify candidate therapeutic targets involved in disease progression and metastasis of human SCLC. Inhibition of the Notch developmental pathway has been implicated in the develop - ment of neuroendocrine precursors in the lung and, more recently, in SCLC oncogenesis 7. At the end of 2015, the inhibitory Notch ligand DLL3 was reported to be markedly aberrantly expressed The tumour-specific cell-surface expression of DLL3 provides a clear therapeutic opportunity. Preclinical testing of a novel antibody-drug conjugate with specificity for DLL3, impressive anti t and implicated DLL3 expression as a p redictive biomarker for efficacy of this agent8. In 2016, results of a first -in-human phase I clinical trial of Rova -T were reported4. This trial enrolled a total of 74 patients with recur - rent metastatic SCLC and eight patients with similarly recurrent large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung. The study defined a recommended schedule of administration, and identified dose-limiting toxicities that included thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and serosal effusions. Among the patients with SCLC treated at active dose levels, an overall objective response rate of 18% was observed. Perhaps most notably, the pre - clinical suggestion of a predictive biomarker for this targeted therapy seemed to hold up: among the patients from whom tumour mat - erial was available for correlative analyses, only those with high levels of expression of DLL3 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 11 CLINICAL ONCOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Among all patients in this DLL3 -high cohort (around two thirds of patients with SCLC) the con - firmed objective response rate was 38% (10 of 26 patients), the disease control rate 88% (23 of 26 patients), and 1 -year survival rate was 32%: these preliminary data are impressive in the context of recurrent metastatic SCLC. On this basis of these initial promising results, mul - tiple confirmatory phase II studies of Rova -T have been launched this year. No other area of clinical cancer research has generated more excitement than T -cel l check - point blockade: monoclonal anti , shown impressive activity in multiple malignancies. In 2016, the first studies eval - uating these agents in SCLC were reported. Antonia et al. 5 published the results of a phase I- II trial of the anti -PD-1 antibody nivolumab, with or without the anti-CTLA -4 a ntibody ipilimumab, in patients with recurrent SCLC. This study included 216 patients, 98 of whom were treated with nivolumab alone, with almost all of the remaining patients receiving one of two combination regimens: nivolumab 3 mg/ kg with ipilimumab 1 mg/ kg ev ery 3 weeks, or conversely, nivolumab 1 mg/kg w ith ipili - mumab 3 mg/kg on the same schedule. In gen - eral, the toxicity spectra observed were simi la r to those reported in other studies of these agents in patients with cancer, including grade 3-4 treatment- re lated adverse events in 13% of patients treated with nivolumab and in 19-30% of patients in the combination arms.Nivolumab alone was associated with a 10% response rate and a 32% disease control rate, while the com - bination treatment cohorts had response rates of 19-23% and disease- con trol rates of 36-42%. The 1 -year survival was 33% with nivolumab alone, and 35-43% in the combination arms. These impressive results led to incorporation of the nivolumab-ipilimumab combination regimen into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines for SCLC, in 2016. Many questions and opportunities in immunotherapy remain. In contrast to other cancers, PD -L1 positivity is rare in SCLCs, and does not seem to correlate with bene - fit from PD -1 directed therapy. The results of the study by Antonia et al.5 indicate that ipilimumab might augment the activity of nivolumab, although a recent phase III study of ipilimumab with or without chemotherapy in SCLC was entirely negative, suggesting limi - ted or no activity of CTLA -4 b lockade in this context9. More encouragingly, in 2016, other more novel immunological targets, notably the macrophage 'don't -eat-me' signal CD47, emerged as promising new op portunities in the therapeutic landscape for SCLC10. SCLC remains a lethal disease, despite the recent progress in defining novel targets and therapeutic strategies. Multiple labora - tory investigators are now focusing on crit - ical aspects of SCLC biology, including the remarkably rapid shift from chemosensitive to chemoresistant disease. Several groups are generating increasingly complex and manipu - lable preclinical models of disease, which might further define drivers of oncogenesis and metastatic spread. Most notably, preclin - ical insights are informing clinical trials and thus, enabling the translation of scientific dis-coveries into clinical benefits. These parallel and integrated identification and validation efforts are shining new lights in what has been a dark corner of clinical oncology.Key advances Multiple groups studying genetically engineered mouse models have identifiedNFIB as a key driver of metastasis in small cell lung cancer (SCLC)1-3 Rovalpituzumab tesirine, an antibody drug conjugate directed at the inhibitory Notch ligand DLL3, showed clinical activity in SCLC, with DLL3 protein expression being a potential predictive biomarker 4,8 Tcell checkpoint blockade using nivolumab,with or without ipilimumab, has demonstrated clinical activity in SCLC, regardless of PDL1 expression on tumour cells 5Charles M.

HEAD AND NECK CANCER IN 2016 A watershed year for improvements in treatment? Alain P . Algazi and Jennifer R. Grandis In the past year, clinical trials have provided important information on strategies to decrease treatment-associated toxicities in patients with head and neck cancer. In addition, the FDA approved the first immunotherapeutic agents for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease, based on the observation of durable responses to pembrolizumab in a phase Ib trial, and demonstration of improved survival and quality of life with the use of nivolumab versus chemotherapy in a phase III trial. The management and prognosis of patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is generally dependent on the stage of disease, and standard treatments are associated with considerably morbidity. Treatment of early stage disease with cura-tive intent using surgery, or radiation-based approaches results in a high probability of long-term survival. For patients with meta - static disease, however, effective treatment 12 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews CLINICAL ONCOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.NivolumabRadiotherapySurgeryCisplatin Cetuximab Pembrolizumaboptions have been limited, with the most- aggressive medical therapy yielding a median overall survival of only 10 months. Moreover, even patients with early stage disease often experience life- a ltering adverse effects fol - lowing definitive therapy. In the past year, new data have challenged some of the fun - damental assumptions about treatment strat - egies and treatment-associated toxicities in patients with SCCHN. These data have come from studies focused on decreasing treatment- related morbidity through the judicious use of surgery, radiation therapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Novel findings also support an expanded role for monoclonal antibodies in both the definitive and metastatic treatment settings, particularly the anti -PD-1 anti b odies nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which con - fer durable remissions in some patients, as observed across a wide spectrum of other metastatic cancer types. For patients with SCCHN, disfigure- ment and functional losses following surgi - cal resections provided the rationale for the development of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) approaches: a complete response to CRT can completely eliminate the need for surgery in certain individuals, and in those with an incomplete response, the extent of resection can be substantially reduced. Previous retro - spective analyses have suggested that negative PET-CT imaging findings after definitive CRT indicate a complete treatment response, but these observations had never been vali d ated prospectively. In a phase III non- i nferiority trial1 with results reported in 2016, 564 patients with SCCHN and extensive nodal involvement (N2-3) were randomly assigned to CRT followed by either planned neck dis - section within 4-8 weeks, or PET-CT imaging at 12 weeks; in the PET-CT cohort, only those with an incomplete or equivocal response proceeded to surgery. At 2 years, no statisti - cally significant differences in overall survival or locoregional control were demonstrated between the two groups 1. Furthermore, fewer surgeries (54 versus 221) and, thus, fewer sur - gical complications were reported for the PET- CT group \u2014 the rates of surgical complications among those who underwent surgery were similar in both groups, as would be expected 1. Our ability to generalize these findings to all patients with SCCHN might be limited, how - ever, because ~85% of study participants had oropharyngeal carcinoma, most of whom human papilloma v irus (HPV)-positive disease1; HPV -positive ore-favourable p rognosis than HPV-negative disease. Platinum-based chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy can cure patients with locally advanced SCCHN, but such treat - ment is a major cause of morbidity, including permanent renal dysfunction, hearing loss, and neuropathy. Since 2006, treatment with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab has been regarded as a potentially less-toxic alternative to platinum- b ased chemotherapy, after the results of the pivotal phase III IMCL - 9815 trial2 demonstrated improved outcomes in patients treated with definitive radiotherapy and cetuximab versus radiotherapy alone. Subgroup analyses have suggested that the benefits of cetuximab are restricted to patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma, perhaps owing to the strong association of these tumours with HPV infection. In the past year, how - ever, a retro s pective analysis involving 182 patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma enrolled in the IMCL - 9815 trial demonstrated that the bene f its of cetuximab were not limited to patients with HPV - positive tumours, although this group had better over - all survival than those with HPV-negative tumours3. Nevertheless, no prospective data were available from studies comparing cetux - imab versus standard-of -care cisplatin, used in combination with radiotherapy. Importantly, in 2016, results of a phase II trial directly comparing cetuximab ver - sus weekly cisplatin as a radio s ensitizer in patients with oropharyngeal cancer were reported4; the data demonstrated differences in acute toxi - cities between the treatment arms, and nonsignificant trends towards in ferior local control, overall survival, and disease-specific survival in the patients who received cetuximab 4. Of note, only 70 of the 130 planned patients were enrolled in this non-inferiority trial owing to slow accrual. A larger phase III trial compar - ing these two radiosensitizers, RTOG -1016 (NCT01302834), has completed enrolment, and the results are eagerly awaited. The adverse effects of definitive radiother - apy are also a major source of morbidity and, given the favourable prognosis of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma, sev-eral studies are exploring whether decreased doses of radiation are effective in this popu - lation. In a phase II trial5, with results pub - lished in December 2015, 37 of 43 patients (86%) had a pathological complete response to reduced- in tensity radiotherapy (maxi - mum total dose of 60 G y) and concurrent cisplatin \u2014 standard radiotherapy regimens use a total dose of 66-74 G y. A randomized phase II trial of reduced-intensity radiother - apy either with or without concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy that will include 296 patients is ongoing (NCT02254278), and should provide more data on the potential for radiation-dose de-escalation in patients with advanced-stage, HPV - associated oropharyngeal carcinoma. The most clinically significant develop - ments for patients with head and neck cancer over the past year inevitably relate to anti -PD-1 immunotherapy, with the FDA approval of nivolumab and pembrolizumab for the treatment of platinum-refractory recurrent and/or metastatic disease. In a phase III trial 6, nivolumab monotherapy induced objec - tive tumour responses in a modest 13.3% of patients, compared with a response rate of 5.8% in patients who received standard-of -care methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab. The increased response rate with nivolumab translated into a 2 -month increase in median overall survival6. Importantly, the nivolumab cohort had a 20% lower incidence of grade 3-4 toxi ci ties and better quality-of - life outcomes than those of the standard-of-care cohort6. P .

Pembrolizumab had been approved by the FDA in August 2016, based on data from a nonrandomized phase Ib trial 7,8 demonstrating an overall response rate of 18% and tumour volume reductions in about half of the 132 patients with platinum-refractory recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN. These results are indicative of modest improvements over the previous standard of care, but find - ings in other solid-cancer settings indicate that anti -PD-1 antibodies enhance immune memory, leading to long-term remissions in some patients. The data suggest the same effects are possible in patients with SCCHN, with 1 -year survival of 36% with nivolumab versus 16.6% with standard-of -care therapy6. Moreover, in the studies of nivolumab and pembrolizumab 6-8, a substantial minority of patients had ongoing responses at the time of data analysis. Patient selection and combination therapy based on pretreament tumour characteris-tics might substantially increase the clinical utility of anti -PD-1 antibodies in the treat - ment of SCCHN. Binding of PD -L1 to PD -1 on cytotoxic T cells results in suppression of T-c ell proliferation and cytokine production. Correspondingly, high levels of intratumoural PD-L1 expression have been associated with increased responsiveness to anti -PD-1 anti - bodies. In the phase III study of nivolumab6, subgroup analyses revealed that the survival benefit was mostly restricted to patients with 1% intratumoural PD -L1 expression (57.3% this PD -L1-positive popula - tion, the median overall survival duration of patients treated with nivolumab was nearly double that of patients who received chemo - therapy (8.7 months versus 4.6 months); the median overall survival of patients with <1% intra tumoural PD -L1 e xpression was ~5.7 months, independent of the treatment they received. Additional assays have shown promise in identifying patients who are mostly likely to benefit from anti -PD-1 monother - apy. In particular, gene-expression profiling has revealed an 'interferon -' s ignature that is highly correlated with overall response rate, progression-free survival, and overall sur - vival in patients with SCCHN treated with pembrolizumab 9. Baseline tumour charac - teristics, such as the degree of intratumoural lymphocyte infiltration or the presence of immunosuppressive regulatory T (T reg) cells, might also help to select specific therapeutic combinations that have been demonstrated to target specific immunological deficien - cies. For example, use of anti -CTLA -4 antibodies in combination with anti -PD-1 antibodies might increase tumour lymphocyte infiltration, and the addition of an indoleam - ine 2,3 - dioxygenase inhibitor might decrease the relative pro portion of Treg cells. Many of the advances in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer over the past year seem modest at a population level, but several key principles that are likely to improve the outcomes of these patients have been embraced. Decreasing the incidence and/or severity of treatment-associated toxici - ties for patients with curative options has been a major area of interest and the rational devel-opment of immunotherapy raises the prospect of long-term remissions, even in patients with unresectable or metastatic SCCHN. If we can expand on these efforts in the future, 2016 might prove to have been a watershed year. Alain P .

SARCOMA IN 2016 Evolving biological understanding and treatment of sarcomas Jean-Yves Blay and Isabelle Ray-Coquard In 2016, novel findings on the role of predisposing gene variants in sarcoma oncogenesis were published, as well as studies addressing novel molecular classifications and results from randomized controlled trials highlighting successful new treatments. Herein, we discuss these meaningful advances. Soft-tissue and visceral sarcomas are a group of very rare cancers arising from resident cells of the connective tissues. The overall inci - dence of these malignancies (comprising >80 histological subtypes and an even larger num - ber of molecular subtypes) is close to 5 per 100,000 per year 1. In comparison with carcino - mas, sarcomas predominantly affect children (15% of paediatric cancers) and young adults (<25 years of age). The mechan is ms of sar - coma oncogenesis remain largely unclear, with the exception of rare predisposition syndromes that have been identified, such as the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Ballinger and co-workers investigated the constitutional genetic land - scape of bone and soft- ti ssue sarcomas in routine clinical practice2. In this study, genetic analysis was performed in 1,162 patients (aged 29-60) with a histologically confirmed diag - of sarcoma indi - viduals using targeted exon sequencing of 72 genes selected on the basis of associations with increased cancer risk 2. Rare variants were stratified into classes that matched the WHO classification of genetic variation, with classes 5 to 3 representing, respectively, variants with known, expected, or predicted pathogenic signification 3.

Of these, vari a nts genes frequently mutated in sarcoma SDHB, RB1 or genes (ATM, ATR, BRCA2 or ERCC2), were found to be associ a ted with an increased risk of sar - coma. Individuals with pathogenic variants in classes 5-3 had a predisposition to being diagnosed with sarcoma at an earlier age than those with other forms of sarcoma. Among the families tested, 17% met the cri t eria of a genetic predisposition to c ancer syndrome, and 16% only had a known or expected patho-genic variant. Conversely, only 20% of patients carrying these variants were found to have a cognate syndrome. Moreover, for 240 patients harbouring multiple (2-6) patho g enic vari - ants of any classes, the number of pathogenic variants was inversely correlated with age at diagnosis, suggesting a polygenic contribution. The results of this study demonstrated the presence of putative pathogenic monogenic and/or polygenic variation in 50% of patients with sarcoma, shedding new light on the aeti - ology of this disease and suggesting possible management strategies for individuals at risk of developing sarcoma. The first-line treatment options for patients with advanced-stage soft-tissue sarcoma (ASTS) have not progressed substantially in the past 30 years. The results of EORTC 62012, the largest ever phase III trial addressing this question 4 showed that the combination of optimal doses of ifosfamide and doxorubicin significantly improved progression-free sur - vival (PFS) duration in patients with ASTS, but had no signifi c ant effects on overall sur - vival. Similarly, n either the combination of gemcitabine with docetaxel5, doxorubicin with palifosfamide6, nor doxorubicin with evofosfamide7 led to improvements in PFS or overall survival durations over doxorubicin alone in the GEDDIS 5, PICASSO III6 and NCT01440088 (REF. 7) t rials, respectively. In this context, the results of the randomized phase II study reported by Tap et al. 8 that assessed the addition of olaratumab, a monoclonal anti-PDGFR antibody, to a doxorubicin- based regimen are a remarkable advance. The median overall survival duration was improved by 11.8 months, and the primary end point of a 2.5 -month improvement in median PFS duration for the combination group was also met (TABLE 1) . The response rates were not significantly different between groups, and slightly more toxicities were observed among patients in the combination arm \u2014 in particu - lar in terms of the incidence of haematologi - cal toxicities and mucositis. The results of this study 8 led to the approval of this combination by the FDA and a positive recommendation by the European Medicines Agency. A phase III study testing olaratumab plus doxorubicin has been completed (NCT02451943); if this trial is confirmative, this combination might become the standard first-line treatment option for patients with ASTS. Of note, the response rate of patients receiving doxo r ubicin with olara - tumab remained inferior to that reported in those trials receiving doxorubicin plus ifosfa - mide4 and thus, the clinical validity of combin - ing ifosfamide, doxorubicin and o laratumab will need to be addressed. The approved agents for patients with pro - gressive disease after doxorubicin treatment include dacarbazine, trabectedin and pazo - panib. Other cytotoxic agents have shown efficacy in phase II studies, but have not been approved (such as paclitaxel for patients with angiosarcoma, or gemcitabine with docetaxel or dacarbazine, in leiomyosarcoma and other subtypes). The results of a phase III study 9 demonstrated that trabectedin improves PFS duration over dacarbazine in patients with metastatic leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma resistant to doxorubicin, but was not accom - panied by a significant improvement in over - all survival duration (TABLE 1) . Schoffski et al.10 reported the results of a phase III study com - paring eribulin with dacarbazine in patients with metastatic leiomyosarcoma or lipo - sarcoma resistant to doxorubicin. The median overall survival duration was significantly improved by 2 months, but no significant differences in PFS were observed (TABLE 1 ). Subgroup analysis showed an improvement of overall survival only in patients with lipo - sarcoma (one third of the cohort). Together, these two trials with intriguing results and per - formed in similar patient populations 9,10 show that PFS is not a consistently reliable surrogate for overall survival. To date, only one antiangiogenic mol e cule, pazopanib, has been approved for the treat - ment of patients with ASTS (not lipo s arcoma) with progressive disease after receiving doxo - rubicin. Antiangiogenic agents have been tested in a few other randomized clinical trials for patients with sarcoma (for example, in NCT01303497, bevacizumab was tested in patients with angiosarcoma with nega - tive results). In RegoSARC11, a randomized phase II study, regorafenib was compared with placebo in patients with ASTS with disease progression after doxorubicin. Four different subgroups were analyzed: patients with sarcomas. Regorafenib improved PFS duration, and, marginally, overall survival duration in all patients except those with lipo - sarcoma 11. Importantly, most of the patients included had not been exposed to pazopanib. Thus, the efficacy of regorafenib in patients with ASTS (excluding liposarcoma) previously treated with pazopanib is now being tested in a fifth treatment arm (NCT01900743). Two other ongoing trials are exploring the efficacy of regorafenib in patients with bone sarcoma (NCT02389244, NCT02048371).

Given the rarity of these subtypes, worldwide collabo - rations are often needed to obtain sufficiently large patient populations to provide statisti - cally robust data. Most patients with wild-type GISTs (that is, with no mutations in KIT nor in PDGFRA ) are usually children or young adults. Boikos et al. 12 described the molecu - lar heterogeneity and natural history of these very rare wild-type GISTs. In their study of 95 evaluable patients, three subgroups were iden - tified according to the status -competent in 82% of the patients, a propor - tion markedly higher than that found in those with GISTs harbouring KIT or PDGFRA muta or ARID1A . Differences exist between presentation of SDH - deficient and SDH -competent GISTs: the former occur only in the stomach, are often metastatic at diagnosis (lymph-node metas - tasis), and tend to have an indolent course despite limited responses to imatinib (2% of patients) or sunitinib (19% of patients). In SDH -deficient group, 21% of patients had syndromic syndrome or Carney-Stratakis syndrome). SDH -competent GISTs occur mostly in the small bowel, and are rarely metastastic. To summarize, this study described the molecular heterogeneity and distinct natural history of three molecular subgroups within wild-type GIST, illustrating the need and efficacy of performing worldwide collaborative studies to explore very rare forms of sarcomas. In the years to come, such collab - orative studies will be critical to improve the outcomes of patients with sarcoma.

I.R-C. receives research support and honoraria from Eli Lilly, Pharmamar and Roche. In the past decade, substantial advancements in neuroendocrine tumour (NET) research have occurred. As a result, several therapies with proven efficacy are now available for patients with NETs, but many questions remain unanswered, including the clinical criteria for selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from targeted therapies, the opti - mal sequence of treatments, and the optimal potential biomarkers indicative of treatment efficacy. Neuroendocrine neoplasms are trad - itionally regarded as a single group of malig - nancies; however, NETs can be subcategorized according to different features of their clinical presentation, and, more importantly, by their distinct site of origin \u2014 a feature frequently used to assign a prognosis. On the basis of these distinctions, patients can be assigned to par - ticipate in specific clinical t rials in which they receive tailored treatment that is concordant with the site of the primary tumour. In 2016, results from a large, international, randomized clinical trial (RADIANT - 4)1 provided evidence for extending the use of everolimus to include progressive NETs of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Previously, everolimus had been demonstrated to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) duration in patients with advanced-stage pancreatic NETs when compared with placebo 2. Subsequently, a growing number of experts proposed that this drug could be used to treat patients with NETs NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOURS IN 2016 Defining rules for increasingly personalized treatments Massimo Falconi and Stefano Partelli In 2016, results of an extensive trial broadened the range of malignancies that can be treated with everolimus to include neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, studies aimed at identifying biomarkers with increased specificity, and at better defining high-grade NETs have enabled substantial progress towards delivering effective targeted treatments to patients with NETs.S.

The results of RADIANT - 4 confirmed this hypothesis, revealing a con - sistent treatment benefit across patients with NETs with different primary tumour sites1. In this study, the estimated PFS at 12 months was 44% for patients in the everolimus group compared with 28% in the placebo group. Moreover, this retrospective study 1 showed consistent bene f icial effects on PFS across the entire spectrum of the subgroups, defined on the basis of primary tumour origin (lung, gastrointestinal or unknown). Before being enrolled in the RADIANT - 4 trial, patients were categorized into prognostic groups; only those with low-grade or moderate-grade lesions (G1 or G2) were selected for inclusion. Since the publication of the 2010 WHO classification of NETs 3, oncological trials have primarily focused on patients with these G1 or G2 forms of the disease, strictly adhering to the prac - tice of using pretreatment Ki67 index scores as the main criterion for selecting eligible patients. Consequently, we have witnessed an increased availability of therapeutic options for patients with G1 or G2 NETs, whereas the need for effective new treatments for patients with high-grade (G3) NETs remains largely unmet. This year, the results of a breakthrough study4 conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC; New Y ork, USA) were published, providing strong evi - dence to support the unique distinction of well-differentiated NETs (WD-NETs) with a high-grade component (characterized by well-differentiated histopathological features and a low proliferative rate) as a separate entity within high-grade NETs. The analysis of sur - vival data strongly supported distinction on the basis of this specific feature; patients with WD-NETs with a high-grade component had a median disease-specific survival (DSS) duration of 55 months, whereas median DSS d uration was 16 months for patients with poorly differentiated G3 neuroendo - crine carcinomas (PD-NECs) without a well- differentiated component. These findings do not merely imply that a pathological reclassifi - cation of high-grade NETs into WD-NETs and PD-NECs is needed, but they also have sub - stantial implications for treatment guidelines. In particular, patients with PD-NEC usually benefit from cisplatin and/or etoposide- b ased regimens, whereas the combination of strepto - zocin and 5 -fluorouracil seems to be effective in patients with WD-NETs. This study has enabled the distinction between two different categories of high-grade neoplasms, the most aggressive category within NETs; such insights can lead to a broadening of the scope of avail - able treatments for patients with these malig - nancies, at least in relation to future clinical trials. The challenge of obtaining a definitive diagnosis of WD-NET with a high-grade component versus that of PD-NECs remains, however, and is heightened by further diag - nostic obstacles, such as those related to the amount of tissue available for diagnosis which, for patients with advanced-stage tumours, typically means biopsy samples rather than surgical specimens. In 2016, another study5 from the same team at MSKCC honed in on this diagnostic issue, and set forth a simple and comprehensive set of guidelines to differentiate WD-NETs with a high-grade component from PD-NECs. A notable methodological advance of this study was the development of a very practical approach for diagnosing this newly recognized subgroup 4, which was established through the meticulous evaluation of available speci - mens from previous clinical studies for spe - cific biomarkers (such as DAXX, ATRX, Rb or p53, which are products of genes altered in patients with WD-NET). Using this approach, patients with WD-NETs with a high-grade component are now more likely to be accu - rately diagnosed than they were in the past using methods relying on the evaluation of only the morphological features and Ki67 index of the tumour. The morphological distinction of high-grade NETs will result in increased pre- cision in patient categorization and will enable the d elivery of in dividually tailored treatments. Currently, somatostatin receptors are one of the few identified therapeutic targets in patients with NETs for which therapies are available, namely somatostatin analogues or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). NETTER - 1 (REF. 6), a large prospective, inter - national phase III trial, was designed to evalu - ate the role of the radiolabelled somatostatin receptor 177Lu-DOTA0 -Tyr3-octreotate agonist long-acting repeatable (LAR) octreo - tide, in the treatment of patients affected by advanced-stage NETs of the small bowel. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the median PFS duration of patients with mid - gut NETs who received DOTATATE compared with that of those treated with LAR octreotide (not reached versus 8.4 months; P <0.0001). This trial succeeded in establishing an addi - tional effective therapeutic agent against these tumours, although the absence of accurate bio - markers to define therapeutic efficacy remains a substantial unmet clinical need. To date, various blood-based biomarkers (in particular, chromogranin A) have been proposed, but none have exhibited sufficient accuracy for the prediction of tumour response to treatment. In light of this challenge, encour - aging results have been obtained with the analysis of circulating gene transcripts before and after treatment in patients with NETs. This year, the levels of circulating NET transcripts (assessed using the 'NETest') and chromo - granin A were used in a study7 to evaluate the efficacy of PRRT with DOTATATE for the treatment of patients with NETs. Changes in NETest accurately correlated with a response to treatment (observed in 89% of patients with a response), whereas increases in chromo - granin A levels were observed in only 24% of patients with a response. In the same study 7, a gene inference methodology was developed to identify specific 'omics' features (growth factor signalome and tumour metabolome) relevant to behaviour. before initiation of PRRT revealed 76% accu - racy in predicting the subsequent treatment response; the accuracy increased to 94% when omics-derived information was combined with information on tumour grade. Notably, most patients with tumours exhibiting substantially elevated signalome and/or metabolome gene expression at baseline responded to PRRT (97%). The main implications of these obser - vations are that therapeutic efficacy can be monitored via evaluation of defined markers and, in addition, the response to PRRT can be predicted through the identification of specific gene clusters. Finally, data from another study pub - lished in 2016 (REF. 8) endeavoured to assess novel biomarkers of response to treatment. This study, conducted by a team based at the University College London Cancer Institute (London, UK), found that the quantification of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) might be a promising biomarker for evaluation of clinical outcome following treatment. In this study, researchers found that among patients Key advances Results of a randomized clinical trial have confirmed that everolimus is associated with a marked improvement in progression free survival duration in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the lung or gastrointestinal tract 1 Well differentiated NETs with a high grade component have been recognized as a unique entity within high grade NETs; practical guidelines for classification of these entities have been described 4,5 The role of circulating gene transcripts and circulating tumour cells as possible biomarkers of treatment efficacy has been evaluated in patients with NETs 6-8 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 17 CLINICAL ONCOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Specifically, a count of >8 CTCs in 10 ml o f blood was associated with a median overall survival duration of 10.7 months, whereas a count of 1-8 CTCs in 10 ml of blood was associated with a median overall survival duration of 31.2 months; the median overall survival duration of patients with no detected CTCs was not reached at the time of analysis. These preliminary results are encouraging; however, for these potential novel biomarkers (NETest, 'omics' signatures and CTCs) to be adopted in daily clinical prac - tice, both the reproducibility and the costs of these diagnostic procedures need to be taken into account. In 2017, we expect the therapeu - tic role of PRRT to be better clarified by the results from the NETTER -1 t rial6. In addition, the optimal sequencing of treatments, which remains a major unmet clinical need in the management of patients with NETs, will be better investigated in the near future.

Choueiri In 2016, two major trials provided conflicting evidence regarding the role of 1 year of adjuvant therapy with sunitinib for patients with high-risk renal-cell carcinoma. In the second-line metastatic setting, updated data from key trials showed that cabozantinib improved overall survival over everolimus, and nivolumab was associated with a better quality of life compared with everolimus. Finally, a phase II study in previously untreated patients showed cabozantinib to be superior to sunitinib. Metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) has been notoriously resistant to systemic therapy, with only cytokines, such as IL -2 a nd inter - feron, producing rare remissions in a small subset of patients. Insights into the importance of targeting angiogenic pathways in RCC led to the development of an armamentarium of therapies over the past 10 years that are now considered 'standard' . Nevetheless, after a dec - ade of treatment VEGF and mTOR inhibi - tors, the metastatic RCC therapeutic landscape was deeply shaken in 2015, by the advent of three new active agents. Nivolumab demon - strated an overall survival benefit compared with everolimus \u2014 a standard of care \u2014 in the second-line setting 1. A phase III trial showed that cabozantinib improved both progression- free survival (PFS) and response rate com - pared with everolimus2. Moreover, the combination of everolimus with lenvatinib, a dual VEGFR and FGFR inhibitor, was demon - strated to be efficacious in a ran domized phase II study3. So what did 2016 bring? Since the late 2000s, several large adjuvant trials have been conducted in patients with RCC. Among these, two trials were published in 2016 and represent major steps forward in the explor - ation of the role of the VEGF axis in the adjuvant setting. The ASSURE trial 4 (ECOG - ACRIN E2805) was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, phase III trial that was conducted in 226 centres in North America. In total, 1,943 patients at high risk of disease recurrence were randomly assigned to receive sunitinib ( n = 647), sorafenib ( n = 649), or placebo ( n = 647) for 1 year after surgery. The primary objective was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) between each experimental group and the placebo arm. The primary analysis showed no significant differences in DFS or overall survival between the three arms. Moreover, toxicity necessitated treat - ment discontinuation in >44% of patients in both experimental arms, subsequently lead - ing to a protocol amendment to reduce the starting dose 4. In the randomized, double-blind, phase III S-TRAC trial5 (NCT00375674), 615 patients with locoregional, high-risk clear-cell RCC were assigned to receive either adjuvant sunitinib or placebo for 1 year; the primary end point was DFS, according to blinded independent central review. The median DFS was 6.8 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.8-not reached) in the sunitinib group and 5.6 years (95% CI 3.8-6.6) in the placebogroup (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.98; P = 0.03). In the sunitinib arm, dose reduction or treat - ment discontinuation was required owingto adverse events in 34.3% and 28.1% of pa tients, respectively5. Key advances In the adjuvant setting, for localized, high risk clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), 1 year of sunitinib improved disease free survival compared with placebo in one trial, but not in another trial4,5 In the second line and third line settings in patients with metastatic RCC, cabozantinib improved overall survival compared with everolimus 6, and new data suggests nivolumab is associated with quality oflife improvement compared with everolimus7 One randomized phase II trial showed cabozantinib to be superior to sunitinib in untreated patients with intermediate risk or poor risk metastatic ccRCC; in those with metastatic non clear cell RCC, sunitinib might have a slight edge over everolimus8 18 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews CLINICAL ONCOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.The results of these two trials in patients with high-risk RCC differ completely and raise the following issues: first, patient- population selection; second, treatment expo - sure; third, end-point assessment. While ASSURE 4 did include a population of patients with non-clear-cell RCC (nccRCC) and a popu l ation at a lower risk of relapse, the researchers reported a prespecified subset ana - lysis restricted to the clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) T3-T4 population only, and no differences were associated with either sunitinib or sorafenib treatment in this group. The potential outcome discrepancy can also be attributed to difference in drug expo - sure, as approximately a third of patients in the ASSURE trial received sunitinib therapy at a one-level reduced starting dose 4, whereas in the S-TRAC trial5, all patients started at a 50 m g dose. Another major differences between the two trials was related to the central radio - logical review for S -TRAC versus investi - gator assessment only in the ASSURE trial. Of note, in S-TRAC 5, the investigator assess - ment of the primary end point did not reach statistical significance. In the light of adverse effects and absence of an overall survival benefit, patient adher - ence is a key consideration, and will neces - sitate individual counselling. Results of further adjuvant studies are eagerly awaited; upcoming studies will report on the role of pazopanib (PROTECT; NCT01235962), or everolimus (EVEREST; NCT01120249). The duration of adjuvant therapy \u2014 that is, 1 year versus 3 years of sorafenib, versus 3 years of placebo \u2014 is being investigated in the SORCE trial (NCT00492258). In the adjuvant trial of axitinib (ATLAS; NCT01599754) 3 years of axitinib compared with placebo will be assessed. In the metastatic setting, 2016 had been a rich year, with the reporting of interim results from two pivotal studies of nivolumab and cabozantinib in the second-line setting, after failure of prior VEGFR-targeted therapies. The final overall survival data from the METEOR study 6 of cabozantinib in 658 patients with metastatic ccRCC were subsequently pre - sented and reported in 2016; median overall survival was 21.4 months with cabozantinib and 16.5 months with everolimus (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53-0.83; P = 0.00026). O n the basis of these results, cabozantinib 60 m g per day was approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency in 2016, and has been integrated in international guidelines on the second-line treatment of patients with RCC who are unresponsive to previous treatment with one or more VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. Since these trials were reported, selecting patients for nivolumab or cabo- zantinib therapy has become an important challenge: evidence supporting their use comes from phase III trials, but unfortunately the strategies have not been compared in a head -to-head fashion. Furthermore, both drugs exhibited benefit across all the pre - specified subgroups (stratified, for example, by risk group, performance status, and num - ber of prior lines of therapy). Cabozantinib had a noticeable benefit in patients with bones and visceral metastasis, as well as a low incidence of disease progression as a best response 6, suggesting a low incidence of primary resistance to this agent. On the other hand, nivolumab was associated with a quality- of-life improvement in a 2016 update from Checkmate 025, in addition to the known over - all survival benefit compared with everolimus7. Finally, in both the Checkmate 025 (REF. 1) and METEOR trials6, the attempt to use PD -L1 or MET staining as predictive biomarkers, respec - tively, failed to discriminate the patients more likely to benefit from the experimental drug. In the randomized phase II CABOSUN trial8, cabozantinib was compared with the current standard-of -care sunitinib in previ - ously untreated patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk metastatic ccRCC. Data reported in 2016 demonstated that treatment with cabozantinib was associated with significantly longer PFS (8.2 months versus 5.6 months; P = 0.012) and a higher objective response rate (46% versus 18%) compared with sunitinib, with similar rates of adverse events and treat - ment discontinuation. Despite the small size of this study, cabozantinib might become a first-line therapeutic option for patients with metastatic ccRCC. Final overall survival data are still maturing. The rare nccRCC population remains a clinical challenge given the heterogeneity of the tumours this definition encompasses and the more limited benefit derived from tar - geted therapies compared with that observed for patients with ccRCC. In 2016, the results of ASPEN 9, a randomized phase II trial to compare first-line everolimus with sunitinib in patients with metastatic nccRCC, were reported. Among the 108 patients enrolled, sunitinib increased PFS compared with that achieved with everolimus, and the results were statistically significant based on pre - planned statistical analyses (8.3 months ver - sus 5.6 months; HR 1.41, P = 0.16. The P value target of significance was <0.2). The results of two previous trials, ESPN 10 and RECORD -3 (REF. 11) had indicated that everolimus is not superior to sunitinib in the nccRCC subpopu - lation. Taken together, these data suggest that sunitinib might have a slight advantage over everolimus in the first-line setting of metastatic nccRCC, although data from confirmatory phase III trials are required. Overall, 2016 kept the pace with 2015 in terms of the rapidly evolving RCC therapeutic landscape. Adjuvant use of sunitinib remains controversial and is not yet recommended in current guidelines 12. Nivolumab and cabo - zantinib are new standards in the second-line setting, but cabozantinib might become the treatment of choice in the first-line setting based on data from CABOSUN 8. Effective therapy in the nccRCC setting remains an unmet need. The field is evolving rapidly, with phase III trials of combination therapies tar - geting PD -1/PD -L1 and VEGF or CTLA - 4, which could again change how we treat metastatic RCC.

All rights reserved.Nature Reviews | Endocrinology Jennie Vallis/Macmillan Publishers Limited Interactions between the nervous system and hormones play an essential part in all facets of homeostasis and regulate key aspects of physiology. In turn, numerous diseases arise from perturbed neurohormonal pathways or their defective responses to different stressors. Notably, neuroendocrine control of energy, metabolic homeostasis and reproduction has drawn much attention, as prevalent disorders of escalating incidence, such as diabetes melli - tus, obesity, pubertal alterations and infertility, have a substantial neuroendocrine dimension. The classic view of neuroendocrinology emphasized a dominant role of neuronal cir - cuits as targets and regulators of endocrine organs, with a major role for the hypo t halamus as an integration centre and output pathway for the control of downstream endocrine systems. Similarly, transcriptional regulatory actions of hormones on neural pathways were stressed. Accordingly, neuroendocrine studies than classic hypothalamic centres for feed - ing and reproductive control). Several studies published in 2016 will have a substantial influ - ence in consolidating these new perspectives in neuroendocrinology. Feeding drive is now recognized to derive largely from mechanisms that are linked to hedonic and reward responses, previously regarded as nonhomeostatic, but nonethe - less also controlled by homeostatic signals. Starvation leads not only to compulsive feed - ing but also to high-risk behaviours charac - terized by aggression and fear. Padilla and co-workers 1 uncovered the neuronal path - way underlying some adaptive behaviours in the starved state, by showing that a subset of neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP), is also involved in the modulation of fear and aggression in conditions of starvation. AgRP neurons are regulated by key met - abolic hormones and transmit a potent orexigenic drive by projecting to neurons in other brain areas, such as the paraventricu - lar nucleus (PVN). A subset of ARC AgRP neurons projecting to the medial amyd - gala (MeA) now also seems to be essential for promoting risk-taking behaviours and reducing territorialism in mice subjected to long-term food deprivation 1. Although AgRP projections to PVN potently induce feeding, GABA-mediated inhibition of neurons in the MeA, driven by AgRP projections, is key for suppressing a downstream circuit reaching the posterior principle region of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which causes reduced territorial aggressive behaviour and increased food-seeking activities. This switch from aggressive to nonaggressive behaviours is not caused by hunger itself but precisely controlled by the balance between activation and inactiva - tion of the different subsets of AgRP neurons, illustrating the major role of these neurons as transducers of key metabolic hormones (such as leptin) to link feeding and behaviour 1. Compelling evidence has suggested a role of non-neuronal cells, predominantly glia, in neuroendocrine regulation, and both meta- bolic status and leptin levels can influence the morphology and functionality of hypothalamic astrocytes 2. Garc\u00eda-C\u00e1ceres and co-workers3 have now shown that insulin signalling in astrocytes plays a crucial part in brain glu - cose transport and sensing. Perturbations in were dominated by protein or RNA expression analyses and invasive approaches, such as explant neurosecretion and electro p hysiology, which often precluded implementation in truly physiological conditions. Nevertheless, new conceptual and technical advancements have widened our understand-ing of neuroendocrine physiology, with con - siderable progress in the areas of metabolism and reproduction, including the discovery of essential regulators (such as the reproductive gatekeepers kisspeptins) and the application of novel functional techniques (such as opto - genetics). These advances have enabled the identification of multisystemic regulatory pathways that affect the brain and peripheral tissues. These bidirectional neurohormonal interactions involve non-neuronal cells and nontranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, as well as previously unidentified functions (such as reward and behaviour) and areas (other NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY IN 2016 Neuroendocrine control of metabolism and reproduction Manuel Tena-Sempere Neuroendocrine networks were previously perceived mainly as transcriptionally controlled, neural regulatory pathways that are centred at the hypothalamus. However, multisystemic circuits encompassing the brain and peripheral tissues have now been uncovered that involve nonneuronal cells and nontranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, with previously unidentified functions, such as reward and behaviour. Several developments in 2016 have helped to consolidate these new advances. KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 21 ENDOCRINOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The data also support a major role for astrocytic insulin signalling in the regula - tion of ARC pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which are key in feeding and energy homeostasis, as the glial cell coverage, synap - tic-input organization and function of POMC neurons were severely perturbed upon astro-cytic loss of insulin receptors. This result pri - marily occurs via modulation of insulin and glucose uptake through the blood-brain bar - rier, which was severely affected by ablation of insulin receptors in astrocytes. Indeed, central glucose handling was not perturbed by insulin receptor elimination in glial cells, suggesting that perturbation of POMC neurons is mostly indirect. These findings change our under - standing of the mechanisms of glucose sensing and insulin actions in the brain 3, and stress that conditions of gliosis, such as in obesity, might deregulate peripheral glycaemic control via alteration of astrocytic insulin signalling. Besides transcriptional regulation, neuro - endocrine functions, such as metabolism and reproduction, are also controlled by epige - netic mechanisms. Among these, non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs (mi RNA s), have received substantial attention. Previous data demonstrated a multifaceted role of mi RNA s in metabolism and indirectly suggested their involvement in pubertal control 4. This year, Messina and co-workers5 showed that miRNA- dependent regulation of gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH)-expressing neurons is key for changes in their neurosecretion that lead to puberty onset. This team showed that elimination of Dicer, the enzyme that is responsible for gen - eration of mature mi RNA s, in GnRH neurons led to absence of puberty and severe central hypogonadism. Expression and functional analyses also revealed specific miRNA sig-natures in developing GnRH neurons, with prominent roles of miR -200 a nd miR -155 in the control of GnRH function5. Notably, rather than by direct inhibition of the Gnrh gene, these miRNA regulators operated mainly via repression of inhibitors of GnRH transcrip - tion, such as ZEB1 and CEBPB, which have other known neuroendocrine roles, including regulation of pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone, or mediating the central endocrine effects of nitric oxide5. These results foreshadow future analysis of deregulated miRNA signalling in perturbations of human puberty and other neuroendocrine axes. In addition to central signals, peripheral hor - mones are essential in neuro en docrine control. Gut factors, such as ghrelin, peptide YY and glucacon-like peptide 1, are known regulators of metabolism, energy balance and reproduc - tion. In 2016, Li and co-workers 6 demonstrated an important role for neuro te nsin, a 13 -am ino- acid neuro peptide produced in various tissues, including the brain and small intestine, in the control of body-weight homeostasis and fat deposition. Indeed, knockout of neurotensin protected mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity and prevented comorbidities of obesity, such as insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. In the brain, neurotensin is associated with hypothalamic leptin action and is regarded as an anorectic factor 7. Neurotensin levels were increased in a rat model of body-weight loss by gastric bypass surgery, in which blockade of peripheral neurotensin increased feeding 7. Hence, the protective phenotype of neuro - tensin knockout might seem to be counter - intuitive. According to Li et al.6, neuro t ensin operates mainly in the periphery by modulat-ing intestinal fat intake via an AMPK-mediated mechanism. Admittedly, other central neuro - endocrine interactions of neurotensin cannot be ruled out. Y et, elevated circulating levels of pro-neurotensin are found in patients with obesity and insulin resistance, and doubled the risk of development of obesity later in life compared with nonobese individuals 6. This year has also seen developments in technical approaches for sophisticated noninva - sive exploration of neuronal activity, applicable to neuroendocrine functions. Stanley and col-leagues 8 reported a novel method for remote, noninvasive, timed activation or suppression of hypothalamic circuits controlling glucose homeostasis and feeding, by the use of micro - waves or magnetic fields in genetic models. The basis for this approach was reported in 2015 (REF. 9), but this study is the first to interrogate the physiological consequences of such neuronal manipulation on relevant neuro endocrine functions, such as feeding and metabolism. The technique enabled the modulation of peripheral glucose levels by manipulating glucosensing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus and comple - ments other new techniques, such as opto - genetics and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The electromagnetic approach operates remotely, does not need implantable devices, reaches diffuse cell populations, and its cell activation kinetics might be superior to that of DREADDs. Hence, this new method pro - vides opportunities for basic and translational research in neuroendocrinology, for both neuronal and endocrine cell types 8. The breakthroughs highlighted here are illustrative of the large body of experimental and clinical neuroendocrinology research con - ducted in 2016.

As a testament to the importance of adipose tissue as a crucial endocrine organ, leptin therapy for individuals with generalized lipodystrophy who frequently develop severe hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and dia - betes mellitus has been approved by the FDA since 2014 (REF. 1).to disrupt the expression of asprosin, the C-terminal cleavage product of profibril - lin2. is a 140 -amino- aci d secreted polypeptide, is abundantly expressed in mature white adipocytes and is thus con - sidered a new adipokine. The authors found that levels of asprosin were raised under fasting conditions in healthy humans and rodents. Remarkably, a single injection of recombinant asprosin to wild-type mice induced a significant increase in plasma levels of glucose and insulin within 30 min. Mechanistically, asprosin acts directly on the liver to stimulate hepatic glucose produc - tion by increasing intracellular cAMP levels, subsequently activating the protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway. Of note, plasma levels of asprosin (in the range of 5-10 nM) in humans with obesity and mouse mod-els of obesity are higher than those in non-obese controls in concordance with insulin levels, which suggests that asprosin levels are associated with insulin resistance. Blocking asprosin action, via a neutralizing antibody against asprosin or genetic deletion of Fbn1 , reduced plasma levels of insulin and hepatic glucose production in vivo . These data pro- vide compelling evidence that asprosin is a fasting-induced adipokine that controls hepatic glucose production and insulin sen - sitivity. The study also suggests that there is an as yet uncharacterized receptor (or recep - tors) in hepatocytes through which asprosin acts to trigger cAMP-PKA signalling (FIG. 1) . Blocking asprosin and its downstream path - ways might be beneficial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to W AT, mammals have brown adipose tissue (BAT), which dissi - pates energy in the form of heat and staves off hypothermia and obesity. Owing to the much smaller mass of BAT than W AT in the human body (~60 g of B AT in the aver - age adult3), its contribution as an endocrine organ to whole-body homeo st asis seems to be marginal. However, recent studies have reported on secretory molecules from BAT, so called 'batokines' , which include fibro - blast growth factor 21 (FGF21), neuregu - lin 4 (NRG4), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and bone morphogenetic protein 8B (BMP8B). These studies indicate a physiological role of BAT as an endocrine organ 4. Notably, an 'inducible form' of ther - mogenic adipocytes, known as - cytes, exists in adult humans5. Beige adipocyte differentiation can be induced by chronic cold exposure, exercise, cancer cachexia and bari - atric surgery 6. Given the recent animal stud - ies showing its biological importance in the regulation of whole-body energy expenditure Although generalized lipodystrophy is frequently associated with insulin resistance, patients with neonatal progeroid syndrome (NPS; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) #264090) develop a rare form of partial lipodystrophy in which they remain insulin sensitive and euglycaemic. In 2016, Chopra and colleagues identified mutations in the gene that encodes profibrillin ( FBN1 ) in patients with NPS; the mutations were found ADIPOSE TISSUE IN 2016 Advances in the understanding of adipose tissue biology Shingo Kajimura Adipose tissues have a central role in energy homeostasis, as they secrete adipokines and regulate energy storage and dissipation. Novel adipokines from white, brown and beige adipocytes have been identified in 2016. Identifying the specific receptors for each adipokine is pivotal for developing greater insights into the fat-derived signalling pathways that regulate energy homeostasis.

In fact, studies published in 2016 support the above-described hypothesis. In a study by Corvera and colleagues, the authors obtained human beige adipocytes derived from the capillaries of subcutaneous W AT and then implanted the adipocytes into mice with diet-induced obesity 7. The mice implanted with human beige adipocytes had lower levels of fasting blood glucose, increased glucose tolerance and reduced hepatic steatosis 7 weeks after the implanta-tion compared with control mice implanted with matrigel (vehicle). Improved glucose tolerance following implantation of beige adipocytes was associated with an increased glucose turnover rate and adiponectin secre - tion from the transplanted human beige adipocytes. Notably, the authors identified several secretory factors, such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (encoded PCSK1 ), (encoded by -33 (e ncoded by IL33 ), which were abundantly expressed in the human beige adipocytes. This study reinforces the notion that increased beige fat mass affects whole-body glucose homeo - stasis; however, determining the causal link between these secretory molecules and the metabolic improvement that is achieved by implanting beige adipocytes requires further investigation (FIG. 1) .Two further studies published in 2016 have identified previously unknown batokines, peptidase M20 domain-containing pro - tein 1 (PM20D1) (REF. 8) and Slit homo - logue 2 protein (SLIT2) (REF. 9), which regulate whole-body energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis (FIG. 1 ). Long and co -workers used globa l transcriptional identi - fied PM20D1 as a secretory enzyme that was highly enriched in mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) -positive cells (that is, brown and beige adipocytes)8. When overexpressed in mice, PM20D1 catalyses the synthesis of N -acyl amino acids from free fatty acids, thereby increasing whole-body energy expenditure, which leads to reduced fat mass and body weight. The authors further showed that N -acyl amino acids increase cellular respi - ration and reduce body weight by functioning as a mitochondrial uncoupler. As the ther - mogenic effect was found in UCP1 -positive and UCP1-negative cells, N-acyl amino acids probably act not only on brown and beige adipocytes but also on neighbouring cells (FIG. 1 ). Notably, the authors identified several mitochondrial proteins, including ANT1 and ANT2, that bind directly to N -acyl amino acids. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms by which N -acyl amino acids are taken up into the target cells and stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling. Svensson et al . used quantitative proteo - mics to search for molecules that are secreted by beige adipocytes 9. The authors found that the C -terminal fragment of SLIT2 BAT and adipose tissue. It does so by activating the PKA signalling pathway, which is a well-known downstream pathway, in response to cold exposure and -adrenergic receptor acti - vation. Although these molecules are enriched in brown and beige adipocytes, they are also expressed in non-adipose tissues. Thus, fur - ther analyses using tissue-specific knockout mouse models are needed to determine the relative contributions of the secretory factors derived from BAT and beige adipose tissue versus alternative tissues in the regulation of whole-body metabolism. As we learn more about the various roles of beige adipocytes in thermogenesis, glucose metabolism and lipid homeostasis, it might be conceivable that multiple types of beige adi - pocytes with distinct functional roles exist within adipose tissue. In this regard, a paper by Graff and colleagues used a variety of Cre-inducible mouse lines to critically investigate the developmental origins of beige adipocytes in response to cold exposure 10. The authors found that perivascular mouse cells expressing smooth muscle actin gave rise to 60-68% of UCP1-positive beige adipocytes, whereas exist - ing mature white adipocytes did not give rise to beige adipocytes. These data might indicate that additional lineages of beige adipocytes exist within a W AT depot. In summary, the new studies published in 2016 made important advances in the field of adipose biology with the identification of new signalling entities from adipocytes that control systemic energy balance. Clearly, the identification of their specific receptors will be an important future theme in the field; this will enable us to determine their target tissues and/or cells and the underlying mechanisms of their actions.

Successive GW AS have identified >100 loci that are robustly associated with type 2 diabe-tes mellitus (T2DM). The risk variants at these loci typically have modest effects on T2DM predisposition and collectively account for only 10% of overall disease risk, far short of the pro - portion that twin and family studies indicate is attributable to overall genetic variation 1. A range of explanations have been proffered for this disparity (often described as 'missing heritability'). One of these explanations impli-cates risk alleles of low frequency \u2014 these alleles are mostly invisible in existing GW AS, as these have primarily interrogated common variants, but can be identified through the more comprehensive variant evaluation that is provided by next-generation sequencing. Fuchsberger and colleagues 2 describe the first large-scale use of sequencing to explore risk of T2DM, combining whole-genome sequencing data from 2,657 controls and T2DM cases with whole-exome sequencing data from a further 12,940 individuals. These data were extended, capturing a subset of the sequence-detected variants, by genotyping 111,548 additional individuals. This study identified many statistically significant asso - ciation signals for T2DM; however, almost all were common, and many lay within exist - ing GW AS signals. Where the risk variants mapped to protein-coding sequence, these discoveries provided valuable clues regarding which regional transcript was driving GW AS signals hitherto detected through non-coding (regulatory) variation. Evidence supporting a contribution of lower frequency variants to the risk of T2DM was scant. The only compelling signal involved mechanistic relationships between otherwise highly correlated phenotypes. The probable explanation here is that risk of T2DM reflects not so much total adiposity but the distri - bution of that fat. Efficient storage of excess calories in safe adipose sites, promoted by the CREBRF allele, lowers the risk of T2DM because it reduces the opportunities for fat deposition in ectopic sites, such as the liver, that are more metabolically harmful. A recent study of insulin-resistance associated alleles in European populations powerfully supports this inference 5. The major motivation behind genetic dis - covery for complex traits is the value of risk variants to reveal mechanisms that are cen - tral to disease pathogenesis (FIG. 1 ). Securing these mechanistic inferences has, until very recently, been a major challenge for T2DM. As with other common diseases, most GW AS signals map to regulatory sequences with few clues to the effector genes through which those variants act. In T2DM, many GW AS loci have predominant effects on insulin secretion, focusing attention on the pancreatic islets; because of their relative inaccessibility, the epigenomic and transcriptomic characteristics of pancreatic islets have been poorly captured by projects such as ENCODE and GTEx. However, the use of sequence-based omics technologies to generate regulatory and expression maps for the human islet has demonstrated that T2DM risk vari - ants are preferentially located within active islet enhancers. One T2DM GW AS region where this information has generated valu - able insights lies next to the gene MTNR1B , which encodes one of the receptors for mela - tonin. The probable causal variant disrupts a NEUROD1 binding site in an islet enhancer an excess of rare loss -of-function alleles within the set of genes that were previously implicated in monogenic diabetes mellitus. The paucity of low frequency association signals suggests little or no selective pressure for T2DM risk alleles during human prehistory. Evidence that most variation in individual risk of T2DM is found in common variants limits the potential to reassign individuals with T2DM into discrete disease subtypes. Although rare variants are unlikely to explain much of the risk variance, their iden - tification and characterization remain impor - tant objectives. Rare alleles detectable in genome-wide studies will, for reasons of sta - tistical power, generally have large phenotypic impact, and such discoveries often lead to clear and rapid mechanistic insights. Whereas few examples of high-impact common variants in outbred populations exist, such variants can rise to higher frequency in isolated populations, through chance or local adaptation 3. An example of a high-impact, geograph - ically restricted variant emerged in 2016. Minster and colleagues conducted a GW AS for BMI in people from Samoa, a population at high risk of obesity and T2DM 4. The key finding was a replicated association signal localized to a coding variant in CREBRF, a gene implicated in fat deposition. The BMI-raising allele has a frequency of 27% in people from Samoa but is essentially absent outside the Pacific islands. This frequency difference might reflect selection for a 'thrifty' allele that, by promoting efficient fat storage, enhanced the survival prospects of carriers during the perilous transoceanic migrations that led to the peopling of the Pacific islands. Intriguingly, the BMI-raising allele in CREBRF was associated with reduced, rather than increased, risk of T2DM. Such variants, which 'row against the epidemiological cur - rent' , can provide instructive insights into the GENETICS OF T2DM IN 2016 Biological and translational insights fr om T2DM genetics Mark I. McCarthy Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health challenge. Development of more effective strategies for prevention and therapy depends on an improved understanding of its pathogenetic mechanisms. 2016 ends a period during which large-scale discovery of risk alleles for T2DM became routine and heralds a shift in research focus towards their exploitation to fuel mechanistic insights. Key advances Disease-associated genetic variation can provide crucial insights into disease pathogenesis 2,4 Most of the variation in inherited predisposition to common diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus depends on common, shared variants, which mostly have modest effects; however, high-impactvariants can be found in isolated populations 2,4 The intersection of genetic and genomic information from relevant tissues is drivingthe characterization of pathogenetic mechanisms 2,4,7 Genetic information is increasingly informing translational efforts, including the capacity to evaluate the contribution ofexternal processes to disease prevalence 9 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 25ENDOCRINOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. Array-based genotypingMechanism Regulatory network Regulatory element Gene Pathway Physiology Translation Therapeutic targets Environmental exposure Biomarkers Diagnostics Stratication upstream of the gene, and variation at this site influences MTNR1B expression6, highlighting some of the key machinery that connects the GW AS-detected variant to its influence on T2DM predisposition. Tuomi and colleagues 7 put further flesh on the bones of this story, demonstrating that melatonin inhibits cAMP generation in islets and blocks insulin release. In a genotype-based recall study, this group showed that the capac - ity of melatonin to reduce insulin secretion was enhanced in homozygous carriers of the T2DM risk allele. The implication, that exces - sive melatonin action is detrimental to islet function, seems to be consistent with the idea that nocturnal secretion of melatonin has the benefi cial physiological effect of dialling down insulin production at night, when food intake is reduced. However, the story is undoubtedly more complex. Loss -of-function coding variants in MTRN1B have been associated with increased, rather than reduced, risk of T2DM, and some epidemiological studies suggest a similar directional relationship 8. These contrasting views probably reflect differences between the impact of an islet-specific GW AS variant and coding variants with wider tissue effects. Thus, the MTNR1B example not only illustrates the growing range of data that can support the assignment of function to T2DM -associated genetic variants but also highlights the biologi - cal complexity that must be addressed. Mechanistic inference provides a crucial first step towards translation, defining novel therapeutic targets and highlighting potential biomarkers. However, genetics offers addi-tional clinical opportunities. Genetics can help to design more effective preventive strategies, for example, through the use of Mendelian ran - domization approaches to identify the specific components of the Western lifestyle that have the strongest influence on risk of T2DM. In this regard, interest is growing in the role of the gut microbiome (and of dietary composition) in promoting obesity and T2DM. The picture remains confused. Associations between obesity and T2DM and the gut micro - biome content and diversity are easy to detect, but whether such differences are causal or reactive is far from clear. The work of Pedersen and colleagues 9 provides an important con- tribution to this story, connecting insulin resistance, raised levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and a microbiome content that promotes BCAA synthesis. With parallel efforts to identify genetic variants that influence microbiome content and diversity 10, it is now becoming possible to establish the mechanistic relationships between microbiome content, BCAA levels and the risk of T2DM. The field has advanced beyond recogni - tion in the decade since GW AS arrived. Much remains to be discovered, but the combina - tion of comprehensive elucidation of risk var - iants, harnessed to genomic information from relevant tissues and physiological studies in humans and animal models, sets the scene for important translational advances in the coming years.

EXERCISE METABOLISM IN 2016 Health benefits of exercise \u2014 more than meets the eye! Mark A. Febbraio Although regular physical activity can prevent or reduce the risk of many age-related diseases, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the protective effects of exercise are largely unknown. In 2016, a series of studies demonstrated that crosstalk between tissues during exercise can protect against metabolic disease, cancer, retinal degeneration and memory loss. These studies provide a molecular basis for the concept of 'exercise as medicine'. Since ~450 bc, physical activity has been known to be able to prevent chronic disease. Quotes attributed to Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, include: \"Walking is man's best medicine\" and \"If there is a deficiency in food and exercise the body will fall sick\" . Now, even short periods of physical inactivity are known to be associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, which manifests as decreased insulin sensitivity, reduced Figure 1 | The identification of DNA sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A combination of genotyping and sequencing drives mechanistic insights that can reveal the molecular and physiological basis of disease. In turn, those insights provide a foundation for a rangeof translational opportunities that might support novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. 26 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews ENDOCRINOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.postprandial lipid clearance, loss of muscle mass and accumulation of visceral adiposity1. These acute changes provide a link between physical inactivity and an increased risk of developing many diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, cancers such as those of the colon and breast, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, erec - tile dysfunction and polycystic ovary syn - drome 1,2. The benefits of physical activity have been attributed to several mechanisms, which include reduced adiposity, increased cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max)), reduced levels of circulating lipids and the maintenance of mus - cle mass. However, in the current millennium, research has shown that, during exercise, pro - teins, peptides, enzymes and metabolites are released from one organ (mainly contracting skeletal muscle) to affect the metabolism in another organ. In 2016, this paradigm was strengthened in several important studies. As exercise involves muscle contraction, most empha - sis has been placed on the release of proteins from contracting skeletal muscle (so called myokines) that affect metabolic processes in other organs 3. Exercise is known to improve brain function and cognition. In an elegant and important study, Moon et al. 4 initially treated L6 myotubes with the 4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) in an attempt to model the effects of exercise in vitro . Subsequent screening of the culture media for proteins using mass spectrometry revealed the presence of cathepsin B. The investigators validated cathepsin B as a myokine by demon - strating that the levels of this protein increased in the plasma of mice, monkeys and humans during exercise. In humans, plasma levels of cathepsin B correlated with both fitness and memory. Moreover, although running improved memory and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in wild-type mice, no effect was observed in mice deficient in cathepsin B 4. This study demonstrated that exercise can induce the release of cathepsin B from contacting skeletal muscle to modify memory and brain function (FIG. 1 ), which validates the hypothesis that exercise is beneficial for delaying dementia in ageing. Although contracting muscle is undoubt - edly an organ capable of releasing important proteins and metabolites during exercise, other organs could have endocrine-like prop - erties during physical activity. In a complex study published in 2016, Mera et al. 5 demon - strated that bone can also drive the adapta - tion to physical exercise via the release of osteocalcin. The investigators demonstrated that circulating levels of undercarboxylated and bioactive osteocalcin markedly increase during exercise. Circulating osteocalcin was then shown not only to increase intramus - cular glucose uptake during exercise but also to increase the production and release of the prototypical myokine IL - 6, in turn increasing fatty acid availability from adipocytes and glu - cose production in the liver; findings that sup - port previous studies performed over a decade ago6,7. The study by Mera et al.5 is an impor - tant addition to the existing model of tissue crosstalk, as it uncovered a bone-muscle-liver and/or adipose tissue axis that regulates nutri - ent supply and demand during muscle con- traction (FIG. 1 ). Determining precisely how bone senses muscle contraction is the next challenge in further defining this model. Physical activity can decrease the risk and/or improve the prognosis of a limited number of cancers such as those of the colon, breast and possibly endometrium 2. Many hypothe - ses have been proposed as to the mechanism underpinning the beneficial effects of physical activity on carcinogenesis. These hypotheses include: the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) network hypothesis, in which exer - cise inhibits carcinogenesis by suppressing activation of mTOR signalling in mammary carcinomas; the hormesis hypothesis, in which the carcinogenic response to physical activity is nonlinear and is accounted for by a physiological cellular stress response; and the metabolic reprogramming hypothesis, in which exercise limits the amount of glu - cose and glutamine available to mammary carcinomas, thereby inducing apoptosis due to reversal of tumour-associated metabolic programming 8. In an important paper pub - lished in 2016, Pedersen et al.9 demonstrated that exercise initiates complex hormonal and immunological responses that inhibit tumour growth in mouse models of cancer. Tumour- bearing mice were randomly assigned to cages with access to either locked or unlocked run-ning wheels. In the latter group, the mice ran considerably longer distances over a 4 -week period than mice in the sedentary (locked wheel) group. Importantly, exercise-trained mice exhibited a >60% reduction in tumour incidence and growth across five different can - cer models 9. The investigators demonstrated that, by activating the sympathetic nervous system and increasing the exercise-induced IL-6 response, a specific subset of natural killer (NK) cells were immobilized. These NK cells were subsequently redistributed to the site of tumours to control tumour growth 9 (FIG. 1 ). This study is important for many rea - sons. First, if patients with cancer can tolerate physical exercise, clinical oncologists could integrate physical activity into current treat - ment plans, which could have profound effects on current lifestyle intervention for successful cancer treatment. Second, as with the studies on memory and metabolic Figure 1 | The multiple benefits of exercise. Exercise can reverse age-related vulnerability to retinal injury, increase memory function via the myokine cathepsin B, improve metabolic homeostasis via communication between bone and skeletal muscle, and reduce tumour growth via the mobilization and redistribution of natural killer (NK) cells.

Such evidence-based research might have profound public health ramifications that facilitate behavioural modification within patient populations. Last, in an intriguing study, Chryso - stomou et al.10 demonstrated that exer - cise can reverse age-related vulnerability to retinal damage. Retinal ganglion cells are recognized to be increasingly sus - ceptible to injury with advanced age. As levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and AMPK both increase with exercise and are thought to medi - ate the beneficial effects of exercise, the investigators focused on the role of these two molecules in the protective effects of exercise against retinal injury in mice 10. The investigators demonstrated that retinal ganglion cells undergo an increase in intra-ocular pressure dur - ing exercise, which in turn preserves inner retinal synapses. Moreover, when an injury takes place in sedentary mice, levels of BDNF normally decrease, but this reduction did not occur in exer - cised mice. However, in mice with BDNF haploinsufficiency or when BDNF was pharmacologically blocked, the benefi - cial effect of exercise was diminished 10. Interestingly, although BDNF can acti - vate AMPK in skeletal muscle during exercise, the protective effects of BDNF in this model were independent of acti - vation of this important fuel-sensing kinase 10. Chrysostomou and colleagues justifiably concluded that their data pro - vided new insights into the mechanism underlying exercise-mediated protection of retinal cells (FIG. 1) .In summary, these four important studies published in 2016 provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of exercise against a myr - iad of diseases including dementia 4, cancer9, obesity5 and retinal disease10. In addition, by uncovering these mechanisms, the inves - tigators have opened up the field for future identification of therapeutic targets and development of therapies for the treatment of these diseases. However, more importantly, these studies provide additional evidence that 'exercise is medicine' . Mark A.

The ever-expanding myokinome: discovery challenges and therapeutic Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endo - crine hormone that regulates energy homeosta - sis and insulin sensitivity1. FGF21 is produced by the liver in response to various nutritional, physiological and pathological stimuli, and signals to multiple tissues including the cen - tral nervous system (CNS) and adipose tissues to mediate metabolic effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism 1. Extended pharmaco - logical administration of FGF21 to obese or diabetic rodents increases energy expenditure and browning of adipose tissues, and mark - edly reduces body weight without significantly affecting food intake 1. The identification of FGF21, and the subsequent characterization of its function, is a remarkable story that has been full of unexpected twists and turns. Although FGF21 was identified in a screen for factors that induce glucose uptake in white adi-pocytes in vitro through insulin-independent mechanisms, FGF21 was subsequently found to profoundly enhance insulin sensitivity in vivo . Notably, despite being identified as a factor that regulates glucose metabolism, the most striking and consistent metabolic effects of FGF21 across species are on lipid metabo - lism in animal models of obesity and diabetes mellitus 1. In 2016, a new chapter in the FGF21 story unfolded, as four papers were published that provide novel insights into the produc - tion and function of FGF21 in mice, monkeys and humans.

Administration of PF -05231023 t o monkeys resulted in a marked decrease in food intake; pair feeding untreated obese monkeys with the same calorie content per day as the 10 mg/kg PF-05231023 t reatment group resulted in body weight changes of the same magnitude as obese monkeys administered PF -05231023. S imilar metabolic effects were observed in humans following PF -05231023 a dministration, which included an ~4-5% decrease in body weight after only 25 days 2; food intake data were not reported. Thus, the effect of FGF21 on body weight that was identified in rodents seems to translate to primates and humans. However, the mechanism underlying this effect might be species-specific, with energy expenditure being the primary mechanism to reduce body weight in rodents and food intake the primary mechanism in primates and humans (FIG. 1) . Figure 1 | Livertobrain hormonal axis regulating energy homeostasis. Production of circulating levels of FGF21 from the liver are induced in response to low protein or high carbo - hydrate levels in both rodents and humans. The conserved and species-specific effects of FGF21 signalling to the brain are indicated. ATF4, activating overexpres - sion of FGF21 in rodents does not decrease total caloric intake, von Holstein-Rathlou and colleagues demonstrated that FGF21 regulates macronutrient intake in mice 4. Previous work in humans identified single-nucleotide poly - morphisms (SNPs) near the FGF21 locus that are associated with changes in macro nu trient intake, including increased carbohydrate intake and decreased fat intake 5,6. Using both gain-of-function and loss -of-function animal models, von Holstein-Rathlou et al. discov - ered that FGF21 regulates simple sugar intake and preference but not the intake of lipids or protein 4. Mice lacking FGF21 exhibited increased simple sugar intake, whereas mice overexpressing FGF21 had markedly reduced sugar consumption, without decreased total caloric intake. Acute administration of recombinant FGF21 protein to wild-type mice rapidly and significantly suppressed simple sugar intake. Interestingly, exogenous FGF21 administration also suppressed the intake of the non-caloric sweetener sucra - lose. von Holstein-Rathlou and colleagues found that FGF21 production by the liver is increased by high carbohydrate levels through activation of the transcription fac - tor ChREBP . FGF21 then enters the circula - tion and signals to paraventricular neurons in the hypothalamus to reduce sugar intake. These effects of FGF21 were not mediated by taste sensing but, rather, through taste processing 4. Together, these data reveal that FGF21 functions as a key mediator of a novel liver -to-brain hormonal axis that regulates macronutrient preference by acting as a sugar satiety signal (FIG. 1) . Consistent with the role of FGF21 in regulating sugar intake, a second study by Talukdar and colleagues also found that FGF21 suppresses sweet taste preference by signalling to the CNS 7. However, in contrast to the study of von Holstein-Rathlou and colleagues, Talukdar et al. extended their studies to monkeys and found that admin - istration of the long-acting FGF21 analogue, PF-05231023, p otently inhibited sweet taste preference7. Interestingly, Talukdar et al. also discovered that overexpression of FGF21 in mice reduced alcohol preference, which suggests that FGF21 affects central reward. Indeed, long-term administration of FGF21 in mice decreased levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmen - tal area, key brain regions that regulate cen - tral reward 7. Importantly, this role of central FGF21 signalling in the regulation of alcohol consumption seems to translate to humans, as a SNP in KLB (encoding the FGF21 obli - gate co - receptor -k lotho) is associated with alcohol consumption8. Increased levels of this liver- derived hormone might thus be produced in response to excess levels of car - bohydrate and/or alcohol to suppress reward and prevent alcohol- ind uced and non- alcohol-induced liver injury (FIG. 1) . Although FGF21 gene and protein expres - sion is induced by high levels of carbohydrate to regulate nutrient metabolism 4, FGF21 is also induced during a number of different physiological conditions (including fasting and overfeeding) and in response to other diets elevation of FGF21 levels has been difficult. To identify the nutritional and meta - bolic context for FGF21 induction, Solon-Biet and colleagues used the geometric frame - work, a multidimensional framework of 25 Key advances Administration of an FGF21 analogue to primates markedly decreases body weightand food intake but does not increase browning of adipose tissues 2 FGF21 mRNA and protein expression is induced in the liver, and the protein entersthe circulation in response to low levels of protein and high levels of carbohydrate 4,9 Elevated levels of FGF21 signal to the brainto suppress sugar intake and sweet taste preference 4,7 FGF21 decreases central reward andreduces alcohol preference 7 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 29ENDOCRINOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.diets varying in macronutrient (protein, car - bohydrate and fat) and total-energy density, to assess the contribution of macronutrient intake and energy intake to hepatic and circu - lating levels of FGF21 in mice 9. This compre - hensive analysis revealed that maximal FGF21 induction was associated with a combination of low protein and high carbohydrate intake. Interestingly, FGF21 expression was not sig - nificantly altered by fat intake or total energy intake. Consistent with the in vivo data, incu- bation of human HepG2 liver cells with glu - cose increased FGF21 protein expression, and maximal levels were observed under condi - tions of high glucose levels and low branched-chain amino acid levels 9 (FIG. 1 ). These data are thus consistent with the observation that low protein 10 and high carbohydrate4 levels induce FGF21 expression in humans and align with the model of von Holstein-Rathlou et al. , which proposed that FGF21 functions as a negative-feedback satiety signal to maintain macronutrient balance through suppression of simple sugar intake 4. In summary, four important studies pub - lished in 2016 have shifted our understand - ing of the major physiological mechanisms controlling FGF21 expression and the phys - iological and pharmacological consequences of FGF21 signalling to the CNS. Additional studies are necessary to determine how the effects of FGF21 on macronutrient intake are retained across species despite species- specific differences in total caloric intake and energy expenditure (FIG. 1) . Future studies elucidating the central pathways mediating FGF21 functions might yield important ther - apeutic targets to treat metabolic disease and drug addiction. Matthew J.

HEALTHY AGEING IN 2016 Obesity in geroscience \u2014 is cellular senescence the culprit? Claudio Franceschi Obesity and ageing are major worldwide health challenges associated with lifestyle changes and an increase in age-related diseases, characterized by chronic inflammation dubbed metaflammation and inflammaging. However, the mechanistic link between these inflammatory processes is still unknown. New findings in 2016 shed light on these issues and indicate common targets for intervention. The obesity epidemic and the increase in the number of elderly people are currently pre - senting major worldwide health challenges. These phenomena have been attributed to rapid changes in lifestyle in the past century, which have created favourable conditions for survival but also access to nutrient-rich food and a sedentary lifestyle. As obesity is a pow - erful risk factor for many age-related diseases, a clash between these two trends can be pre - dicted, which questions the optimistic vision of an endless increase of life expectancy and health span. Understanding the determinants of healthy ageing is crucial to avoid health-care systems becoming overwhelmed with sick elderly individuals. This concern has prompted a reappraisal of geriatrics or gerontology, known collectively as 'geroscience' (REF. 1). As ageing is the single major risk factor for age- related diseases, a central tenet of geroscience suggests that a small number of mechanisms (such as, cell senescence and inflammation 2,3) are shared between these diseases and advanc - ing age. This comprehensive approach offers a rationale to combat age-related diseases under a single umbrella of ageing, instead of individually, which is currently favoured by medical schools 1. Several papers published in 2016 have enhanced our understanding of ageing and obesity, offering a strong, integrated rationale for their prevention and cure, as suggested by 'rejuvenation' seen in experiments of hetero - chronic parabiosis2,3. The well-known, but oversimplified, notion is reticulum stress in visceral adipocytes leading to the accumulation of inflammatory cells. These cells are thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the chronic inflammation in metabolic diseases called 'metaflammation' (REF. 4) and to contribute to a whole-body pro-inflammatory state that occurs during ageing, termed 'inflammaging' These processes lead to cardiometabolic, degenera - tive and inflammatory disorders during age - ing (FIG. 1 ). However, the mechanisms linking stressed adipose tissue and immune activation are still largely unclear.Natl Acad. Sci. USA http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/ pnas.1611243113 (2016). 9.Solon-Biet, S.

Obesity Nutrient excess Calorie restriction Physical activity In one study, a diet enriched with saturated fat, cholesterol and high-fructose corn syrup (roughly equivalent to a human fast-food diet) induced deleterious changes in body weight and composition, as well as in meas - ures of physical, cardiac and metabolic health in mice, which were attributed to changes in cellular senescence 5. This diet induced a dra - matic increase in the number of cells express - ing markers of cellular senescence (such as, p16, p53 and senescence-associated -ga- lactosidase cells secrete cytokines, chemokines, matrix remodelling proteases and growth factors, which are - lectively known as a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) 2. A 7.5 -fold increase in number of V AT cells express-ing CD68, a pan-macrophage marker, was observed, suggesting that these senescent cells were indeed macrophages. Importantly, physical exercise prevented accumulation of senescent cells and development of SASP , while concomitantly neutralizing the harm - ful effects of this diet on metabolic (weight, subcutaneous fat and V AT, insulin and glu - cose levels) and health (cardiac function and running capacity) parameters. Another article showed that, in addition to an increased number of macrophages (F4/80 +), senescent T cells preferentially accumulate in the inflammatory foci of V AT in HFD-fed mice 6. These T cells constitutively expressed CD153+PD1+CD44highCD62lowCD4+, and ~60% expressed SA-gal. Interestingly, upon cell transfer, these senescent T cells induced inflammation in V AT (high expression lev - els of IL6 and TNF) and insulin resistance to lean mice, suggesting that these cells are likely to have a causal role in the development of obesity. A third paper analysed the clearance of human senescent fibroblasts implanted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, which were embedded into alginate beads to protect them from immunocyte attack 7. One of the major cell types attracted by these senescent fibroblasts was a subpop - ulation p16 and SA-gal, which resembled senescent cells. These cells were sensitive to liposomal clodronate, which was used to selectively kill cells capable of phagocytosis. Moreover, systemic clodronate treatment of old animals reduced the number of cells expressing p16 and SA -gal, indicating that a significant pro - portion of these cells were indeed a subclass of macrophages. Yang et al. showed that a moderate calorie restriction was effective in non-obese adult humans (aged 20-50 years) 8. After 2 years of 25% calorie restriction, individuals had a 10.4% reduction in weight, an increase in autophagy markers in muscle and a significant reduction in circulating inflammatory mark - ers (C-reactive protein: 40%; TNF: 50%), without any effect on immune responses (such as, skin delayed hypersensitivity and vaccine responsiveness). Finally, Collins et al. investigated the relationship between compromised muscle integrity, diet, obesity-associated chronic inflammation, adipose tissue and the gut microbiota following a short-term, high-fat, high-sucrose diet 9. In and the number of cells (quanti - fied by Oil Red O, picrosirius red staining and CD68 + cells) increased (from ~0% to 1-2%, from ~2% to 4% and from ~1% to 6%, respectively) after 3 days and was sustained over 28 days. These findings were associ - ated with systemic inflammatory changes and consistent, dynamic, alterations in gut microbiota composition. These data indicate a number of key points. First, senescent macrophages have a major role in both ageing and obesity, and are potential cellular targets for treatment of both conditions. Second, the accumulation of senescent immune cells, either macrophages or T cells (immune ageing) and their SASP link obesity to metaflammation 4 and chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammatory state (inflammaging), which contribute to ageing and age-related diseases 2,3 (FIG. 1) . Moreover, immunity, metabolism, adipose tissue and muscle are highly integrated factors in ageing. Early accumulation of immune senescent cells seems to be a crucial event linking nutritional stress, chronic inflam - mation, obesity, ageing and age-related dis - eases (FIG. 1) . In this scenario, changes in gut microbiota composition could be another early and/or causal mechanism, rather than a simple consequence of nutrient-rich diets, and could also be an intervention target. Furthermore, the two major pillars to coun-teract obesity and ageing are in fact the same \u2014 appropriate nutrition or dietary habits and physical exercise \u2014 and their beneficial Figure 1 | A nutrient-rich, high-fat diet induces accumulation in visceral adipose tissue of senescent immune cells (macro phages and T cells). Senescent immune cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) are characterized by the secretion of a broad repertoire of active mole-cules impinging on several targets (cell growth, tissue repair, inflammation), referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The pro-inflammatory activity of SASP inflammation (known as metaflammation) and to age-associated, low-grade, chronic inflammation (known as inflammaging), that in turn favour the onset of chronic age-related diseases. These factors might also be modulated by the gut microbiota.Key advances The visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of mice fed a diet of fast-food accumulates pro-inflammatory senescent cells that are cleared by physical exercise 5 The VAT of mice fed a high-fat diet accumulates a particular subset of senescent CD4 + T cells that can induce obesity when transferred to lean mice6 Human senescent fibroblasts implanted into immunodeficient mice induce senescence in macrophages that can be cleared by a bisphosphonate drug (clodronate), which kills phagocytic cells 7 2 years of moderate calorie restriction induce a significant loss of body weight and a decrease in inflammatory markers withoutany detrimental effect on immune responses in humans 8 A short-term, high-fat, high-sucrose diet in Sprague Dawley rats quickly fat deposition, fibrosis and increased number of pro-inflammatory cells, which are associated with early systemic inflammation and dynamic alterations in gut microbiota composition 9 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 31ENDOCRINOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.effects target basic biological mechanisms such as cell senescence and inflammation. Remarkably, the potential of calorie restric - tion, the most studied anti-ageing strategy, to reduce the accumulation of senescent cells has been largely neglected both in animal models and humans. Based on these results, the biological role of senescent cells and SASP is even more com - plex and intriguing than previously thought. Senescent cells accumulate in tissues and organs during ageing, and data in mice indi - cate that their clearance can extend median lifespan and attenuate age-related deteriora - tion of several organs 2,5. In adult and old ani - mals, senescent cells have a negative influence on health because they damage neighbouring cells via SASP and contribute to age-related degeneration and inflammation, that is, inflammaging. The gut microbiota, which undergoes profound changes and remod - elling with age and is also quickly gaining the stage, is highly sensitive to diet and life-style and can be modified by prebiotics and probiotics10. Time will tell if, and to what extent, changes in human gut microbiota are causally related to obesity via cellular or macrophage senescence; this is a hot topic for research, together with the role of other cell types (such as tissue-resident natural killer cells whose main function is to sense cell alterations due to infections, transfor - mation or exposure to other stressors) and their epigenetic changes in metaflammation. I look forward to seeing these issues clarified in 2017 and beyond.

Modulation of gut-brain-axis function is associated with alterations in the stress response and over - all behaviour in both animal models and in humans 1. A high comorbidity exists between stress-related mental symptoms such as anxiety and IBS, a fact that has provided the greatest impetus for research into the impor - tance of the gut-brain axis2. Over 50% of patients with IBS have comorbid depression or anxiety. Modulation of the gut-brain axis is increasingly being proposed as an appropriate target for the development of novel treatments for a wide variety of disorders that range from depression and anxiety to IBS, obesity and neurodevelopmental disorders 3. The gut microbiota interact with the host through immune, neuroendocrine and neural pathways 4. These pathways are components of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and preclin ic al evidence suggests that the microbiota can recruit this bidirectional communication net-work to modulate brain development, func - tion and even behaviour. Preliminary studies have shown differences in the composition of the gut microbiota in patients with depres - sion compared with healthy individuals. which raises the question: would transplanta-tion of microbiota from a patient with depres - sion have a similar effect if the immune system and brain development in the recipient animal were normal? To answer this question, Kelly and col - leagues7 recruited 34 patients with major depres sion and 33 healthy individ ua ls matched for age and sex. Plasma levels of cytokines, C-reactive protein, salivary cortisol and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were determined by ELISA, and showed alter - ations supporting a proinflamatory phenotype associated with depression. Plasma levels of tryptophan and kynurenine and composition of faecal microbiota were also determined. Depression was associated with decreased gut-microbiota richness and diversity. A fae - cal microbiota transplant was prepared from a subgroup of patients with depression or from healthy individuals and transferred by oral gavage to a microbiota- de ficient rat model. The model comprised normal rats with a developed immune system and normal brain function that were given a cocktail of antibiotics to eliminate the gut microbiota. Transplantation In one series of experiments, germ-free mice (but not conventionally raised animals) were protected from depression-like immobil - ity induced by the forced-swim test as well as from anxiety behaviours. In addition, faecal samples from 58 Chinese patients with major depression and 63 healthy individ ua ls as controls showed distinct differences in microbial composition 5. In the patients with depression, the microbiota had alterations in species belonging to three bacterial phyla: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Transplantation of faecal sa mples pooled from five patients with dep ression into germ- free mice resulted in depressive behaviour patterns; by contrast, faecal transplantation from five healthy individ ua ls had no behav - ioural effect. Mice receiving microbiota from patients with depression showed disturbances in hippo campal gene activation and also in carbo hydrate and amino-acid metabolism5. This study provides convincing evidence that the depressive phenotype can be transferred by transplantation of the microbiota. However, germ-free mice have abnormal immune- system development and brain anomalies (such as decreased levels of 5 -hydroxytryptamine and brain- derived neurotrophic factor, changes in neuro nal morphology in cortical myelination 6), GUT-BRAIN AXIS IN 2016 Brain-gut-microbiota axis \u2014 mood, metabolism and behaviour Timothy G. Dinan and John F . Cryan In 2016, key studies have increased our understanding of the part played by the brain-gut-microbiota axis in disorders as diverse as depression, obesity and autism spectrum disorder. The data indicate that alterations in gut-microbial composition can substantially affect central physiology, and that transplantation of the gut microbiota can transfer a behavioural or physiological phenotype.

This study prov ide s further evidence that the gut microbiota have a causal role in the develop - ment of features of depression and could prov i de a tract a ble target in the treatment and prevention of this disorder. Several lines of evidence suggest that brain function and behaviour are influenced by microbial metabolites. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, propionate and acetate, are key products of the gut micro - biota. Although no direct evidence currently exists that SCFAs travel via the blood stream to the brain in humans, findings increasingly support the indirect actions of SCFAs. For example, increased production of acetate by an altered gut microbiota in mice and rats leads to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which in turn promotes increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), increased ghrelin secretion, sequelae 8. Perry and col- leagues8 found that, in contrast to propion - ate and butyrate, whole-body turnover of acetate, and concentrations of acetate in the plasma and faeces, were markedly increased in insulin- r esistant rats after a high-fat diet (HFD) compared with chow-fed rats8. Acetate infusion in chow-fed rats strongly replicated the increases in GSIS measured in HFD-fed rats, implicating heightened acetate turnover in driving the increases in GSIS in HFD-fed rats. By contrast, supplementing butyrate in chow-fed rats to match the turnover rates observed in HFD-fed rats surprisingly had no effect on GSIS. To examine the role of the gut microbiota in acetate-induced hyperinsulin - aemia, HFD-fed rats were treated with broad- spectrum, nonabsorbable oral anti b iotics, which resulted in a major reduction in GSIS during a hyperglycaemic clamp. Faecal trans - plantations transferred the acetate turn o ver, faecal acetate and GSIS associated with the donor animal to the recipient animal. These data suggest that the gut microbiota are the source of most of the increase in endogenous acetate production in HFD-fed rats. When the vagus nerve was severed in the rats, infusion with acetate exhibited a marked reduction in plasma insulin concentrations throughout a hyperglycaemic clamp, without any change in plasma glucagon concentrations, when compared with rats that had an intact vagus nerve 8. Overall, these data support the view that increased acetate production resulting from a nutrient-gut-microbiota interaction and subsequent parasympathetic activation is a possible therapeutic target for obesity. Maternal obesity has been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, including autism spectrum disorder 9. Now, Buffington and colleagues10 have shown that obesity in mice induced by a maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) is associated with social behav - ioural deficits, which are mediated by alter - ations in the offspring gut microbiota. The diversity of the microbiota in MHFD offspring was reduced compared with a nimals on a regu l ar diet, with an especially notable reduc - tion in Lactobacillus spp. The MHFD-induced changes in the offspring gut microbiota were associated with major alterations in the meso - limbic dopamine reward system within the ventral tegmental area. Furthermore, treat - ment with a commensal bacterial s pecies Lactobacillus reuteri increased levels of oxytocin (known to increase social behav - iour), ameliorated synaptic dysfunction in the ventral tegmental area and selectively reversed social deficits in MHFD offspring. This amelioration of the deficient social behaviour was entirely speci f ic to L. reuteri, as treatment with another Lactobacillus species, Lactobacillus johnsonii, whose abun - dance is also reduced in the gut microbiota of MHFD offspring, failed to n ormalise social behavioural deficits. These data support pre - vious evidence suggesting a role of the gut microbiota in social behaviour10. Understanding the way in which the gut microbiota influence gut-brain-axis com - munication (FIG. 1) has been the subject of considerable research effort in the past few years. The gut microbiota are now recog - nized to influence processes such as the stress response and, consequently, to play a part in the pathophysio l ogy of functional bowel dis - orders such as IBS2. Whether changes in the microbiota are central to the pathophysiology of at least some psychiatric disorders such as depression has yet to be definitively demon - strated, although the studies published this year provide further support for such a view. Increasingly, evidence is accumulating for a role of the gut microbiota in autism spectrum disorder and the negative metabolic conse-quences in obesity. Future studies must deter - mine whether exciting new data, which has largely been obtained from preclinical animal experiments, translates to humans; only time will tell. Timothy G.

HBV is non-cytopathic but chronic infection can trigger immunopathology, leading to chronic liver inflammation and fibrosis, ultimately resulting in liver cirrhosis and/or hepato c ellular carcinoma (HCC). Work by Stanaway et al.1 published in 2016 has high - lighted how widespread viral hepatitis and its complications remain in the world today, with the burden of death and disability increasing at an alarming rate. Although most other communicable diseases are decreasing, the absolute burden and relative rank of viral hepatitis is increasing. Viral hepatitis is now the seventh leading cause of death worldwide, with attributable deaths increasing from an estimated 0.89 million in 1990 (95% uncertainty interval 0.86-0.94) to 1.45 (95% un certainty in terval 1.38-1.54) million in 2013. Preventive measures remain of para - mount importance for HBV and HCV con - trol, including the prophylactic HBV vaccine that is now part of universal immunization programmes in many countries worldwide. An important demonstration of how this approach reduces long-term morbidity from HBV infection comes from a 2016 study in Taiwan (REF. 2). Chang et al.2 analysed 1,509 patients with HCC according to whether they were born before or after the stepwise introduction of HBV immunization of newborn babies in 1984. Adjusting for age, a significant reduction in HCC rates was shown in vaccinated birth cohorts reaching adulthood (from 0.92 to 0.23 H CC inci - dence per 100,000 person-years), in line with previous findings in children and adoles - cents. The most common reason for break - through infection in vaccinated infants was high-level hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) infection in the mother. An additional strat - egy to tackle such transmission was evalu - ated by Pan et al. 3 who randomly assigned 300 HBeAg+ m others with >200,000 IU/ml of HBV DNA in the third trimester of preg - nancy to receive tenofovir from week 30 or 32 to 4 weeks postpartum or not, in addition to standard immunoprophylaxis of the infant. Tenofovir substantially reduced mother-to-child transmission in this high-risk group, although it did not eliminate it completely (HBV infection incidence dropped from 18% to 5% of infants). Importantly, birth defects were not increased in the tenofovir group, in line with its good safety record in HIV infection in pregnancy. The improved efficacy of prophylactic strategies should ultimately reduce the prev-alence of HBV over the coming decades but a huge burden of chronic disease currently remains. In contrast to the astonishing effi - cacy of new HCV drugs, current therapies can efficiently suppress HBV replication and reduce liver inflam m ation, but are unable to clear the virus or even achieve sustained virologic control after therapy withdrawal. Exciting progress has been made in pre - clinical development of new classes of anti - virals for HBV (not discussed here), but harnessing the immune system is prob a bly still required for effective off- tr eatment responses. Encouragingly, the immune system has the inherent capacity to maintain HBV under effective long-term control in the majority of infected adults who resolve infection, whereas chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is character iz ed by profound defects of HBV- specific antiviral immunity. Attempts to boost such immunity with immune-based therapies have, to date, yielded disappoint- ing results. This issue is exemplified by the failure of a therapeutic vaccine to induce any substantial reductions in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in a phase II trial of 178 patients with CHB already immuno - suppressed on antiviral agents4, despite induction of HBV-specific T cells observed with this vaccine in healthy volunteers in a phase I trial. This heat- in activated, yeast- based vaccine containing HBsAg, hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B x anti - gen (HBxAg) also achieved limited boosting of HBV-specific T - cell responses in patients with CHB in the phase II trial, but notably not against HBsAg 4. To achieve an off-treatment 'functional cure' , we require improved understanding of factors limiting the development of effi - cient antiviral immunity in different disease phases of CHB. In 2016, two interesting papers using a mouse model of HBV persis - tence 5,6 described new potential mechanisms of HBV-specific T - cell tolerance, while a third paper7 provided evidence that such tolerance is not fully oper a tional in the early phases of CHB. Tian et al.5 investigated immunological mechanisms contributing to the propensity of HBV to establish chronicity after vertical infection (rather than the typical control seen after adult horizontal acquisition 1).

Further experi me nts suggested sable for HBV-specific CD8+ PD Another HBV viral antigens by hepatic macro - phages represents an important mechanism of HBV-specific T -c ell tolerance induction6. In the same mouse model of hydrodynamic HBV infection, HBV-specific CD4 + T-cell deletion was caused by their intrahepatic retention mediated by chemokines prod uc ed by intrahepatic macrophages6. Here, T-cell considered chemokines and para xically drove HBV-specific T -c ell deletion by intrahepatic trapping and deletion. Both these studies indicate that HBV- specific T -c ell deletion might be caused directly by persistent presentation of viral antigens by infected hepatocytes, and by cross-presentation of HBV antigens by mye-loid cells present in the liver (FIG. 1) , high- lighting this cell type as a future thera peu tic target. These interesting results must be inter - preted with caution because of the inherent limit ations of the hydrodynamic mouse model to fully recapitulate the complexity of natural HBV infection; discrepancy between data obtained in natural infection and mouse models has been reported7. The issue of HBV immunotolerance was further explored in 2016 in patient samples8. The level of HBV-DNA integration, clonal hepatocyte expansion and HBV-specific T-c ell response were similar in CHB, irrespec - tive of clinical and virological cyte turnover and HBV-DNA inte were present in young (14-30 years) 'immuno tolerant' patients, showing that liver damage and potential pro- on cogenic events already occur in this first phase of CHB. As the level of HBV-specific T -c ell response was similar in patients categor - ized as immunotolerant or immune active, the researchers argued that this terminology seems inadequate to define the clinical and immunological features of the hetero ge neous populations of patients with CHB. That the degree of HBV-specific immune tolerance is not linked to age or levels of liver inflamma - tion has important therapeutic consequences as the field starts to select patient groups for new immune-based therapies. The universally weak HBV-specific T -c ell responses observed in all stages of CHB underscore the need to further define under - lying molecular defects. One such defect has been found in mitochondria of HBV-specific T cells, which have defective depolarization 9 (FIG. 1) . The capacity of T cells to flexibly metabolize glucose and other nutrients has been identi fied as one critical determinant shaping immune function. In this study of patients with CHB, whereas functional cyto - megalovirus-specific CD8 + T cells could util - ize oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of glucose, the exhausted PD -1+ HBV-specific CD8+ T cells within the same donors were heavily dependent on glucose for glycolysis. The possibility of targeting mitochondrial and or metabolic defects as novel therapeutic approaches was exemplified by the capacity of IL-12 to recover mitochondrial potential and oxidative phosphorylation of HBV-specific T cells in vitro . Dissecting the extent of immunologi - cal defects present in heterogeneous CHB patient populations will be necessary to tailor distinct immunotherapeutic strat eg ies. Such immuno lo gical information must be coupled with virological data that goes beyond the cur rent quantification of overall serum HBV level to instead analyse the com - position of infected hepatocytes. A detailed analysis using novel immunohistochemical techniques 10 showed that HBV-infected hepatocytes during CHB do not constitute a homogeneous population of infected targets, but are a complex mosaic of cells expressing different levels of HBV antigens and DNA. In particular, the demonstration of a mutu - ally exclusive pattern of expression of HBsAg and whole HBV DNA in infected hepato - cytes constitutes a surprising finding that needs to be considered when assessing novel immunological approaches to deal with the complex interactions between HBV and its natural host. The task of achieving a functional cure for the still large population of chron - ically infected patients remains challeng - ing. Nevertheless, better understanding of the mechanisms of HBV immunotolerance will improve the success of future thera-pies that will probably involve combined anti viral and immune strategies. Under - standing how best to combine these different approaches and select the most appropriate patient populations to treat will be the next major challenges. Mala K.

In 2016, major advances have been made in the use of circulating tumour cells and cell-free DNA for monitoring tumour evolution in patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, with a focus on colorectal cancer. Figure 1 | Key applications of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) as liquid biopsies for precision medicine. Blood can be sampled repeatedly to detect cancer, predict risk for metastatic relapse, identify therapeutic targets, stratify patients to the most effective drugs, monitor the efficacy of therapies ( for example, persistence or increased levels of CTCs and/or ctDNA indicates resistance to therapy), detect potential resistance mechanisms and detect early relapse in patients without metastatic disease or the progression of metastases.Nature Reviews | Gastroenterology & HepatologyGastrointestinal cancer Precision medicineLiquid biopsy Early detection of cancer (diagnosis) Determine risk for metastatic relapse (prognosis) Identication of therapeutic targets Stratication for treatment decision Real-time monitoring of treatment Detection of resistance mechanisms Early detection of metastatic relapse ctDNA CTCsThe term 'liquid biopsy' was originally introduced 6 years ago to define the analy - sis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the blood of patients with cancer1, but it has now been extended to the examination of circu - lating cell-free DNA (ctDNA), micro RN As, microvesicles and even platelets, which all contain tumour-derived information 2,3. In particular, analyses of CTCs and ctDNA have paved new diagnostic avenues 4. Key clini c al applications include the detection of cancer, prediction of prognosis in patients with curable disease, monitoring of systemic therapies and stratification of patients based on the detection of therapeutic targets or resistance mechanisms 4 (FIG. 1) . Tumour heterogeneity is a hallmark of cancer5 that also offers an important rationale for blood-based analysis as compared to single tissue. Russo et al. 6 showed in a study published in 2016 how genomic heterogeneity is associ - ated with acquired resistance to targeted agents. Studying EGFR blockade in colorectal cancer (CRC), the authors showed that liquid biopsies could be integrated with radiological imaging to monitor the effect of individual oncogenic alterations on lesion-specific responses. Biopsy of a patient's progressing liver metastasis fol - lowing prolonged response to cetuximab revealed a MEK1 mutation (Lys57Thr) as a novel mechanism of acquired resistance. This lesion regressed upon treatment with panitu - mumab and the MEK inhibitor trametinib. In ctDNA, a previously unrecognized KRAS mutation (Gln61His) was identified that increased despite therapy, and this same KRAS mutation was later found in a separate non - responding metastasis. Thus, separ a te tumour lesions in the same patient can harbour dis - tinct mutations that are detectable by liquid biopsy. Analysis of a single-lesion biopsy might therefore be inadequate to guide selection of subsequent targeted therapies. Most literature on ctDNA is derived from the analysis of patients at advanced disease stages, when the yield of ctDNA is much higher than in earlier stages. In patients with cancer, detection of minimal residual disease by monitoring of peripheral blood after sur - gery has become the next frontier. In this context, Tie et al. 7 described promising find- ings of ctDNA monitoring in patients with stage II CRC. Thus far, it is difficult to deter - mine which of these tumours will recur and to identify patients who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Tie et al. 7 analysed 1,046 plasma samples from a prospective cohort of 230 patients with resected stage II colon cancer and showed that ctDNA can persist in a patient's blood after surgery. Most importantly, this persis - tence was associated with an increased risk of relapse. Similar prognostic value in patients with stage II CRC has been already reported for CTCs detected at surgery. Future inter - ventional studies are now required to evaluate whether this group of high-risk patients with stage II CRC will profit from chemotherapy to prevent recurrence. An important clinical application of the liquid biopsy is the early evaluation of therapy efficacy. In this setting, Li et al. 8 prospectively evaluated 136 patients with an advanced gastric cancer, counting CTCs using the FDA-cleared CellSearch system (Janssen Diagnostics, USA) at baseline and after 6 weeks of chemotherapy. The results of this study, published in 2016, showed clearly that unfavourable post- t reatment CTC levels (3 CT Cs per 7.5 m l blood) were correlated with a poor therapeutic outcome reflecting an ineffective therapeutic response. Specifically, conversion to a favourable CTC level follow - ing therapy improved prognosis, but patients who changed to an unfavourable CTC level had a worse prognosis. CTCs are defined as an independent biomarker predictor of decreased progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

Understanding the molecular mech - anisms that regulate the biology of metastasis- competent CTCs is of utmost importance in unravelling the formation of metastases and tumour relapse in patients with cancer. Cayrefourcq et al. 9 derived the first cell line (CTC-MCC -41) from CTCs isolated from the blood of a patient with colon cancer. Subsequently, in 2016, Alix-Panabi\u00e8res et al. 10 determined the molecular bases under ly ing differences between this colon CTC line and well-described cancer cell lines derived from primary tumours and from metastatic sites 10. The results showed clearly that the CTCs displayed a very specific transcription programme. Interestingly, among the 1,624 transcripts exclusively upregulated in CTC- MCC -41 cells, key genes related to energy metabolism, DNA repair and stemness were observed. Such data might supply insights for the discovery of new pathways and biomarkers to identify the most aggressive CTC sub - populations with stem cell properties. CTC lines could contribute to the development of new drugs to eradicate metastasis-initiator CTCs causing relapses and cancer-related death in individuals with cancer. In conclusion, CTCs and ctDNA analyses are complementary, depending on the con - text of use. Prediction of prognosis in patients with potentially curable disease can already be achieved and might lead to improved tumour staging. Monitoring chemotherapy or other targeted therapies by longitudinal measure - ments of CTCs or ctDNA is feasible and the consequences are currently being investigated in clinical trials.

Lakatos In 2016, personalized medicine for IBD has been evolving. Increasing comfort with biosimilar infliximab was achieved with 'real-life' data. Drugs with alternative modes of action confirmed substantial benefit, even in patients failing anti-TNF agents. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells yielded a new treatment option for perianal fistulas. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are classi fied as chronic inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by intermittent disease flares and periods of remission. In the absence of adequate treatment, chronic inflam ma tion results in irreversible intestinal damage and disability. The introduction of anti-TNF agents led to a paradigm shift in management strategies; infliximab and adalimumab induce and maintain clinical remission, as well as mucosal healing. However, one-third of patients with IBD do not respond to anti-TNF treatment and up to 40% of initial respond-ers lose response or develop intolerance over a year 1. Thus, optimization of anti-TNF treat - ment is essential and drugs with new modes of action are needed. Correlation between serum anti-TNF levels and clinical, as well as endoscopic, outcomes has been previously demonstrated. However, patients with optimal serum drug concen - trations can also fail to respond to treatment. Moreover, clinical and endoscopic response also correlates with the number of TNF- expressing immune cells, as detected by con - focal laser endomicro sc opy. To shed further light on the missing links of the pharmaco - kinetics of biologic agents, Y arur \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.Key advances Patients with IBD and moderate to severe inflammation are more likely to exhibit a 'serum to tissue anti-TNF mismatch', which might account for primary non-response 2 'Real-life' experience with infliximab biosimilars suggests that CT -P13 is effective and safe in the induction and maintenance of clinical remission and response in IBD 4; efficacy of one-time switching from the originator to the biosimilar is non-inferior compared with continued originator treatment 6 Ustekinumab was more effective than placebo in inducing clinical response and maintaining clinical remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease in a phase III trial 8; in a real-life cohort, vedolizumab showed clinical benefit in half of the patients with IBD who had failed anti-TNF treatment 7 Local treatment with Cx601 stem cells is yielding a novel therapeutic option for refractory perianal Crohn's disease fistulas 10 measured intestinal ti ssue TNF levels as well as tissue and serum drug concentrations in a cross- sectional study of 30 patients with IBD who had vary ing d egrees of disease severity and were treated with infliximab or adali - mumab. Inflamed intestinal tissues exhib- than matched unin flamed sa mples, which correlated with the increased TNF levels of inflamed tissues, as well as with the sever - ity of inflammation. However, in moderate to severe inflammation, the drug to TNF concentration ratio in tissue was lower than in mild inflammation or in the absence of inflammation. Accordingly, these patients were more likely to exhibit a high serum and a low tissue anti-TNF concentration, which was interpreted as a so -called serum to tissue anti- TNF mismatch. These findings suggest that primary non-responders to anti-TNF treat - ment who exhibit moderate to severe inflam-mation might lack sufficient drug tissue levels to neutralize TNF production. A plausible explanation is that severe inflammation leads to increased faecal loss of anti-TNF agents, which was previously associ at ed with primary non-response in severe ulcerative colitis3. The advances in understanding pharmaco kin etics of biologic agents are crucial to optimize patient management. The reversed engineering process, the novel legal framework and the lack of clini - cal data in IBD initially led to considerable concern after the first infliximab biosimilar received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency in 2013 for all indications of the originator product. In the largest, prospective, nationwide observa - tional cohort 210 consecutive patients with IBD were treated with CT -P1 3, a biosimilar of infliximab4. Biosimilar infliximab was effective in inducing clinical response and remission at week 14 in both Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis. This effect was main-tained until week 30 and was associated with a substantial decrease in levels of inflamma - tory biomarkers, such as C -reactive protein level (21 mg/l and 32 mg/l a t baseline, which decreased to 11 mg/l a nd 7.5 mg/l a t week 14 in Crohn's disease ( P = 0.02) and ulcer - ative colitis (P = <0.001), respectively). Until week 30, adverse events occurred in 17% of patients. Infusion reactions occurred in 7% and infectious adverse events occurred in 6% of patients. Additionally, clinical remission rates were markedly higher in infliximab- naive patients than those with prior exposure to the originator compound. Accordingly, these patients exhibited substantially higher baseline anti-drug antibody positivity than infliximab-naive patients 4. Notably, a sub- stantial proportion of patients with infusion reactions had previously received the origina - tor infliximab. In line with this finding, Ben-Horin et al. 5 showed that anti bo dies against the originator drug Remicade (Janssen, USA) from treated patients with IBD recog - nized, crossreacted biosimilar Remsima (Celltrion, South Korea). This cross re activ - ity of Remicade anti-drug antibodies and Remsima suggested similar immuno do minant epitopes and immuno ge nic potentials of the biosimilar and o riginator molecules. NOR-SWITCH is a randomized, double- blind, parallel-group study that evalu at ed switching from the innovator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab compared with contin - ued treatment with the innovator compound6. Across all indications, 481 patients were included in the study. Disease worsening during the 52 -week study period occurred in 26.2% of those who remained on the origina - tor and in 29.6% of those who were switched to the biosimilar. This percentage difference fell within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin and disease worsening was compar - able among indications. On the basis of these results, the efficacy and safety of CT -P13 proved comparable to the originator com - pound as reported by earlier observational studies. In addition, efficacy was main - tained after switching from the or iginator to the biosimilar. Vedolizumab inhibits interaction between 47 integrin and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 to prevent the trans-migration of gut-homing T cells into the inflamed intestinal tissue. Phase III trials previously showed its efficacy in moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative coli - tis. Thus, vedolizumab was the first drug to receive regulatory approval representing a new, gut-selective mode of action in the IBD treatment armamentarium. Efficacy and safety of vedolizumab induction treatment was confirmed by Amiot et al. 7, who analy sed a real-life cohort of patients in a compassionate early access programme for those who failed TNF antagonists. 173 patients with Crohn's disease and 121 patients with ulcerative colitis received vedolizumab 300 mg in travenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8 weeks. At week 14, steroid-free clin ic al remission was achieved in 31% of patients with Crohn's disease and 36% of patients with ulcerative colitis, and clinical response was obtained in 51% and 50%, respectively. Adverse events occurred in 32% of patients, of with 5% discontinuing treatment. Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of IL -12 and IL -23. In a phase IIb study, intravenous ustekinumab showed notable benefit in terms of clinical response in moderate to severe Crohn's disease refractory to TNF antagonists and subcutaneous doses were effective during a 22-week maintenance period. In November 2016, Feagan et al.8 reported the results of the phase III trial, which consisted of two 8 -week induction studies and a maintenance trial for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. UNITI -1 included patients who had failed anti-TNF therapy and UNITI -2 recruited those who were refractory to con - ventional treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of ustekinu mab (130 mg o r 6 mg/kg) o r placebo. Already at week 6, intravenous ustekinumab induced markedly higher rate of clinical response than placebo in both induction studies (in UNITI -1 34.3%, 55.5%, and 28.7%, respectively, P <0.001).

The rate of adverse events was similar in the ustekinumab- tr eated and placebo- treated groups and was consistent with the cumulative data from its indica - tion for psoriasis. Additionally, Wils et al.9 reported on the efficacy of compassion at e use of subcutaneous ustekinumab in 122 con - secutive patients with Crohn's disease who had failed anti-TNF treatment. At 3 months, two-thirds of patients exhibited clinical bene - fit, with normalization of C -reactive protein levels occurring in 41% and endoscopic response obtained in 77% of patients. There has been a long-term need for drugs with new modes of action for the growing number of patients refractory to anti-TNF agents and major advances have been made to meet this need in 2016. Current treatments options for fistulizing Crohn's disease are limited by quality of evi-dence and long-term efficacy but results from Pan\u00e9s et al. 10 yielded a new treatment option for perianal Crohn's disease fistulas. In a phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel- group study, 212 patients with treatment refractory complex perianal fistulas were randomly assigned to receive intra le sional injection of allogeneic, expanded, adipose- derived stem cells (Cx601, 120 mi llion cells) or placebo. 50% of patients treated with Cx601 compared with 34% of the placebo group ( P = 0.024) achieved the combined primary end point of clinical closure of all fistulas and absence of abscess on MRI at week 24. Thus, adipose-derived stem cells could open up a new, local treatment option for refractory perianal fistulas. During 2016, the comfort with bio - similar use and acceptance of the concept of interchangeability undoubtedly increased. However, it is difficult to estimate the effect of multiple switches and long-term immuno - genicity when numerous biosimilars of an agent become available. The latest advances and ongoing drug development with new modes of action might bring a new era in the treatment of IBD. Moreover, new tools to predict response to a specific treatment could further aid the personalized use of biological therapies in IBD. Krisztina B. Gecse and P\u00e9ter L.

Globally, it is estim - ated that 1 in 1,000 women aged >40 years live with PBC and the risks of disease pro gr ession to cirrhosis and liver failure1. In 2016, our understanding of PBC patho ge nesis has been be further refined on the basis of ele - gant basic and clin ic al science, including the concept of high-risk and low-risk disease, particularly as recognized after evalu ati on of treatment response to the first-line agent ursodeoxycholic acid2. Increasingly, it is now recognized that a multistep model of PBC pathogenesis can be identified (FIG. 1)1. In this setting, therapies for those stratified at high-risk of disease progression despite ursodeoxy cholic acid use will be more or less effective, depending on when they are initiated and how they work 2.Animal models of PBC have always been a struggle, as attempting to recapitulate such a complex interaction of immunological injury and localized tissue response is challeng - ing.However, work from the Gershwin and Y oung groups in 2016 has made progress in develop ing a m ore meaningful disease model for study, and one that captures the gender distinction seen in PBC 3. This group studied mice character ize d by prolonged chronic expression of IFN. Interestingly, in this model, mice developed murine PBC character ized by female predominance, upregulation of total bile acids, spontaneous production of anti- mi tochondrial anti bo dies and portal duct inflammation. Overall, this work highlighted the importance of inter - feron signalling in initial PBC pathogenesis. Inflammatory responses mediated by type 1 T helper cells have been recognized as crit - ical for loss of immunological tolerance and PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS IN 2016 High-definition PBC: biology, models and therapeutic advances Gwilym J. Webb and Gideon M. Hirschfield In 2016, obeticholic acid became the first new licensed therapy for primary biliary cholangitis in >20 years. This therapeutic came at a time of improved disease understanding from biliary and immunological mechanistic insights. 40 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.this data parallels an understanding of PBC genetic risk that spans key imm une-regulatory pathways including IL -12 a nd JAK-STAT modifiable by oestrogen exposure. A dichotomous understanding of PBC has often been raised between the impor - tance of immunological injury alongside cellular response to biliary injury and cholestasis. With more sophisticated experi - mental approaches, it seems that this dis - tinction is beginning to blur and in a way that might indicate bet ter therapeutic approaches. Notably, it has become relevant that the Cl /HCO3- exchanger (AE2; glyco - calyx are important in maintaining a pro - tective biliary HCO3 'umbrella' . In 2016, Chang et al.5 explored this understanding, demonstrating in vitro that soluble adenylyl cyclase, a bicarbo na te sensor, regulates bile- salt- induced apoptosis in a manner depend - ent on intracellular Ca2+ stores, which are mediated by intrinsic apoptotic pathways. These findings suggest that downregulation of AE2 in PBC can sensitize cholangiocytes to by activ at ing soluble adenylyl cyclase. Intriguingly, related hydrophobic bile acids (glycocheno de oxycholic acid) suppress expression of AE2 in biliary epithelial cells by inducing reactive oxygen species and enhanc - ing biliary epithelial cell senescence, which induced bile duct inflammation. Reduced AE2 expression also upregulated the expression of CD40 and HLA -D R, as well as production of IL-6, IL -8 a nd CXCL10 from biliary epithelial cells in response to Toll-like receptor ligands (CXCL10 is secreted in response to IFN). This work equally highlights how changes to normal bili ary epithelial cell physiology are relevant, not only to a response to injury, but also to subsequent signalling pathways leading to chronic inflammatory responses. Thus, the senescence- as sociated secretory phenotype of biliary epithelial cells might be relevant in PBC and other cholestatic liver diseases, and changes in AE2 function could be a 'bridge' between the immune system and cholestasis. Additionally, that IL -17-p ositive T cells are detected in portal infiltrates close to inflamed bile ducts expressing the CCR6 ligand is already Cytokine-treated human cholangiocytes secrete CCL20 and induce CCR6 -dependent migration of type 17 T helper cells, suggesting that local cholangio-cyte chemokine secretion then localises these pathogenic and damaging cells to bile ducts 7. Intriguingly, CCL20 is a recognized genetic risk locus for PBC development and could be a meaningful added target for intervention 4.Further advances in understanding the careful orchestration of liver injury have come from better appreciation of the gut- liver axis, with focus towards the fa rnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth fa ctor (FGF)-19 signalling pathway. FXR is a central transcriptional sensor of bile acid metabolism and one key target gene in the gut is FGF19 , which encodes an enterokine released into portal blood following bile acid binding to FXR. Augmentation of this pathway presents opportunities for thera - peutic benefit, with the goal of directing enhanced anti- inf lammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-cholestatic inhibiting CYP7A1, the 8. An FGF19 vari an t (M70) has been developed as a potential new therapeutic for cholestatic liver diseases, which constitutively inhibits synthesis and hepatic accumulation of bile acids, without Figure 1 | Converging themes in the pathophysiology and treatment of PBC. Obeticholic acid (OCA) downregulates bile acid (BA) production and limits further damage to small bile ducts through inhibited expression of the bile acid synthesis enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP27A1, and through synthesis of FGF19 (REF. 10) (1). Mice with targeted disruption of MDR2 have unchaperoned bile acids, which are more reactive and cause progressive damage to biliary epithelial cells (BEC) and liver fibrosis; FGF19 and M70 act to reduce bile acid synthesis and fibrogenesis 9 (2). Bile acids downregulate AE2 expression through the formation of reactive oxygen species, with multiple downstream effects including increased expression of the effector cytokines IL-6 and IL -8, and the leukocyte chemo CXCL106 (3). Via inhibition of AE2 activity intracellular accumulation of HCO3-, bile acids promote BEC apoptosis stimuli5 (4). Dysregulated of IFN in the features of PBC, resulting in T -cell infiltration of periductular areas, the production of anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) in conjunction with B cells and the upregulation of bile acid production (5).

These effects seemed contingent inhibition of CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 , genes encod - ing key enzymes in the classic and alternate bile acid synthesis pathways. This approach is now under go ing clinical trials spanning cholestatic liver diseases and NAFLD. Finally, convincing data have emerged over the past 5 years supporting clinical effi- cacy for a semisynthetic FXR agonist, obeti - cholic acid, such that 2016 culminated in a new internationally approved therapy for patients with PBC. In particular, data pub-lished in 2016 from a large clinical trial with obeticholic acid 10 added to previous studies showing that FXR agonism has clear, durable effects on relevant markers of active choles - tatic liver injury. Obeticholic acid reduces exposure to toxic hydrophobic bile acids by predicted and demonstrated falls in bile acid synthesis through direct and indirect (FGF19) actions on CYP7A1-mediated bile acid synthesis, as well as bile acid excretion by hepatocytes. In conjunction with consider - able work on surrogate markers of PBC dis - ease course and outcome, the data from the obeticholic acid tr ials proved sufficient for product authorisation. Patients with PBC now have access to the first of, hopefully, many new generation treatments for their disease, which have arisen from collective ongoing efforts to finally understand PBC in high-definition.Key advances Overexpression of the IFN pathway in mice led to an animal model of autoimmune cholangitis that recapitulates the female preponderance of by activating soluble adenylyl cyclase 5 Glycochenodeoxycholic acid reduces expression of anion exchanger 2 in biliaryepithelial cells, inducing reactive oxygen species and enhancing epithelial cell senescence 6 A clinical trial supports the efficacy of obeticholic acid in the treatment of patientsfailing current care 10, leading to a licensed therapeutic that is predicted to change the clinical course of PBCGwilym J.

Garrett Fascination about the gut microbiota shows no signs of slowing down. The launch of the US National Microbiome Initiative in 2016, and similar efforts across the globe, underscore the continued enthusiasm for microbiome studies in the USA and beyond. Indeed, 2016 has been yet another notable year for gut microbiota research. Central challenges facing microbiome science are the scale of studies and technological plat - form development. More specifically, in how large a population can we effectively and effi - ciently study microbiomes, and how do we develop studies to include the microbiomes of thousands or even millions of individ ua ls that include best technological practices, data reproducibility and open access? Some of these challenges are not intrinsic to micro - biome science and are broadly applicable to our culture's increasing thirst and appreci - ation for big data science. The efforts of the Human Microbiome Project , the MicroBiome Quality Control project , the 'crowd-sourced' American Gut project , the European Union's MyNewGut project and the US National Microbiome Initiative merit praise in their efforts to address these challenges. Herein, key 2016 gut microbiota discoveries are summar ized. As is often the case, space con - straints and intellectual preferences have both limited and shaped this list of notable papers that aim to fulfil the promise of microbiome science for humankind. Several independent laboratories and working groups have aimed to define the gut microbiota membership and function of healthy populations. In 2016, one note - worthy paper focused on variation of the faecal microbiome in healthy European popu - lations with extensive metadata. Using the Belgian Flemish Gut Flora Project, the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP study, along with other global data sets, helped identify factors that shape variation in the faecal microbiome and challenged previous assumptions about what factors affect the gut microbiota of adults 1. A cluster of papers under the aegis of the Human Functional Genomics Group (HFGG) 42 | JANUARY environ me ntal effectors and the microbiota in shaping the human immune response. In Schirmer et al.2, which focused on the gut microbiota and cytokine response, blood and stool samples were collected from 500 individuals of the HFGG cohort (healthy individuals from the Netherlands with exten - sive metadata). Serum cyto kin e profiles were generated from both whole blood and partici - pants' peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and stool samples were sequenced for taxonomic and inferred functional profiling. The goal of the study was to link gut microbiome features to inter individual variation in the immune response. The 2016 HFGG studies revealed interesting effects: gender, season ali ty and age on monocytic-type cytokine response; specific host genetic loci as key influencing on both monocytic- typ e and T-helper-cell-type cytokine responses; and microbiome inferred functional effects (as opposed to taxonomic effects) on IFN and TNF production. The approach and data reported in Schirmer et al. 2 serve as an important resource and foundation for future studies on the effect of the microbiome in shaping the human immune response. Two studies in 2016 from Jeffrey Gordon's laboratory offer hope and true promise for cracking the Gordian Knot of global under nutrition \u2014 a problem for which a ready -to-use therapeutic food might not be a sufficiently durable solution. Prior studies of a cohort of Malawian children implicated the microbiome as a principal actor in mal - nutrition and stunting, and a follow -up study has now identified an association between low levels of human milk oligosaccharide sialy l ation and severe stunting in Malawian infants3. Human milk is not only critical fuel for developing babies but also supports the develop ment of the infant gut micro bi ota. Using gnotobiotic mice and pigs that con - sumed a Malawian diet and ha rboured a group of gut microorganisms isolated from Malawian infants, the group tested the effects of milk oligosaccharide sialylation. In a microbiota- dependent manner, purified sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMO) in contrast with non-sialylated BMOs, promoted lean body mass gain and altered bone morph o- logy and distinct metabolic patterns in the brain, muscle and liver3. In Blanton et al.4, the Gordon group inoculated gnotobiotic mice fed a Malawian diet with gut microbiota from either 6-month-old or 18-month-old healthy and undernourished children. Mice receiv - ing the 'undernourished' microbiota showed impaired growth, and meta -omic profiling identified taxa that correlated with growth and 4. Two identified species, Ruminococcus gnavus and Clostridium symbiosum, were sufficient to improve growth and metabolic defects in gnotobiotic mice harbouring the microbiota of donors with mal nutrition. These two papers are notable not only for their exemplary approaches to causality testing in microbiome science, but also for their clear translational potential. The gut-brain axis describes the signal - ling between the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system. Although this concept orig-inally linked the enteric nervous system with the central nervous system; for many, the term now includes consideration of gut microbial metabolites affecting emotional, cognitive and other neurological functions. Two 2016 studies rooted in gnotobiotic mouse models provide exciting and compelling mechanistic data regarding the role of the microbiota in neurodevelopment and Parkinson disease. The role of maternal diet and the out - comes of offspring is a longstanding area of interest. In Buffington et al. 5, studies of a maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) in con - ventional and gnotobiotic mice revealed an intriguing role for diet and gut microbiota in mouse neurodevelopment 5. The investigators not only observed that MHFD altered the gut microbiota, social behaviour, oxytocin levels and synaptic potentiation in the ven - tral tegmental area, but they also determined that Lactobacillus reuteri was sufficient to correct these MHFD-induced changes and Mice that overexpress -sy nuclein recapi - tulate several features of human Parkinson dis - ease and generation of gnotobiotic -syn uclein mice enables interrogation of the role of the gut microbiota and their metabolites in motor dysfunction 6. Interestingly, the mere presence of the gut microbiota enhances the motor defi - cits in these mice and short-chain fatty acids, via their effects on microglial cells, promoted -synuclein-mediated neuro inf lammation and ensuing motor dysfunction. Collectively, these papers identify key mechanistic roles for select- ing micro organisms and microbial metabolites in mice for the study of neurodevelopment processes and neurodegenerative disorders. Bacterial members of the gut micro bio ta have garnered enormous attention, but in 2016, studies revealed a role for para si tes as me mbers or modifiers of the gut micro bi ota with poten - tial implications for mucosal immuno lo gy and human health. In Howitt et al.7, tuft cells \u2014 rare gut chemo se nsory cells \u2014 emerged as key sensors of the mouse sym bi otic proto - zoan Tritrichomonas muris . Tuft cells seem to orchestrate the immune response to a variety of pathogenic helminths and employ bona fide taste chemo sen sory pathways to initiate anti-parasite immunity, revealing under-appreciated signalling pathways used to sense gut parasites 7,8. In Chudnovskiy et al.9, another symbiotic trichomonad was identified, pro - tection from mucosal bac te rial infections via 2016 Key advances Big data microbiome science is challenging assumptions on what drives human microbiome variation and revealing how the microbiota shape the human immune response 1,2 Sialylated milk oligosaccharides promoterestoration of a healthy gut microbiota in preclinical undernutrition models 3 Select gut microbiota species might be useful partners in restoring growth andmetabolic defects in undernutrition 4 Gut microbiota and their metabolites promote Parkinson-disease-like deficitsin mice 6 Symbiotic protozoa and pathogenic helminths shape mucosal immune responses via canonical and noncanonicalmicrobial sensing pathways and affect the gut microbiota 7-10 Laura Marshall/Macmillan Publishers Ltd KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 43 GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved. \u00a92017MacmillanPublishersLimited,partofSpringerNature.Allrightsreserved.host epithelial IL-18, b ut exacerbated suscepti bi lity to colitis and mouse colorectal tumours. As the rates of chronic protozoan colonization and helminth infections have decreased in industrial nations, the rates of inflammatory and allergic diseases have skyrocketed. This observation inspired Ramanan et al. 10 to examine helminth infection in mice deficient in the Crohn's disease sus - ceptibility gene Nod2 . Helminth infection pro - tected these mice from intestinal inflam ma tion and altered the gut microbiota; coloniza - tion with inflammatory Bacteroides spp. was reduced and a microbiota enriched in Clostridiales spp. emerged 10. The micro biota of individ uals from helminth-endemic regions showed simi la r patterns, which were reversed with anti- helminth therapy. These three studies shed light on different facets of host immune- protozoa-microbiota interactions and support the need for further inv estigation into their translational applications.Overall, 2016 was a banner year for gut microbiota science in terms of new functional insights gained from larger cohort studies, novel preclinical models fulfilling the prom - ise of translation of microbiome science, and insights around the biology of parasites, the microbiota and host immunity.

The discovery of disease-causing anti - bodies in membranous nephropathy (MN) and mutations in podocyte genes in focal seg-mental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), together with the availability of modern immunosup - pressive drugs has provided new avenues for individualized therapy, and several important studies were published in 2016. For patients with diabetic nephropathy, the publication of promising renal outcome data with novel glucose-lowering agents might be the beginning of a success story. The first RCT of rituximab in primary MN \u2014 the GEMRITUX study \u2014 was published in 2016 (REF. 1). In this open-label trial, patients received maximal conservative therapy with (n = 37) o r without ( n = 38) rituximab (375 mg/ m2 on days 1 and 8). The study failed to show a significant difference in the primary end point of complete or partial remission of proteinu - ria at 6 months (35.1% in the rituximab group versus 21.1% in the control group). Rituximab treatment did, however, significantly increase the rate of decline in anti -PLA2R antibody levels; 50% of anti -PLA2R - positive patients in the rituximab group and 12% of those in the control group showed antibody depletion at 6 months. Most importantly, after 17 months of follow -up, the rate of remission was signif - icantly higher in the rituximab group (64.9%) than in the control group (34.2%). Although these data provide evidence that rituximab can induce proteinuria remission in MN, the fairly high proportion of non-responders in this and Immunosuppressive therapy resulted in higher rates of complete remission of proteinuria (17% versus 5%) and disappearance of hae - maturia (42% versus 16%), but had no effect on the eGFR end point of a decrease >15 m l/ min/1.73 m2 from baseline at 36 months (22% versus 24%). The findings demonstrate the value of maximal conservative therapy in IgAN. During the run -in phase proteinuria was reduced to <0.75 g p er day in about one- third of patients, and during the randomized phase mean blood pressures were consistently <130/80 mmHg and proteinuria was <1 g per day in about three-quarters of patients. The beneficial effects of immunosuppression on proteinuria and haematuria suggest that this therapy reduced glomerular inflammation. Why did this not translate into a beneficial effect on the renal outcome? Clearly, the dis - ease course was very mild in the control group (change in eGFR of 1.6 m l/min/1.73 m2 per year), thus limiting the power of the study. The data should not, therefore, be used as evidence to withhold immunosuppression in patients with severe IgAN. Although an analysis of the V ALIGA study data suggested that corti - costeroids are effective in patients with eGFR <50 ml/min/1.73 m2 (REF. 4), some patients likely require more aggressive therapy. Steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) with histologic findings of FSGS poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Many patients respond to ciclosporin and experi - mental studies suggest that in addition to its other rituximab studies (35-54%) is a cause for concern. Studies with hard renal end points are, therefore, required to evaluate if rituximab reduces progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, the finding of sponta - neous remission in 34.2% of patients in the control group underlines the need for better predictors of progressive kidney failure in pri - mary MN to enable avoidance of unnecessary immunosuppressive therapy. A multivariable analysis showed that a high PLA2R antibody titer (>275 U/ml) was associated with a lower likelihood of remission. Moreover, a previous study reported limited efficacy of rituximab among patients in the highest tertile of PLA2R antibody levels 2. These findings suggest that non-response to rituximab might be the conse - quence of an inadequately low dose and meas - urement of anti -PLA2R antibody titres might enable selection of patients who need higher doses to obtain maximal efficacy. The results of the STOP-IgAN trial question the benefit of immunosuppressive therapy in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) 3. This open-label RCT included patients with IgAN, relatively stable renal function and persistent proteinu - ria (>0.75-3.5 g p er day) despite 6 months of maximal conservative therapy. 80 patients were randomly assigned to receive supportive care alone (blood pressure target <125/75 mmHg, cholesterol-lowering therapy and lifestyle advice) and 82 patients were assigned to sup - portive care plus immunosuppression (pred - nisone in those with estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) >60 m l/min/1.73 m2 or prednisone prine in those with eGFR <60 m l/min/1.73 m2).

Children with SRNS have a high frequency of mutations in podocyte genes 6, and a 2016 study reported that treatment response to ciclosporin was dismal in these patients 7. Among 169 children with SRNS, single-gene causes were detected in 71 (42%) patients. Overall, 79% of mutations were detected in one of three genes: NPHS1 , NPHS2 and WT1 . Only one of 32 patients with a genetic cause of SRNS who received ciclosporin achieved complete remission of proteinuria; five patients experienced partial remission. ESRD developed in 66% of patients with genetic SRNS and was not affected by ciclosporin therapy; patients with partial remis - sion also showed disease progression. By con - trast, 79% of patients with non-genetic causes of SRNS responded to ciclosporin, with 60% achieving complete remission. Progression to ESRD was observed in 27% of these patients and was strongly associated with failure to induce remission. This study confirms that SRNS is not a single entity, and that improved diagnostic characterization might assist treat - ment decisions. The results support routine use of genetic testing in paediatric SRNS, and withholding ciclosporin in those of ciclosporin in patients with FSGS owing to other mutations cannot be ruled out and efforts should be made to record treatment outcomes in rare disease registries. How findings in children might translate to adults with SRNS and/or FSGS is unclear. Diabetic nephropathy is the most com - mon glomerular disease and a leading cause of ESRD. Current treatment for diabetes mellitus is insufficient in preventing diabetic nephro - pathy and renal outcome trials with agents such as thiazolidinediones, DPP - 4 inhibitors, bardoxolone and sulodexide have been unsuc - cessful. In 2016, renal outcome data with two new classes of glucose-lowering agents were published. The EMPA-REG study showed that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin signif - icantly attenuated worsening of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 8. Similarly, the LEADER9 and SUSTAIN10 trials of GLP - 1 agonists (liraglutide and semaglu - tide, respectively) provided evidence that these agents improve renal outcomes (TABLE 1) . None of these studies showed a benefit of the inter - vention with respect to retinopathy or incident microalbuminuria, but improvements were seen in glycaemic control, body weight and systolic blood pressures. A reduction in glomerular hyperfiltration is likely responsible for the reduced incidence of new-onset macroalbuminuria with the new agents. SGTL2 inhibitors and GLP - 1 agonists might affect glomerular pressure by influenc - ing tubuloglomerular feedback as a conse - quence of decreased proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP - 1 agonists have now been approved for the treatment of T2DM. Their beneficial effects on renal outcome should stimulate their use in patients with class 1-3 chronic kidney dis - ease (they have not been approved for patients with eGFR <30 m l/min/1.73 m2). Given their different modes of action, future trials should evaluate a combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP - 1 agonists. Data from 2016 has thus raised new hope and optimism for patients with diabetic nephropathy. Overall, 2016 saw important progress in the treatment of glomerular diseases. In the future, measurement of PLA2R antibodies and the development of epitope-specific assays will enable individualized treatment of MN. Children with SRNS and associated FSGS will benefit from rapid genetic testing to inform treatment decisions. Cautious use of immunosuppressive treatment is still war - ranted in patients with IgAN and the develop - ment of predictors of progressive disease will be of major importance. Finally, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP - 1 agonists will likely improve outcomes in patients with T2DM and combined therapies should be investigated.

GENETICS OF KIDNEY DISEASE IN 2016 Ingenious tactics to unravel complex kidney disease genetics Kirsten Y . Renkema and Nine V .A.M. Knoers The genetic background of many kidney diseases is complex and involves multiple genes, genetic variants and molecular pathways. Here, we look at how researchers tackled this challenging topic in 2016, focusing on studies that used ingenious data-integration tactics, which led to new insights into kidney disease aetiology and renal disease progression. Complex or multifactorial diseases are defined as conditions caused by a combi - nation of genetic and environmental risk factors. To define the contribution of risk factors to the aetiology of a specific trait, it is necessary to investigate well-defined patient cohorts and perform large-scale statistical data analyses. As the genetic background of renal disease and renal disease progres - sion is often complex, the kidney research field appreciates the challenges of defining genetic risk factors. Here, we describe four studies that used ingenious strategies of data integration to identify key genetic deter - minants of chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney-disease progression, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Pattaro et aimed to associate with estimated glomerular filtra - tion rate (eGFR), a measure of the renal filtration ability used to diagnose and stage CKD 1. In total, 53 genetic loci were identi - fied as being associated with eGFR, of which 29 loci had already been identified in pre - vious studies. 19 of the 53 loci associated with eGFR among individuals with diabetes specifically. The researchers then combined genome-wide association study (GW AS) meta-analyses, which included data from 133,413 individuals and a replication cohort of 42,166 individuals, with publicly availa - ble expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and epigenetic data. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to prioritize genes at the associated eGFR loci 2. The analyses showed that the genes associated with eGFR are mainly expressed in the kidney and the urinary tract and that they function in path - ways important for kidney development, renal transmembrane transporter activity, kidney structure and regulation of glucose metabolism. Integration with epigenetic data demonstrated that the associated var - iants specifically map to regulatory regions in the kidney. On the basis of these findings, the researchers propose that genetic factors that determine eGFR are largely mediated by direct effects within the kidney, with a possible role for developmental processes in CKD aetiology. The latter finding is consist - ent with the Barker hypothesis, which states that adult disease can have fetal origins 3. The strength of this study lies within the combination of three factors. First, meta-analyses on very large amounts of data facilitated the identification of newly associated loci for a complex trait with genome-wide significance. Second, the integration of GW AS data with eQTL and epigenetic data led to further prioritization of the associated loci. Third, by applying molecular pathway analyses, the researchers looked further than the associations identi - fied by GW AS analysis alone and were able to translate their findings into pathways with biological relevance. Another study looked beyond genetic associations by performing molecular path- way enrichment analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CKD progression as identified by GW AS in 1,331 African Americans and 1,476 European Americans from the prospective, observa - tional Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study 4. The rate of renal function decline varies substantially among individ - uals with CKD and approaches to identify individuals who are at risk of CKD progres- sion are needed. To better understand the contribution of genetics to CKD progression, a GW AS was performed, separately among African Americans and European Americans and stratified by diabetes status. The researchers identified 12 S NPs associated with eGFR decline in African Americans and six SNPs associated with eGFR decline in European Americans. Four SNPs showed genome-wide significance ( P 5 \u00d7 1 08) in African Americans. Molecular pathway analyses revealed an over-representation of molecules with renal and urological func - tions in close proximity to the associated loci. Interestingly, SNPs in a long noncoding RNA (LINC00923 ) associated significantly with non-diabetic CKD in both African Americans and European Americans. Among African Americans, the association of rs653747 in LINC00923 with CKD pro- gression reached genome-wide significance and could be replicated in a population and phenotype-related cohort. Further investiga - tions should be performed to determine the contribution of LINC00923 variants to CKD progression. Long noncoding RNAs increas - form the target of investigation in aeti - ological studies because they have emerged as an important class of gene-expression reg - ulators 5. A limitation of this study was that validation of discovery loci was hampered owing to the lack of equivalent cohorts with Approaches to identify individuals who are at risk of CKD progression are neededKey advances Genetic variants associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) affect molecular pathways relevant for kidney function and kidney development 1. Smart data integration methods prioritized molecular key players and pathways involved in kidney disease pathogenesis and CKD progression 1,4,6. Genetic variation contributes to the individual differences in CKD progression 4. An association was found between a long noncoding RNA (LINC00923) and nondiabetic CKD, showing the relevance of noncoding, regulatory regions of the DNA in kidney disease progression 4. WNK1, KANK1, and ARHGEF17 were identified and validated in vivo as susceptibility genes for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis8. 47 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews NEPHROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Another key study from 2016 pinpointed genes associated with CKD by combining mouse phenotype information with human GW AS data 6. The investigators used mouse phenotype data available online from the Mouse Genome Informatics database to pri - oritize loci associated with CKD. Genes that were prioritized using this approach involved those that, when mutated in mice, resulted in abnormal renal physiology, renal morphol - ogy, GFR, or urine protein level. Subsequently, the matching human gene orthologues were checked for eGFR-associated SNPs as iden - tified by GW AS analysis of individuals in the CKDGen consortium 1. Significant asso - ciations with eGFR in humans were iden - tified for SNPs in two, seven, and 17 genes that caused abnormal GFR, abnormal renal physiology, and abnormal renal morphology in mice, respectively. Furthermore, genes associated with abnormal kidney morphol - ogy showed significant enrichment for eGFR- associated SNPs. The integrative approach used by the researchers led to the identifi - cation of CYP26A1 , BMP4, and CYP24A1 as candidate genes for kidney disease patho - genesis, exemplifying how a smart analy-sis strategy linking GW AS data to biology can be used to investigate the genetics of complex disease 7.A fourth study explored the genetic back - ground of FSGS8 \u2014 a complex disease in which gene variants can either be sufficient to cause disease or can increase susceptibil - ity to FSGS in combination with environ - mental factors. Furthermore, FSGS is a rare disease, which precludes the recruitment of large patient cohorts. Instead of using a genome-wide approach, Yu and co -workers applied gene-panel sequencing to search for FSGS-related genes. A selection of 2,500 genes, known to be expressed in podo - cytes, was sequenced from 214 European American patients. FSGS was confirmed by biopsy in all patients, ensuring a pheno - typically homogeneous cohort. Due to the use of a gene panel, fewer statistical tests and comparisons were needed, decreas-ing the extent of correction for multiple testing. Thus, a focused approach to gene identification, involving a selected region of DNA, has statistical advantages in diseases of limited sample size. Next, potential sus-ceptibility genes were further examined in an in vivo high-throughput screening sys - tem. The researchers developed a method based on an FSGS mouse model in which genes of interest can be silenced in podo - cytes specifically. Wnk4 - bility genes, as their silencing aggravated proteinuria in the FSGS mouse model. Complex disease studies that involve the digestion of large '-omics' datasets require ingenious study designs. The four studies on genetic risk factors for complex kidney disease and kidney disease progression discussed here show that the strength of data integration methodologies lies mainly within a combination of using appropriate patient cohorts, informational datasets, functional data, and computational analysis Nature Reviews | NephrologyPatients Case recruitment Sample collection Patient matching based on gene and/or trait Experimental proof Disease modelling Functional gene or variant characterizationData generation Phenotype '-omics' EnvironmentData analysis Bioinformatics BiostatisticsIntegrationGenetic causes of kidney diseases Figure 1 | Components that are essential for aetiological research strategies for the identification of contributors to complex kidney diseases. Such studies require consideration of appropriate patient cohorts, approaches to data generation and analysis, and supporting functional experimental data.tools9. Studies that focus on elucidating the genetic causes of complex diseases require consideration of integrative research strate - gies (FIG. 1) . Of interest, increasing attention is turning to the assessment of variation in the gene regulatory components, such as long noncoding RNAs, to understand the genetic basis of complex kidney diseases. Future large-scale whole genome sequenc - ing and characterization studies will further clarify the effect of noncoding variants on kidney disease aetiology and pathogen - esis. The contribution of environmental factors to the aetiology of kidney disease seems underexposed in the field, with the exception of research on the effects of dia - betes mellitus. With the current progress in technique developments and bioinfor - matics opportunities, together with the available collaborative biobank initiatives, the field of complex genetics can and will reveal many more clues on disease aetiology in the near future.

KIDNEY CANCER IN 2016 The evolution of anti- angiogenic therapy for kidney cancer Chung-Han Lee and Robert J. Motzer Tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target pro-angiogenic pathways improve progression-free and overall survival in patients with metastatic kidney cancer and were thus tested in the adjuvant setting in studies published this past year. 2016 also saw the emergence of new inhibitors of pro-angiogenic pathways that might represent the next step in kidney cancer therapy. Kidney cancer has long been understood to be a disease of altered hypoxia signalling. Indeed, loss of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) \u2014the most common genetic alteration in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) \u2014 leads to the accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcription fac - tors 1, which activate crucial genes involved in the hypoxic response including those encoding pro-angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth fac - tor (VEGF). Targeting the VEGF pathway has therefore been the molecular rationale for the development of multiple agents to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC), including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, and bevacizumab. In addition, regulatory approval was obtained in 2016 for lenvati - nib 2 and cabozantinib3, which target the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and putative pro- angiogenic resistance mechanisms mediated by growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (cMET) (FIG. 1 ). In the metastatic setting, these drugs have demon - strated clear clinical benefits including improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival; however, their efficacy in earlier stages of disease remains unclear and they are therefore being tested as adju - vant therapies after surgery in patients who are at high risk of disease recurrence. In 2016, two clinical trials \u2014 ASSURE 4 and S-TRAC5 \u2014 tested the efficacy of VEGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as an adjuvant treatment for RCC. The ASSURE phase III trial 4 randomly assigned 1,943 patients with completely resected high-grade RCC (defined as Fuhrman grade 3 or grade 4 and at least stage pT1b according to the TMN classification system), to receive placebo, sunitinib (50 m g daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off), or sorafenib (400 m g twice daily). In the orig - inal trial design, patients were administered the typical starting dose for metastatic disease; however, the rates of drug discontinuation were high due to toxicity (44% with sunitinib and 45% with sorafenib). After 1,323 patients were enrolled, the clinical trial was amended and starting doses were reduced to 37.5 m g of sunitinib daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, or 400 m g of sorafenib daily. With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, the primary end point of median disease-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (79.6 months with placebo, 73.4 months with sorafenib and 70 months with sunitinib; HR 0.97 for sorafenib versus placebo (97.5% CI 0.80-1.17, P = 0.7184) and HR 1.02 for sunitinib versus placebo (97.5% CI 0.85-1.23, P = 0.8038)). Overall survival at 5 years was also not different between the three groups (80.3% with placebo, 97.5% CI CI 74.1-81.9%). This study suggested that in the adjuvant setting, sunitinib and sorafenib were diffi - cult to tolerate and that the use of sunitinib or sorafenib based on an intention-to-treat analysis was not beneficial. The phase III S -TRAC trial5 randomly assigned 615 patients with completely resected ccRCC, who originally presented with local invasion (tumour stage 3 or greater) or regional lymph node metasta - sis, to placebo or sunitinib (50 m g daily for 4 weeks on followed by 2 weeks off). Dose reductions and treatment discontinuations in the sunitinib group were 34.3% and 28.1%, respectively, compared to 2% and 5.6% in the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the primary end point of median disease-free survival on sunitinib was 6.8 years (95% CI 5.8-not reached) compared to 5.6 years (95% CI 3.8-6.6 years) in the placebo group (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98, P = 0 .03). At the time of data analysis, overall survival was not significantly different between sunitinib (79.1%) and placebo (79.3%; HR 1.01 95% CI 0.72-1.44, P = 0.94). T hese findings suggest an improvement in disease-free survival with the use of sunitinib in the adjuvant setting. On the basis of these conflicting find - ings regarding disease-free survival out - comes with sunitinib, the role of TKIs as an adjuvant therapy remains controversial. Whether the discordant outcomes are due to different trial populations or to differences in drug discontinuation rates and dosing, remains speculative. In both trials, median overall survival has not yet been reached, and additional follow -up will be helpful to see if TKIs have an effect on overall survival in the S -TRAC trial. The results of other adjuvant trials with axitinib and pazopanib Key advances The ASSURE trial showed no significant differences in disease free survival for adjuvant sorafenib or sunitinib treatments4 The STRAC trial showed improved disease free survival with adjuvant sunitinib5 Overall survival data for adjuvant clinical trials remains pending4,5 Novel HIF directed treatments (PT2399 and PT2385) decreased tumour volume in mouse models8,9 and stabilized kidney cancer in one patient10, and are worthy of further investigationthe role of TKIs as an adjuvant therapy remains controversial 49 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews NEPHROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Although strategies that inhibit recep - tor tyrosine kinases have made substan - tial advances, direct targeting of HIF has been a long-standing challenge owing to the absence of a known catalytic domain. Loss of VHL can lead to the accumula - tion of HIF - 2, which dimerizes with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transloca - tor (ARNT, also known as HIF - 1) and the dimerized complex binds to DNA to induce transcription of HIF -2 target genes. PT2399 is a small molecule that directly binds to HIF - 2 and prevents it from dimerizing with ARNT and activat - ing its transcriptional targets8 (FIG. 1 ). Use of PT2399 led to reduction in -specific cyclin -D1 by CCND1 ), and glucose transporter pro - tein type 1 (GLUT - 1) in HIF - 2 - dependent RCC cell lines8. PT2399 also inhibited colony formation in soft agar, a measure of carcinogenic potential, and decreased the volume of tumours induced by ortho - topically implanted RCC cell lines 8. The decreased colony formation and tumour shrinkage seen in response to PT2399 corre - lated with baseline levels of HIF - 2 protein, which suggests that a subset of tumours that depend on HIF2 -associated transcription might be particularly sensitive to PT2399. The efficacy of PT2399 was compared to that of sunitinib in 22 patient-derived xenografts9. This model system recapitu - lates clinical responses to TKIs such that decreased tumour growth in mice often correlates with tumour shrinkage or disease stabilization in patients. PT2399 decreased tumour growth in xenografts by 60% on average compared to 40% with sunitinib (P <0.0001). A lmost half of the xenografts (10 of 22) were sensitive to PT2399 (>80% reduction in tumour volume compared to vehicle control), and these included sar - comatoid and rhabdoid histologic vari - ants and tumours resistant to sunitinib. HIF- 2 - dependent transcripts were down - regulated in sensitive xenografts, whereas they were unaffected in resistant xeno - grafts (<40% reduction in tumour volume), despite dissociation of the HIF - 2-ARNT complex. Similar to findings in cell lines, the levels of HIF - 2 correlated with the response to PT2399. Resistance to PT2399 was acquired with prolonged exposure to the agent, owing to mutations in either Figure 1 | Current and future anti \u00adangiogenic therapies. Loss of VHL is a common genetic feature in clear cell renal cell carcinoma that leads to the accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF -2, and expression of growth factor (VEGF), G1/S -specific cyclin -D1 and targeting pathways at the tumour-endothelium interface. New agents including lenvatinib also target other tyrosine kinases hepatocyte factor receptor (c -MET), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)) thought to be critical for resistance to VEGF- directed therapy. A novel class of agents that inhibit HIF -2-dependent transcription (PT2399 and PT2385) has been developed. These molecules target more directly key pathways in kidney tumorigenesis, downstream A patient from whom a PT2399-sensitive xenograft was generated was enrolled on a phase I trial10 to assess the efficacy of PT2385, a close analogue of PT2399. This patient had metastatic ccRCC and was heavily pretreated with high doses of IL -2, bevacizumab, sorafenib, everoli - mus, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib. After 11 months of treatment, he remains on treatment and his disease is stable. 2016 was a year of rapid scientific advancement and improved understand - ing of the applications of anti-angiogenic therapies. With data from the adjuvant tri- als, we have begun to explore of the role of systemic TKI treatment for the management of micro m etastatic RCC and we await the results of ongoing and future trials to pro - vide further clarity on the efficacy of TKIs as adjuvant treatment. We might also see the development of a novel class of agents that can target the known genetic defects in RCC more specifically than can current treatments. Further studies will be necessary to determine the efficacy and toxicity profile of these agents. Robert J.

Mehta Approaches to effectively prevent and manage organ dysfunction in critically ill patients remain elusive. Key studies in 2016 highlighted the challenges in finding effective treatments for renal failure in sepsis and assessed the optimal timing of renal replacement therapy initiation in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. Management of organ dysfunction in criti - cally ill patients is an area of controversy and active research. The publication of revised definitions for sepsis1 refocused attention on early interventions with appropriate fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors, vasodilators and inotropes to maintain tissue perfusion. Three multicentre trials published in 2016 evaluated approaches to achieve haemodynamic balance without unwanted effects on other organs, including the kidney. In the V ANISH trial 2, 421 patients with sepsis requiring vasopressors after fluid resuscita- tion were randomly assigned in a 2 \u00d7 2 f acto- rial design to one of four treatment groups: patients received infusions of either vasopressin or noradrenaline within 6 h o f vasopres - sor requirement to maintain a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65-75 m mHg; once maximal infusion rates were reached hydrocortisone or placebo were added to the regimen. Patients who were still hypoten - sive after addition of steroids or placebo also received other open-label catecholamines. The primary outcome of kidney failure-free days did not differ between the treatment groups, nor was any difference found in the secondary outcomes of mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, or seri - ous adverse events. Vasopressin administra - tion was associated with higher urine outputs and a reduced requirement for renal replace - ment therapy (RRT) than was noradrenaline; however, the need for RRT was left to the discretion of the clinician. Major acute kid - ney injury (AKI) events occurred in >57% of patients, sustained renal failure at day 28 was seen in >45% of patients, and RRT was initiated in 24% of patients overall. The Leopards trial 3 tested the efficacy of levosimendan, a calcium-sensitizing inotrope with vasodilating properties, on organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis. Patients who had received fluid resuscita - tion and vaso p ressors for 4 h t o achieve a target MAP of 65-70 m mHg were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infu - sion of levosimendan or placebo for 24 h in addition to standard care. Additional inotropes such as dobutamine were added at the physician's discretion to maintain tar - get MAP . No difference in organ failure was observed between the levo s imendan and the placebo groups. Secondary outcomes of mortality at 28 days, length of ICU and hospital stay, the proportion of patients with a major acute kidney event over a 28 -day period (defined as death, initiation of RRT, or sustained renal failure), and the dura - tion of RRT, were not different between the two groups either, although patients in the levo s imendan group had lower MAPs, required higher doses of noradrenaline and were less likely than patients in the pla - cebo group to be weaned off mechanical ventilation. These two trials are complemented by the HYPRESS 4 trial in which 380 patients with sepsis and evidence of organ dysfunction for a duration of <48 h and on vasopressors for 4 h were randomly assigned to receive an intrave - nous bolus of hydrocortisone followed by con - tinuous infusion of hydrocortisone or placebo for 11 days. No difference was observed in the primary outcome of the occurrence of septic shock within 14 days. Mortality at 28 days was relatively low at 8.5% and RRT was required in 12% of patients overall; however, there was no difference between the two groups. These three trials reflect the ongoing chal - lenges in finding an effective treatment for organ failure in sepsis. Three mechanisms are currently thought to explain sepsis-induced organ failure: impaired tissue-perfusion defects, inflammation and cell hibernation 5. The three studies presented above suggest that improving tissue perfusion with use of vasopressors or inotropes or by addressing inflammation with steroids is not benefi-cial. Alternatively, this lack of benefit might relate to a lack of understanding in knowing when each therapeutic intervention is most beneficial. All three studies utilized serum creatinine-based AKIN criteria to charac - terize renal dysfunction \u2014 an approach that might under-estimate the true incidence of AKI, which might be better assessed by urine output criteria. Given that urine volume is a sensitive maker of organ perfusion to guide resuscitation for shock, it is surprising that none of the studies provided any information on this parameter. Interventions should ideally be imple - mented when they are most likely to achieve maximal benefit. In the V ANISH trial, 21% of Key advances Early use of vasopressin in fluid resuscitated patients with sepsis did not affect the number of kidney failure free days but did, however, reduce renal replacement therapy (RRT) use compared to noradrenaline2 Infusion of levosimendan for 24 h did not reduce the incidence of severe organ dysfunction or mortality among patients with sepsis compared to standard treatment3 Steroids were ineffective in preventing the development of shock in patients with severe sepsis4 In a single centre trial, early initiation of RRT in surgical patients with stage 2 acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with a significant reduction in mortality at 90 days7 In a multicentre trial, delayed initiation of RRT following the onset of complications in patients with stage 3 AKI led to avoidance of RRT in approximately 50%; however, mortality rates tended to be higher among patients who received delayed RRT 8 These...trials reflect the ongoing challenges in finding an effective treatment for organ failure in sepsis 51 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews NEPHROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

All rights reserved.patients already had stage 3 AKI at baseline despite early fluid resuscitation and treatment of systemic inflammatory response syndrome; it is likely that the incidence of stage 1 and 2 AKI was much higher at baseline. Similarly in the Leopards trial, 7% of patients had underlying chronic kidney disease, 29.8% had stage 3 AKI and 17% were on dialysis at time of enrolment. In the HYPRESS trial, >40% had renal dysfunction at baseline even though the study design excluded patients with organ failure of >4 h duration. Since these trials only considered stage 3 AKI or RRT requirement as kidney failure, lower stages of AKI were not accounted for and might have precluded the phases of organ dysfunction where the interventions might have had most benefit. These studies also illustrate the need for standardized criteria to consider RRT requirement as an outcome measure. Variations in the timing of initiation and discontinu a tion of RRT are commonplace in critically ill patients and contribute to the lack of demonstrated benefit. The incidence of new RRT in the V ANISH and Leopards trials was quite different despite similar enrolment criteria, whereas the incidence of RRT in the HYPRESS trial was lower, perhaps represent - ing the enrolment of patients much earlier in the course of injury. Two major trials have addressed issues relating to the timing of RRT in the ICU, with opposite results 6. The single-centre ELAIN trial7, demonstrated a marked mor - tality bene f it of initiating continuous (C) RRT within 8 h o f reaching stage 2 AKI compared to initiating RRT within 12 h of reaching stage 3 AKI (mortality 39.3% versus 54.7%, respectively; P = 0.03). By contrast, the multicentre AKIKI study8 ran- domly assigned patients in 31 French ICUs to receive either immediate RRT (early strat - egy) or a delayed strategy in which RRT was initiated if patients developed severe hyperkalaemia, uraemia, metabolic acido - sis, pulmonary oedema, or that persisted for >72 h a fter randomization. More than half the patients were treated with intermittent haemodialysis. The primary outcome of mortality at 60 days was similar in the two groups (48.5% versus 49.7% in the early and delayed strategy group, respec-tively; P = 0.79); h owever, 49% of patients in the delayed-strategy group never received dialysis. Although dialysis was avoided in almost 50% of patients in the delayed strat- egy group, those who ultimately required dialysis had worsening metabolic and clini - cal status on dialysis initiation. Although the differences in mortality were not significant when adjusted for baseline severity of illness, patients who did not receive RRT had the lowest severity-of -illness scores at baseline and had the lowest mortality (37.1%), fol - lowed by patients who received therapy early (48.5%), and then patients who received therapy late (61.8%). The different findings of the ELAIN and AKIKI trials stem from differences in study design and different hypothesis being tested. The ELAIN trial was designed to show a survival benefit for early RRT and included surgical patients with stage 2 AKI, whereas the AKIKI trial was designed to test the hypothesis that delayed RRT would confer a survival bene- fit in critically ill patients with stage 3 AKI. RRT was consequently initiated at different stages of AKI severity. Moreover, the choice of modality or dose was unrestricted in the AKIKI trial with most patients receiving intermittent haemodialysis, whereas it was limited to CRRT with an effluent volume of 30 (ml/kg)/h in the ELAIN trial. The ELAIN and AKIKI studies and the design of two ongoing clinical trials (IDEAL-ICU 9 and STAART10) suggest that we do not yet have a reproducible approach to evaluate which patients need dialysis in the ICU setting. AKI biomarkers of kidney damage could potentially inform this decision; however, current approaches and study designs do not incorporate an overall assessment of phenotype and do not account for the demand imposed on the kidney by multi- organ failure. I believe that the findings from these studies highlight a need for dynamic risk-stratification tools to identify patients who will or will not need therapeutic inter - vention, including RRT, for management of their AKI. The timely application of any pharmacological intervention or RRT needs to consider individual patient characteristics, process-of -care elements, and logistics to achieve therapeutic goals. New biomarkers are now available to chart the site and phase of organ dysfunction and should be utilized to create unique biomarker and clinical sig - natures to define time points for specific interventions. Although the future is bright, we need to know where to look and when to act to make a difference. Ravindra L.

RENAL TRANSPLANTATION IN 2016 Novel approaches to improve recipient and allograft outcomes Paolo Malvezzi and Lionel Rostaing Kidney transplantation was the focus of numerous publications in 2016. Key studies demonstrated a survival advantage of HLA-incompatible kidney transplantation and suggested that novel approaches such as co-stimulation blockade using belatacept and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection using a C1 esterase inhibitor might prove to be future game changers. Key advances Patients who received kidney transplants from HLA incompatible living donors had superior survival to waitlisted patients who received transplants from deceased donors or did not undergo transplantation2 The addition of a plasma derived C1 esterase inhibitor to standard care might improve outcomes in kidney transplant recipients with antibody mediated rejection3 Belatacept based immunosuppression is superior to ciclosporin based therapy for long term preservation of allograft function7 Tacrolimus minimization within the first year after kidney transplantation is not safe and should not be attempted 8The incidence of chronic kidney disease is increasing worldwide but the availability of deceased kidney donors has reached a plateau. Thus the sole option to enable fur - ther increases in kidney transplantation is to increase the number of living donors. In many cases, living donor candidates might be ABO-incompatible and/or HLA- incompatible with their potential recipient. This problem can be circumvented using a kidney paired exchange programme, or if such an approach is not possible or per - mitted, by performing incompatible kid - ney transplantation after desensitization therapy 1. In 2016, Orandi et al. published a US multicentre study that included 1,025 recip - ients of HLA-incompatible kidneys from living donors2. They found that, despite the need for desensitization therapy, these recipients had significantly better survival at 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 8 years than did matched waitlisted patients who received kidneys from deceased donors or did not undergo transplantation. This survival bene f it was seen even among recipients who had a positive cytotoxic crossmatch result, indicating that progress is being made in safely countering humoral immunity. Although these findings are promising, HLA-incompatible kidney transplantation is unlikely to become a routine procedure because of the frequent complications of acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejec - tion (ABMR), which are difficult and costly to manage. Various treatment options for acute ABMR are currently being investigated. Recently, Montgomery et al. reported data from their placebo-controlled trial of human plasma- derived C1 esterase inhibitor addition to standard care (plasmaphere-sis and intravenous immunoglobulin) in 18 patients with acute ABMR 3. Although the number of participants was small, the results showed a trend towards better graft function and a reduced incidence of trans - plant glomerulo p athy in 6 - month protocol biopsy samples in the C1INH group. These encouraging findings are in contrast to dis - appointing data from several case studies and from the RITUX-ERAH trial, which showed no bene f it of rituximab versus placebo in addition to standard care for acute ABMR4. Notably, controlled trials in the field of acute ABMR are rare, whereas retrospective case reports are abundant and frequently describe off-label use of powerful, potentially hazardous drugs. Following kidney transplantation, the main goal is to obtain good long-term (20 years) allograft function despite the use of nephrotoxic agents, such as the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) ciclosporin and tacrolimus. Although tolerance (that is, normal graft function without immunosuppression), has not yet been achieved, various strategies to reduce or eliminate nephrotoxic agents from immunosuppressive regimens have been tried with conflicting results. A potential alternative to CNIs in trans - plant recipients is the fusion protein belata - cept, which selectively inhibits T - cell activity by blocking co-stimulation. This agent (at a less intensive dose) was approved by the FDA and EMA in 2011 for the treatment of Epstein Barr virus positive transplant recipients based on 3 -year data from the phase III BENEFIT5 and BENEFIT-Ext trials6. In 2016, Vincenti et al. reported 7 -year follow -up data from the BENEFIT trial, in which 666 de novo kidney transplant recipients who had undergone basiliximab induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive either ciclosporin-based immunosuppression or a less intensive or more intensive belatacept regimen, in addi-tion to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids 7. During the first year post-transplan - tation, the incidence of acute T - cell-mediated rejection was significantly higher in the bela - tacept groups than in the ciclosporin group, but these events were not associated with worse renal function at 3 years or with the occurrence of de novo donor-specific anti - bodies (DSAs) 5. Among 447 patients who were followed for up to 7 years post-trans - plantation, the incidence of death or graft loss at 84 months was significantly higher in the ciclosporin group (21.7%) than in either belatacept group (more intensive 12.7%, less intensive 12.8%; P = 0.02)7. In addition, mean progress is being made in safely countering humoral immunity 53 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews NEPHROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

All rights reserved.estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increased during 7 years of follow -up in the belatacept groups but declined in the ciclo - sporin group. At month sive belatacept, less intensive belatacept and ciclosporin groups, respectively. Moreover, the cumulative rates of development of DSAs at month 84 were significantly lower in the belatacept groups (more intensive 1.9%, less intensive 4.6%) than in the ciclosporin group (17.8%; P <0.001). These results demonstrate that belatacept-based immunosuppression is superior to ciclosporin-based therapy for long-term preservation of allograft function. The disadvantages of the belatacept reg - imen are the increased incidence of early post-transplantation, low-grade acute rejec- tion \u2014 which could potentially be prevented by using lymphocyte-depleting agents instead of basiliximab as induction therapy \u2014 and the need for monthly intravenous infusions of the agent. An alternative strategy to de novo use of belatacept would be to use standard tacrolimus-based therapy for the first 3 months after de novo kidney transplanta - tion and then introduce belatacept to replace tacrolimus and everolimus to replace MMF (FIG. 1) . This approach could potentially avoid early episodes of acute rejection, but enable the long-term benefits of belatacept therapy to be retained. The target population for such a strategy might be recipients of kidneys from living donors and recipients with poor renal function early post-transplantation. A very recent randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility of reducing tacroli - mus dose at 4 months post-transplantation in stable, steroid-free kidney transplant recip - ients 8. In this study, 186 patients who were receiving extended-release tacrolimus plus mycophenolic acid were randomly assigned to either a 50% reduction in tacrolimus dose (targeted trough concentration >3 g/l) o r to no change in dose (trough concentra - tion 7-12 g/l). The mean trough levels of tacrolimus were significantly lower in the dose reduction group than the dose mainte - nance group at 6 months (4.1 \u00b1 2.7 g/l v er- sus 6.7 \u00b1 3.9 g/l, P <0.0001) a nd 12 months 2.1 <0.0001). A lthough eGFR at 12 months post-transplantation was similar in the two groups (56.0 \u00b1 m\u00b2), the num - ber of rejection episodes (11 versus three, P = 0.016) a nd the frequency of subclinical inflammation in surveillance kidney biopsy samples were significantly higher in the dose reduction group. Moreover, donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies appeared in six patients in the dose reduction group but no patients in the dose maintenance group (P = 0.008). These data demonstrate that tacrolimus min-imization within the first year post-trans - plantation is not safe (trough levels should be maintained at >7 g/l) a nd should not be attempted. Consistent with these findings, a previ - ous trial of tacrolimus withdrawal in kidney transplant recipients with weaning begin - ning at 6 months post-transplantation was terminated early because of safety concerns9. Importantly the data suggested that the num - ber of HLA epitope mismatches, the results of IFN ELISPOT assays and the detection of urinary CXCL9 might help to predict which patients would develop acute rejection during tacrolimus weaning 9. Overall, clinical research in kidney trans - plantation was very active in 2016. Progress in countering the HLA antibody barrier has enabled excellent survival outcomes with HLA-incompatible transplantation and novel immunosuppressive strategies are starting to emerge.

Blood pressure (BP) guidelines vary in their recommendations for target BP in patients with CKD with most guideline commit - tees currently recommending a BP goal of <140/90 mmHg for most patients with CKD and some guidelines recommending a lower BP goal of <130/80 mmHg in patients with CKD and proteinuria 2. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) was a randomized, controlled trial that aimed to identify appropriate systolic (S) BP tar - gets to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among older individuals with - out diabetes. 9,361 participants, who were 50 years of age with SBP 130 m mHg at screening and at risk of cardio va scular dis - ease, were randomly assigned to an inten - sive SBP target of <120 m mHg standard target of <140 m mHg (REFS 3,4). The trial was terminated early, after 3.26 years, when preliminary safety analyses showed a 25% reduction in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular events and a 27% reduction in mortality in participants assigned to intensive SBP control 3,4. 28% of participants in SPRINT had CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 20 m l/min/1.73 m2 and <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, although patients with polycystic kidney disease, marked pro - teinuria, treated glomerulonephritis, and renal transplant recipients were excluded. No difference in the pre-specified com - posite renal end point of a 50% decrease in eGFR or development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or transplantation, was observed among participants with baseline CKD; however, the number of ESRD events were small in both groups perhaps due to early termina - tion of the trial and a lower-than-expected decline in eGFR. Acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as a decrease in eGFR of 30% to <60 m l/min/1.73 m2 was more common in the intensive group than in the standard-treatment group (HR 3.49; 95% CI 2.44-5.10; P <0.001), p robably due to greater use of antihypertensive therapy in the intensive care group. No evidence of permanent CKD associated with the lower SBP goal exists; however, the possi - bility of long-term adverse renal outcomes with low SBP targets cannot be excluded. More detailed analyses of patients with CKD in SPRINT are underway to assess the long-term effects of lower BP goals on CKD progression. Currently available data, however, suggest that a lower SBP goal provides cardiovascular protection and reduces mortality in patients with CKD, but does not prevent progression of renal disease. Although the SPRINT study pro - vides important information on managing SBP in non-diabetic patients of advanced age with substantial cardiovascular risk, it is important to remember that these results cannot be generalized to other populations or to all patients with CKD and therefore cannot be used to derive new BP guidelines for patients not included in the SPRINT study population. When setting a BP goal for a particu- lar hypertensive patient, the decision as to which BP goal to pursue is balanced by treatment risks. The delineation of 'target organ damage' acknowledges that some organs (such as the heart, brain and kid - ney) are more vulnerable to the effects of high BP than are other organs (such as the liver and spleen). Thus, the chosen BP goal must balance the benefit of target organ preservation against the risks of interven - tion. A meta-analysis of 44,989 patients enrolled in randomized, controlled trials of intensive versus less-intensive BP -l owering treatment for at least 6 months, evaluated not only conventional primary outcomes such as death, heart attack, heart failure and stroke, but also ESRD and worsening of albuminuria 5. The investigators included a variety of studies that used different BP goals and achieved differing levels of reduction in BP (from 1.3/0.8 mmHg to as much as 14.2/6.7 mmHg). In addition, some studies included children with CKD and others included patients with diabetes, introducing heterogeneity into the analyses. The meta-analysis showed that intensive BP-lowering treatment was associated with a 14% reduction in major cardio v ascular events as compared to the less intensive group. Among the three trials in which wors - ening albuminuria was included as an end Key advances A lower blood pressure goal provides cardiovascular protection and reduces mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but does not prevent progression of renal disease4,5 Choosing an appropriate blood pressure goal for patients with CKD requires assessment of the benefits of intensive blood pressure control on cardiovascular outcomes and potentially renal outcomes, against the increased risk of adverse effects such as orthostatic hypotension, falls in the elderly and AKI 5. The use of empagliflozin when added to standard care (typically an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high cardiovascular risk is associated with a slower progression of CKD and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events but has no effect on incident albuminuria 7 Increased visittovisit variability is emerging as a risk factor for death and cardiovascular disease; in patients with CKD, greater visittovisit variability in systolic blood pressure predicts death and haemorrhagic stroke, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and no clear interventions are yet available 10 HYPERTENSION IN 2016 Blood pressure goals, variability and SGLT2 blockade in CKD Debbie L. Cohen and Raymond R. Townsend Blood pressure (BP) goals and the management of BP in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain controversial topics. Key articles in the past year have addressed BP goals in CKD, the use of new agents to slow CKD progression and the effects of visit -to-visit variability in systolic BP on cardiovascular events and renal progression in patients with CKD. 55 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews NEPHROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In the eight trials that evaluated ESRD as an end point (8,690 participants), however, no significant reduction in the hazard ratio was observed, although a trend for a benefit with more intensive BP control was evident. The lack of effect of tight BP control on the development of ESRD is consistent with the findings from SPRINT. Unlike SPRINT, the meta-analysis found an 8% increase in cardio va scular events among patients with CKD who received intensive BP control; however, this effect was not statistically sig - nificant. The investigators also noted that the risk of adverse effects, such as hypoten - sion, were up to threefold higher among par - ticipants assigned to intensive BP therapy. The value in this study is in its large size, concordance with the SPRINT data in terms of the lack of effect of tight BP control on CKD progression, and the use of ESRD as an end point. The findings from this analy-sis suggest that future interventions to target hypertension in patients with CKD might require a personalized approach 6. 2016 also saw the first demonstration of renal protection by an agent from a rel - atively new class of drugs \u2014 the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial had pre - viously shown that empagliflozin reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and eGFR 30 m l/min/1.73 m2. A secondary analysis to determine the long-term effects of empagliflozin on renal end points showed that fewer patients in the empagliflozin group developed incident or worsening nephropathy (defined as progres - sion to macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine levels, ESRD, or death from renal disease), than patients in the placebo group (12.7% versus 18.8%; P <0.001)7. Doubling of serum creatinine levels occurred in 1.5% of the empagliflozin group and 2.6% of the placebo group ( P <0.001) w ith a relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal replacement therapy was initiated in 0.3% of participants in the empagliflozin group and 0.6% of those in the placebo group (P = 0.04), and progression to macroalbuminuria occurred in 41.8% of participants in the empagliflozin group ver - sus 64.9% in the placebo group ( P = 0.001). Incident albuminuria, however, was similar between groups. The incidence of urosep - sis was higher in the empagliflozin group whereas the incidence of AKI and hyper - kalaemia were lower in the active treatment group. This study showed that empagliflozin, when added to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk, slowed progression of CKD and led to lower rates of clinically relevant renal events, suggest - ing this agent might be the first to have a significant role in delaying the progression of renal disease since the introduction of renin-angiotensin system blockers. That visit -to-visit variability (VVV) in SBP is an independent predictor of death, progres - sion to ESRD, and cardiovascular events, has been reasonably well established in clinical trials of hypertensive patients8, and in patients who are already on dialysis9, but data on VVV in patients with CKD who are not enrolled in studies or who are not on dialysis are scarce. A 2016 study leveraged the large captive Kaiser Permanente population of Northern California to address this knowledge gap 10 by evaluating the risks of death, development of ESRD, or cardiovascular events among 114,900 adults with nondialysis CKD over a 3-year period. The researchers observed a significantly higher risk of death (HR 1.22), and haemorrhagic stroke (HR 1.91) among patients in the highest quintile of SBP varia - bility compared with those in the lowest quin - tile, even after controlling for the mean SBP , the severity of kidney disease, and comor - bidities. VVV of SBP did not, however, pre - dict ESRD, heart failure, or ischaemic stroke. Findings from this study showed that a sub - group of individuals at higher risk of death and haemorrhagic stroke can be identified within a broader group of patients with CKD; however, the optimal number of visits and spacing between the visits when screening patients, and most importantly appropriate interventions once candidates are identified are still lacking. These particular studies are highlighted here because we believe that they showcase heterogeneity in the target organ effects of hypertension and in the degree to which organ damage can be mitigated by BP inter - ventions. The heterogeneity in organ response to BP control might relate to different method - ologies used to assess BP . Brachial BP , which is generally obtained in the sitting position and typically used in research studies and in routine clinical encounters, might not reflect the actual BP in the brain or kidney, as these organs are upstream and downstream of the measurement point, respectively. Further studies are needed to determine the benefits of reductions in intrarenal pressure on renal out - comes, and whether approaches to decrease intrarenal pressure specifically might reduce the disparity in outcome benefits from BP interventions.

Initial reports of the Aedes aegypti mosquito-transmitted flavivirus epidemic described ZIKV as similar to dengue and chikungunya virus infections2. As the epidemic unfolded, however, increasing numbers of newborns with microcephaly were diagnosed, raising suspicions of a causal relationship with ZIKV 2,3. An autopsy study of a fetus from a ZIKV- infected mother revealed microcephaly with lack of gyration, hydrocephalus, and multi - focal calcifications in the cerebral cortex and sub c ortical white matter, together with mild focal inflammation1. Using reverse transcrip - tion PCR (RT - PCR) and electron microscopy, Mlakar and colleagues identified ZIKV in the fetal brain tissue in this particular case. A Brazilian study showed a 100 -fold increase in microcephaly incidence from November 2015 to February 2016, mirroring the peak incidence of ZIKV infection 3. After a review of the 1,501 suspected cases, 76 were classified as definite ZIKV-related brain developmen - tal disorders, 54 as highly probable, 181 as moderately probable, and 291 as somewhat facial palsy developed. The mean duration between onset of ZIKV symptoms and GBS was 7 days, and 42% of patients did not have an asymptomatic period between ZIKV and GBS. The latter patients were classified as having a para-infectious onset, whereas those with a symptom-free interval were deemed to have post-infectious GBS 5. The authors showed that RT - PCR in urine had the highest sensitivity (67%) for demon - strating ZIKV infection in this patient pop - ulation. Positive serology (IgG or IgM) for ZIKV was identified in 86% of the patients. The rate of encephalitis among ZIKV infected individuals is low, particularly when compared with other flavivirus infections, such as West Nile and dengue virus. A fatal case of ZIKV encephalitis was reported in Brazil in an otherwise healthy non-pregnant woman 6. She presented with a rash and arthralgia, after which she rapidly developed leg weakness, dysarthria and confusion. After a gradual deterioration over a period of 10 days, severe brain oedema was observed, which eventually resulted in her death. 2016 was undoubtedly the year of ZIKV , but other important studies on the topic of neurological infections were published. Two large randomized clinical trials evaluated treatment options in HIV-associated crypto - cocccal meningitis7,8. Cryptococcosis is a defining opportunistic infection for AIDS, and is the second most common AIDS- defining illness in Africa. Therapies for cryptococcal meningitis are currently lim-ited to three antifungal drugs (amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine and fluconazole) and treatment for complications (in particular, raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure), and case fatality rates are high (30%). Oral therapies are desirable for resource-poor set - tings, which have the highest cryptococcal disease burden. During brain infections, immune responses can exacerbate cerebral oedema and neurological damage, leading to coma and death. Therefore, adjunctive anti- inflammatory therapies might be of interest in cryptococcal meningitis. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial pub - lished in 2016 attempted to answer a burn - ing clinical question: what is the role of adjunctive dexamethasone therapy in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis? This probable. Of the affected live-born children, 80% had microcephaly, and the remainder had other congenital structural abnormalities of the brain. Experimental studies provided further support for a causal link between ZIKV and microcephaly. In neural stem cell, neuro - sphere and brain organoid models, Garcez and colleagues showed that ZIKV could infect human brain cells and reduce their viability, which might lead to abrogation of neurogen - esis during human brain development 4. The offspring of mice and nonhuman primates infected with ZIKV show similar congenital brain disorders to those found in humans. ZIKV was also found to be associated with a sharp rise in the incidence of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (FIG. 1 ). At the height of the ZIKV epidemic in early 2016, a cluster of GBS cases was observed in Colombia5. A total of 401 patients were identified with a neurological syndrome and a history of ZIKV infection, of whom 270 (67%) were diagnosed with GBS. Clinical fea - tures were reported for 68 patients, reporting to six university hospitals. The ZIKV infec-tion presented with fever, rash, myalgia, headache, conjunctivitis and arthralgia, after which limb weakness, paraesthesia and CNS INFECTIONS IN 2016 2016, the year of Zika virus Diederik van de Beek and Matthijs C.

At 10 weeks, mortality rates were similar between groups, but the percentage of patients with disabil - ity was higher in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25-0.69, P < 0.003). P atients in the dexa - methasone group had impaired CSF fungal clearance compared with the placebo group. These findings show that adjunctive dexa - methasone has no role in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. The second trial was an open-label, dose-finding adjunctive sertraline for the treatment is a selective in vivo fungicidal activity against Cryptococcus spe- cies. 112 participants from Uganda were randomly assigned to three different dose of sertraline for the first 2 weeks, followed by a consolidation dose for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the 2 -week CSF clearance rate for Cryptococcus . At 12 weeks, 40% of the study participants had died, indicating the severity of disease. Participants receiving ser - traline had faster cryptococcal CSF clearance and a lower incidence of immune reconsti - tution inflammatory syndrome and relapse than was reported in the past. No clear dose- response relationship between the sertraline dose and early fungicidal activity was found. Nevertheless, further investigation of adjunc-tive sertraline for cryptococcal meningitis in randomized clinical trials using clinical end points is warranted.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is commonly transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, but sexual transmission has also been reported. ZIKV infection presents with exanthema, and might lead to abrogation of neurogenesis during fetal brain development, resulting in microcephaly. During or after ZIKV infection, acute demyelating inflammatory polyneuropathy can develop. In rare cases, ZIKV causes encephalitis.the case fatality rate remains high (17%)9. In 2016, European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial meningitis were published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) 10. The guidelines state that empirical treatment with dexameth - asone should be routine for all adults and children with acute bacterial meningitis in the setting of high-income countries. The guideline strongly recommends starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible, and no more than 1 h a fter arrival at hospital10. To summarize, 2016 was an exciting year for the CNS infections field. ZIKV infection during pregnancy was found to cause microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects, and an increased incidence of GBS was reported in areas affected by ZIKV . Randomized clinical trials showed no role for adjunctive promising effects of adjunctive sertraline in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Progress has been made in the treatment of bacterial meningitis over the past decade, but we are not there yet, and there is still an urgent need for new adjunctive treatments for cryptococcal and bacterial meningitis.

NEURO-ONCOLOGY IN 2016 Advances in brain tumour classification and therapy Matthias Preusser and Christine Marosi Brain tumours encompass a heterogeneous collection of neoplasms, traditionally classified by histopathological criteria. In 2016, the WHO published an updated classification that, for the first time, defines brain tumour types according to integrated histological and molecular parameters. Furthermore, clinical trial results were reported that inform therapeutic decision-making in diffuse gliomas. May 2016 saw the publication of CNS4+, an update to the WHO classification of tumours of the CNS 1. For the first time, this new clas- sification integrates histomorphological and molecular parameters for the diagnosis of primary brain tumours. It builds on recent advances, such as the demonstration that different genetic subtypes of morphologi - cally identical tumours have different natural histories, and may differ significantly in their response to treatment. The new WHO classification is certainly a milestone in the evolution of neuro- o ncology, and will change the landscape of brain tumour research by providing a novel reference system for the diagnostic work -up in the clini c al set - ting, as well as for basic and clinical research. It will also introduce new challenges, however. The sophisticated molecular evaluation that is required for a fully integrated diagnosis via the CNS4+ classification is not readily avail - able in every diagnostic laboratory, thereby creating a need to upgrade services or to cen - tralize neuropathology services at national and international levels. Furthermore, clinical trials will need to base patient selection on the new tumour classification, which has poten - tial implications for trial logistics and patient accrual if molecularly defined patient subsets are to be targeted. Hopefully, these efforts will lead to better treatments for well-defined adult and paediatric patient populations. With regard to the treatment of brain tumours, 2016 brought some important clini - cal trial results in low-grade gliomas (LGGs, WHO grade II) and anaplastic gliomas (WHO grade III), and in glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) affecting elderly patients (aged 65 years). LGGs account for ~15% of all gliomas, mainly affect people in the third and fourth decade of life, are associated with tumour-related epilepsy, have a distinct tendency to recur and progress into malignant gliomas, and limit life expectancy. Treatment strategies for LGGs include neurosurgical resection (which is often not possible due to tumour extent or location), watchful waiting, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy with procarbazine, vincristine and lomustine (PCV) or temozolomide 2. The question of which LGG treatment strategy to use in which patient, and how to combine or sequence these treatments, has long been unresolved. Important trial results shedding light on this issue were presented in 2016. Between 1998 and 2002, Buckner et al. recruited 251 patients with LGG who had undergone biopsy or at least partial resection of their tumour 3. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment either with fractionated radiotherapy up to 54 G y with 1.8 G y per fraction, or to radio t herapy followed by six adjuvant cycles of PCV chemotherapy. After a median follow -u p of 11.2 years, it became clear that patients treated with radiation alone had significantly shorter survival than those who subsequently received chemotherapy (7.8 years and 13.3 years, respectively; HR 0.59, P < 0.003). Molecular characterization, which was available for 45% of the tumours, indicated greater benefits for patients codeletions and isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) mutations.Another international trial led by the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) registered 707 patients with histologically proven WHO grade II gliomas, and explored the efficacy of radiotherapy (50.4 G y, 1.8 G y per fraction) compared with dose-dense temozolomide chemotherapy (75 mg/m2 daily for 21 days, in up to 12 cycles of 28 days)4. Patients were stratified according to age, WHO perfor - mance status, presence or absence of contrast enhancement in MRI, 1p deletion status, and recruitment site. Patients underwent randomization when active treatment was required, and they had to fulfil at least one of the following criteria: age >40 years, new or worsening neurological symptoms, refractory seizures, and radiological tumour progression. The trial included 477 patients, who were followed up for a median of 48 months. Tissue for molecular characterization was available from 318 patients. This trial confirmed that patients with IDH1 mutation and 1p/19q codeletion had the longest periods of progression-free sur - vival (62 months, 95% CI 41 to not reached), followed by the patients showing IDH muta - tions only (48 months, 95% 41-55 months). Patients with wild-type IDH1 had the shortest period of progression-free survival (20 months, 95% CI 12-26 months). Of note, IDH -mutated, non-codeletion patients had a longer period of progression-free sur - vival with radiotherapy than with chemo - therapy (55.4 versus 36.0 months, P = 0 .013).

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN 2016 Immune-directed therapies in MS \u2014 efficacy and limitations Bernhard Hemmer and Mark M\u00fchlau In 2016, new highly active treatment options for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) emerged. At the same time, large clinical trials in progressive MS highlighted the limitations of immune-directed therapies, and called for new strategies to treat disease progression in MS. During the past two decades, several immune therapies have been established for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). For all the drugs that have been approved to date, effi - cacy and safety inversely correlate. However, work reported in 2016 has demonstrated that B-cell depletion with CD20 -specific mono - rituximab, ocreli - zumab and ofatumumab) is a safe and effective treatment strategy for RRMS. In March 2016, a retrospective study was published in which patients with RRMS were switched from natalizumab to either ritux - imab or fingolimod1. Patients who received rituximab experienced fewer relapses and adverse events than did those who received fingolimod. During the first year, only 2% of patients discontinued rituximab, whereas 24% discontinued fingolimod. This positive outcome of B -cell depletion was reinforced by data from two identical phase III trials of ocrelizumab in RRMS that were published in December 2016 (REF. 2). In these trials, the efficacy and safety of ocreli - zumab and subcutaneous IFN1a were com - pared. Over a period of 2 years, ocrelizumab reduced relapse rates by 46% and 47% (pri - mary end point) in the two trials, and reduced confirmed disability progression by 40% in both trials (secondary end point). Most impressively, ocrelizumab largely abolished inflammatory disease activity as measured with MRI: in the two trials, the numbers of gadolinium- e nhancing lesions were 94% and 95% lower in patients treated with ocrelizumab than in those treated with IFN. Tolerability and safety of the two drugs was comparable. The outcomes of these phase III trials and the results emerging from clinical practice sug - gest that B -cell depletion is a highly effective and safe treatment option for RRMS. However, the long-term effects of B -cell depletion are still uncertain, and caution is warranted in the use of this approach until long-term safety data are available.For patients with newly diagnosed ana - plastic gliomas, van den Bent et al. presen - ted the first interim results of the EORTC CATNON trial 26053, which used a 2:2 factorial design to explore the added value of temozolomide as concomitant or adjuvant therapy to radiation (59.4 G y in 33 fractions)6. After a median follow -up of 27 months, the interim analysis showed a hazard ratio reduction of 0.645 (95% CI 0.450-0.926, P = 0. 0014) for overall survival when adjuvant temozolomide was used. Whether concomi-tant chemotherapy is also beneficial in these patients will be known in 2021. For elderly patients with glioblastoma, therapeutic concepts have evolved consid - erably in recent years, and radiotherapy and chemotherapy monotherapy regimens adapted to patient 6-methylguanine- MGMT ) promoter methylation status have been defined7. In 2016, Perry et al. reported the results of a Canadian-led phase III trial, in which short- course radiation therapy (40 G y in 15 frac - tions over 3 weeks) combined with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide was compared with radiotherapy alone in fit newly diag- nosed glioblastoma patients aged 65 years8. The addition of temozolomide to radiother - apy extended the median overall survival from 7.6 months to 9.3 months, and quality of life was not diminished with the combined therapy. These findings indicate that multi - modal therapy is beneficial and can be con - sidered as a feasible treatment option in fit elderly patients with glioblastoma. In the field of neuro-oncology, the main advances over the past year lie in a refined classification of primary brain tumours using increasingly sophisticated techniques, and in the extension of our knowledge on indica - tions for and sequencing of classic radiation and alkylating chemotherapy approaches. Unfortunately, like previous years, 2016 failed to deliver positive trial results for bio - logical agents in gliomas. The ACT -I V trial evaluating rindopepimut, a vaccine target - ing epidermal growth factor receptor var - iant III (EGFRvIII), was stopped early for futility, thereby dashing the hopes raised by earlier smaller trials. Hopefully, ongoing trials with other novel agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death 1 (PD -1), or the drug-antibody conju - gate ABT - 414, which targets amplified EGFR, will produce more-encouraging results in 2017 and beyond 9,10.

Ablation of the adaptive immune system and maturation of a new immune repertoire that lacks autoreactive immune cells as a result of transplantation has the potential to stop autoimmune-mediated damage. In 2016, the results of a phase II trial of HSCT in RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) were reported 3. Twenty four patients with highly active disease took part in the trial. One patient died as a result of transplantation- r elated complications, but 70% of the other patients experienced no disease activity during the 3 years that followed the intervention. The other 30% experienced early and sustained disability progression after transplantation, but without relapses and MRI activity. None of the surviving 23 patients experienced a relapse or developed gadolinium-enhancing lesions for up to 12 years after HSCT. The results of this study suggest that HSCT is a highly effective treatment for RRMS, with a profound and long-lasting impact on inflammatory disease activity. Although the treatment seemed to fully sup - press the development of new lesions, it failed to stop progression in a subgroup of patients. Given the possibility of severe adverse effects and the increasing potency of new immuno - therapies, head -to-head trials will be neces - sary to establish HSCT as a standard therapy in MS. Further insight into the effectiveness of immunotherapy for progressive MS has been gained from placebo-controlled phase III trials reported in 2016, with relatively sober - ing outcomes. In particular, the INFORMS trial of fingolimod in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS) showed that the immunomodulatory drug did not influence 3-month confirmed disease progression (CDP) when compared with a placebo4, although secondary MRI end points, such as new T2 -weighted and gadolinium- enhancing lesions, did indicate suppression of inflammatory activity. More-encouraging results from the ORATORIO trial were presented in December 2016 (REF. 5). In this trial, ocrelizumab was compared with a placebo in patients with PPMS who were no older than 55 years and had inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid changes. Ocrelizumab reduced confirmed disability progression over 3 months by 24% (primary end point) and over 6 months by 25% (sec - ondary end point), and reduced the change of T2 -weighted volume by 90%. The drug was well tolerated, but the observed rate of neo - plasms \u2014 in particular, breast cancer \u2014 was higher among patients who received ocrelizumab than among those who received a placebo (2.3% versus 0.8%). Although ORATORIO was the first trial to demonstrate an influence on disease progression in PPMS, the impact on clinical outcome parameters was still modest. In another phase III trial in SPMS, the monoclonal antibody natalizumab, which is very effective in RRMS, did not show any effect on disease progression 6. These results indicate that even potent immunotherapies that efficiently target the peripheral immune system and prevent new CNS lesions have \u2014 at best \u2014 a moderate impact on disease progression, implying that the peripheral immune system no longer predominates in the progressive stage. If this implication is correct, what are the mechanisms that underlie progression? Two possible explanations have emerged in recent years. First, neuropathological studies have demonstrated the presence of diffuse white matter pathology and cortical lesions associ - ated with meningeal immune infiltrates in progressive MS, indicating the existence of a sequestered immune response in the CNS that is disconnected from the peripheral immune system. The second possibility is that secondary neurodegeneration, triggered by immune-mediated damage to axon-glia structures, develops and causes disease pro - gression. In line with this concept, a careful neuropathological study has demonstrated widespread and pronounced loss of dendritic spines in the cortex in MS that seems to occur independently of cortical demyelination and axon loss 7. These pathological changes might be a correlate of disease progression that is independent of relapses. The reason for dendrite loss is unclear, but it might be a long-term consequence of widespread low-grade diffuse inflammation in white and grey matter, and in the meninges. A comprehensive view of progressive MS requires consideration of not only the late and clinically overt progressive phase, but also the probable early events that precede clinical onset of disease. Two important studies pub - lished in 2016 have addressed the preclinical phase of PPMS. In one study, Cortese and col - leagues linked information in an MS registry to the results of the conscription examination of men in Norway 8. They found that people who developed RRMS had lower cognitive scores at 2 years before the first demyelinat - ing attack, and those who developed PPMS exhibited cognitive impairment up to 20 years before overt onset of progression. This find - ing suggests that patients with PPMS can have subclinical disease activity decades before clinical onset. In the other study, the risk of developing PPMS was investigated in patients with radio - logically isolated syndrome (RIS)9. Of 453 people with RIS, 128 developed CIS or RRMS, and 15 developed PPMS. People who devel- oped PPMS were a mean of 10 years older and more likely to be men than those who devel-oped CIS or RRMS. The age of onset and the prevalence of PPMS in this cohort were com - parable to those in other cohorts of patients with PPMS 10. Selected patients with RIS who had frequent MRI scans exhibited ongoing asymptomatic MRI activity years before the onset of PPMS. Taken together, these studies suggest that, at least in a subset of patients, asymptomatic inflammatory CNS lesions occur years before the onset of PPMS. Combined with the fact that only 10% of all new lesions in RRMS are accompanied by clinical symptoms, these findings make it tempting to speculate that PPMS is also preceded by an inflammatory phase, and the lesions remain asymptomatic because they do not affect critical areas, are less destructive, or are few in number. This disease course would place PPMS in the same category as SPMS, with several impli - cations. First, we would need to establish the diagnosis before the onset of progression to enable efficient treatment of PPMS with commonly used immune-directed thera - pies. Second, for patients in whom we cannot prevent progression (regardless of whether they have PPMS or SPMS), new treatment Key advances Research reported in 2016 has demonstrated the efficacy of immune-mediate therapies in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and the limitations of these therapies in progressive MS B-cell-depleting therapies have been shown to be highly effective and well tolerated in RRMS 2 Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation strongly reduces inflammatory disease activity in active RRMS and secondary progressive MS, but comes with the risk of serious adverse events 3 Ocrelizumab is the first drug to reduce disability progression in PPMS, but the impact on clinical outcome parameters is still modest, and the treatment might carry an increased risk of neoplasms 5 Patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS) can have cognitive impairments and subclinical MRI activity years before clinical presentation 7,8, suggesting that PPMS has a presymptomatic inflammatory phase 61 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews NEUROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Last, we need to recon - sider whether we should separate PPMS and SPMS in future treatment trials that target progressive MS.

Reiman Investigational treatments to impede the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) are being evaluated in clinical trials, and biomarkers to detect and track the disease are being developed and deployed. Recent findings underscore the importance of ongoing clinical trials and biomarker developments in the understanding, treatment and prevention of AD. Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of disabling cognitive impairment in older adults, is among the most daunting pub - lic health problems of our time. With more people reaching older age, the urgency to understand, treat and prevent this condition is mounting. Over the past few years, research - ers have developed promising biomarker methods to detect and track the disease, long before cognitive impairment manifests. Potential treatments to target elements of the postulated pathogenic cascade have been discovered and are beginning to be tested in clinical trials, incorporating a growing num - ber of biomarkers to help (TABLE 1) . Clinical trial findings and biomarker developments reported in 2016 remind us of both the chal - lenges and opportunities ahead. According to the amyloid hypothesis 1, increased levels of a 42 -amino-acid form of the amyloid - (A) protein in the brain initiate a cascade of deleterious events that lead to progressive symptoms of AD. The postulated cascade begins with aggregation of A42 monomers into potentially harmful oligomers and fibrils, the main constituents of A plaques. Inflammatory responses ensue, followed by aggregation, phosphorylation and trans-syn -aptic spread of the intraneuronal protein tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments, which are the main compo - nents of neurofibrillary tangles. The cascade culminates in dysfunction and degeneration of affected synapses and neurons. The amyloid hypothesis is espoused by many but not all researchers, and remains the focus of heated debate. The supporting evidence is substantial but largely circum - stantial, and clinical trials of anti -A treat - ments promise to help settle the arguments once and for all. Several of these treatments are now being evaluated in people with cog- nitive impairment, and even in cognitively unimpaired individuals who, on the basis of Key advances The antibody aducanumab, which binds to and promotes removal of amyloid- 42 (A42) oligomers and fibrils, dramatically reduced A plaque measurements, and was hinted to slow cognitive decline, in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild AD dementia and a positive A PET scan4 The antibody solanezumab, which binds to and promotes clearance of A42 monomers, had little impact on cognitive decline and no impact on PET measurements of A plaque or paired helical filament tau (PHF-tau) deposition in people with mild AD dementia and a positive A PET scan6 18F-AV1451 PET measurements of paired helical filament tau burden were elevated in the medial temporal cortex and associated with worse memory performance in cognitively unimpaired older adults, were elevated in lateral temporal, parietal and cortical cortex in those with a positive A PET scan, and corresponded roughly to Braak staging of neurofibrillary tangle pathology7 An automated assay dramatically reduced the variability of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A 42 measurements, setting the stage to improve the standardization, precision, power and comparability of CSF biomarkers of AD8 CSF and blood neurofilament light (NfL) chain levels were elevated in mice and humans with A , tau and -synuclein pathologies, supporting the potential use of blood NfL measurements to help monitor disease progression and treatment effects in protein-based neurodegenerative diseases9 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 62 NEUROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In 2016, Sevigny et al. reported encour - aging preliminary findings from a 12 -month trial of the antibody treatment aducanumab in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild AD dementia, along with PET evidence of A plaques 4. This antibody binds selec - tively to A42 oligomers and fibrils, inducing engulf and remove fibrils. In an initial dose-finding and safety trial, adu - canumab dramatically reduced A plaque measurements, and was hinted to slow cogni - tive decline. Confirmation of the safety data and preliminary cognitive findings for adu - canumab in larger and more-definitive trials, which are now underway, would provide conclusive support for the amyloid hypothe - sis, and would be a game changer in the fight against AD 5. By contrast, findings from a clinical trial of another anti -A treatment were disappointing. In 2016, Honig et al. presented findings from a large and thoughtfully designed 80 -week trial of the antibody treatment solanezumab in people with mild AD dementia and PET evi-dence of A plaques 6. This antibody binds to and promotes the clearance of A monomers, and is intended to reduce the aggregation of these monomers into potentially damaging oligomers and fibrils. In the trial, solanezumab treatment failed to sufficiently slow cognitive decline, and had no significant impact on PET measurements of A plaque or paired helical filament tau (PHF-tau) deposition. Although trends towards reductions in cognitive and functional decline were observed among the treated patients, the observed effect sizes were small. There are several possible explanations for the disappointing solanezumab trial findings. For example, the solanezumab dose could have been too low to enable enough antibodies to cross the blood-brain barrier and sufficiently engage their target in the brain, as only one or two in 1,000 antibody molecules cross the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the treat - ment may have been initiated too late in the disease to have a substantial effect. Indeed, the drug may be engaging the wrong A target (monomers) in people with cognitive impairment (when the underlying disease is already extensive), so that pre-existing oligomers and fibrils remain free to exert their potentially harmful effects. Although the pos- sibility remains that critical elements of the amyloid hypothesis are simply wrong, it would be premature to draw that conclusion until dif - ferent anti -A treatments have failed to work, even in unimpaired people at increased risk, when the disease is less extensive. AD drug development is not for the faint- hearted, and we need the fortitude to stay the course until the amyloid hypothesis is definitively confirmed or refuted. We need to develop a more diversified portfolio of investi - gational treatments, clarify the added value of combination therapies, and continue to accel - erate the evaluation of prevention therapies. We also need to continue to find new ways to work together and share research data, tools and ideas, and enrolment resources. We need to continue to learn from previous efforts, and conduct trials in the most thoughtful and rig - orous way. The increasing availability of AD biomarkers promises to aid this effort. The best-established AD biomarkers include PET measurements of A plaque burden, PHF-tau burden and cerebral glu - cose metabolism; MRI measurements of brain atrophy and resting state functional connectivity; and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A 42, A40, total tau and phospho-tau levels. These and additional brain imaging, spinal fluid and other biomarker methods con - tinue to be developed, tested and considered for inclusion in observational studies and clinical trials. In a study reported in 2016, Sch\u00f6ll et al. used 18F-AV1451 PET to characterize PHF- tau deposition in cognitively unimpaired older adults 7. PHF-tau burden in the medial temporal cortex was associated with worse episodic memory performance. PHF-tau in the lateral temporal, parietal and frontal cortex was observed only in unimpaired indi - viduals with PET evidence of substantial A plaque burden, and the regional pattern of PET measurements corresponded roughly with Braak staging of neurofibrillary tan - gle pathology 7. Tau PET ligands and image analysis techniques continue to be developed and tested. A need exists to make tau PET ligands more widely available for clinical tri - als, and to find ligands that are suitable for the investigation of non -AD tauopathies. A major impediment to the use of CSF bio - markers of AD has been substantial measure - ment variability among different samples and laboratories. In 2016, Bittner et al. demon - strated the ability of an automated Elecsys assay to measure A42 levels with much less variability, setting the stage to improve the standardization, precision, power and com - parability of A 42 and other CSF biomarkers in research and clinical settings8. CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels have provided an indicator of axonal injury in several neurological disorders. In a study reported in 2016, Basioglu et al. found elevated CSF and blood NfL levels in mouse models and humans with A, tau and -sy nuclein pathologies9. The authors sug - gest that blood NfL levels could provide an accessible way to monitor disease progres - sion and treatment effects in individuals with protein-based neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging investigational treatments and biomarker developments (TABLE 1) have the potential to revolutionize the understanding, treatment and prevention of AD.

The field of movement disorders \u2014 a group of neurological conditions that manifest as hypokinetic or hyperkinetic disorders and other disorders of motor control \u2014 includes many areas of immense growing interest. In this update on the most notable advances in this field in 2016, I have chosen to highlight three of these areas: Parkinson disease, hyperkinetic movement disorders and essential tremor. 2017 marks the 200th anniversary of James Parkinson's Essay on the Shaking Palsy . Since its publication, much progress has been made in the characterization of the motor and non - motor clinical phenomenology of Parkinson disease (PD), development of effective medical and surgical treatment, and better understanding of possible mechanisms of neurodegeneration that underlie the disease. Nevertheless, many questions remain. In a Nature supplement in October 2016 (REF. 1), four big questions were posed: how does PD begin, what is the role of -synuclein protein, what is the role of the gut in PD, and what is the best way to divide people with the disease into subtypes? Research published in 2016 has addressed some of these questions. Increasingly appreciated is that nonmotor features of PD contribute to overall disabil - ity more than do the typical motor features, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. Consequently, in addition to the traditional subtypes of PD \u2014 tremor-dominant PD and postural instability-gait 2 \u2014 new subtypes are being recognized, includ - ing those based on nonmotor symptoms3. Although some clinical and pathological over - lap might exist between the subtypes, cogni - tive and autonomic impairments are more commonly associated with the non m otor forms of PD, consistent with the presence of more- s evere and widespread dopaminergic and nondopaminergic pathology, even outside the CNS. Three important studies published in 2016 have added to the evidence for non m otor, extra-CNS manifestations of PD, with impor - tant implications. In one study of mice that overexpressed -synuclein, removing the nor - mal gut microflora \u2014 either by raising the mice in a germ-free environment or by treating them with antibiotics \u2014 markedly reduced brain - s ynuclein pathology, inflammation, and motor deficits4. These pathological and behav - ioural abnormalities worsened, however, when the mice were inoculated with faecal bacteria taken from patients with PD. These findings suggest that gut bacteria influence CNS cellular mechanisms and regulate movement. This hypothesis is supported by a second study, which showed that the gut microbiota was altered in 34 patients with PD compared with 34 healthy controls 5. These alterations in the enteric nervous system in patients with PD might contribute to early gastrointestinal dys - motility (for example, delayed gastric emptying and constipation), and might have therapeu - tic implications \u2014 for example, modification of gut microbiota could alleviate symptoms of PD and prevent disease progression. The third study that was related to extra- CNS manifestations of PD examined the involvement of the skin in PD. This study enrolled 28 patients with PD and 23 healthy controls 6. Skin biopsy samples were taken from multiple sites, and deposition of pilo - motor and sudomotor -synuclein was quan - tified. All patients with PD had significantly higher cutaneous -s ynuclein deposition than control participants, which distinguished the two groups with a sensitivity and specificity of >90%. If confirmed by other studies, the Key advances Gut microbiota has been shown to differ between patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and healthy controls4 Deposition of -synuclein in skin biopsy samples in patients with PD suggests that cutaneous deposits could provide a pathological biomarker of the disease6 A novel association between mutation of the TMEM230 gene and PD suggests that impaired synaptic vesicle trafficking is a mechanism that underlies neurodegeneration7 The approval of the dopamine-depleting drugs deutetrabenazine valbenazine for hyperkinetic movement disorders is expected in 2017 following a positive trial 8 Treatment of essential tremor with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy has produced encouraging results 10, but longitudinal studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 64 NEUROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

All rights reserved.finding of cutaneous -synuclein deposition in sympathetic adrenergic nerve pili muscles, and in sudomotor (sympathetic cholinergic) nerve fibres, could lead to the development of a diagnostic biomarker of PD. Converging evidence suggests that - s ynuclein pathology starts in the colon and skin before spreading to the olfactory bulb and caudal brainstem, progressing through the brainstem and the diencephalon until it eventually reaches the cortex. The three stud- ies discussed above support this hypothesis, but the concept of prion-like spreading of pathology in patients with neurodegenera - tive disease has been described as \"the most controversial question in the field right now\" (REF. 1). The notion that toxic -synuclein is a major culprit in neuro d egeneration is now being translated into early-phase clinical trials of anti --synuclein therapeutic strategies. The 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Y oshinori Ohsumi for his discov - eries of the mechanisms of autophagy, and impairment of autophagy and the ubiquitin- proteasome system continues to be the leading theory for cell death. However, an important new mechanism of neuro d egeneration in PD was proposed in 2016. In a family with an autosomal dominant form of PD, Deng et al. 7 discovered a novel PD -related mutation in the TMEM230 gene, which - brane protein in neuronal synaptic vesicles. This finding needs to be replicated in other populations, but we postulate that muta - tions in the TMEM230 gene impair synaptic vesicle trafficking and recycling, ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration and a typical PD phenotype.In the field of hyperkinetic movement disorders, a trial published by the Huntington Study Group in 2016 (REF. 8) is expected to lead to approval of a new dopamine-depleting drug. In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs that deplete presyn - aptic dopamine by inhibiting vesicular mono- amine transporter type 2 (VMAT2; FIG. 1 ) seem to be safer and carry little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. The VMAT2 inhibitor tetrabena - zine is approved by the FDA for treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD), and is commonly used to treat not only chorea but also other hyperkinetic movement disorders, such as tics and stereotypies. Since the approval of tetrabenazine, other VMAT2 inhibitors, such as deutetrabenazine and val - benazine, have been studied in the treatment of HD-related chorea, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome9. In the Huntington Study Group trial8, 90 patients with HD were randomly allocated to receive deutetrabenazine ( n = 45) or placebo (n = 45). Deutetrabenazine and placebo were titrated to the optimal dosage and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1 -week washout period. The difference in maximal chorea scores on the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale was 2.5 units in favour of deutetra - benazine; this effect was significant (P < 0.001) and was considered to be clinically meaning - ful. Significant improvements were also seen in secondary end points. The rates of adverse events were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo. Deutetrabenazine and valbenazine promise to be at least as effective as tetrabena - zine, but with a lower risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, insomnia, depression, par - kinsonism and akathisia, and an improved pharmacokinetic profile such that administra - tion once or twice daily is possible, instead of three times daily. Finally, 2016 saw an important develop - ment in the treatment of essential tremor with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy (FUT). In a multinational trial, 66 patients with essential tremor that persisted despite optimal medical therapy were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive FUT or a sham procedure 10. The patients' tremor was assessed with the 32-point Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor by an independent group of neurologists who were blinded to the treatments. A between-group difference of 8.3 points (95% CI 5.9-10.7, P < 0.001) in t he mean change from baseline favoured FUT over the sham procedure. FUT seems to be less invasive than thala - mic deep brain stimulation and the results are encouraging, but adverse events were common: 36% of the patients treated with FUT developed gait disturbances, and 36% experienced paraesthesias after the treatment. These adverse effects persisted at 12 months in 9% and 14% of patients, respectively. Long- term studies are needed to confirm the results, although many patients with essential tremor and PD are already requesting this proce-dure because, in contrast to DBS, it does not involve drilling of burr holes, or placement of intracerebral electrodes or a subcutaneous pulse generator. These important developments in move - ment disorders in 2016 highlight several advances, including an improved under - standing of the pathogenesis of PD and some novel theories about the role of gut microbiota and the enteric-CNS interac - tion. New VMAT2 inhibitors will probably be approved in 2017 for the treatment of chorea and tardive dyskinesia, but are also likely to be used for the treatment of other hyperkinetic movement disorders. In addi - tion to immune anti -- s ynuclein therapies, immunomodulation of autoimmune move - ment disorders, such as anti-NMDA recep - tor encephalitis, is emerging as an important therapeutic strategy.

Effect of deutetrabenazine on chorea among patients with Huntington Key advances In pooled analyses of trials on endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke, the number needed to treat to improve by at least one level on the modified Rankin Scale was 2.6 (REFS 1,2) These analyses also showed that the beneficial effects of endovascular treatment declined with longer times between stroke onset and groin puncture, but remained statistically significant through to 7 h 18 min (REFS 1,2) In patients with a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor ischaemic stroke seen at dedicated TIA clinics, the risk of a new stroke after 3 months was 3.7% 4 \u2014 less than half the figure reported 15 years ago A substudy of the CHANCE trial showed that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel was not superior to aspirin alone in carriers of mutations that reduced the ability to metabolize clopidogrel Ten modifiable risk factors, which account for >90% of the global burden of stroke, were identified 8 STROKE IN 2016 Stroke is treatable, but prevention is the key Ale Algra and Marieke J. H. Wermer The past 2 years have seen major breakthroughs in endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. As highlighted in 2016, we now need to refine the logistics for delivery of this treatment, including patient selection. We should not forget, however, that it is better to prevent strokes in the first place. In 2015, five ground-breaking trials shook up the stroke community by providing the eagerly awaited evidence for effectiveness of endovas - cular recanalization therapy in acute ischaemic stroke. In 2016, after the dust had settled, it was time for reflection and refinement. In the HERMES collective, the investiga - tors of five randomized trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REV ASCAT, SWIFT PRIME and EXTEND -IA) joined forces and performed meta-analyses with individual patient data. The aim was to investigate treatment effects over time and in prespecified subgroups 1,2. Data from 1,287 patients with proximal ante - rior artery occlusions were pooled, and the primary outcome was reduced disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. Overall, endovascular treatment reduced disability at 90 days (common odds ratio (cOR) 2.49, 95% CI 1.76-3.53). The number of patients needed to treat to improve by at least one level on the mRS was only 2.6. A favourable effect was present in all prede - fined subgroups, including patients older than 80 years of age, those who underwent randomization more than 5 h a fter symptom onset, and patients not eligible for intrave - nous alteplase1. The odds of better outcomes declined with longer time windows from symptom onset to groin puncture, with cORs of 2.79 (95% CI 1.96-3.98) at 3 h, 1.98 (95% CI 1.98 at 6 h, a nd 1.57 (95% CI 0.86- 2.88) at 8 h. T he treatment effect remained statistically significant through to 7 h 18 min.These findings not only show the broad applicability of endovascular treatment, but also emphasize that the 'time is brain' concept holds for thrombectomy. Implementation of thrombectomy will have global implications for the structure of care systems that aim to provide timely treatment to patients with acute ischaemic stroke. One-third of the patients in the trials were transferred from primary stroke centres to advanced interven - tion centres, highlighting the need to formu - late decision rules to predict the presence of large-vessel occlusions, so as to decide which patients to transfer 3. The symptom-to -groin or door - to - groin time will be a new target to monitor quality of care. Within the chain, all processes in the transport of the patient from home to the angiography suite need to be streamlined. Simple time registration systems based on Bluetooth technology might aid tun - ing of these multiple steps. Extension of the time window for treatment will increase the number of patients who can be treated and enable implementation of the treatment in rural areas. The HERMES results suggest that treatment up to 8 h a fter stroke onset is bene - ficial, but the number of patients in the time window beyond 6 h was too small to draw firm conclusions, hence, further study of the 6-8 h t ime interval is warranted. A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor ischaemic stroke is a harbinger of a new vascu - lar \u2014 in particular, cerebrovascular \u2014 event. This risk is especially high in the initial days to weeks after the event. In a cohort study pub - lished in 2016, the TIAregistry.org Investigators enrolled 4,789 patients with a TIA or minor ischaemic stroke 4. The participants were seen by a stroke specialist at one of 61 sites in 21 countries worldwide. Sites were selected if they had a dedicated system in which patients with a TIA could be seen urgently. The risk of stroke was found to be 2.1% at 1 week, 3.7% at 3 months and 5.1% at 1 year. The 1 -year risk of any vascular event (stroke, acute coro - nary syndrome or vascular death) was slightly higher at 6.2%. A high ABCD2 score, large- artery sclerosis and multiple infarcts at brain imaging each doubled the risk of a new stroke. The event rates in TIAregistry.org are considerably lower than estimates from studies around the turn of the millennium, which reported a 3 -month risk of 12-20% for vascular events. These findings are likely to be explained by earlier and more intensive sec - ondary prevention, including prompt admin - istration of aspirin5 and the use of statins and antihypertensive medication. The CHANCE trial, the results of which were published in 2013, indicated that early use of dual antiplatelet therapy prevents stroke recurrence 6.

All rights reserved.were randomly assigned to aspirin plus clopi - dogrel or aspirin monotherapy. 90 -day stroke recurrence was reduced by 32% with the combination therapy. In 2016, the CHANCE investigators reported an important substudy on three CYP2C19 major alleles that influence the conversion of clopidogrel into its active metabolite in the liver 7. The genetic analysis was carried out in 2,933 patients, 1,726 (59%) of whom were carriers of CYP2C19 variants that reduced their ability to metabolize clopi - dogrel. Among the poor metabolizers, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel was no longer superior to aspirin (relative risk reduc - tion (RRR) 7%, 95% CI who metabolized clopidogrel effi - ciently, combination therapy was even more effective than in the overall trial (RRR 49%, 95% CI 25-65%). A statistically significant interaction of the treatment effect between the two subgroups (P = 0.02) was observed (FIG. 1) . Of note, the CHANCE findings pertain to the Chinese population, in which the prev - alence of CYP2C19 variants affecting clopi- dogrel metabolism is around 60% \u2014 much higher than in European populations, for example, where the prevalence is about 30%. However, if these findings are replicated in non-Chinese populations, they could have important implications for the acute manage - ment of patients with a TIA, and genetic testing might become a part of the armamentarium of the emergency department.Stroke is a global problem, affecting 17 million people each year. The advent of high-tech personalized approaches carries the risk of further increasing the disparities in stroke care between high-income and middle-to -low-income countries. Stroke mortality and disability have decreased over the past decade in high-income countries, but stroke is still the second most common cause of death in low-income countries. The major - ity of people around the world have no access to intravenous alteplase, thrombectomy, stroke unit care or 24 h TI A services, so we should place more emphasis on stroke prevention. In a mega-case-control study of 13,447 patients with a first acute stroke (10,388 with ischaemic stroke and 3,059 with intracere - bral and controls, investigators to iden - tify potentially modifiable stroke risk factors8. Ten such factors were found: hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical activity, diet, psychosocial factors, abdominal obesity, alcohol, cardiac causes, and apolipoproteins. These ten risk factors together account for over 90% of the population attributable risk, and were found to apply to all major regions of the world, as well as all ethnic groups, sexes and ages. These findings were in line with the results of a subanalysis of the Global Burden of Disease study, which focused on stroke in 188 high-income, middle-income and low-income countries from 1990-2013 (REF. 9). In this subanalysis, the population attributable fractions of stroke-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated in rela potentially modifiable environmen- tal, occupational, behavioural, physiological and metabolic risk factors, and in different age and sex groups. Again, over 90% of the global stroke burden was ascribed to modifia - ble risk factors. Importantly, almost one-third of the worldwide burden of stroke was attributed to air pollution. The year 2016 showed us the promising future of high-tech and personalized stroke care, but also taught us not to forget the need for primary stroke prevention. Investments in global prevention programmes are urgently needed to substantially improve health around the globe. To this end, the World Stroke Organisation campaigns with the slo - gan \"stroke is treatable; lives can improve with better awareness, access and action\" (REF. 10).

All rights reserved.This year saw strides forward in all three arms of the tissue engineering triad \u2014 cells, scaf - folds and signalling molecules. Developments in 2016 included the identification of a new stem cell population in fibrocartilage and its signalling pathway, a refined method for 3D bioprinting of collagenous structures with micro-heterogenous domains, and whole-joint tissue resurfacing technology with tunable properties to thwart the effects of an inflammatory environment. There is no doubt that the field of regener - ative medicine has enthusiastically embraced the paradigm-shifting technology of 3D bio - printing. Although there have been important developments in printing geometrically com - plex shapes in the past 3 years, the ability to reproduce the heterogeneous spatial arrange - ment of biologically complex structures has eluded investigators to date. In 2016, Rhee and co-workers demonstrated a bioprint - ing technique to generate constructs with discrete microdomains that exhibit distinct material properties 1. The authors developed a novel 'bioink' with a high-density collagen biogel (10 -fold higher concentration of colla - gen compared with previously studied hydro - gels2) and used a modified build plate that was heated to 37 \u00b0C to enable rapid polymerization of the hydrogel, resulting in improved fidel - ity of the printing process. This novel bioink preparation displayed excellent cell viability with cells starting to align along the collagen fibres in an organized fashion via integrin receptors 1. Using this methodology, cells and collagen fibres can be oriented in specific in culture and then used alone, seeded onto porous scaffolds or delivered by hydrogel. An alternative strategy is to recruit endogenous stem cells, which obviates the need for stem cell isolation, culture and delivery. A 2016 article by Embree and co-workers 4 details the discov - ery of a new population of fibrocartilage stem cells (FCSCs) located in the superficial zone of the condyles of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The authors convincingly demon - strated the generation of cartilage, bone and haematopoietic marrow from a single FCSC. This finding suggests the potential use of cul-ture-expanded FCSCs for cell-based therapies for fibrocartilage structures. Embree et al. 4 further showed that the maintenance and phe - notypic status of FCSCs is regulated through the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, and that the Wnt signalling inhibitor sclerostin main-tain the FCSC population and joint homeosta - sis. They demonstrated in another experiment the ability of FCSCs to be chondroprotective in a rabbit model of TMJ degeneration 4. Fibrocartilage structures in the body in - clude not only the TMJ but also the menis - cus, vertebral discs, and tendon-to -bone enthesis; options for the treatment of injury to these structures are limited. The study by Embree et al. 4 suggests sclerostin might have use as a potential therapeutic in fibrocartilage degeneration through its effects on resident FCSCs. Whether the resident population of stem cells in the superficial zone of hyaline cartilage, which makes up other joints such as the knee and hip, will respond to a thera-peutic such as sclerostin remains to be seen 5. If so, this approach would be broadly appli - cable to degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. The recruitment of endogenous stem cells is an attractive strategy for the treat - ment of cartilage injuries and the character - ization of FCSCs by Embree and colleagues 4 is an important next step in developing this directions to resist the tensile and circum-ferential forces found in the meniscus. This technology marks a step closer to biomimetic replication of the micro-cytoarchitecture of complex collagen structures. Importantly, the mechanical properties of the bioink produced by Rhee et al. 1 are superior to those of other hydrogel bioinks currently available for printing soft tissues such as carti-lage 3, thus marking progress towards the devel - opment of constructs capable of load-bearing. This report signals the first demonstration of successful bioprinting of constructs that repli - cate the complex microarchitecture of the knee meniscus, which has organized collagen bun-dles in load-oriented geometries. Ultimately, heterogeneous 3D -pr inted constructs could have applications in a number of other mus - culoskeletal tissues such as articular cartilage, which contains discrete layered zones with differing material properties and Benninghoff arcades (the unique cytoarchitecture of oriented collagen). Tissue engineering strategies have tradi - tionally relied on the use of cells, whether fully differentiated or stem cells, that are expanded REGENERATIVE MEDICINE IN 2016 Important milestones on the way to clinical translation Daniel A. Grande Regenerative medicine can be viewed as 'tissue engineering V2.0'. Discoveries and novel applications of technology advanced the field considerably in 2016, with the use of new biomaterials, stem cells and biologically active molecules. Key advances 3D bioprinting can produce biomimetic constructs that replicate the complex microarchitecture of the knee meniscus1 A resident population of fibrocartilage stem cells could be exploited for cartilage regeneration and repair via manipulation of the Wnt signaling pathway 4 The combination of gene therapy and tissue engineering can produce both cell-based and acellular engineered constructs with tunable and inducible anticytokine effects 9 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 68 RHEUMATOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This group had pre - viously demonstrated the recruitment of endogenous stem cells using an anatomically shaped scaffold loaded with transforming growth factor (TGF) 3 to induce chon - drogenesis and chemo at tract mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), resulting in hyaline carti - lage resurfacing6. The new data published in 2016 suggest a similar population of FCSCs might exist in the meniscus 4, which is one of the more difficult structures to repair with orthopaedic surgery. The applications for tissue engineering technologies have now progressed beyond the treatment of focal cartilage defects to that of entire joint surfaces using novel woven scaffolds seeded with cells (either differenti - ated chondrocytes or stem cells). In almost all cartilage repair studies to date, however, little attention has been given to the environment into which an anabolic treatment to restore cartilage is placed. Following damage to the joint there is an increase in inflammatory mediators such as IL -1 and TNF, which could compromise the integrity of a tissue- engineered construct as well as the rest of the joint surface. Additionally, IL -1, w hich is a key player in the aetiology and progression of OA, has been shown to inhibit MSC-based repair of articular cartilage 7,8. Gene therapy using IL -1 r eceptor antagonist (IL -1R a) is promising as a potential therapeutic to coun - ter the effect of IL -1. I n 2016, Moutos et al.9 combined IL -1R a gene therapy with tissue engineering to produce engineered constructs with therapeutic anticytokine effects (FIG. 1) . Moutos and co -wo rkers expanded upon their initial work in developing anatomically designed whole-joint resurfacing techniques 10 by adding the capability to provide anti- inflammatory properties, thus protecting the engineered construct in an inflammatory environment. An advanced textile manu-facturing approach was used to produce orthogonally oriented fibres that provide mechanical functionality immediately upon implantation with patient-specific geom-etries; the gene therapy approach used a scaffold-mediated lentivirus transduction technique to enable controlled delivery of anticytokine therapy 9. The study character - ized the ability of the IL -R a-e xpressing con - structs to inhibit the effects of IL -1 on the development of cartilage in vitro . Such a scaffold-mediated lentivirus trans - duction technique could be used as an acel - lular approach utilizing endogenous stem cells in other joint-resurfacing applications. In addition, this approach could be adapted for other growth factors, such as TGF, which has been shown to be an important morphogen in the recruitment of stem cells and their differentiation toward cartilage in other acellular models of scaffold-based car - tilage repair 6. This method of transduction results in high titres of anticytokine therapy in an exogenously tunable and inducible manner. The of textile manu - facturing and scaffold-mediated lentiviral transduction provides a tissue engineer - ing strategy for total-joint resurfacing. The ability of the gene construct to self-regulate the production of IL -1R a in response to variations in IL -1 c oncentration within the synovial environment \u2014 that is, acting as a feedback mechanism \u2014 as well as the use of multiple morphogens in combination to simultaneously provide vigorous support to the cartilage layer would be substantial enhancements of this system. Key chal - lenges to the clinical translation of this tech - nology include determining how well this resurfacing approach will perform in vivo, whether this construct will integrate with the subchondral bone to form a solid base for joint motion, and how complex such a surgery will be to perform. Progress made in 2016 moves the field of regenerative medicine closer to clinical trans - lation. Improved resolution in 3D bioprint - ing foretells the use of off-the-shelf meniscus, obviating the need for allografts. Harnessing the power of FCSCs, for use as allogeneic cell-based therapies or by exploiting the Wnt pathway with sclerostin or a small-molecule analogue, could present promising therapies for difficult-to -treat fibrocartilage injury. Finally, the concept of providing a whole-joint tissue-engineering solution, rather than treating only cartilage injury, reaches a new level of sophistication with constructs capable of thwarting the effects of an inflammatory environment. Challenges remain but can be met by careful and continued refinement of these developments. Daniel A.

However, the most important feature of these 'omics' analyses is their usefulness in the clin - ical setting, in particular for the stratification of patients into clinical groups that might be amenable to personalized therapies and for future studies on the pathophysiology of the disease. We believe that three papers in particular from 2016 have provided new and impor - tant information on potential mechanisms behind the type I interferon (IFN) signature in SLE (FIG 1). Two studies investigated dif - ferences in the expression of the type I IFN signature across diseases and cell types 1,2. The third study went further; based on modular analysis, the authors stratified patients with SLE according to relevant biological features involved in disease activity patterns 3. This study represents the first attempt to uncover the real complexity of SLE beyond the type I IFN signature. De Jong et al. 1 analysed the type I IFN signature in several diseases, including SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory idio pathic myopathies and multiple sclerosis. Type I IFN responses were analysed according to whether they were IFN-related or IFN-related and by the degree of involvement of each type I IFN. The authors used blood from patients with multiple sclerosis receiv-ing IFN therapy as the reference for the IFN signature and blood from patients with SLE for the IFN response. Patients from both reference groups who had a positive mechanisms of initiation of such responses if they could be linked to specific types of ini - tiating viral infections or other intracellular inducers. From this work it is clear that SLE is an IFN and not an IFN disease. Flint et al. 2 also investigated the type I IFN signature, primarily looking for differences in the type of signature expressed by various cell types (neutrophils, CD4 + T cells, CD8+ T cells and monocytes) across four different immune-mediated conditions, including SLE, and healthy individuals. These authors used weighted gene expression network anal-ysis (WGCNA), which identifies gene mod - ules in the data based on co -expression (a method widely used after the publication of Chaussabel et al. in 2008 (REF. 6)). Once mod - ules were obtained, one of them was selected for each cellular population as the most rep - resentative type I IFN signature based on gene composition, correlation with SLE diagnosis and correlation with a 21 -gene core type I IFN signature expression profile. An extensive analysis of the 1,288 genes within the selected modules (1,150 unique to myeloid subsets and only 11 unique to T cells) was then per - formed to compare between diseases and cellular populations. Examining the median expression of the type I IFN core genes (67 genes shared by the four modules), most of them were found to be highly expressed in myeloid cells and neutrophils, whereas only a few of them had increased expres - sion in T cells. However, high expression of the T -c ell-specific modules seemed to be an exclusive feature of patients with SLE, unlike monocyte-specific and neutrophil-specific modules, which presented similar expression levels across other diseases and controls. As the authors discuss, the similar neutrophil type I IFN signature across conditions seems to be concordant with the importance of basal type I IFN signalling in maintaining myeloid populations, whereas it does not seem to be necessary in T cells. On the other hand, the specific expression of T-cell modules in patients with SLE (in agreement with findings type I IFN signature were then selected (patients expressed an average of 23 inter - feron response genes, which is 2.5-4 times higher than the average for healthy indi - viduals), and unsupervised clustering was performed, followed by differential expres-sion analysis. In this way, the authors could differentiate between the groups of patients and were able to define IFN and IFN sig - natures in these groups. Two scores were constructed based on the average expression of IFN and IFN signalling genes: a -A:GC -B log ratio was used in the analy si s of the remaining dis - eases. Interestingly, in untreated patients with multiple sclerosis and inflammatory idiopathic myopathies, a dominance of the GC-A score was observed (although there was important heterogeneity in patients with multiple sclerosis, some of whom also had a GC -B score), whereas in patients with RA, both scores were equally involved. The authors have previously identified a baseline type I IFN signature that is related to unre - sponsiveness to IFN treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis 4, and a similar phe - nomenon has been observed in patients with RA who are unresponsive to anti-TNF treatment 5. This study attempts for the first time to dissect the type I IFN signature within and across diseases, providing some hints regarding the pathophysiology of the type I IFN signature itself, and suggesting the existence of not just one, but at least two type I IFN signatures. The authors' sugges - tion of differential signalling in individuals having the GC -A versus the GC -B cluster seems reasonable, and might shed light on the SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS IN 2016 Gene expression profiling comes closer to the clinic Guillermo Barturen and Marta E. Alarc\u00f3n-Riquelme Gene expression profiling has been used for the first time to stratify patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) into potentially useful clinical groups, and also to further understand differences in the cell-specificity and nature of the interferon signature typical of SLE and other autoimmune diseases.

In summary, this paper suggests the existence of genes that dif - ferentially regulate the type I IFN signalling pathway in what seems to be a cell-type and disease-specific manner. Banchereau et al. 3 identified patient-specific co-expressed gene modules by means of the WGCNA method, using longitudinal gene expression data from paediatric patients with SLE. Interestingly, when these modules were correlated with SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) and expression profiles were projected on to the Chaussabel modules 6, seven groups of patients were revealed, corresponding to five immune signatures that differed from each other in terms of the types of cellular mechanisms involved: lymphoid, erythro - poiesis, plasma cell, neutrophil/myeloid, and type I IFN signatures. An interesting question arises in relation to the study by Flint et al. 2, as Banchereau et al.3 found T -c ell-associated modules to be underexpressed in patients with SLE. No differences were observed across the groups in terms of demographic parameters, with the exception of one group in which all patients had lupus nephritis that corre - lated with the type I IFN, neutrophil and plasmablast-associated modules 3. The patients in this group had anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and severe disease. In addition, the neutrophil and type I IFN signatures cor - related strongly with development of lupus nephritis and were modified by mycophenolate mofetil treatment, particularly in patients with proliferative rather than membranous glomerulonephritis. Importantly, grouping patients in this way might serve as a basis for personalized treat - ment, and could be used for drug repurpos - ing analysis. Stratifying patients could help to identify if there are indeed differential patho - physiological pathways behind the different transcriptional profiles and cell types, and if these pathways can be modulated by specific drugs. However, some questions persist; first, can these groups be validated in adult patients with SLE? Another concern is predictability of the groups without the need for long- term follow -up of patients; correlations with other sources of information (that is, serum cytokine levels) could serve as a basis to iden - tify new biomarkers of transcriptional group prediction. Nevertheless, this work is the first attempt to stratify patients with SLE using longi - tudinal transcriptional data3. Validation and reproducibility of the data \u2014 as well as the use of predictive measurements through the use of simple analysis algorithms \u2014 will be of utmost importance before these results can be used in the clinical setting. Autoimmune diseases have several com - mon features and one of them is the presence, at least in some patients, of a type I IFN signa - ture, for which SLE is the main representative disease. The detailed dissection of this signa - ture and implicated cell populations begins to reveal differences and commonalities across diseases. Multi-omics integrated approaches using systems medicine will enable recogni - tion or even re -classification of autoimmune diseases in molecular terms and redefine the use of existing therapies and the design of new ones.

The pathogenesis of fibrosis in SSc remains elusive. Furthermore, although patients with SSc experience fibrosis in multi - ple organs synchronously, whether fibrosis in different organs is driven by the same or dif - ferent cells and pathways is unclear. Indeed, the specialized architecture of these organs, and the distinct organ-specific relationships between the vasculature, stroma, lining epi - thelium and adipose tissue depots, suggest that unique mechanisms, signalling cues and cell-cell communications might underlie organ- specific fibrosis. Several studies published in 2016 have identified dermal white adipose tis - sue (dW AT) as a new adipose depot and high-light the existence of mechanistic links between cutaneous adipogenesis and fibrogenesis 1-3. dW AT is a unique adipose tissue that lies within the skin, is distinct from subcutaneous (also called hypodermal) adipose tissue, and seems to be required for skin barrier function. Loss of this tissue, which is a prominent feature of human SSc (FIG. 1 ) as well as mouse models of the disease, adversely affects skin homeosta-sis and promotes dermal fibrosis. These new insights, coupled with reports of sustained clinical benefit from adipose- de rived stem cell (ADSC) therapy (auto lo gous fat grafting) in SSc, draw attention to the role of white adi - pose tissue (W AT) in skin fibrosis and could have broad therapeutic implications. The dW AT story begins in the 1970s, when dermatologist Raul Fleischmajer described atrophy of intradermal adipose tissue and its replacement by collagen-rich fibrous tissue as consistent features of SSc 4, leading him to spec- ulate that fat loss might represent a key patho-genic event. Although this astute observation remains unchallenged, little research has been carried out to elucidate the nature and signifi - cance of dermal fat loss. During the past 5 years, atrophy of dermal adipose tissue accompany - ing skin fibrosis has been highlighted in various promotes systemic adipogenesis, including der - mal adipose tissue expansion, at the expense of skin fibrosis 7. Intradermal adipocytes dis- play unusually rapid growth kinetics, which explains the ability of dW AT to undergo swift expansion (hyperplasia) in response to cold stress or bacterial challenge, as well as during wound healing and the hair cycle 8. In view of the growing recognition of the importance of dW AT in skin barrier function, and its atrophy in skin fibrosis, there is considerable interest in approaches to measure and visualize this depot. In 2016, Kasza et al. 1 described non- invasive MRI-based imaging strategies for quantitating dW AT in mice and humans. Using MRI, the authors were able to visualize dW AT and demonstrate a strong correlation between dW AT thickness determined by imaging and by direct histologic assay. The MRI technique also demonstrated expansion of dW AT in mice treated with a high-fat diet, highlighting the sen - sitivity of this approach to monitoring change and its potential utility for longitudinal studies. A similar imaging strategy was applied to ten healthy human subjects in a small pilot study. The results showed that skin-associated fat was highly variable and showed no correlation with BMI or sex. Interestingly, a correlation between the thickness of skin-associated fat with self-reported temperature preference was noted, with those preferring warmer tempera - tures paradoxically having a thicker layer of fat 1. What triggers adipocyte attrition and dW AT involution during skin fibrosis, and how might this process contribute to pathogenesis in SSc? To address these questions Mastrogiannaki et al. 2 generated transgenic mice in which platelet-derived growth factor receptor - positive (PDGR+) progenitor cells expressed constitutively active \u00df-catenin. The Wnt- \u00df-catenin pathway is of particular interest as it mouse models of SSc. Time-course studies established that loss of dermal adipocytes, cou - pled with down re gulation of such as fatty acid-binding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 2 (PPAR2) adiponectin in the skin, actually preceded histological or biochemical evidence of fibrosis, suggesting that dW AT involution represents an early and possibly primary event in dermal fibrosis 5. W AT is made up of unilocular adipocytes and the so -ca lled stromal secrete adipokines, whereas ADSCs have regenerative capacity and give rise to adipo - cytes and other mesenchymal lineages. W AT is organized into distinct depots throughout the body. In mice, dW AT is readily recognized as a discrete layer of fat cells situated between the dermis and the panniculus carnosus muscle, whereas in humans (who lack panniculus car - nosus), dW AT is found in pilosebacious units called dermal cones 6. Like other W AT depots, dW AT is rich in progenitor cells that give rise to adipocytes or dermal reticular via cell-fate decisions regulated by PPAR. Indeed, pharmacological PPAR activation in mice SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS IN 2016 Dermal white adipose tissue implicated in SSc pathogenesis John Varga and Roberta G.

However, the production of antibodies to self-proteins characterizes many autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The formation of germinal centres (GCs) and interaction with T helper cells are crucial for B-cell activation and the production of anti - bodies to aid the clearance of infections. The gut \u2014 with help from diverse gut microbi - ota \u2014 has an important role in this process; maintaining homeo st asis and protecting the body from pathogens by secreting IgA anti - bodies. Studies of RA in humans and exper - imental models of arthritis have revealed an association between RA and gut micro bi ota1,2, MICROBIOME IN 2016 T follicular helper cells and the gut microbiome in arthritis Veena Taneja Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an expansion of certain gut commensals, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In 2016, studies using experimental models of arthritis have begun to unravel the links between the gut microbiota, T follicular helper cells and arthritis.Key advances Novel MRI imaging approaches can accurately quantitate intradermal adipose tissue in mice and in humans 1 Expression of Wnt-\u00df-catenin in fibroblast progenitor cells disrupts adipocyte differentiation and permits emergence of fibrotic cells in the skin 2 Adipocyte progenitor cells within the dermis are required to limit fibrosis, are lost during the development of skin fibrosis, and depend on local dendritic cells for their continued survival 3 is implicated in SSc pathogenesis and drives fibroblast activation while blocking adipocyte differentiation. The transgenic mice expressing \u00df-catenin in PDGR + progenitor cells showed attrition of the dW AT layer and a correspond - ing increase in fibrotic dermis2. Ex vivo , stem cell cells expressing constitutively active \u00df-catenin showed impaired adipocyte differ - entiation. These observations are consistent with earlier reports demonstrating attrition of dW AT and its replacement by fibrotic tissue in transgenic mice expressing Wnt10b in FABP4 + progenitor cells9, indicating that suppression of adipogenesis by Wnt-\u00df-catenin promotes emergence of fibrotic fibroblasts and replace - ment of dermal adipose tissue with fibrotic tissue. As PPAR is the master regulator of adipogenesis and required for adipocyte dif - ferentiation, it seems likely that the suppres - sion of PPAR by \u00df-catenin accounts for the switch from adipocytic to fibroblastic cell fate in the skin. Comparable adipocytic-fibrogenic cell-fate switches can occur during fibrosis in hepatic stellate cells, dermal adipocytes and lung lipofibroblasts, indicating that this phe - nomenon is not restricted to the skin 5,9,10. It is reasonable to speculate that cirrhosis, SSc and pulmonary fibrosis in humans might similarly be associated with an adipocyte-to -fibroblast cell-fate switch. Further insights into the fate of dermal progenitor cells in fibrosis have come from an elegant study by Lu and colleagues 3. These investigators defined a population of SCA1+ ADSCs within dW AT in mice and showed that their numbers markedly declined during skin fibrosis. Intradermal adipose atrophy was paralleled by an increase in dermal thickness and accumulation of SCA1 + myofibroblasts. Survival of the remaining ADSCs in fibrotic skin was maintained by CD11b + dendritic cells via lymphotoxin-\u00df and downstream integrin activation. Moreover, when mice with skin fibrosis were injected intradermally with ADSCs in combination with lymphotoxin-\u00df receptor stimulation, the injected ADSCs showed enhanced engraftment and survival, and dW AT loss and dermal fibrosis were ameliorated 3. These findings focus attention on dW AT as a newly recognized, distinct adipose depot that is relevant to skin biology, and suggest that intact dermal adipogenesis and healthy dW AT are required to restrain skin fibrosis. Important questions about the anti-fibrotic role of 'nor - mal' dW AT remain to be clarified; for instance, whether it is attributable to secreted adipokines that act via paracrine mechanisms to inhibit myofibroblast differentiation, to the preferen - tial differentiation into anti-fibrotic adipocytes rather than fibrotic myofibroblasts, to maintenance of the population of regenerative and reparative ADSCs within dW AT, or \u2014 most likely \u2014 to a combination of these factors. Nevertheless, these reports open a new door for exploring skin fibrosis in SSc and related conditions, and might have implications for fibrosis in the liver and the lung. Moreover, these studies suggest novel targets for preventing or reversing fibro - sis, including pharmacological enhancement of PPAR function and other strategies to dis-rupt the differentiation of ADSCs into fibrotic myofibroblasts.

SFB Non-pathogenic commensals Pathogenic/opportunistic bacteria Laminapropria cell B cell providing impetus for researchers to define the mechanisms involved. Research from 2016 unveiled a requirement for gut microbiota in the differentiation of T follicular helper (T FH) cells, leading to GC formation, autoantibody production and development of experimental arthritis. The K/B\u00d7N mouse model represents a well-studied model of antibody-mediated autoimmune arthritis that is dependent on gut microbiota, particularly segmented fil-amentous bacteria (SFB) 3. Type 17 T helper (TH17) cells and autoantibodies are thought to have important roles in this and many other experimental models of arthritis. However, treatment with anti -IL-17 monoclonal anti - bodies in patients with RA has not shown much efficacy 4, prompting research efforts to define the role of other types of T cells in RA pathogenesis. In 2016, Teng and co-workers 5 demonstrated that TFH cells are required for SFB-dependent arthritis in a K/B\u00d7N model. T FH cells express CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR) 5, B -cell lymphoma T -c ell co timulator, programmed cell death protein 1, the cytoplasmic adap - tor protein SH2 domain-containing protein 2A (also known as SLAM-associated protein (SAP)) and cytoplasmic IL -21. A doptive transfer of T cells from a Cxcr5/ mouse into Tcra/ (T-c ell-deficient) B\u00d7N mice caused the development of mild arthritis, regardless of whether the Tcra / B\u00d7N mice were colo - nized with SFB or not5. The development of mild arthritis in these mice was attributed to the inability of T FH cells from Cxcr5/ mice to migrate to systemic lymphoid tis - sues. Interestingly, the presence of SFB was required for the differentiation of T FH cells in Peyer's patches and the development of arthritis, as SFB-negative mice did not develop arthritis. Teng et al. 5 further showed that SFB- induced TFH cells in Peyer's patches exit the gut and produce antigen-specific antibodies systemically, which are essential for the devel - opment of arthritis. However, cognate T -c ell receptor recognition of SFB antigens was not required for SFB-mediated differentiation of T FH cells in Peyer's patches, suggesting a non-antigen-specific role for SFB. The work of Teng et al. 5 provides evidence that the induction of TH17 and TFH cells occurs before the onset of experimental arthritis, which is important in relation to RA in humans as preclinical systemic autoimmunity proceeds the clinical onset of RA. Although much of the work on animal models of arthritis sup - ports a causal role for T H17 cells in the onset of disease, this study showed that TFH cells are also important5. Notably, IL -6 i s required for the induction of both TH17 and TFH cells, and targeting IL -6 in patients with RA has been a successful approach. In another study from 2016, Block and co-workers6 confirmed a role for gut micro - biota in the differentiation of TFH cells and the formation of GCs, as the depletion of gut microbiota in mice by the use of antibiotics reduced the number of T FH cells and levels of antibody production. In this study, TFH were shown to have a more crucial role in arthritis development than T H17 cells. IL -17-d eficient K/B\u00d7N mice developed arthritis and had nor - mal GCs and TFH cells; however, the presence of SFB was required for arthritis development as treatment with antibiotics prevented the devel- opment of arthritis in both IL -17-d eficient and IL-17-s ufficient mice. Transfer of splenocytes from mice that lacked BCL6 (a transcription factor necessary for the differentiation of T FH cells) in their CD4+ T cells into mice lacking T cells led to low levels of antibody produc - tion, but no arthritis6. These results highlight the contribution made by TFH cells in helping B cells during antibody production and arthri - tis development. This study6, in contrast to the work of Teng et al.5, suggests that TH17 cells are dispensable in a K/B\u00d7N model if the right intestinal microbiota is available to drive the differentiation of T FH cells. The differences in the results of these two studies could be caused by the timing of the experiments, as Teng et al. looked at that presence of T H17 cells before the onset of arthritis5. It is possible that, in the presence of IL -6, g ut TH17 cells could differen - tiate into TFH cells in this model, leading to the development of GCs as previously suggested7. TFH cells are a heterogeneous population; although both studies discussed above5,6 demonstrate critical roles for TFH cells in arthri- tis development, the exact population that is required was unknown. Chevalier et al. 8 deter - mined which population of TFH cells (CXCR5+ or SAP+) was required for auto an tibody pro - duction and development of arthritis in the K/B\u00d7N model. Adoptive transfer of CD4 + T cells from SAP-deficient KRN mice, but not those from CXCR5 -de ficient KRN mice, into B\u00d7N mice led to abrogation of antibody production and arthritis. Although these observations suggest a requirement for T cell-B cell inter - actions during inflammation, non- co gnate activation of CD4+ T cells could also help to cause arthritis. CD4+ T cells from Cxcr5/ KRN mice transferred into Cd28/ mice did not cause arthritis, whereas co -transfer of CD4+ T cells from Cxcr5/ KRN mice with T cells from complete Freund's adju - vant-immunized Cd28+/+.Ag7+/ mice induced GC formation, antibody production and arthritis in Cd28 / mice8. These observations suggest that environmental factors or infec - tions might cause non-cognate CD4+ T-cell stimulation, leading to GC formation and the production of autoantibodies. Although Chevalier et al. 8 did not study the role of the microbiome, the presence of non-cognate Figure 1 | Gut microbial diversity in an individ\u00ad ual determines the differentiation of T cells into TH17 or TFH cells. Dysbiosis might cause an increase in gut epithelial permeability, enabling the translocation of luminal contents and micro - bial products into the lamina propria. This trans-location can lead to activation of the immune system via cognate and non-cognate presenta-tion of microbial products, and the production of various cytokines (such as IL -17, IL -6, trans - forming growth factor - (TGF ) and IL -21). Type 17 T helper (TH17) cells are required for the clearance of pathogens. In the presence of the appropriate cytokines (IL -6 and IL -21), TH17 cells can differentiate into CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5)-expressing T follicular helper (T FH) cells that help B cells to form germi- nal centres and produce antibodies. CXCR5+ B cells and TFH cells from Peyer's patches migrate away from the gut and systemically produce pathogenic autoantibodies, causing inflamma - tion and immune complex-mediated pathogen-esis. Research published in 2016 suggests T FH cells provide a mechanistic link between the gut microbiota and arthritis 5,6,8.

Last year, yet another new myositis-specific autoantibody (MSA) was identified 6 and clinical pheno- types such as treatment response and tissue sample features began to be characterized in relation to a patient's autoantibody pro - file. Other important steps forward were the results from controlled trials using conven - tional immunosuppressive therapy in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis 7 and looking at the clinical and molecular effects of exercise in combination with immunosuppressive thera-pies in patients with adult myositis 8. Myositis is a heterogeneous group of disor - ders that mainly affect the muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. The standard subclassi - fications of polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion-body myositis (IBM) do not satisfactorily distinguish between clinically or histopathologically distinct subgroups of patients. MSAs, on the other hand, are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and represent an opportunity to improve MYOSITIS IN 2016 New tools for diagnosis and therapy Ingrid E. Lundberg In 2016, there have been several major scientific achievements related to myositis, including the discovery of a novel autoantibody and the relationship between autoantibodies and distinct clinical phenotypes. Advances in the way clinical trials are conducted have also led to breakthroughs in treatment strategies.CD4+ T-c ell and B-cell activation could be due to endogenous activation by microorganisms or infectious agents. Infections have long been thought to precede the onset of arthritis, but conclusive evidence and mechanisms have eluded researchers. T FH cells could provide a link between the occurrence of infections and preclinical autoantibody production (FIG. 1) . The gut contains the largest number of antibody-producing plasma cells in the human body. One can speculate that bacteria that contain proteins orthologous for auto an tigens in various autoimmune diseases might be involved in GC formation and preclinical autoantibody production when T FH cells acti - vate B cells in the gut. Whether these auto - antibodies result in autoimmunity still needs to be investigated. It is conceivable that many commensals carry proteins orthologous for human antigens. The question remains why the presence of these commensals does not result in autoimmunity in healthy individ-uals, or in all individuals who carry genetic susceptibility alleles. One explanation is that T FH cells are stimulated by the gut microbi- ota to differentiate into regulatory or IL -17/ IL-21-p roducing cells9. The studies high - lighted in this article5,6,8 used mouse models of antibody-mediated arthritis. Experimental models that require the adaptive immune sys - tem (such as collagen-induced arthritis) and that use animals carrying arthritis-suscepti - bility genes could provide critical information on the role of T FH cells and the gut microbiota in modulating arthritis. For example, a 2016 study showed that modulation of T FH cells by blocking glucocorticoid-induced TNF recep-tor ameliorated collagen-induced arthritis in mice 10. These observations provide an insight into the role of TFH cells, in addition to TH17 cells, in the pathogenesis of experimental arthritis. The generation of T FH cells and TH17 cells possibly depends upon environmental conditions or microbiota in individuals with different genetic susceptibilities to disease; however, research from 2016 suggests that we need to look more closely into the role of gut microbiota and T FH cells in our hunt for therapeutic strategies.

For example, anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies are associated with clinical amyopathic dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease 1. To address the question of whether prog - nosis varies between patients with different MSA subtypes requires large cohorts of well- characterized patients, followed longitudinally. In 2016, Pinal-Fernandez and colleagues 2 uti- lized one such cohort of patients with myositis, comparing patients with anti-signal recogni-tion particle (SRP) with anti-3-hydroxy-3 -methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies, both of which are associated with necrotizing myo-pathy 3. In this cohort, anti-SRP antibodies were associated with more-pronounced mus - cle weakness and worse prognosis for muscle performance compared with anti-HMGCR antibodies 2. Only 50% of 37 anti-SRP-posi - tive patients reached full or near-full strength after 4 years of treatment in a specialist centre for muscle diseases, with young age at onset being a predictor of poor response to treat - ment 2. Differences in the pattern of muscle involvement, as identified by MRI, between patients with anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies further supports the role of MSAs in subgrouping patients 3. Muscle involvement in patients with anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies differed in the location of inflam - mation in thigh muscle groups and by sever - ity, as measured by degree of oedema, muscle atrophy and fatty replacement 3. Patients with anti-SRP antibodies had more-severe involve - ment of muscles compared with patients with anti-HMGCR antibodies 3. The MRI-identified differences in muscle involvement seen in patients with distinct MSAs suggest that there could be differences in molecular disease pathways in these sub-groups of patients. Different histopathological features are associated with different MSAs, adding evidence to this theory. Following this pattern, muscle biopsies from patients with anti -Jo-1 antibodies (which are directed against histidyl-tRNA synthetase) are necrosis and atrophy 4; and muscle tissue samples from patients with anti -transcription intermediary factor 1 (TIF1; also known as E3 ubiquitin- protein ligase TRIM33) antibodies have more signs of mitochondrial dysfunction than anti-Jo-1-positive patients5. Notably, the MSAs discussed so far target ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic antigens, several of which are involved in protein syn - thesis. The association between these MSAs and the localization of inflammation to skeletal muscles needs further clarification, but the upregulation of some of these auto - antigens in regenerating muscle fibres makes such fibres a possible target for the immune system. However, whether MSAs have a direct role in causing muscle weakness or muscle inflammation remains to be seen. Towards the end of 2015, an MSA, anti- four and a half LIM domains protein 1 (FHL1), was discovered by screening a muscle complementary DNA library with sera from patients with myositis 6. Mutations in FHL1 are associated with severe muscle dystrophies in patients, leading Albrecht et al. 6 to select anti-FHL1 antibodies for further investiga - tion. Interestingly, anti -FHL1 antibodies were present in ~25% of patients with myositis (dermatomyositis, polymyositis and IBM), but not in those with other autoimmune disorders or muscular dystrophies 6. These autoantibodies were associated with a clinical phenotype characterized by muscle atrophy, severe muscle weakness, dysphagia and poor response to immunosuppressive treatment. Anti -FHL1 -positive individuals also had a more severe histopathological pattern overall, compared with anti -FHL1 -negative patients with myositis. Expression of FHL1 was patchy, being seen in aggregate formations in tissue samples from anti -FH L1-po sitive patients, compared with a homogenous pattern of expression in antibody-negative patients or healthy individuals 6. Work in animal models provided evidence for a pathogenic role for anti-FHL1 antibodies in muscle inflamma - tion as myositis-prone mice developed more- severe muscle weakness and histopathology than control mice after immunization with the FHL1 protein 6, but the role of anti -FHL1 antibodies in human myositis needs further exploration.Figure 1 | \u00adspecific autoantibodies and juvenile myositis. Myositis-specific autoantibodies can be subgrouped according to their association with clinical phenotypes. For example, antisynthetase antibodies are associated with myositis, interstitial lung disease, mechanic's hand and arthritis, whereas anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies are associated with interstitial lung disease and dermatomyositis. Anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) antibodies and anti -3-hydroxy-3 (HMGCR) antibodies are associated with necrotizing myopathy, anti-four and a half LIM domains protein 1 (FHL1) antibodies with muscle atrophy, dysphagia and inflammation in the muscle, and anti-cytosolic 5 (cN -1A) transcription intermediary factor 1 . Key advances Myositis-specific autoantibodies, such as anti-FHL1 antibodies, can be used to stratify patients into distinct clinical phenotypes with clearly defined histopathology 5 Combined therapy with glucocorticoids and either methotrexate or ciclosporin is more favourable than treatment with glucocorticoids alone for patients with juvenile dermatomyositis 6 Exercise could be included in treatment regimens alongside conventional therapy without adverse effects 8 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 76 RHEUMATOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Few controlled studies have been performed, and methotrexate, ciclo - sporin and azathioprine (drugs often used in combination with glucocorticoids) have shown no advantage over glucocorticoids alone in adult patients. In light of previous trials, an investigator- ini tiated trial in new- onset juvenile dermatomyositis published in late 2015 represents a landmark in the treatment of myositis 7. This international, multi-centre trial was strongly supported by paediatric investigators around the world. The study included 139 patients with juvenile der - matomyositis and clearly demonstrated the superiority of glucocorticoids in combination with methotrexate or ciclosporin, compared with glucocorticoids alone, on the primary outcome (PRINTO20 response criteria) 7. In addition, combination therapy gave a shorter time to inactive disease. Overall, the combi - nation of glucocorticoids and methotrexate had a more favourable safety profile than glucocorticoids and ciclosporin. This study emphasizes the need for international collab-oration when working with rare diseases like myositis, and will hopefully form the basis of future treatment guidelines. For a long time, exercise was discouraged for patients with myositis due to fears that it would worsen inflammation. However, evi - dence is accumulating that exercise is safe for patients with myositis. In 2016, Munters and colleagues published a clinical trial that showed that exercise has beneficial effects on clinical disease activity and aerobic fitness, as well as affecting muscle tissue on a molecular level 8. The molecular effects of exercise, investigated by use of gene expression analysis and proteo - mics, included an anti-inflammatory response and the promotion of protein synthesis and mitochondrial activity. This research empha - sizes the importance of combining immu - nosuppressive treatment with exercise and implies that mechanisms other than immune- mediated muscle fibre loss might contribute to muscle weakness, and could be reversed by physical activity 8, although the optimal form of exercise still needs to be determined. Advances in myositis this past year have been made possible by standardized, longitu- dinal follow -up studies of large patient cohorts, which are necessary for the identification of differences between antibody- as sociated sub - groups of patients2,3,5. The PRINTO network for juvenile dermatomyositis is another great example of international collaboration lead - ing to a large clinical trial 7. For researchers Chronic musculoskeletal pain remains a sub - stantial challenge in clinical medicine despite the availability of a number of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. In the past 10 years, attention has been focused on nociceptive pain, and in particular on -ne rve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is needed for normal development of the sympa - thetic nervous system and the sensory neurons responsible for nociception and temperature sensation. In individuals with musculo - skeletal pain, treatment with NGF inhibitors can produce impressive improvements in joint pain and physical function; however, mild neurologic adverse events and cases of accelerated arthropathy have been reported in clinical trials, leading to suspension or delay of investigations into these agents. Both pre - clinical and clinical studies are ongoing to assess the mechanisms and effects of this novel effective analgesic treatment, and 2016 saw the publication of some notable results in this area. NGF binds to two receptors on peripheral nociceptors: the high-affinity p75NTR. Binding of NGF to these receptors then activates a signalling pathway of intra - cellular kinases, which can eventually lead to neurite outgrowth and sensitization of the neurons 1. In adults, injection with NGF results in pain, a finding that motivated the develop - ment of a NGF antagonist approach for clinical pain modulation (FIG. 1) . OSTEOARTHRITIS IN 2016 Anti-NGF treatments for pain \u2014 two steps forward, one step back? Nancy E. Lane and Maripat Corr Inhibitors of -nerve growth factor (NGF) have impressive effects in reducing musculoskeletal pain, but have also been associated with adverse events of unclear aetiology. Several studies in the past year have sought to clarify the relative benefits and risks of anti-NGF treatment.interested in adult or juvenile myositis, the International Euromyositis Register9 is a multi- disciplinary international collaboration that invites investigators to participate in research projects and to use the electronic register in the clinic.

All the - clonal antibody tanezumab began around 10 years ago: in a phase I study, patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) reported a signifi - cant and prolonged reduction in knee pain 2. This work was followed by a phase II trial published in 2010 that demonstrated both the efficacy and safety of tanezumab in indi - viduals with moderate to severe knee OA 3. Subsequent phase III studies in patients with painful knee and hip OA assessed the safety and efficacy of tanezumab (alone or in com - bination with NSAIDs), and found that anti-NGF treatment significantly reduced joint or back pain compared with both placebo and NSAIDs 2,3. However, reported adverse events from these clinical trials included osteo necrosis and rapidly progressive OA of the hip, knee and shoulder. The sponsors found that these adverse joint-related events occurred more frequently in patients receiv - ing high-dose tanezumab and concurrent NSAIDs 4. Concerns about joint safety led the FDA to put a partial clinical hold on all anti-NGF trials for 26 months (except termi-nal cancer pain trials), and for an additional 27 months owing to sympathetic nervous system safety concerns. Fast forward to 2016 and new clinical trial data have become available for another anti-NGF antibody, fasinumab, which is in development for the treatment of chronic pain states including OA and low back pain 5. A large phase II-III study with fasinumab, in patients with either knee or hip OA who had inadequate pain relief or who could not tol - erate standard therapies ( n = 419), found that fasinumab (at a dose of 1 mg , 3 mg , 6 mg o r 9 mg) reduced joint pain by >50% and was statistically significantly better than placebo. Adverse effects reported were those expected from other anti-NGF therapies 5. During the Figure 1 | Transmission of pain by NGF . The neurotrophin -nerve growth factor (NGF) is released upon injury and causes pain by activating its receptor (TrkA) on nociceptors and mast cells (which causes the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine), leading to transmission of pain sig - nals from the periphery to the spinal cord and brain via the dorsal ganglion. Inhibitors of NGF have shown promise in clinical trials of musculoskeletal pain.study period, no cases of osteonecrosis were reported; one case of a subchondral insuffi - ciency fracture in the placebo group plus six cases in the combined fasinumab groups were reported, and one case of rapidly progressive OA was observed in each of the 3 mg , 6 mg , and 9 mg fasinumab dose groups. A phase IIb study of fasinumab for chronic low back pain was also initiated; however, with nearly 70% of the study participants enrolled, a case of arthropathy was observed in a patient in the high-dose (9 mg) f asinumab group who had advanced OA at the time of enrolment. On the basis of this adverse event, the FDA placed the chronic back pain study on partial clinical hold 6. The results of both tanezumab and fasi- numab studies in knee or hip OA and chronic low back pain demonstrate the efficacy of NGF inhibition in reducing pain; however, there seems to be a small group of patients who go on to develop advanced arthropa - thies, and this effect is most prevalent with higher doses of the biologic agents, or with the combination of NSAIDs and tanezumab. A number of theories have been pro - posed to explain the incidence of advanced arthropathies in this setting, the most com - mon being that improved analgesia leads to increased loading of a diseased joint, result - ing in disease progression. Alternatively, this phenomenon could be similar to neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint), which occurs secondary to loss of sensation in an extremity and can result in joint dislocations, fractures and fragmentation. However, there might be another biological explanation. NGF levels are high in inflammatory tissues, and these tissues have a high number of monocytes. NGF is reportedly part of an important reg - ulatory pathway in monocytes and other cell types 7. Inflammatory stimuli activate Toll- like receptors (TLRs) on monocytes, which increases expression of the NGF receptor TrkA. Then, NGF binding to TrkA seems to block the TLR responses, and reduces pro - duction of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, TNF, IL -6 a nd IL -8) while increasing the release of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL -1 monocytes TrkA inhibitors reduced the anti-inflammatory effect increased NF -B p athway activa - tion and inflammatory cytokine production while decreasing IL -10 p roduction. Other TLRs also increase NGF production8, and NGF signalling might abate TLR2 -mediated cell death9, broadening the beneficial effects of NGF. Interestingly, this regulatory pathway might be dysfunctional in inflammatory arthritis. Mononuclear cells from the syno - vial fluid of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) had reduced TrkA expression, and NGF administered to lipopolysaccharide- stimulated JIA synovial fluid monocytes and Key advances Adjudication of adverse events observed in clinical trials of the -nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitor tanezumab determined that the small number of cases of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (OA) were particularly associated with high doses of tanezumab or co -administration with NSAIDs4 A large phase II-III of the high-affinity NGF inhibitor fasinumab showed this agent was effective and well-tolerated in patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee or hip 5 Clinical development of fasinumab continues, with careful consideration of OA disease severity and doses being evaluated 6 KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 78 RHEUMATOLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

These data are intriguing as they suggest that alterations in TrkA expres - sion or signalling might disrupt endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms, thus increas - ing joint destruction. They also suggest that inhibition of NGF in the presence of inflam - mation might increase the inflammatory reaction. Additional evidence exists that the p75NTR NGF receptor is also associated with suppressing TLR-induced maturation of den - dritic cells 10. Further studies will be needed to determine if inhibition of NGF and NGF signalling in monocytes might be relevant to the destructive arthropathy observed in a small number of patients enrolled in the anti-NGF studies. In summary, NGF inhibitors can mark - edly reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain, but enthusiasm for these compounds has been dampened by a small number of cases of advanced arthropathy in OA joints. The adverse events have not yet been clearly explained, but understanding the multi - ple biological pathways that are influenced by NGF is critical if we are to continue the clinical development of NGF inhibitors for chronic pain states. At this time, we seem to have taken two steps forward in the treatment of chronic pain associated with OA, but one step back. Nancy E.

BLADDER DYSFUNCTION IN 2016 New insights into interstitial cystitis and chronic pelvic pain syndromes Jia-Fong Jhang and Hann-Chorng Kuo In 2016, immunohistochemical evidence revealed major differences in the inflammatory characteristics of Hunner and non-Hunner interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Evidence also emerged that an isomer of testosterone, -S, might be a urinary biomarker of IC/BPS. Intravesical botulinum toxin injections became a standard treatment of IC/BPS. Furthermore, the International Continence Society has published a new Standard for Terminology for Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome char - acterized by a wide range of clinical mani - festations. This syndrome, characterized by pain in the pelvic area, potentially includes uro l ogical, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and/or gynaecological aetiologies. 2016 was an exciting year for research into CPPS, especially into interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Data from several studies have pro - vided novel insights into pathogenesis, termi - nologies, b iomarkers and treatments of CPPS and IC/BPS. Bladder inflammation, dysfunction of the urothelial barrier and increased expres - sion of sensory proteins are all suggested to account for IC/BPS, although conclusive evi - dence is available for none of these hypoth-eses. Inflammation of the bladder has been considered a cornerstone of the pathogenesis of IC/BPS for approximately 100 years; how - ever, the specific inflammatory characteris - tics have never been fully defined. Maeda and coauthors 1 used immunohistochemical stain - ing and novel image-analysis software (Tissue Studio v.3.5) to quantify the extent of urothelial inflammation in patients with Hunner-type or non-Hunner-type IC/BPS (HIC and NHIC, respectively). This study revealed the presence of significantly more severe lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the urothelium in patients with HIC than in those with NHIC. Furthermore, the plasma-cell ratio was significantly higher in patients with HIC than in those with NHIC or bacterial cystitis. In the bladders of patients with HIC, the severity of inflammation at the bladder ulcer site was not significantly different to that at the non-ulcer site. In addition, expansion of the light-chain-restricted B -cell population was observed in 31% of patients with HIC versus none with NHIC. The presence of focal clonal B-cell expansion usually suggests an early, min - ute, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lym - phoma. These findings indicate that HIC should be considered as a form of pancystitis, and as a distinctly different disease from NHIC. This observation also implies that partial cystectomy of the Hunner lesion alone might not effectively eliminate bladder inflammation in patients with HIC. However, in this study, the correla - tion between infiltration of inflammatory cells and clinical symptoms, such as a reduction in bladder capacity, was not significant in patients with HIC. Thus, further investigation, to evalu - ate the role of different inflammatory cells (such as mast cells) in the bladders of patients with IC/BPS is necessary. In terms of genetic char - acteristics, gene expression analyses were per - formed on bladder tissue from patients with IC/BPS and from women with stress urinary incontinence without pain 2. Two inflammation- associated genes, C -C motif chemokine 21 (also known as chemokine ligand 21) and fibroblast growth factor 7, were found to be overexpressed in women with IC/BPS and the level of expres - sion of these proteins was found to be corre - lated with symptom scores. However, only 15 women with IC/BPS were included in this study, hence further investigation of gene expression patterns in patients with IC/BPS is required.CPPS is a multifactorial condition, and termi n ology varies according to the type of specialist responsible for managing the patient. Terms used in the field of CPPS have been poorly defined for some time; r esearchers might, therefore, be confused on the most appropriate terminologies, resulting in mis-understanding during discussions. In August 2016, the International Continence Society (ICS) published standards for the terminol - ogy relating to CPPS, with the aim of improv - ing the understanding of these syndromes and patient diagnosis 3. Different types of CPPS are classified into nine clinical domains (lower urinary tract (LUT), female genital, male genital, gastrointestinal, musculo s keletal, neurological, psychological, sexual and comorbidities). Symptoms and signs of each domain are defined in a clear and detailed report. Cystoscopic findings, which were pre - viously of debatable clinical relevance, such as glomerulations and Hunner lesions, are also clearly described. In terms of bladder pain, the ICS working group agreed to distinguish hypersensitive bladder, IC/BPS and IC from HIC. This guideline is an important step in the treatment and management of patients with CPPS because it unifies several established, yet debatable terminologies, such as Hunner lesions and hypersensitive bladder. The ICS working group should enable i nternational consensus to be achieved. P.

Some tests, such as cystoscopic hydrodistention or the potassium sensitivity test are helpful in the diagnosis of IC/BPS but might be too invasive for some patients. Thus, non-invasive biomarkers are necessary to help clinicians to accurately differenti - ate between IC/BPS and diseases with over - lapping symptoms, and to evaluate the extent of disease progression. Among the potential biomarkers of IC/BPS, urinary nerve growth factor (NGF) has attracted much attention since 2009. Urinary NGF levels in patients with IC/BPS are significantly higher before treatment compared with those of age- matched individuals without IC/BPS, and also decrease significantly in patients that respond to treatment with hyaluronic acid 4. In 2016, Parker and co-workers5 applied mass- spectrometry-based global metabolite pro - filing to urine samples from women with IC/BPS and found that levels of etiocholan- 3-ol-17-one sulfate (etio -S), an isomer of testosterone, were significantly higher than in urine samples from women without IC/BPS. A statistically significant correlation was observed between urinary etio -S levels and patients' symptoms, such as pain. This approach also enabled accurate differenti a tion of patients with IC/BPS from those without, with a sensitivity and specificity of up to 84.7% and 91.2%, respectively. However, the relation - ship between urinary etio -S levels and IC/BPS has not been investigated. The presence of elevated urinary etio -S might only imply acute stress and might not be completely specific for IC/BPS 6. Further investigations of urinary etio-s levels in patients with bacterial cystitis and/or OAB are necessary. The treatment of IC/BPS is difficult and frustrating for many clinicians. The exact pathogenesis of IC/BPS remains controversial, thus urologists are often only able to relieve patients' symptoms rather than cure their underlying disease. Despite many efforts to develop new treatments of IC/BPS in the past decades, few have been proven to be effective in clinical practice. Intravesical botulinum toxin - A (BoNT - A) injections are currently widely used in patients with IC/BPS and are recommended as a standard-of -care treatment in most guidelines. However, the FDA have yet to approve the use of BoNT -A in patients with IC/BPS. Results of the first prospec - tive, multicentre, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy of intravesical BoNT - A injections versus normal saline injections in patients with IC/BPS have been published this year 7. At 8 weeks after treatment, a sig - nificantly greater reduction in the severity of pain was observed in the BoNT - A group com - pared with the placebo group (visual analogue score, 2.6 \u00b1 2.8 versus 0.9 \u00b1 2.2; P = 0.021). The overall treatment success rates were 63% (26/40) in the BoNT - A group and 15% (3/20) in the placebo group (P = 0.028). This result also elevates the evidence rating of BoNT - A injections as a treatment of IC/BPS from level four to level three in the AUA guidelines. Previous immunohistochemical evidence indicated that the chronic urothelial inflam - mation and apoptosis observed in patients with IC/BPS are ameliorated by BoNT - A injections8. In September 2016, data were pub - lished from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the patients with IC/BPS 9. In compar - ison with the placebo group, patients treated with an oral SHIP1 activator had greater improvements in bladder pain scores and O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index scores. The main adverse events in patients receiving AQX -1 125 were diarrhoea (in 10.8% of patients) and skin rash (in 10.8% of patients). Nevertheless, the overall adverse event rates in patients receiv - ing AQX -1125 or placebo were not signifi - cantly different (51.4% and 78.1% of patients, respectively). Data from the first randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the use of gabapentin in women with CPPS were also published in 2016 (REF. 10). At 6 months, par - ticipants receiving gabapentin had significantly less severe bladder pain and significantly improved mood compared with those receiv-ing placebo. Trials investigating these novel treatments of IC/BPS and CPPS have provided exciting results; however, further clinical trials are required to confirm the reproducibility of these results, including the efficacy and safety. Clearly, a considerable amount of research is required before these treatments can be widely used. Data from laboratory-based studies will also help confirm the validity of these novel approaches. In 2016, data from studies involving patients with CPPS and/or IC/BPS provided strong new evidence in several different domains. More breakthrough studies of pathogenesis, bio - markers and treatments, based on results from 2016, can be expected in the following years. Researchers and clinicians should closely fol - low the development of these novel concepts, in order to expand our understanding and provide the best level of care for patients.

Sternberg and Himisha Beltran 2016 was an important year for prostate cancer research. New clinical data highlight the need for personalized treatment across clinical disease states and have changed clinical practice for men with metastatic disease. Molecular studies have characterized tumour heterogeneity and informed biomarker development for advanced disease and research into mechanisms of treatment resistance. The management of clinically localized pros - tate cancer detected by measurement of serum PSA levels is a controversial topic. The ProtecT trial included 82,429 men aged 50-69 years who had a PSA test between 1999 and 2009; 2,264 of these men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 1,643 men agreed to be randomized to either active monitoring, rad - ical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy 1. ProtecT was intended to address the comparative effectiveness of these three approaches with a primary outcome measure of prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Importantly, the majority of patients enrolled in this study had low-risk disease (>75% with Gleason score 6). Although the incidence of disease progression including metastases was higher in patients undergoing active moni - toring than in the other groups at a median fol - low-up period of 10 years \u2014 and this follow - u p duration might be too short to evaluate PCSM \u2014 overall PCSM was remarkably low in all three study arms: only ~1% of patients died from their disease, irrespective of the treatment assignment. ProtecT highlights one end of the prostate cancer disease spectrum, patients with tumours with a low probability of affect - ing patient mortality, and the importance of individualizing care and discussing treatment options such as clinical monitoring or active surveillance for patients with low-risk disease. At the other end of the spectrum, in patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, research published in 2016 has shown us that advanced tumours might be better treated with combination therapy strategies, poten - tially due to intratumoural heterogeneity. The STAMPEDE trial employed an innovative multiarm multistage design that used one con-trol arm and several comparator arms to evalu - ate therapies beyond the standard of care (SOC) of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone for patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) 2. Investigators from primarily the UK and Switzerland recruited men with high-risk, locally advanced, meta s tatic or recur - rent prostate cancer starting first-line long-term ADT. Men were randomly assigned 2:1:1:1 to four groups, evaluating SOC (ADT alone) versus ADT plus six cycles of docetaxel, zol - edronic acid or both. Of a total of 2,962 treated men, 61% had M+ disease, 15% had N+/NxM0 and 24% had N0M0 disease. Of note, only 6% of men had previously been treated with local radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. At a median follow -u p duration of 43 months, the median overall survival was 71 months for the ADT alone group (32 months to not yet reached) and 81 months (41 months to not yet reached) for ADT plus docetaxel (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.93; P = 0.006)2, sup - porting the use of chemo h ormonal combination therapy for HSPC. No evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect was found for any of the pre - specified subsets. Notably, no survival benefit or decrease in skeletal-related events (SREs) were observed with the addition of zoledronic acid (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79-1.11; P = 0.450), consistent with prior studies and providing further evidence against the routine use of zoledronic acid for SRE prevention in the HSPC disease state. These results coincide with those reported in the CHAARTED trial from the USA in patients with metastatic HSPC treated with ADT alone or the combination of ADT and six cycles of docetaxel 3. Patients with high-volume disease who received ADT plus docetaxel had a 17-month benefit in median overall survival compared with those receiving ADT alone (49.2 months versus 32.2 months, respectively). An update, presented at the ESMO Congress 2016, presenting data with 2.4 years of addi - tional follow -up duration, corroborated the positive results in patients with high-volume disease (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.79; P <0.0001), but patients with low-volume disease had no survival benefit from the addition of docetaxel to ADT (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70-1.55; P = 0.86)4. Based on these results and a systematic review and meta-analysis5, guidelines, such as those from ESMO and EAU, now support docetaxel treatment as a SOC in combination with ADT as first-line treatment of metastatic HSPC in men fit enough for chemotherapy (level of evidence 1, recommendation grade A). NCCN guidelines more cautiously consider this option for fit patients with high-volume disease. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has a wide range of clinical behav - iours. Important gains in survival have been achieved in the past decade and six drugs are now approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC. However, current treatment decisions are not based on molecular tumour stratification, which might have contributed to the failure of multiple clinical trials. One landmark study demonstrated that up to 20% of metastatic CRPC tumours harbour genomic alterations that affect DNA repair pathways, most commonly involving BRCA2 and ATM 6. These findings have promising implications for predicting therapy responses to Key advances The ProtectT trial1 found remarkably low 10year overall prostate cancer specific mortality (~1%), highlighting the relative indolence of Gleason score 6 disease and the importance of individualizing therapy in this patient group STAMPEDE trial2 data concur with CHAARTED trial3 data showing that addition of docetaxel chemotherapy to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) results in extended survival in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer compared with ADT alone Pritchard et al.7 found a high incidence (11.8%) of germline mutations in DNA repair genes in tumours of men with metastatic prostate cancer, which has implications both for treatment considerations and for the disease risk of relatives Wyatt et al.8 demonstrated the feasibility of noninvasive sequential testing of circulating tumour DNA to assess genomic alterations in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer undergoing systemic therapy, paving the way for future biomarker driven trials New insights into treatment resistance mechanisms and tumour heterogeneity, including the neuroendocrine phenotype, were provided by Beltran et al. 9 and Kumar et al.10, highlighting the importance of clinical and molecular integration to identify patient subsets with resistant disease KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 82 UROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Unexpectedly, in addition to somatic alterations, a high incidence of germline muta - tions in DNA repair genes (8%) was also found in that study. In 2016, these initial discoveries were extended to further define the frequency of germline mutations in patients with meta - static prostate cancer. Pritchard et al.7 evalu - ated germline DNA of 692 men with metastatic prostate cancer who had not been selected for family history or other clinical features, focus - ing their analysis on 20 DNA repair genes. In 11.8% of men, 84 predicted deleterious germline DNA repair gene mutations were found, breast cancer, the presence of germline mutations involving DNA repair genes in men with pros- tate cancer might help identify family members at risk of developing not only prostate cancer but also other cancers. The high prevalence of such mutations in this study suggests that all men with metastatic prostate cancer should be considered for routine genetic testing irrespec - tive of family history or age. These findings also indicate a need for specialists in genetic counselling as an integ ra l part of the multidis - ciplinary team. The frequency and significance of germline DNA repair defects within spe - cific age, ethnic and racial subgroups require further study. In addition to these DNA repair alterations, other genomic alterations enriched in meta - static CRPC tumours have potential clinical implications; for somatic (60%), (40%) and RB1 (10%) 6. As metastatic biopsies cannot always be performed serially, researchers have started to evaluate the potential of these altera - tions in predicting response to therapy and/or prognosis using liquid biopsies including ana - lysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). One study demonstrated that the relative abundance of individual lesions captured in ctDNA can be detected and used to track clonal subpopula - tions in the circulation and other studies have since found that the presence of AR mutations or amplification in ctDNA is associated with a decreased response to subsequent treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide. In 2016, one team of researchers used ctDNA analysis to assess and serially follow a large panel of alterations in 65 patients with CRPC during the course of systemic therapy 8. They found that genomic profiling of ctDNA was feasi - ble in nearly all patients with CRPC and was clinically informative in identify in g action - able alterations, demonstrating how emerging technologies could guide the design of future biomarker-driven trials. Understanding how molecular alterations contribute to treatment resistance is critical. One study published in 2016 evaluated the evolution of CRPC to a neuroendocrine pheno - type, an aggressive AR - indifferent subtype of CRPC, showing that alterations in, for exam - ple, RB1 and TP53 were commonly acquired9. By integrating whole-exome, transcriptome and epigenetic data, the team found that these neuro e ndocrine tumours commonly evolve from a prostate adeno c arcinoma precursor through a mechanism of divergent clonal evo - lution. In another study published in 2016, an examination of the hetero g eneity of the lethal phenotype by evaluating spatially distinct metastases in patients at the time of autopsy discovered that both early and key late driver lesions were often shared between metasta - ses 10, suggesting shared vulnerabilities between tumour lesions. The clonal evolution that occurs during the course of therapy, including the development of the neuroendocrine pheno - type, and the relative contribution of intra- tumoural hetero g eneity in driving treatment resistance has potential clinical implications. Understanding these mechanisms could help in identifying subsets of patients that might be less likely to respond to AR -t argeted therapies and in elucidating mechanisms of response to current and emerging therapeutics. Overall, these studies presented in 2016 set a foundation for future research and a path towards integration and validation of molecu - lar data in clinical care across multiple disease states. We anticipate that this work will continue to be a major focus of prostate cancer research in 2017.Cora N.

Wolfe The discovery and confirmation of the female urinary microbiota in 2012 provided opportunities to improve insight into lower urinary tract disorders in women, including UTI and urgency urinary incontinence. Now, research in 2016 has shown that expanded culture techniques enable improved uropathogen detection and confirm that bacteria detected by culture-independent methods are alive. Nearly every clinician assesses urinary health from time to time; for example, ordering and interpreting a urine analysis and/or urine cul - ture to detect a UTI. Clinicians providing care for women with lower urinary tract (LUT) disorders have also relied on these traditional urinary assessments in order to evaluate, diag - nose, and treat affected patients. However, all 83 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews UROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

All rights reserved.of these assessments are based on the assump - tion that the healthy female urinary bladder is sterile, an assumption that we now know to be incorrect. Since 2012, when microbes were detected in the female urinary bladder (the female urinary microbiota) 1, additional and confirmatory evidence has clearly docu m ented the presence of a living bacterial community in the bladders of women with and without lower urinary symptoms 2-6. This major para - digm shift raises many questions regarding the role of the female urinary microbiota in lower urinary tract health and disease. Much more is known about the micro b iota of other organs than that of the bladder. For example, the well-studied gut microbiota are known to vary considerably based on diet - ary intake and BMI. Studies that link the gut microbiota with CNS function highlight the biological importance of microbial niches throughout the human body. The urinary microbiota holds similar potential, especially given the well-known connections between brain and bladder function 7. Three papers published in 2016 have addressed several clinically relevant questions in the field. Karstens and co-workers8 pro - vided confirmatory evidence of the presence of bacterial communities in the bladders of women with and without lower urinary tract symptoms. In a carefully controlled study, these investigators collected catheterized urine sam - ples from clinically well- c haracterized women (mean age approximately 58 years) with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI, n = 10) and nine women without such symptoms. The investigators reported detection of rele - vant bacterial sequences in 95% of samples, and a median DNA content of 95 f g/mL with - out group differences between women with and without symptoms. They also observed a higher number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in samples from women with UUI (mean = 49) c ompared with those with - out, although these data were not statistically significant (mean = 39 (P = 0.2)), group differ - ences in OTU abundance (In UUI, nine more abundant and five less abundant, compared with controls), and significant individual vari - ation in the number of bacterial families (range 2-49) detected per sample, as well as the diver - sity and richness of each sample. Overall, they concluded that increased symptom distress and urgency incontinence episodes correlated with the characteristics of the urinary micro - bial community, which could be clinically important. The work of Karstens and colleagues 8 pro- vides important and independent confirmation of work previously published by Pearce et al. 4 who first described differences in the urinary microbiota of women with UUI compared with those without such symptoms. Despite the small size of Karstens and colleagues' (REF. 8) cohorts, the findings are strengthened by the careful characterization and matching of the participants. In addition, the proportion of samples that were sequenced is high; this strength would have been further enhanced by the concomitant use of enhanced culture-based techniques 2,3,5 to confirm that the detected DNA arose from living microbes. A complementary paper by Thomas-White and co-workers9 used pre-existing samples collected in an NIH study designed to evaluate the treatment outcomes of well- c haracterized women enrolled in a multi c entre prospective randomized trial (the Value of Urodynamic Evaluation (ValUE) study) to assess the role of preoperative urodynamic testing before surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Women with concomitant UUI were included, as clinically appropriate. The study relied on samples (mostly obtained through voiding (n = 174), b ut some obtained through catheteri - zation (n = 23)) o btained at baseline, before SUI treatment. Most (86%) of the 197 samples con - tained detectable l evels of bacterial DNA. An important clinical message was that no associ - ation with SUI symptoms was observed, in agreement with the fact that SUI and UUI have different aetiologies. Similar to data from pre - vious studies, the community c haracteristics \u2014 including diversity and organism predomi- nance \u2014 of the urinary microbiota were associ - ated with UUI symptoms. In addition, the large sample size meant that these investigators were also able to detect an association between hor - monal status and BMI. Finally, they demon - strated that increased diversity of the urinary microbial community was associated with a concomitant lower frequency of Lactobacillus in clinically postmenopausal women who are not taking exogenous oestrogen. A third paper by Price and co-workers 5, addressed the clinical relevance of bacterial members of the urinary microbiota, focusing on the ability of the standard urine culture protocol to detect microorganisms. The stand - ard protocol has been refined to grow certain uropathogens, especially E. coli .

Hilt and co-workers 2 had previously described enhanced urine culture techniques that were established to grow organisms detected pre - viously by sequencing. In 2016, Price et al. 5 extended this work to a clinically relevant popu l ation of women based on their self- reported UTI. A key message of this paper was the low rate of uropathogen detection using standard urine culture techniques. Using baseline catheterized samples from 150 adults attending urogynaecology clinics, standard urine culture failed to detect 67% of uro p atho g ens overall and 50% in participants with severe urinary symptoms. The investiga - tors evaluated a variety of culture conditions to determine the optimal urine culture method that could be incorporated into any clinical laboratory for optimizing the detection of uro - pathogens. They reported that 100 \u00b5L o f urine plated onto Blood (BAP), (CNA), and 48 h r esulted in detection of 84% of all uro - patho g ens, v ersus just 33% with the commonly used standard urine protocol (FIG 1) . Clinicians face a number of challenges when caring for women with lower urinary tract symptoms. The simple dichotomy of 'infection' or 'no infection' does not incorpo - rate evidence documenting the existence of the female urinary microbiota. The spectrum of health, dysbiosis, and disease likely relates to the urinary microbial community, as it does to other human microbial niches. Reliance on standard urine culture alone might limit the information available to physicians; the addi - tional information available from enhanced urine culture techniques helps inform clini - cians of the status of the urinary microbiota, including the presence of uro p athogens that might be missed using standard urine culture protocols.

BLADDER CANCER IN 2016 News in diagnosis, treatment, and risk group assessment Richard Zigeuner 2016 has been a good year for research in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Topics to see progress include risk assessment of patients treated with BCG maintenance, the role of repeat transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), a prospective study of white-light versus narrow-band imaging, a meta-analysis regarding single instillation chemotherapy, and the effect of the use of fluorescence-guided TURB on progression. Many publications regarding different aspects of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) have been published over the past year, covering subjects as diverse as risk assess- ment, endoscopic techniques, surgery, and topical chemotherapy. An article by Cambier et al. 1 defined risk groups regarding recur - rence, progression, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival in patients with NMIBC treated with transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) and subsequent BCG main - tenance therapy. The authors evaluated 1,812 patients from two European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trials and were able to stratify them into six risk groups for early recurrence based on grade, recurrence rate, and number of tumours. For late recurrence, only prior recurrence rate and number of tumours had independent effects, resulting in the creation of four risk groups. By contrast, risks of progression and death from bladder cancer were dependent only on pT classification and grade \u2014 that is, risk fac - tors for progression from non-muscle- in vasive cancer to muscle-invasive disease are different from risk factors for recurrence. The highest risk was shown for T1G3 tumours with a progression rate of nearly 20% and death from bladder c ancer in 11% of patients after 5 years. The authors concluded that NMIBC is a hetero g enous disease and that patients with T1G3 tumours need alternative treatments. This study is of particular clinical impor - tance, because the widely used EORTC risk tables 2 for prediction of bladder cancer recurrence and progression included patients 85 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews UROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Predictive accuracies were moderate with c -indices from 0.56 to 0.67 for recurrence and \u2014 slightly higher \u2014 from 0.64 to 0.72 for progression and death from bladder cancer. However, this study enables a risk assessment in patients treated with BCG maintenance. The conclusion that patients with T1G3 tumours are undertreated by BCG is at least debatable against the back - ground of a cancer- s pecific survival (CSS) of 89% at 5 years, which seems to be not inferior to results from large series favouring early cystectomy in these patients3. An article by Gontero et al.4 evaluated the of reTURB in high-grade T1G3 tumours in a multi-institutional data - base of 2,451 patients who were subsequently treated with BCG, 41% of whom underwent reTURB. The study end points \u2014 recurrence, progression, CSS, and overall survival\u2014 were all related to presence of detrusor muscle in the specimen after first TURB. Four groups were defined (+ or - muscle, + or - reTURB). After multivariable analysis, only patients without presence of muscle in first TURB specimen had a moderate (but not signifi - cant) outcome benefit. The current guide - lines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommend a reTURB in all T1 and all high-grade tumours (except isolated car - cinoma in situ ), when the biopsy sample is lacking muscle in the specimen, or on the sur - geon's impression of incomplete resection 5. The 2016 article provides several surprising results. Firstly, the rate of residual tumours in the reTURB group was 71%, which is higher than average reported in the literature of 33-55% 5-7. Secondly, only 38% of patients received maintenance BCG; as guidelines rec - ommend BCG maintenance as standard of care, 100% of patients should ideally receive this treatment. Thirdly, no data regarding upstaging to muscle- in vasive bladder c ancer after reTURB are available. This omission is surprising, as after diagnosis of a T1 tumour at initial TURB, ~20% of patients are upstaged to muscle- in vasive disease after reTURB. As the authors had access to the pathology reports after reTURB, data regarding upstaging should have been easily available. Fourthly, no subset of patients benefiting from reTURB could be identified, despite the considerable hetero - geneity in underutilization of reTURB and BCG administration and a high rate of resid - ual tumours. More astonishingly, recurrence rates, progression rates, and cancer- s mortality were 51%, 19%, and 9%, respec - tively, after a median follow -up period of more than 5 years. These outcomes are much better than expected when looking at the presented residual tumour rates and, regarding CSS, seem to be non in ferior even to early cystec - tomy series for T1G3 (REF. 3). Possible reasons for these unexpected results include the fact that potential harms of inadequate TURB might be compensated by ablative effects of BCG. Alternatively, perhaps a salvage TURB at 3 months for so -called early recurrence provides the same outcomes as a reTURB at 4-6 weeks. These reasons could only be prop- erly investigated in a prospective ra ndomized trial, which is not currently in sight. Naito et al.8 published the results of a prospective randomized trial comparing white-light (WL)-TURB with TURB using narrow-band imaging (NBI), with the primary end point of recurrence rate at 1 year after treatment. The study hypothesis was a reduc - tion of recurrence by NBI of 10%. 981 patients were randomized and stratified by EORTC risk group (low, intermediate, high). The over - all recurrence rates were ~16% at 3 months and 26% at 12 months. Overall, no significant reduction in recurrence rates at 3 months or 12 months could be demonstrated for NBI versus WL - TURB. In preplanned subgroup analysis, only patients with low-risk tumours showed an absolute risk reduction of 15% and 22% at 3 months and 12 months, respectively. The percentage of risk reduction seems to be clinically relevant; however, the low-risk group represented the smallest sample size in this study, and by absolute numbers recurrences could be prevented by the use of NBI in eight (at 3 months) and 12 (at 12 months) patients, whereas the larger subsets of patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk had no bene - fit. Moreover, the dropout rate in this study was >40%. The main limitation of this study is the lack of information regarding adjuvant intravesical treatment. In summary, the bene - fit of NBI seems to be very limited, as only a small number of patients with low-risk disease saw a benefit. The topic of single instillation chemother - apy after TURB versus TURB alone was evalu - ated by Sylvester et al. 9 in an individual patient data meta-analysis of 11 randomized studies including 2,278 patients. Single instillation chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 35% (HR 0.65), the absolute risk reduc - tion was 14% (from 59% to 45%) at 5 years, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of seven instillations to prevent one recurrence. No benefit was demonstrated in patients with a prior recurrence rate of >1 per year and with an EORTC recurrence score of 5. No benefit in time to progression or death from bladder c ancer was observed; however, in patients with EORTC score 5, increased overall mortality was noted (HR 1.26), of 12% in those with EORTC score 5 versus 11.2% in those with EORTC score <5. The authors concluded that single- in stillation chemotherapy should not be given in patients with high-risk disease. Sylvester and col - leagues' study provides clear data regarding the reduction in cancer recurrence risk by single instillation chemotherapy. The finding that patients with a recurrence risk score of 5 do not benefit seems somewhat academic at a first glance \u2014 as the EORTC tables 2 com - bine clinical and patho l ogi c al parameters, the latter are not available at time of instil - lation. However, any multi f ocal recurrent tumour (and this information is available at time of surgery) has a score of 5 and could be excluded from single instillation. The reason for an increased overall mortality in these patients after single instillation remains Key advances Data from EORTC studies were used to define risk groups of patients with NMIBC treated with BCG maintenance regarding recurrence, progression, and cancer specific mortality1 A retrospective multi institutional analysis evaluating the role of reTURB in T1G3 patients subsequently treated with BCG showed a high rate of residual cancer and only limited clinical benefits4 TURB using narrow band imaging versus white light reduced recurrence rates only in a very small number of patients with low risk tumours, whereas the overall study population did not benefit 8 Single instillation chemotherapy after TURB reduced the absolute recurrence risk by 14% in a meta analysis, but only in patients with EORTC risk scores <5 and/or <1 recurrence per year9 For the first time, fluorescence guided TURB was shown to reduce the risk of progression by 4% compared with white light in a meta analysis10...potential harms of inadequate TURB might be compensated by ablative effects of BCG KEY ADVANCES IN MEDICINE JANUARY 2017 | 86 UROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Marston Linehan and Christopher J. Ricketts Recent advances have been exciting in the genomics of and targeted therapeutics for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

The Kaplan-Meier curves for overall mortality of subgroups of patients with an EORTC score 5 who either did or did not receive single instillation chemotherapy sepa - rate after 6 years, and, in absolute numbers, the difference is 21 patients. However, the difference might have occurred by chance, as this study was not designed for a preplanned subgroup analysis. Finally, Gakis and Fahmy 10 reported a meta-analysis regarding the effect of fluorescence- g uided TURB using - levulinate (HAL) versus WL on progres - sion. Five studies (four prospective, one retrospective) including 1,301 patients were selected. After a median follow -u p period of 27.6 months (HAL) versus 29 months (WL), progression was noted in 6.8% of patients who underwent HAL imaging and 10.7% of those who received WL imaging (OR = 1.64, P = 0.01). T he absolute difference in progres - sion rate is close to 4%, corresponding to a NNT of 25 HAL-guided TURBs to prevent one progression. This meta-analysis shows for the first time not only an increased detection of bladder lesions by HAL but also a reduction in progression risk. The authors hypothesize that this effect might be the result of an increased detection and eradication of carcinoma in situ by HAL. However, one limi t ation of the study is the heterogenous definition of progression between the five trials. In my opinion, it seems plausible that improved eradication of flat tumour lesions including carcinoma in situ , which is usually not visible with white light but can be detected by HAL and has a high poten - tial to progress to muscle-invasive disease if left untreated, is the main reason for this effect. Overall in 2016: updated EORTC risk groups provide outcome assessment for BCG- treated patients, reTURB in patients with T1G3 bladder cancer showed a high residual tumour rate and very moderate benefits in a real life setting, and NBI reduced early recur - rence rates compared with white light, but only in low-risk tumours in a small number of patients. A s ingle instillation chemother - apy after TURB was effective with respect to reduced risk of recurrence in patients with EORTC risk scores <5 or prior recurrence rates of <1 per year, whereas fluorescence-guided TURB was shown to reduce risk of progression for the first time in a meta-analysis.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) affects nearly 300,000 individuals worldwide annually and is responsible for over 100,000 deaths each year. RCC is not a single entity, but is made up of several different types of cancer that present with different histologies, clinical courses, and responses to therapy, which are associated with different genetic alterations. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common type (~75%) and the most well- c haracterized form of RCC. ccRCC is genetically distinguished by inacti - vation of VHL , most commonly by mutation or methylation of VHL and loss of chromo- some 3p. The protein product of VHL, pVHL, is a component of an E3 ubiqui t in ligase com - plex that HIFs, HIF1 and HIF2, for ubiquitin- m ediated degradation in an oxygen- s ensitive manner. When VHL is lost in ccRCC, even in normoxia, the VHL com - plex no longer targets and degrades the HIF transcription factors, and HIF accumulates and activates the hypoxia response path - way. Activation of the hypoxia response pathway results in increased expression of HIF target genes, such as VEGF , PDGF , and TGFA , which can and migration that aid tumori - genesis1. Elucidation of the VHL pathway has provided the foundation for the development of targeted therapeutic agents for patients with advanced RCC. From 2005-2015, seven new agents tar - geting the VHL-HIF pathway were approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC. Five of these agents, sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, pazo- panib, and axitinib, directly target down - stream targets of the HIF pathway, such as VEGF, VEGFR, and PDGFR; whereas, two agents, temsirolimus and everolimus, inhibit the mTOR pathway and induce reduced levels of HIF by inhibiting de novo translation and 87 | JANUARY 2017 www.nature.com/reviews UROLOGY \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In 2016, two novel agents, cabozantinib and lenvatinib, were approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC. Cabozantinib is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that VEGFR, as well as MET and AXL. A randomized phase III trial evaluated the effect of cabozantinib as a second-line ther - apy in 658 patients with advanced ccRCC who had progressed after treatment with one or more VEGFR TKIs 2. Patients who received cabozantinib had an improved median overall survival (OS) of 21.4 months compared with 16.5 months for those who received everolimus (hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.83; P = .00026), (PFS) (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.41-0.62; P <0.0001), and an increased response rate in comparison with everolimus (17% versus 3%; P <0.0001) (FIG. 1a is a that also targets VEGFRs, as well as FGFR1-FGFR4, PDGFR, RET and KIT. A phase II registration study was performed to evalu - ate the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib as a second-line therapy in 153 patients with advanced ccRCC who had progressed after a previous VEGF-targeted therapy 3 The everoli - mus and lenvatinib combination treatment improved median PFS to 14.6 months com - pared with 5.5 months in patients treated with single-agent everolimus (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.68; P = 0.0005), im proved median OS to 25.5 months compared with 15.4 months (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.88; P = 0.024), and significantly increased objective response rate (43% versus 6%; P <0.0001)3. The FDA approved cabozantinib in April 2016 and the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus in May 2016 as second-line therapies for patients with advanced ccRCC. In addition, in October 2016, sunitinib was shown to significantly improve the median duration of disease-free postsurgical survival from 5.6 years with pla - cebo to 6.8 years in patients with locoregional ccRCC with a high risk of tumour recurrence (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98; P = 0.03) (FIG. 1a)4. The ability to target the VHL-HIF2 path - way in VHL-deficient ccRCC has long been a goal of investigators in this field. Two recent studies have evaluated a novel therapeutic approach that directly targets HIF2 using a small-molecule inhibitor, PT2399. PT2399 was designed to directly bind the PAS B domain of HIF2 and inhibit binding to its dimerization partner, ARNT, which is essen - tial for HIF2 transcriptional activity 5,6. Cho et al.6 evaluated the effectiveness of PT2399 in both in vitro and in vivo cell-line models of VHL-deficient ccRCC and demonstrated inhibited colony formation and tumour regression in mouse xenograft models6. Chen et al.5 evaluated ccRCC tumourgraft- p atient-derived- xenograft (PDX) platform and tumori g enesis in 56% (10/18) of the PDXs treated with PT2399 (REF. 5). Both studies demonstrated the on -target effects of the HIF2 inhib i tion. The sensitive PDX models had robust HIF2 protein expression and a specific mRNA expression signature associated with response was identified by compari s on with the resistant PDX model5,6.

An eagerly awaited clinical trial of a companion agent, PT2385, is currently underway and has the potential for the devel - opment of a whole new class of agents target - ing the VHL-HIF2 pathway for patients with VHL-deficient ccRCC (FIG. 1a) . The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has previously conducted comprehensive molecular characterization of both ccRCC and chromophobe (ch)RCC7,8. Recently, TCGA Research Network reported the comprehensive molecular characteri - zation of papillary (p)RCC9. This analysis confirmed the distinctiveness of type 1 and type 2 pR CC, and characterized the hetero - geneity of type 2 pR CC (FIG. 1b ). Type 1 pRCC was shown to be characterized by a clear pat - tern of copy number gains for chromosomes 7 and 17, an association with MET mutation or alteration, and an improved survival rate com - pared with type 2 pR CC. Type 2 pR CC was shown to have a variety of genetic alterations, which included loss of CDKN2A (associated with decreased survival), and mutation of chromatin remodelling including - TFEB gene fusions, which are usually thought to be associated with childhood RCC 10, were observed in a relatively high percentage (12%) of type 2 pR CCs from adults. Type 2 pR CCs were also shown to have increased expres - sion of the NRF2-ARE pathway genes and mutations in the genes that regu l ate the NRF2-ARE pathway were identified in a subset of type 2 pR CCs. Notably, a subset of type 2 pR CC samples demonstrated a distinct CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) that was associated with germline or somatic mutation of FH, highly increased expression of the NRF2-ARE pathway, and a significantly decreased survival ( P <0.0001) (FIG. 1b )9. These findings provide the foundation for under - standing the molecular basis of pRCC which will hopefully result in the development of effective therapies for this disease. In summary, new second-line therapies for patients with advanced ccRCC have recently been approved and a novel thera - peutic approach targeting of HIF2 tran - scription and improved understanding of the molecular basis of pRCC will hopefully result in improved management approaches for patients affected with this disease.W.

Designed by Laura MarshallOver the past decade, numerous scientific advances have led to improvements in the care of patients with mitochondrial diseases. However, further studies are required to fully understand the heterogeneity and tissue specificity of these diseases, in addition to finding new treatments and preventive measures. Other proteins involved in mitochondrial function include those involved in phospholipid metabolism, the disulde relay system, solute carriers of thiamine and phosphate and Fe-S protein assembly mtDNA tRNA ProteinRNA RNA processing and Oxidative phosphorylation Complex I Complex IIComplex IIIComplex IVMetabolism of toxic compounds Respiratory chain ATP ADPATP synthaseMitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes in the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) genomes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial function, resulting in defects in oxidative phosphorylation. Over ~1,500 proteins are required for normal mitochondrial structure and function: mtDNA encodes 13 structural proteins and 24 RNAs involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis, whereas nDNA encodes all the othersMutations in genes encoding any of these proteins can lead to defective oxidative phosphorylation, deficits in essential enzyme intermediates and/ or end products, and the accumulation of toxic compoundsMITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES The diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases is complex as the conditions can manifest at any age and patients can present with a wide range of symptoms that can involve dysfunction of almost any organ or tissue. Symptoms frequently manifest in tissues with high energy demand, including muscle, eyes and the central nervous system. Confirmation of a mitochondrial disease requires genetic testing, biochemical tests and histochemistry. Management of mitochondrial diseases is challenging owing to their heterogeneity and the involvement of multiple systems. Supportive care and early treatment of organ-specific disease complications are essential. Available targeted treatments include enzyme replacement therapy (for example, with thymidine phosphorylase), pharmacological agents aimed at scavenging toxic compounds and the replacement of deficient proteins (such as coenzyme Q10).Patients with mitochondrial disease have several reproductive options to prevent or minimize the risk of passing on their condition to their children. Patients with nDNA mutations can consider preimplantation or prenatal genetic diagnosis. For women with mtDNA mutations, genetic advice is more complicated, but can include preimplantation genetic diagnosis to identify embryos with the lowest level of heteroplasmy. Mitochondrial donation \u2014 the transfer of nDNA from a woman with mtDNA mutations into an enucleated donor oocyte or zygote \u2014 might provide further reproductive options for women with mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial donation has been approved in the United Kingdom and is under investigation in other countries. Childhood-onset mitochondrial diseases have a prevalence of 5-15 cases per 100,000 individuals; the estimates for adult-onset disease vary between 2.9 and 9.6 per 100,000 individuals. Prevalence can vary in certain populations, such as those with genetic founder mutations or those with high consanguinity. mtDNA mutations are responsible for ~80% of mitochondrial diseases in adults, whereas they are only found in 20-25% of childhood-onset diseases.PRIMEVIEW DIAGNOSIS MANAGEMENTMECHANISMS OUTLOOKPREVENTION EPIDEMIOLOGY doi:10.1038/nrdp.2016.81 published online 20 Oct 2016For the Primer, visit doi:10.1038/nrdp.2016.80 Many patients with mtDNA-driven diseases have both mutated and wild-type mtDNA, known as heteroplasmy; the proportion of mutated mtDNA is key for determining the severity of cellular dysfunction.
