Table of Contents3 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report About ZSFGThis year's Annual Report demonstrates what Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center is all about. We are a diverse, excellent, resilient and hardworking staff that operates a world class hospital by providing equitable, compassionate, patient-centered care. We are improving the health and wellness for all the people of San Francisco, regardless of ability to pay or immigration status. Even as we entered our third year of the COVID-19 pandemic and a fourth surge of cases at the beginning of the fiscal year, our team's commitment to providing high quality care to our patients remained as strong as ever, even as this time has been ever-challenging for them. We have dealt with the now six COVID-19 surges with excellent, best-practice treatment, expanded testing, robust vaccine and booster programs and continued education and outreach to the community. As we continued to adapt and pivot to best provide services in an ever changing COVID-19 pandemic, we were also confronted with the emerging threat of a monkeypox (MPX) and had to quickly adapt yet again. Our experience over the last three years of dealing with COVID-19 informed our best practices and our vaccine clinic quickly acted, making it a model for the equitable distribution of vaccine to those who needed it. Even while staff were confronted with everyday emergencies, we kept a laser like focus on our core mission, vision and values of equity, safety, quality, care experience, developing our people and providing sound financial stewardship for the hospital. The pages that follow tell the story of this past fiscal year and how we were resilient in the face of new emergencies. I am very proud of the progress we made and continue to make on advancing the hospital's core mission as it entered its 150th year. Our work to advance our mission will ensure we are here for another 150 years. Importantly, our partnership with UCSF continues to help make excellence and resilience an essential part of who we are. We are home to 20 UCSF research centers, with research budgets of nearly $200 million and nearly 1,000 research awards. I am excited to share with you our partnership's remarkable progress this year in the following pages. Support from the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation this past fiscal year also continued to grow. The Foundation helped us raise critical funds and awarded grants to support our work to meet our true north goals focusing on ensuring equity, access, and quality health care. Let me conclude with some of the numbers. This year, our outstanding interdisciplinary team of 6,300 staff, including 400 volunteers, provided 361,469 outpatient visits and cared for over 100,000 patients and had 2,431 trauma activations. 1,164 babies were born here and we provided emergency and psychiatric care for more than 37,000 people. Additionally, the vaccine clinic administered 78,434 doses of COVID vaccines and boosters. I would like to thank the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Francisco Health Network, under which we operate, for their support to make these achievements possible. At ZSFG, 2022 will be remembered as a year of extraordinary challenges, but also a year of great progress in service to our patients and the people of San Francisco. Susan P .

At ZSFG there are more than 300 UCSF principal investigators, researchers and research support staff working on 980 funded awards, totaling nearly $200 million. Below are just a few of the incredible projects that UCSF researchers have worked on this past year.Research Stories UCSF Top Public Recipient of NIH Funding; 15th Year For the 15th year in a row, UC San Francisco garnered the top spot among public institutions in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2021. UCSF continued to rank highly among all public and private institutions nationwide, ranking fourth overall. The University was awarded nearly 1,500 NIH grants and contracts, amounting to more than $709 million in funds - a $23 million increase from the 2020 total and a new record for NIH funding to a public university. Neal Benowitz, MD The Research Behind Biden's Plan to Reduce Nicotine in Cigarettes Diana Greene Foster, PhD UCSF Turnaway Study Shows Impact of Abortion Access on Well-Being Dr. Greene Foster and her team conducted a groundbreaking study that revealed the long-term adverse effects of unwanted pregnancy on people's lives, pointing to widespread challenges that will result from the US Supreme Court ruling to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion. The study found more adverse effects among those who were denied an abortion, such as life-threatening complications at the end of pregnancy, worse long-term health, and negative effects on children born from an unwanted pregnancy. Geoffrey Manley, MD, PhD Brainpower May Take A Beating Following Concussion Dr. Manley and his team conducted a study that examined the long term effects of a concussion on cognition. Researchers found that a total of 13.5% of patients, who had been diagnosed a year ago with concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury, were found to have \"poor cognitive outcome,\" which included poor memory and processing speed and/or meaningful drop in test scores. Total: $191 million Non-Federal: $92 million Federal: Research at ZSFG13 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report Partnership with UCSFHOUDINI LINK The Division of Substance Abuse and Addiction Medicine (DSAAM) partnered with Behavioral Health Services to support substance use treatment through HOUDINI LINK (Hospital Opioid Use Disorder treatment Initiation and Linkage to care) and the Bridge Clinic. This project successfully improved post-hospitalization linkage to community-based medication-assisted treatment, decreased substance use and improved quality of life for patients. It was so successful that Mayor Breed funded it as an exemplar program to address the city's overdose epidemic. Citywide Case Management Case Managers are working with philanthropic partners on (1) a project focused on digitally enhanced intensive case management and implementation of contingency (incentive based) management of substance use disorders in criminal-justice-involved clients with serious mental illness (SMI); and (2) developing best practice protocols for using telephonic and digital interventions to support chronically homeless clients with SMI. The philanthropic partner is also working with The Division of Infant Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in co-designing a digital app with transitional age youth in foster care for behavioral health navigation and engagement.The Division of Trauma Recovery Services The Division of Trauma Recovery Services is working with the State of California and other states to replicate the Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) model and provide technical assistance to new TRCs. TRCs provide integrated and multidisciplinary care focused on mental health and case management to victims of violent crime. Over the past seven years, the number of TRCs in California has increased to 19, and in the last several years an additional 20 TRCs were established in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. The Transform Mental Behavioral Health Fund The Department of Psychiatry is a partner in The Transform Mental Behavioral Health Fund (TMBHF), an initiative supported by the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation, which was established to address rising mental and behavioral Health needs throughout the City and County of San Francisco. Through this fund, Patient Navigators (PNs) are being hired to serve as a part of a comprehensive patient navigation program that works with vulnerable and underserved patients at ZSFG. These PNs will work across the following programs: The Addiction Care Team, Behavioral Emergency Response Team, Inpatient Psychiatry, Psychiatric Emergency Services, Social Medicine, Solid Start, and and Healthy Steps. These teams are also implementing Compass Rose, a module in the electronic health record focused on complex care linkage and Social Determinants of Health. They are due to go live in October and November of 2022. This fiscal year, ZSFG's Department of Psychiatry, which is mostly comprised of UCSF staff, prioritized behavioral health to align with the City and County of San Francisco. Below are a few of the key initiatives that the department has begun working on and will continue into FY23:UCSF Research at ZSFG DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVES14 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report Partnership with SF General Hospital Foundation The San Francisco General Hospital Foundation (SFGHF) was established in 1993 by a group of volunteers dedicated to supporting those served by our city's public hospital. Since then, the Foundation has supported ZSFG in raising critical funds to support our patients and community. The Foundation's mission is to support and fund excellence in patient care and innovation at ZSFG, with a focus on ensuring equity, access, and quality health care for all. Since its inception, the Foundation has raised over $280 million in support for ZSFG. For nearly 30 years, the Foundation has raised critical funds to support equity and innovation at ZSFG: fostering collaboration in services, investing in new ideas to better serve patients, and supporting staff with their own well-being. Each February, the Foundation invites the City of San Francisco to join them for Hearts in SF. An evening to celebrate the frontline works of ZSFG, Hearts in SF is also the annual debut of the newest Hearts in San Francisco sculpture series, an iconic public art project that raises critical funds for ZSFG each year.Partnership with the SF General Hospital Foundation15 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report Partnership with SF General Hospital Foundation 2022 Hearts in SF Event SFGHF was thrilled to have more than a thousand registered guests for the 2022 Hearts in San Francisco Virtual Gala, raising $1.8 million to support San Francisco's beloved public hospital and only Level 1 trauma center. Hosted by KQED's Priya David Clemens live from Oracle Park, this year's virtual celebration was broadcast to homes across the Bay Area and beyond, honoring our health care heroes and raising critical funds for ZSFG. Guests heard from leading doctors, including Heroes and Hearts Award winners Geoffrey Manley, Neil R. Powe, and Malini K Singh, and the Unsung Heroes awardees at the hospital, including the Environmental Services unit (Sarah Lew and Francisco Saenz); the Facilities Services unit (Greg Chase, Alexander Quinn and AJ Singh); the Sojourn Chaplaincy and Spiritual Care Department (including Claire Bohman and Monica Moore); and ZSFG's Med-Surg nurses, represented by Terry Dentoni and Chinelo Amah. Finally, Dr. Priscilla Chan, in an open and heartfelt conversation with SFGHF's CEO Kim Meredith, inspired all to invest in public health as she shared her personal experience as the child of immigrants and what motivated her to become a physician. The event also celebrated the legacy of Dr. Sue Carlisle, who retired as the Vice Dean of the UCSF School of Medicine at ZSFG this year. Partnership with the SF General Hospital Foundation16 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report Partnership with SF General Hospital Foundation Equity and Innovation Grants The Foundation has awarded more than 500 grants and $12 million dollars since 2004 to departments across ZSFG. Designed to supplement patient care at San Francisco's only public hospital since its early days, today the Equity & Innovation (formerly Hearts) Grants program has grown to foster new ideas, fund creative approaches to patient care, and place value on programs fighting inequities in health care delivery. In its most recent award cycle, the Foundation awarded 27 grants that directly impact on-the-ground innovative equity initiatives at the hospital. Championed by staff and departments, these funded projects will ensure health equity and patient care remain at the center of their work. Grantees showcase the variety of ways staff at ZSFG are working for a more equitable future for both staff and the patients they care for. Care for All: Equity and Inclusion San Francisco General Hospital Foundation strengthens the city's public safety net by nurturing cross-sector community partnerships and supporting ZSFG with integrating social determinants of health into its clinical care. By applying the lens of equity, the hospital is better able to address the structural inequities that many in our community face. Transforming Health Care: Innovation and Leadership San Francisco General Hospital Foundation invests in Zuckerberg San Francisco General's efforts to test, innovate, and incubate new and transformative models of care with emphases on whole-person care, team-based approaches, and continuous quality improvements. Partnership with the SF General Hospital Foundation17 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report COVID-19 ResponseSpecifically, due to the Omicron variant, ZSFG activated surge level orange in January 2022, once again responding to a new and unparalleled challenge. ZSFG simultaneously cared for patients while also managing the extensive number of staff who were unable to work either because they had COVID-19 or had a high-risk exposure. As the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2022 and after more than 15 months of activation, ZSFG officially demobilized its Hospital Incident Command System for its COVID-19 response. COVID-19 updates transitioned to daily clinical leadership huddles and other established venues. ZSFG, like hospitals throughout the country and world, responded to the rapidly changing COVID-19 pandemic and adapted policies and procedures to quickly meet the needs of patients and staff. ZSFG continued to respond and adapt its COVID-related operations, using data, science and facts to address new and emerging challenges. As the fiscal year began in July 2021, San Francisco entered its fourth surge of the pandemic due to the more infectious Delta variant, the first of three surges during the fiscal year, driven by new variants. Fortunately, in July 2021, 77% of eligible San Franciscans were fully vaccinated and by the end of the fiscal year, 85% were fully vaccinated1 and 67% boosted2. Vaccines and boosters remained highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. During the first part of the fiscal year, the case rate among unvaccinated people was more than double that of fully vaccinated people; the hospitalization rate was eight times higher among unvaccinated people than among fully vaccinated people. Throughout, ZSFG continued to provide routine and preventative care to its patients while dealing with increased demand for testing and vaccines amid multiple surges. ZSFG also initiated new return-to-work guidelines, implemented well-practiced surge plans to ensure ZSFG was caring for the highest priority patients, collaborated with community partners to create as many discharge avenues as possible for non-critical and non- acute patients, limited visitors to comply with health orders and to ensure a safe workplace, and provided unprecedented numbers of tests for our patients and staff every day. 1 https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-vaccinations 2 https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-vaccine-boostersCOVID-19 Response & Recovery18 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report COVID-19 ResponseVaccines & Boosters In July 2021, the San Francisco Health Officer issued an update to the Safer Return Together Health Order accelerating vaccination requirements for staff at designated high-risk settings, which included staff at ZSFG who were required to receive the initial COVID-19 vaccine series by September 2021. In August 2021, ZSFG also began offering the supplemental (third) mRNA vaccine shot for immunocompromised staff and patients. SFHN patients who received their mRNA vaccine were able to make appointments or drop into the ZSFG Learning Center to receive their third dose. And shortly after that, ZSFG made COVID-19 booster shots available to all staff and began providing boosters to nearly 200 staff per day. During the fiscal year, ZSFG administered 8,835 doses of the booster vaccine to employees, and the ZSFG Urgent Care Clinic administered 46,587 booster doses to patients. By October 1, all ZSFG staff were required to be vaccinated to come to work on campus. This decision was made by the San Francisco Health Officer to ensure the safety of San Francisco, especially in high-risk areas such as hospitals. Following implementation of the vaccine mandate, 99% of the DPH ZSFG workforce completed their vaccination series by the end of the fiscal year. Upgraded and Expanded Patient Vaccination Clinic Opens During the fiscal year, the Patient Vaccination Clinic relocated to ZSFG's Learning Center to better accommodate the increased community demand for vaccinations. The Learning Center opened with five new check-in and check-out stations, eight new vaccination stations, 45 monitoring chairs, four vial drawing stations and space for inpatient and outpatient roving teams and carts. Vendor COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement In September 2021, suppliers, vendors, and contractors entering ZSFG buildings were required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to comply with San Francisco's updated Health Order. To ensure compliance with the new order, ZSFG instituted Vendormate, a vendor credentialing system to ensure hospital operations were not interrupted. Roving Vaccine Service In December, ZSFG began offering a roving vaccine service to all staff and patients on the ZSFG campus. As COVID-19 cases were rising across the country, it was extremely important that staff and patients receive their booster. The roving team conducted screenings, vaccinated employees and staff, provided vaccination cards and documented their work in EPIC/OHS. Employee Forum ZSFG leadership, UCSF, DPH Human Resources, and the leadership of SEIU Local 1021 partnered to provide a forum for employees to learn about the importance of vaccinations. More than 100 people attended and learned about how vaccinations protect us, our colleagues, friends and families, and the importance of continuing our COVID-19 prevention work at ZSFG. COVID-19 Response & Recovery19 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report COVID-19 ResponseThe Omicron surge, which began in December 2021, provided an unprecedented challenge due to increased staff call volume to OHS and a concomitant 10-fold increase in testing need, as well as critical staff shortages due to staff quarantine and isolation. Testing options were expanded and policies were modified to align with the CDC's return-to-work guidelines to reduce the impact on staff shortages. A successful test-to-stay policy was implemented such that even staff with high-risk exposures could remain at work safely so long as frequent tests were negative and symptoms did not develop. Swift and successful partnership between our executive team, managers, internal steering committee, and information services ensured the health and safety of our employees. COVID Surges San Francisco experienced three surges during the fiscal year, the first due to the Delta variant in July 2021. From December 2021 forward, the Omicron variant and then several sub-variants caused most COVID-19 cases in San Francisco and across California and the U.S. The second surge of the fiscal year peaked in January 2022 and resulted in the largest Staff Testing The ZSFG Occupational and Employee Health Services (OHS) provided no-cost COVID-19 testing to employees. In the dynamic environment of shifting testing availability, quarantine and isolation requirements, contact tracing, surveillance standards, and outbreak management, trained telephone hotline staff and testing clinicians served as the main access point for employee education and access to appropriate and timely testing seven days per week using a COVID-19 policy developed by local experts and leaders. The surge staffing model for these teams involved more than 200 employees. Updated policies were also disseminated through internal communications, daily health screening and a public- facing web page. FY 2021/2022 Hotline Calls 22,205 Completed Tests 15,324 Diagnosed Cases 2,548 The OHS team achieved goals of access to nurse- obtained COVID-19 PCR testing within 24 hours of employee calls and provided results in under twelve hours using the campus clinical laboratory. In September 2021, the OHS team worked with the laboratory team to add self-swab PCR that expanded capacity and efficiency supporting more than 90% adherence to weekly surveillance testing in the 4A skilled nursing facility unit. In October 2021, the team implemented rapid NAAT COVID-19 testing to provide 20-minute point-of-care results and clinical guidance that improved employee experience and wait times, and reduced time away from work by an average of one day per symptomatic employee. COVID-19 Response & Recovery20 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report COVID-19 ResponseThroughout each surge, staff stepped up in ways that are truly remarkable: care teams, environmental services workers, finance teams, occupational health staff, laboratory teams, and testing and vaccination teams to name just a few. Below are some of the many ways ZSFG worked to ensure a safe, high quality, well-resourced and fulfilling workplace for everyone: Instituted new return-to-work guidelines; Implemented well-practiced surge plans to ensure ZSFG cared for the highest priority patients and that staff were available; Collaborated with community partners to create as many discharge avenues as possible for non- critical and non-acute patients; Limited visitors to comply with health orders and to ensure a safe workplace; Provided unprecedented numbers of tests for our patients every day; Continuously monitored workforce and patient areas to ensure best distribution of resources; and Listened to staff to better improve service during this time. Celebrating Successes On December 14, 2021, San Francisco reached the milestone of fully vaccinating 80% of its population, one of the highest rates in the nation. ZSFG and the outstanding vaccine team were essential in achieving this milestone; between staff and patients more than a quarter of a million vaccine doses have been provided on campus since the beginning of the pandemic through June 20, 2022.number of hospitalized patients and staff absences of the pandemic. The third surge due to Omicron sub-variants was long and broad, beginning in May 2022, with case numbers finally declining in August 2022. In response, ZSFG activated surge level orange in January 2022 with 27% of ZSFG inpatients having COVID-19. At the time, the hospital was not only concerned about caring for patients but also managing the staff exposure and risk. Similarly, all hospitals in San Francisco, California and the country were experiencing the same issues, all of this as the two- year anniversary of COVID-19 approached. One unified and comprehensive ZSFG campus-wide surge plan was implemented and served as the basis of multiple and interconnected operational surge plans that were used to drive the work and processes in each area. Countermeasures were implemented and included decreasing the number of in-person specialty care visits, elective procedures, and elective surgeries, and updating return to work and visitor policies. COVID-19 Response & Recovery21 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report Highlights ZSFG Mahoney REIGN Nursing Student Externship Program This year, ZSFG Nursing launched the REIGN Nursing Student Externship Program, made possible by the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation's Equity and Innovation Grants Program. To honor the legacy of Mary Eliza Mahoney, the first African American licensed nurse to graduate from an accredited school of nursing, the ZSFG student nurse externship program strives to Recognize Excellence in Generations of Nursing (REIGN). This initiative will provide 10 student externs from underrepresented races and ethnicities into the profession of nursing with up to 120 hours of clinical and patient care experience. This program allows externs to learn more about public health and trauma care; develop competencies, clinical skills, and professional confidence; and establish valuable professional relationships.MPX Response ZSFG was at the forefront of this emergency. In May 2022, SFDPH began monitoring monkeypox (MPX) following the guidance of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) on the evolving situation in the U.S. and in other countries. SFDPH systems were in place to receive reports of suspected cases from health care providers; identify and reach out to any individuals who have been in contact with cases during their infectious period; and ensure that clinicians remain well informed about testing, infection control and management of MPX as the situation developed. Later that same month, SFDPH received the first shipment of the JYNNEOS vaccine from CDPH for preventative use in people who are identified as close contacts. SFDPH immediately set up a system to administer the vaccine efficiently and equitably. Our mass vaccination clinic in building 30 distributed the vast majority of vaccines within SFDPH and was the largest vaccination site in San Francisco. Highlights22 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report HighlightsZSFG is honored to be recognized for providing LGBTQ+ centered patient care and for creating a welcoming and safe environment for all individuals on campus. Our deepest gratitude and congratulations to our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Lukejohn Day, for his leadership in helping us obtain this designation, and many thanks to all of our staff who put our values into action every day. National Gun Violence Awareness Day From June 3 to June 5, 2022 ZSFG participated in National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Staff were encouraged to wear orange in honor the many people killed due to gun violence in the U.S. every year and the people we treat here at ZSFG, the only trauma center in the City. The national event honors Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who was shot and killed in Chicago in 2013, just one week after performing at President Obama's second inauguration parade. Orange is the color that Hadiya's friends wore in her honor and is worn to raise awareness about gun violence. ZSFG and the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation partnered to participate in this important event. Staff wore orange, handed out orange masks to staff and visitors and hung orange hearts with names of gun violence survivors. LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader 2022 In April 2022, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation gave ZSFG a top score of 100 and the designation of \"LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader\" in their 15th anniversary edition of the Healthcare Equality Index (HEI). This is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey of healthcare facilities on policies and practices dedicated to the equitable treatment and inclusion of LGBTQ+ patients, visitors and employees. ZSFG was granted this designation for our equitable and inclusive care for LGBTQ+ patients and their families. In the last year, ZSFG hosted, partnered, and sponsored several large-scale community events targeting Trans and Non-binary individuals including the Transgender Day of Remembrance, Transgender Day of Visibility, the Trans March, the Trans Wellness & Holistic Fair and, through the Transgender Pilot Program of Behavioral Health Services, the annual Transgender Health Fair in addition to numerous online provider and patient education sessions supporting the LGBTQ+ community. This designation demonstrates that ZSFG is committed to improving the health and wellness of our LGBTQ+ community and providing world- class care with equity, compassion and respect. It also shows our commitment to our expert, dedicated and hard-working staff and all of our community partners at ZSFG. Highlights23 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report HighlightsPublished Journal Articles New England Journal of Medicine: the Evolution of a Hospital-Based COVID-19 Vaccination Program for Inpatients ZSFG was the first hospital in San Francisco, and one of the first in California, to successfully operationalize the administration of COVID-19 vaccines to hospitalized patients. The interdisciplinary team, led by Dana Freiser, BSN, RN, Medical-Surgical Nursing Performance Improvement Coordinator, developed the Inpatient Vaccine Program by identifying and mitigating 12 workflow considerations to ensure a sustainable system. Between February and July 2021, inpatient clinicians administered 526 COVID-19 vaccines with zero wasted doses, leading to over 80 percent of enrolled patients (or greater than 1,000 patients) having been fully vaccinated while admitted or after discharge. Even after this time period, the program infrastructure remained flexible enough to adapt to evolving vaccination eligibility, including supplemental and booster dose indications. Journal of Environmental and Occupational Medicine: Temperature Screening of Healthcare Personnel is Ineffective in Controlling COVID-19 Throughout the pandemic, ZSFG monitored the effectiveness of employee temperature screening in managing COVID-19. Having screened and tracked our 6,000+ staff every day from March 2020-March 2021, our screening team found only one employee who had an elevated temperature, and no other symptoms, which was later found to be a false high temperature when re-measured with an oral thermometer. Therefore, the researchers concluded that temperature screening of healthcare personnel at a large US hospital, has no utility in detecting COVID-19 or controlling its transmission. Key members of this publication include: | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report HighlightsAnnual Residential Care Facility for the Elderly Survey In September 2021, the Community Care Licensing (CCL), a unit under the California Department of Social Services conducted an unannounced annual survey of the Residential Care Facility for the Elderly (RCFE). During their one-day survey, they toured the facility and reviewed infection control practices. They assessed staff training and policies, personal protective equipment inventory, quarantine and isolation strategies, signage, and social distancing of residents in communal areas. The surveyors cited zero deficiencies. The survey team reported that they were impressed with the implemented COVID-19 protocols and overall preparedness and organization of requested items during the survey. Successful Surveys California Department of Public Health Radiologic Health Branch Survey In September 2021, CDPH visited ZSFG to conduct the Radiologic Health Branch survey. Throughout the visit, surveyors reviewed the hospital's Computed Tomography (CT) program by conducting interviews, inspecting our CT scanner and reading relevant safety reports and service logs. They also reviewed our Radiation Safety and Dosimetry programs by inspecting our licensed machines and output testing, and touring the B25 X-ray and AVON Building. Overall, the survey team was extremely complimentary of our organization, staff, and Radiology services.

The MHRC provides rehabilitation services to clients with severe mental health issues and disabilities that require a secure environment. The surveyors focused on programming, nursing, food and nutrition services, and the environment of care. During the exit conference, surveyors stated that they were most impressed with: COVID-19 protocols and restrictions The MHRC's treatment plans. The surveyors requested permission to use the MHRC Treatment plan as a tool to assist other MHRCs to improve their practices. The quality and cleanliness of the kitchen, and the service overall. Some members of the MHRC team, from left to Survey Secondary to a self-report regarding blood transfusion submitted in 2021, in May 2022 CDPH conducted a validation survey to ensure that ZSFG was in compliance with Federal and State regulation related to the report. In May it was observed that there were areas that ZSFG needed to address to be fully compliant with federal regulation, and CDPH revisited the facility in August 2022 and found the hospital to be in full compliance with the previously submitted plan of correction and in substantial compliance with all federal regulations. Submission of a plan of correction for the state required improvements also occurred with no further inspections or follow up from CDPH required. Clinical Laboratory Accreditation Survey In June 2022, the Joint Commission conducted an unscheduled Clinical Laboratory Accreditation Survey. Surveyors reviewed the hospital's laboratory policies, procedures and how these are implemented in the operation of the Laboratory, they also observed care, treatment and services being delivered as they apply to the laboratories work including point-of-care testing and orientation and training of staff. The lab's success is well captured by these statistics: of the 226 lab standards and 993 elements of performance, only eight findings were identified, representing 99% compliance. Additionally, zero deficiencies were ranked high likelihood for harm, widespread scope, or immediate threat to life. The Anatomic Pathology Lab was inspected with no findings and many compliments about the department, staff, and procedures.

Completion is tracking for mid-to-late 2023. Building our Future29 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report True North Strategies29True North is ZSFG's unwavering commitment to our mission, vision, values, strategies and metrics that represent our efforts to becoming the health care organization of choice for patients and staff. To ensure we are moving in the right direction, ZSFG developed a True North Scorecard. The Executive Leadership Team focused on driving improvements to ensure ZSFG achieves our True North and strategic goals, by using A3 Thinking, Countermeasure Summaries and the Daily Management System. At the base of this triangle are our True North Pillars: Equity; Safety; Quality; Care Experience; Developing Our People; and Financial Stewardship; as well as the system we use to guide improvement work, the ZSFG Way. True North Goal Measure Targets (FY 21-22) Actuals (FY 21-22) Equity Departments Driving Equity 50% 50% Safety Patient Safety Composite 75% 75% Quality Access & Flow During COVID-19 80% 0%* Care Experience Real Time Survey Implementation Significantly impacted by COVID-19 variant surges* Developing our People Operationalizing \"Thriving Salary Variance $0.0M -$12.28M** *This year's strategic initiatives have been significantly impacted by the Delta and Omicron COVID-19 surges in summer 2021 and winter 2022. **The COVID-19-related costs have not yet been separated out of our operating fund to be charged to the COVID-19 budget. Therefore, these variances will appear inflated, but once these costs are removed, ZSFG is projected to have a salary variance of $0.00.True North Strategies TRUE NORTH OVERVIEW30 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report True North Strategies30FY21/22 was a year of deployment for ZSFG's strategic initiatives. With the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and deployment of key leaders to the COVID-19 response team, our Kaizen Promotion Office (KPO) pivoted its strategic initiatives to better serve ZSFG's COVID-19 response. In July 2020, the KPO restarted strategic planning with tools and processes designed for increased flexibility, prioritization, and rapid cycle implementation for the uncertain future. In November 2020, the KPO facilitated a Hoshin Strategic Planning Session for the ZSFG Executive Team Through this process the team approved six key performance indicators (KPI) and six corresponding strategies which align with ZSFG'S True North Pillars. This strategic planning session was used to determine strategic initiatives, assign executive owners and operational teams that would develop and implement organization-wide improvement plans. Calendar year 2021 focused on the continued deployment and operationalizing of these six strategic initiatives. Aiyana Johnson, ZSFG Chief Experience Officer, stated that: \"the Hoshin process this year was respectful of the pandemic we were trying to manage. The dynamic tools that were introduced enabled us to have meaningful discussions about what was important while being flexible enough to change direction if needed. It allowed us to be strategically resilient.\" ZSFG has pivoted to be more focused with our priorities, even throughout the pandemic, and remains committed to achieving our strategic goals in order to better serve our staff and patients. While progress was significantly impacted by the Delta and Omicron COVID-19 surges in 2021 and 2022, the following strategies represent ZSFG's initiatives for improvement over calendar year 2021 and into 2022.True North Strategies TRUE NORTH OVERVIEW31 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report True North Strategies31At ZSFG, equity means that there is a fair and adjusted opportunity for all to participate, which applies to health, resources, hiring opportunities, retention, workforce development, and overall experience. The pandemic has underscored the urgency and importance of our equity work, highlighting the major health care disparities within our patient population. ZSFG understands that the journey to equity requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the negative outcomes which stem from institutional racism and patterns of unequal and unequitable practices. Although change is difficult, the strong commitment is palpable towards an equitable solution and inclusion for all. ZSFG's goal is for its organizational commitment to equity to be at an Institutional Evolution level where the systematic barriers that inhibit the progress of equitable policies and practices are removed, equity strategies are proactively advanced, and staff and providers invest time and financial resources towards developing an environment of belonging. Over FY21/22, the team achieved their equity goal below. Selected Metrics Baseline (FY 21 -22) Target (FY 21 -22) Actual (FY 21-22) % of departments that have equity drivers with countermeasures. 30% 50% 50% True North Strategies EQUITY32 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report True North Strategies32As healthcare providers, it is our responsibility to provide safe, high quality care to the patients we serve. ZSFG leadership prioritized safety through the Hoshin process in previous fiscal years and saw significant reductions in harm events. However, over the past few years with a transition to the Epic system and the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in harm events. To monitor patient harm, the team has identified the following four metrics for the hospital to improve on. These harm events are being tracked via the monthly patient safety dashboard, Patient Safety and Performance Improvement Committee reports, the daily management system, root cause analysis, and condition-specific task forces. Moving forward, the team will continue to test and implement countermeasures that will improve our progress on the selected metrics. * Targets for Colon Surgical Site Infections and Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections are a continuation of FY 20/21 targets and are above previous year's baselines due to the team's focused effort on holding improvement gains, while prioritizing efforts to improve and address the remaining harm events that are off target. Selected Metrics Baseline (FY 20-21) Target (FY 21-22) Actual (FY 21-22) Patient Safety Composite 50% (2 out of 4) 75% (3 out of 4) 75% (3 out of 4) Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (rate/1,000 urinary catheter days)2.70 2.26 1.98 Central Associated Bloodstream Infection (rate/1,000 central line days)0.74 0.77* 0.46 Colon Surgical Site infection with (rate/1,000 Midnight Strategies | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report True North Strategies33*These current efforts have been substantially impacted by the Delta surge summer 2021, and the Omicron surge winter 2022. These surges impacted all areas of our Flow and Access Composite, specifically ED Diversion rates, adjusting OR scheduling to assist with hospital surges, and availability of specialty care visits. With high vaccination rates and low case counts in San Francisco, the next steps for this strategy are to ensure the consistent tracking of the following indicators across operational areas, and targeted problem solving to address those off-target, including the development of plans to communicate our progress to frontline staff. Healthcare quality falls into multiple domains that span effectiveness, efficiency, equity, patient centeredness, safety, and timeliness. Previously, the majority of ZSFG's quality work has been fragmented and siloed, as well as only focused on the inpatient quality indicators. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has turned much of ZSFG's efforts to operational readiness with less of a focus on improving quality indicators. However, operational flow and access to care are critical to several quality elements as well as better prepare our organization for ongoing COVID-19 surges.While ZSFG is engaged in the COVID-19 pandemic it must continue its True North goal of improving access and quality care for our patients. Over the next fiscal year, ZSFG will be focusing on developing a clear and unified approach for how to drive, improve, and sustain improvements with respect to quality across our key operational areas.

Since the development of CEX, the organization has undergone transformational events. During this time, CEX focused their efforts on supporting organizational priorities, but has been unable to quantify their impact on the patient experience due to limited measurement tools. Over the last decade, ZSFG has gained some insight on what the organization does well and what can be improved through the required CAHPS/patient experience survey. CEX will work to better quantify the patient experience at ZSFG by: 1. Continuing to roll out their real-time survey pilot to seven more departments across campus; 2. Developing an operational strategic plan; and 3. Fully operationalizing the Care Experience survey strategy. Once achieved, our CEX team will be able to not only quantify the patient experience, but also better understand where ZSFG can improve the quality of care for our patients and community.

Over the past five years, our staff and providers have experienced incredible change - moving into a new acute care building in 2016, implementing Epic in 2019 and working through a worldwide pandemic in \"survival mode\" over the past two years. Thus, COVID-19 thrusted our focus to addressing our staff and providers' basic needs of safety, stability and security during the first phase of the pandemic. This second phase provides us an opportunity to rethink how to engage a more fatigued workforce while reintegrating staff who have been working remotely or deployed elsewhere. COVID-19 has grounded us in four human experience principles that are important to our staff and providers: communication, wellness, safety and recognition. With this focus, the team strives to develop a framework that sustains the changes that have been implemented throughout the pandemic and foster a thriving work environment where our staff and providers feel safe and valued so they can provide the safest and most consistent care to our patients, while being a value added to their teams. At the same time, ZSFG understands that improving staff wellness and engagement requires a combined effort with other key strategic initiatives, such as Equity, Safety and Care Experience. Additionally, some high-value areas of staff wellness are out of ZSFG leadership's control such as parking, staffing and increased bonuses and salaries. Nonetheless, the team remains committed to improving the staff engagement focus areas of recognition, wellness, and communication by operationalizing the Thriving at Work Strategy.

For the City and County of San Francisco specifically, there was an initial projected loss of $1.7 billion. Moving forward, San Francisco and ZSFG are now faced with balancing the shortfall while maintaining critical city functions, prioritizing vulnerable populations, and continuing to respond to COVID-19. In order to achieve this goal, ZSFG's Finance Team implemented a major countermeasure this year of introducing the Finance and Operations summits which included: Reporting of available data to directors and executives via Tableau every two weeks, that included drill down functionality to invoice and/or employee depending on the report. Monthly meetings between the Finance Team and each Director and Executive to review data. These meetings occurred for Pharmacy, Nursing, Ancillary Services, Administration, and Quality totaling 19 service lines. Agreement on metrics, interpretation of data and areas of focus for financial performance, development of action plans and monthly follow-up. Moving forward, the team will continue to host these monthly summits and strengthen the partnership between the operational teams and finance team. Additionally, Finance will continue tracking factors related and not related to COVID-19 which may contribute to budget overages and develop plans to address any issues that arise in order to remain within our decreased budget.

ZSFG honored Cynthia Ma and Wynne Bamberg, two employees who have devoted decades of exemplary service. Cynthia Ma is a Senior Hospital Eligibility Worker who has dedicated 35 years of service to Patient Financial Services. Her enrollment and application assistance has been significant to some of the most impactful healthcare program changes over the years. She was part of the original Enrollment Unit team, created for the implementation of the Healthy San Francisco program in 2008, enrolling thousands of San Francisco residents. She was also part of the same team for the Affordable Care Act implementation in 2014, providing application assistance to the multiple new programs that it provided. Cynthia has assisted countless patients and has done so with patience, kindness, and respect. Wynne Bamberg spent much of her tenure within the Department of Psychiatry, where she held a variety of roles ranging from projects related to research, education and program development. She then joined the School of Medicine Vice Dean's Office in 2013 as the Executive Assistant to the ZSFG Vice Dean and is currently the Communications Analyst. She is a passionate and dedicated leader whose communication, willingness to help, and commitment to our mission have served our UCSF and ZSFG communities, especially during the pandemic. Her contributions and commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and other institutional initiatives exhibit a dedication to both ZSFG and UCSF's missions of innovation, education and clinical care. Our deepest gratitude to Cynthia Ma for 35 years of service and to Wynne Bamberg for 30 years of service! ZSFG would also like to thank and congratulate all the honorees for their incredible work.Annual Medical Staff Meeting In June, UCSF held their Annual Medical Staff meeting. Required by regulation, ZSFG uses the opportunity to celebrate staff. Three awards that celebrate faculty and trainees were given out: the Primary Care Awards, the Krevans Awards, and the Rapaport Award.

ZSFG celebrated with a special edition of the Stethoscoop that highlighted several nursing staff who received awards associated with Nursing Excellence and treated staff with a ZSFG tote bag. Well before the COVID-19 pandemic and certainly through it, advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and medical and patient care assistants put their heart and soul into the work they do at ZSFG. They are providing emergency care, inpatient care, procedural care, clinic care, care coordination, education, quality improvement or management. Representing more than 30% of our workforce at ZSFG, they are supporting our staff and our patients expertly and compassionately. Nursing is the heart of ALL clinical care at ZSFG and it is an honor to celebrate them during Nurse's Week and throughout the year. Staff Celebrations40 | ZSFG FY 21/22 Annual Report Staff CelebrationsEnvironmental Services 2021! September 2021, ZSFG celebrated Environmental Services (EVS) week. EVS is often referred to as the first line of defense against infection control. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, they were on the frontlines responding to the evolving guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting. Over the last year two years, the EVS team stepped into new roles to support citywide pandemic operations. A few EVS colleagues, for example, utilized their customer service skills during the vaccine rollout by providing line control, translations, and support at the Southeast Health Clinic. EVS Week was a time to recognize the uniqueness of the healthcare setting and the role EVS plays in patient-centered care. While the EVS team's day-to- day work may consist of cleaning, delivery of linens, disinfecting, and other measures to keep our spaces healthy and clean, the goal is to always serve our patients and their loved ones. Our deepest gratitude to our EVS team for being excellent stewards of our facilities and caring so diligently for our patients and our staff. With appreciation to Casie Aniya, Christine Falvey, Christopher Ross, Kathleen Kowal, and the ZSFG Executive team for their contributions to the production of this Annual Report and gratitude to Christine Baker and the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation for the photos.
