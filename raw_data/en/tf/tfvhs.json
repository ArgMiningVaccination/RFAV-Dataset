As a re- sult, a credit union may today lend the amount needed to pay for an operation, while tomorrow it may grant a loan to finance the purchase of a television set. As part of a survey to determine the purposes for which most loans were made during 1948, the Bureau of Fed- eral Credit Unions sent a question- naire in December 1948 to the credit committee chairmen of all Federal credit unions. Since the credit unions hold their annual meetings each Jan- uary and operating reports for the preceding calendar year are then made to the members, the question- naire was sent out with the suggestion that it be completed at the same time that the committees prepared the re- ports for the 1949 meetings. The Bureau emphasized that participation in the survey was optional. The questionnaire called for listing the total number and total amount of loans granted during 1948 for each of the following purposes : to finance the purchase of automobiles, household furniture and appliances, and other consumer durable goods: to pay taxes, funeral expenses, insurance premiums, current living expenses, vacation ex- penses, and home repair expenses; to pay medical, dental, and hospital expenses for adult members of the family, dependent children, and ma- ternity cases; to consolidate debts; to make investments in business ventures and in stocks and bonds: and for all other purposes. Most of the organizations holding charters under the Federal Credit Union Act represent occupational groups. Though Federal employees constitute the largest single occupa- * Division of Programs and Reports, Bureau of Federal Credit Unions. 12 Union Loans, 1948 by ERDIS W. SMITH * tional category, others with large numbers include State and local gov- ernments, schools, stores, railroads and other public utilities, and the petroleum industry. Of the groups classified as associational, almost a third are religious organizations. Almost two-thirds of the residential groups are rural community groups. Complete and usable returns pro- duced a sample equal to 10.6 percent of the 4,058 Federal credit unions in operation on December 31, 1948. To test the adequacy of the sample the reporting credit unions were classified by type of membershipoccupational, residential, or associational-and were compared with all Federal credit unions, similarly distributed. In ad- dition, the credit unions making re- turns were classified according to the amount of loans granted during the year and were compared with all Fed- eral credit unions classified by the amount of total assets. The tests in- dicated that the sample was a good cross section of all operating Federal credit unions. To interpret properly the tidings of the survey, it is necessary to keep two points in mind-the nature of Federal credit union lending policies and the difficulty of identifying ex- actly the purpose for which a loan is made. Federal credit unions, as noted above, are authorized to make loans to members for provident and produc- tive purposes. The board of directors for each Federal credit union estab- lishes the general operating policies, including the interest rate on loans, the maximum amount that may be loaned to any one member, and in some cases the type of security that may be accepted. The credit commit- tee, which must act on each loan ap- plication, administers the organiza- tion's loan policies. The committee may increase the collateral require- ments or cut the amount loaned in individual cases, but the amount loaned may not exceed the limitations fixed by the board of directors and by the Federal Credit Union Act. As a credit union increases in size, the board of directors usually liberalizes its loan policies. Generally, too, credit committees become more liberal as they gain experience and the members demonstrate their credit worthiness through transactions with the credit union. The standard loan application provides space for the member to write the purpose for which he is borrowing the money. The purpose as stated by the member is considered at the time the committee acts on the application. The specific application of the pro- ceeds from a cash loan may not be identifiable since, in general, the tot.al family income is apportioned among all family obligations. For instance, the \"rent money\" one month may be used to purchase a radio. A loan of approximately the same amount dur- ing the same month may be desig- nated as a loan to pay the rent or to pay for the radio.

This dif- ficulty in labeling the purpose of the loan\"is greater for such expenditures as payment of medical expenses, vaca- tion expenses, and home repairs than it is for the purchase of durable con- sumer goods, when the item pur- chased is pledged as security for the loan. When the questionnaire was de- signed, an effort was made to list a comprehensive group of loan purposes that would be generally applicable and so provide a basis for tabulation and analysis. No definitions of the purposes were provided, since it was believed that the titles were self-ex- planatory. The credit union officials tabulated the purposes stated on the loan appli- cations and grouped them under the various categories on the question- naire. While there were undoubtedly differences in grouping the data, due to differences in interpretation, it is believed that the general results of the survey are acceptable as indica- tions of the purposes for which loans were granted during 1948. When loans \"for all other purposes\" are ignored, the three most commonly given purposes were \"payment of cur- rent living expenses,\" \"consolidation of debts,\" and \"payment of medical, dental, and hospital expenses for adult members of the family\" (table 1). \"Payment of current living expenses\" was the most frequently cited purpose for five of the eight groubs in which credit unions were classified on the basis of the total amount of their loans granted during the year. The reporting credit unions were divided into those making loans of: debts\" was first in rank of number of loans granted for one group, second for four, and third for one. Loans for medical services for adult members of the family ranked as the third most fre- quently given purpose for all groups that had granted more than $1,000 in total loans during the year. In evaluating the loan practices of Federal credit unions, however, the number of loans granted in a given period is more significant than the amount of loans granted for various purposes, since the influence of the large credit unions that make large loans affects the aggregate percent- ages. This distortion is best illus- trated by the statistics for loans granted to purchase automobiles. While some automobile loans were granted by Federal credit unions in all eight groups during 1948, the num- ber granted ranged from 2 percent for the group making loans of less than $1,000 to 8.9 percent for the group with loans totaling $100,000 or more. In amount, on the other hand, auto- mobile loans ranged from 4.4 percent for the first group to 23.5 percent for the group of credit unions lending $100,000 or more. In amount, loans for the purchase of automobiles, consolidation of debts, and payment of current living ex- penses were the chief purposes in that order. Automobile loans made up the highest proportion of the amount loaned for the four groups of Federal credit unions that granted loans total- ing $10,000 or more during 1948. Con- solidation of debts accounted for the highest proportion of the amount loaned by three of the four groups that loaned less than $10,000; it ranked second for the three largest groups, consisting of Federal credit unions that loaned amounts in excess of $25,000. Loans to meet current living expenses, which ranged third in the amount loaned in the combined figures for all Federal credit unions, ranked second for three groups, fourth for four groups, and fifth for one group. Loans for home repairs ranked third for five groups, while loans to purchase household furniture and appliances, loans to pay medical bills for adult members of the family, and loans to consolidate debts each ranked third for one group. The survey indicates that Federal credit unions are serving the purpose for which the program was estab- lished. Credit unions provide, in gen- eral, remedial loan service for their members, and they supplement rather than compete with the lending serv- ices provided by banks and building and loan associations. Loans that en- able a family to adjust its finances to meet problems caused by declines in real income or sudden emergencies are not, as a rule, the type of loans banks choose to make, and need for such loans often forces people of small means to patronize money-lenders who charge high interest rates. Thus credit unions can and do provide a worth-while loan service in a field not adequately served at reasonable rates by commercial lending agencies. Bulletin, July 1949 846933-49-3 13 "}
