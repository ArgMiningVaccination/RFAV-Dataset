The Immune System The body's ability to protect itself from Infectious Disease. Will Sickness Occur? Immune System Components Source: http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/componen ts-of-the-immune-system What is an antigen? Anything that can be bound by an antibody Fragments of microbes can be antigens The foreign agent/antigen is recognised in a specific manner e.g -B Cells -T Cells What is an Antibody? Produced to one specific epitope (ie is antigen specific) Neutralises toxins Blocks adhesion/ cell entry Kills via complement Neutralises viral infectivity and prevents replication. Organisation of the Immune System Immunity without memory Physical barriers Chemical barriers Immunological barriers No memory of protection Immunity with memory : Passive Immunity Transfer of antibodies from people who have immunity to those who do not: Mother to baby across placenta Blood transfusion Blood products including immunoglobulin. Temporary protection Immunity with memory : Active Immunity Contact with disease Vaccination Body develops its own antibodies to the disease. Vaccines provide immunity without complications of the disease Consequences of Infection May be innocuous May cause serious Illness May cause death May have lifelong consequences and Lifelong Immunity (most of the time) Macrophages Digest most of the micro-organism Regurgitate the antigens Display antigens on their surface so that another type of white blood cell (lymphocytes) can take over. How Immunity works Macrophages and helper T cells T Cells B Cells Invader repelled Not forgotten. Memory Cells Once infection has been eliminated, some B and T cells become memory cells These retain memory of the antigen On re-exposure, powerful immune response. This ability of the immune system to have a memory for previous antigens is the basis for vaccination. Vaccines and How They Work History Evidence that Chinese used smallpox inoculation (variolation) as early as 1000AD Also practised in Africa & Turkey 1796: Edward Jenner used cowpox material to create immunity to smallpox. 1885: Louis Pasteur & Rabies Vaccine The Ideal Vaccine Produces the same immune protection as an infection without causing disease Generates long-lasting immunity Interrupts spread of infection How Soon After Immunisation are we Protected? In Simple Terms... Vaccines work by making us produce antibodies to fight disease without actually infecting us with the disease. If the vaccinated person then comes into contact with the disease itself, their immune system will recognise it and immediately produce the antibodies they need to fight it. 2 types of vaccines Live attenuated -Whole vaccines Inactivated - Whole vaccines -Viruses -Bacteria - Fractional -Protein-based -Polysaccharide-based Live Attenuated Vaccines Vaccines are longer lasting and require fewer boosters However the disease could mutate back to the pathogenic strain Harder to make for bacteria Examples: BCG/ MMR/ Rotavirus/ Varicella/ Yellow fever Non Live Vaccine Cannot cause disease Cannot replicate Immune response mainly antibody based Antibody titre falls with time 3-5 doses required Classified as whole inactivated/conjugate/recombinant/subunit Whole Inactivated Vaccine Organisms are killed or inactivated by heat or chemicals but remain antigenic. They are usually safe but less effective than live attenuated vaccines. Larger doses and more boosters are required. e.g. polio virus (IPV) Toxoid Vaccine A purified toxin produced by the antigen is used to elicit a response e.g. tetanus, diphtheria Sub unit Vaccine Contains only specific antigenic proteins of an infectious agent. Antigens have been separated from the rest of the vaccine e.g. acellular pertussis and some influenza. Recombinant Vaccine (a type of Subunit) Recombinant DNA technology e.g. HPV and Hep B Conjugate Vaccine Some bacteria are encapsulated making it difficult for the immune system to respond Carrier proteins are used which combine with antigens to improve immunogenicity Their efficacy and safety appear to be high. e.g. Men C , PCV, Hib. \"Other Ingredients\" needed to make a Vaccine Vaccine Components Suspension fluid (water, saline etc) Preservatives, stabilisers, antimicrobial diph Thiomersal Mercury used as a preservative and an inactivating agent In 1999 EU and US manufacturers decided to decrease thiomersal levels in vaccines as a precaution and to retain trust in vaccine supply WHO state that there is no evidence of toxicity All vaccines in the infant immunisation programme are thiomersal free Timing of Vaccines and their Side Effects Infant Immune System Naive - needs exposure to foreign antigen in order to develop normally Maternally acquired immunity is temporary and does not protect against all infections. The infant immune system has the capacity to cope with a vast array of antigens at any one time. Timing of Primary Immunisation Course Maternal IgG is transferred across the placenta Passively acquired IgG can suppress response to DTP , Polio, Men C and Hib for 2 months Maternal antibody to measles may interfere for 1 year. Why are Gaps Needed Between Doses? To allow each immune response to develop e.g. primary immunisation To avoid immune interference - if another live vaccine is given while the immune system is making a primary immune response, the activation of the innate immune system may neutralise the second vaccine. Hence we wait 4 weeks. Can Vaccines Overload the Immune System? We are exposed to countless antigens every day, in the food we eat, in the air we breathe, in the water we drink. The human body contains 100 trillion bacteria. The immune system is capable of responding to 100,000,000,000 antigens at a given time The MMR contains only 24 antigens. NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES OVERLOAD THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Vaccine failures Primary failure - when an individual fails to respond to the initial vaccine (eg 10% MMR) Secondary failure - responds initially but response wanes over time (most inactivated vaccines) Timing of Vaccine Reactions Inactivated - generally within 48h Live vaccine - according to time taken for virus to replicate e.g. MMR vaccine a)Reactions to measles (malaise, fever, rash) occur in 1st week b)Rubella (pain, joint swelling) in 2nd week c)Mumps (parotid swelling) in 3rd week Adverse events Live vaccine - frequency of adverse events falls with number of doses Inactivated vaccines - frequency of adverse events increases with number of doses... if antibody levels are good, this binds to antigen in subsequent dose, producing an immune response which, if big enough, is inflammatory Susceptible populations Not everyone produces an immune response Not everyone can get certain vaccinations Other factors e.g. immunosuppression can cause susceptibility "}
