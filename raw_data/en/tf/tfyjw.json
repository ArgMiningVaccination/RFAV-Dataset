SPAM) indi cate that these nuisance solicitations are finding their way into e-mail accounts with ever increasi ng frequency. Studies indicate that one of the leading ways spammers obtain legitimate e-mail addresses is through the use of \"spam-bots\", which are specialized computer programs that automatically harvest e-mail addresses from web pages and other documents that are posted onlin e (just like this report). Once a valid e-mail address has been located and distributed to othe r \"spammers\" there is sure to be a dramatic increase in the amount of spam received by that e-mail address. In this report, we have taken a measure to help protect the e-mail addresses that are listed inside. The text \"SPAM-ZAP\" (without quotation marks) ha s been inserted directly after the \"@\" symbol in each e-mail address in this report - an example of this format follows: john.smithSPAM- ZAP@maine.gov . Inserting this \"SPAM-ZAP\" text creates a bogus e-mail address that will cause any automatically generated SPAM e-mail to be sent to the invalid address instead of to the real e-mail address. Ultimately, any e-mail messages th at are sent to that bogus address will not make it through to the intended recipient - this is true of both legitimate messages as well as SPAM. Instructions for readers who wish to e-mail a contributor to this report: 1) Click on the desired e-mail address or copy th e address into a new message inside your e-mail client. 2) Remove the capitalized words \"SPAM-ZAP\" (t here will be no quotation marks) from the e- mail address. 3) Write your message and send it out as you normally would. Thank you for your understanding of this issue a nd for your willingness to work with any minor inconveniences associated with our use of this anti-spam method. We hope that readers will support our efforts to eliminate this document as a potential source of e-mail addresses that could be used by spammers, while still providing a means for the public to contact individual contributors to this report. S i n c e r e l y , Marianne DuBois and Susan Davies 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 7 CHAPTER 1 PREFACE Contact: Susan Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: (207)441-9271 email: Susan.p.davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov The following report is submitted to simultaneously fulfill requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA) particularly the Section 305(b) Report, Section 303(d) List, and information requested under Section 314, and, also to serve as a biennial report to the Maine Legislature as required under 38 MRSA Section 464.3.A. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (The Department or MDEP) assembles these reports with input from many sources and recognizes that the Section 305(b) Report and Section 303(d) List are important ways of regularly communicating information on the health, current status and trends of the State's waters. For the 2010 Integrated Report the Department has updated tabular summaries of water quality status (Appendices; Chapter 4 and Chapter 8) that appeared in the 2008 Integrated Report. Where needed, Department staff and external contacts have also updated narrative content, including programmatic descriptions and summary information. For more in-depth background information about specific water quality programs please refer to the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Report, available on the web at: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm Maine waterbodies are assigned to one of five categories (or sub-categories) that describe water quality status in the Integrated Report (Executive Summary, page 9 and Ch 4). Those waters that are currently listed under category 5 represent U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) \u00a7303d list \"impaired waters\" and require development and submission of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) report to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The 2010 Integrated Report provides: Delineation of water quality assessment units (AUs), identified by their 10-digit HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) followed by a waterbody-specific code (Appendices II-IV); Water quality attainment status for river, lake and marine Assessment Units (Appendices II-IV); First time attainment status reporting for wetland assessment units (Chapter 5 and Appendices) o Summary of wetland assessment methodology First time attainment status reporting based on assessment of river and stream algal assemblages (Chapter 4 Assessment Criteria and Appendices) o Summary of algal assessment methodology Basis for the water quality standard attainment determinations for river, stream, lake and marine Assessment Units (Chapter 4 and Appendices); Schedules for additional monitoring planned for certain Assessment Units (Appendices II-IV); Identification of Assessment Units requiring Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) determinations and a schedule (priority) for those waters (Chapter 8 and Appendices II-IV); 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 8 The 2010 Integrated Report presents State of Maine water quality assessment summaries for rivers, streams and lakes that have been generated by the Assessment Database (ADB). ADB is public domai n software developed by EPA to improve states' ability to track and document water quality assessment results. Though marine and wetland assessment data are not currently stored in Maine's ADB, assessment results are reported in the 2010 Appendices. DATA SOURCES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS SOURCES OF RIVER AND STREAM ASSESSMENT DATA The Department generates much of the data for the assessment through the various monitoring programs it conducts, notably the Biomonitoring Program, Surface Water Ambient Toxics Monitoring Program, the Diox in Monitoring Program, and the Atlantic Salmon Recovery Plan. Additionally, data are provided from a variety of professional and volunteer monitoring groups. These include other state agencies and resources (Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Atlantic Salmon Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, University of Maine System), federal agencies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service), other governmental agencies (Saco River Corridor Commission, St. Croix International Waterway Commission), tribes (Penobscot Indian Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians) and a number of volunteer watershed groups and conservation organizations that are working cooperatively with Department staff and that follow an EPA approved Quality Assurance Project Plan, or that follow monitoring practices specifically approved by MDEP (Watershed councils of the Dennys, East Machias, Machias, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Ducktrap and Sheepscot Rivers, Presumpscot River Watch, Royal River Conservation Trust, Sheepscot Valley Conservation Association, The Nature Conservancy, Friends of Merrymeeting Bay). SOURCES OF LAKE ASSESSMENT DATA The Department's Lake Assessment Section manages much of the data collected from lakes within the state. A strong partnership with the Maine Volunteer Lakes Monitoring Program (VLMP, Inc.) assures the quality and comparability of the data collected through numerous regional entities and local lake associations. Regional entities include Cobbossee Watershed District, Lakes Environmental Association, St. Croix International Waterway Commission, Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Penobscot Indian Nation, Portland Water District, Auburn Water District, Acadia National Park, and Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust. Data has also been acquired from private consultants (such as Lake and Watershed Resource Management Assoc., Biodiversity Research Institute, Florida Power and Light as part of regulatory requirements) and water utilities that belong to the Maine Water Utility Association. Additional data is acquired through the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife (DIF&W) and through cooperative projects with the University of Maine System, Colby College, Unity College, Soil and Water Conservation Districts and similar entities. Data collected under probability based studies conducted within EPA Region I and as part of the National Lake Assessment Study being conducted by EPA Headquarters is also considered. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 9 SOURCES OF MARINE ASSESSMENT DATA The Maine Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Marine Resources (DMR), the Maine Healthy Beaches Program, the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (CBEP) and a variety of volunteer monitoring groups monitor Maine's coastal waters. DEP monitors toxic contaminants in tissues and assesses water quality using data collected by DEP, especially the Surface Water Ambient Toxics program, and others. DEP participates in the Gulf of Maine Council's Gulfwatch Project that surveys toxic contamination in mussel tissue in the Gulf of Maine. DMR monitors for indicators of human pathogens (fecal coliforms) and biotoxins (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning). The purpose of the DMR monitoring is to protect human health by managing shellfish harvest areas. The Maine Healthy Beaches Program monitors ocean beaches in order to provide protection of swimmer health. The Casco Bay Estuary Project (CBEP), funded by EPA's National Estuary Program, also monitors and supports monitoring in Casco Bay and coordinates the National Coastal Assessment for the entire Maine coast. CBEP data for the current reporting cycle will be available in late May 2010 in an updated State of the Bay report (http://www.cascobay.usm.maine.edu/ ). SOURCES OF WETLANDS ASSESSMENT DATA The Department generates most of its assessment data for wetlands through the Biological Monitoring Program (see Chapter 5 for additional information). Wetland biomonitoring is coordinated with the State's river and stream biomonitoring program using a 5-year rotating basin schedule. At present, annual wetland monitoring is primarily focused on freshwater lacustrine and riverine fringe wetlands. Under Maine's Water Classification Program, wetlands are classified with associated surface waters. Wetlands that are part of great ponds or natural lakes and ponds less than 10 acres in size are considered GPA waters. All freshwater wetlands not classified as GPA waters are classified under Sections 467 and 468 (Classification of Major River Basins and Classification of Minor Drainages) according to the drainage basin in which they occur and the classification of associated water bodies. The 2010 305(b) report includes provisional class attainment st atus for monitored wetlands based on the State's narrative biological criteria. Data for permitted wetland gains and losses is provided through the DEP Wetland Loss Tracking System by the Division of Land Resource Regulation . 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 10 CHAPTER 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RESPONSE TO COMMENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SURFACE WATERS This report continues to base assessments of streams & rivers, lakes & ponds, and marine & estuarine waters on the five main listing categories that were initially established for these waters in the 2002 305b Report. These five main assessment categories are as follows: Category 1: Attaining all designated uses and water quality standards, and no use is threatened. Category 2: Attains some of the designated uses; no use is threatened; and insufficient data or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened (with presumption that all uses are attained). Category 3: Insufficient data and information to determine if designated uses are attained (with presumption that one or more uses may be impaired). Category 4: Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses, but does not require development of a TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) report. Category 5: Waters impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s), and a TMDL report is required. Section 4-1 on Assessment Methodology contains more detailed information on the listing categories and sub-categories. SUMMARY OF CHANGES The size and percentage results from the 2002 through 2010 Integrated Reports are not exactly comparable due to changes in assessment and mapping technology over the years, but they can give an idea of changes in the approximate amounts of waters in each category. This information is displayed in Table 2-1. Table 2-1 shows that 75 river and stream miles have been delisted from Category 5 for the 2010 cycle. Most of the decrease in Category 5A is due to approval of the Maine Statewide Bacteria TMDL that moved many waterbodies to Category 4A. Increases in Category 2 waters also occurred due to new TMDL monitoring data that confirmed that certain segments are now a ttaining uses. TMDL monitoring confirmed attainment of bacteria criteria for five pr eviously listed waterbodies. Table 2-1 reveals that the lakes and ponds of Maine were relatively stable (as a percent of total assessed waters) with respect to their listing categories during the 2008 to 2010 time frame. This period saw a major reduction in category 3 and an increase in category 2, 4a and 5a waters. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 11 Table 2-1 Summary of Changes to Surface Water Assessment Categories - 2008 to 2010 Note: These figures do not include waters listed under Category 4A for atmospheric deposition of mercury Rivers and Streams 31,217= Total Miles Assessed in 2008 31,215=Total Miles Assessed in 2010 2008 Miles in Category* % of Total 2008 Assessed Miles2010 Miles in Category** % of Total 2010 Assessed Miles% Change '08-'10 Change in Miles '08 - '10 Category 1 4,347 14 4,338 14 0 -9 Category 2 25,371 81 25,378 81 0 +7 Category 3 295 1 314 1 0 +19 Category 4 214 <1 461 1.4 0 +247 Category 5 990 3 730 2 0 -260 Lakes 986,952 = Total Acres Assessed in 2008 986,952 = Total Acres Assessed in 2010 2008 Acres in Category % of Total 2008 Assessed Acres2010 Acres in Category % of Total 2010 Assessed AcresChange in Acres '08- '06 Change in Acres '10-'08 Category 1 295,443 29.9 295,443 29.9 0 606,236 73,600 0.9 -1,312 5,125 Marine Waters (Acres) 1,821,434 = Total Acres Assessed in 2008 1,821,434 = Total Acres Assessed in 2010 2008 Acres in Category % of Total 2008 Assessed Acres2010 Acres in Category % of Total 2010 Assessed Acres% Change '08 - '10 Change in 98,380 Marine Waters (Square Miles) 2,846 = Total Square Miles Assessed in 2008 2,846 = Total Square Miles Assessed in 2010 2008 Square Miles in Category % of Total 2008 Assessed Square Miles 2010 Square Miles in Category % of Total 2010 Assessed Square Miles % Change '08 - '10 Change in Square Miles 153.72+*** by final 2008 cycle ADB **Single-Category Reporting miles as generated by final 2010 cycle ADB ***Variable additional miles due to Co mbined Sewer Overflow waters All freshwaters in Maine are listed for an impaired Fish Consumption Use caused by mercury from sources beyond the region; miles affected by this statewide listing are not recorded in Table 2-1. These waters were listed in Sub-Category 5C in the 2006 Integrated Report. These waters have now been moved to Category 4A because of US EPA's approval, on December 20, 2007, of a Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load. The New England States and New York developed the regional mercury TMDL to address mercury impairments t hat are caused by sources beyond the 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 12 Region. The State of Maine has already taken aggressive action to reduce sources of mercury within the State's jurisdiction. Further mercury reductions will be required from sources outside the State's boundaries to provide the desired reduction of mercury in Maine's waters. Category 5D, Legacy Pollutants, includes many mainstem river segments that are listed for non-attainment of the Fish Consumption use due to PCBs in fish tissue. In September of 2009 EPA approved a Statewide Maine Bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load that resulted in the removal of 205 bacteria-impaired segments from Category 5A and 5B to Category 4A or Category 2. The TMDL addressed bacteria impairments caused by Eschericia coli in freshwaters and Enterococcus in estuarine and marine waters. These 205 segments are located in 13 of Maine's 21 major watersheds (8-digit hydrologic unit code basins). Sixty-two of the delisted waterbodies are river and stream segments and 143 are estuarine and marine assessment units. WETLANDS Maine DEP began development of a biological monitoring and assessment program for freshwater wetlands in 1998 as part of the biomonitoring program. The Biological Monitoring Program provides water quality information for a wide array of programs, and includes ambient monitoring, evaluation of water quality classification attainment, and assessment of risks and impacts. The wetlands initiative currently focuses on aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of wetland ecological integrity, and plans to build capacity to assess multiple biological assemblages including algae and plant communities. Beginning with the current reporting cycle, the Biological Monitoring Report will include provisional assessments for wetland attainment of water quality standards. GROUND WATER The Groundwater Program is described in Chapter 6. Responsibility for ground water resource assessment and protection is shared among the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Environmental Health, the Maine Geological Survey in the Department of Conservation and the U. S. Geological Survey. Several other agencies, particularly the Department of Transportation, Department of Agriculture, and State Planning Office may investigate ground water contamination problems in certain areas and they also contribute to ground water protection through development of ordinances and management practices that are designed to reduce the risk of harming ground water quality. A significant portion of Maine's ground water may be threatened by contamination, particularly in unforested areas, which comprise approximately 11% of the State. Drinking water quality is an issue that carries significant public concern for both private and public well supplies. Public interest in ground water is primarily focused on its use as a drinking water supply (ground water provides 60% of all human demand and 75% of livestock demand statewide) and on its us e as a source of process water for industry. Numerous wells in Maine have been made unpotable by pollution from specific point sources and also from nonpoint source pollution. Important sources of ground water contamination in Maine include disposal activities such as septic 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 13 systems and landfills, leaking storage faci lities, agriculture, spilled hazardous materials or previously unregulated activities. Monitoring of ground water in Maine is either site-specific or generalized. Monitoring at a particular site is typically done to gather data on water quality impacts of particular activities, and may or may not be research-related. Most of the ground water data collected in Maine is the result of permit conditions, enforcement agreements or impact assessments. With the advent of the Environmental and Geographic Analysis Database (EGAD) at the DEP, many of these data which are potentially useful for research purposes are now readily made available to the public or other agencies in report or map form. This effort enhances the ability of the DEP to communicate and report ground water and other data to the EPA and other state or federal agencies. Ambient monitoring refers to large area, long-term monitoring conducted to obtain trend information on ground water quality or quantity. The MGS and the USGS carry out these types of monitoring projects under several cooperative agreements. The USGS and MGS maintain a statewide network of ground water observation wells to track changes in water quality and quantity. For the purpose of this report, data derived from the DHHS Public Water Supply Monitoring Program are used as ambient ground water quality data. These water tests are from single-source untreated public water supply wells. Major impediments to effective ground water protection in Maine include; the lack of data to quantify the impact of some nonpoint pollution sources and general public unfamiliarity with key ground water concepts and issues. Public misconception about ground water is probably the major factor contributing to degradation of this resource. The development of a comprehensive and accessible database for water data (EGAD) has increased the accessibility of the wide variety of data collected on water quality by various state agencies. Continuing use of this database will improve operations at the agencies responsible for ground water protection and assessment, and provide a resource for increasing the general public's awareness of ground water issues. Relative to ground water protection the principal uses of this database are to (1) help design clean-up strategies in areas of known contamination; (2) plan future development that better provides for protection of public health and safety; (3) assist in prioritizing protection of sensitive ground water and surface water bodies, wetlands, and other resources; (4) enhance understanding of the spatial relationships between water resources and population as they relate to potential or known pollution sources; and (5) assess the flow and transport interrelationships between surface and ground water quality, in order to evaluate ground water impacts on surface water bodies and on ground water dependent habitat. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 14 RESPONSE TO COMMENTS PROCESS TO SOLICIT PUBLIC COMMENTS The following subsections detail the actions taken by the Department of Environmental Protection to promote the public's knowledge of the existence and availability of the draft version of the 2010 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report (commonly known as the 305b Report). This process was undertaken in order to gain comments from the public on the contents and conclusions of the draft report. The official period of time that the Report was available for public comment was from July 29, 2010 to the close of business on August 27, 2010. In addition to the public comment process outlined below, the draft version of the 2010 305b Report was reviewed internally by Department staff as well as by US EPA staff in order to produce the final version of the Report. REPORT POSTING ON THE DEPARTMENT 'S WEBSITE : On July 29, 2010 the Department posted the draft 2010 305b Report as two digital files in the Adobe\u00ae Portable Document Format (PDF) on the public comments section of its Bureau of Land and Water Quality website. Hardcopies of the draft report are made available to the public on request. POSTAL MAILING TO THE AGENCY RULEMAKING SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE LIST: The Department offers a subscription service that provides notification of both rulemaking changes and rule adoption for all department rules. Subscribers to this service include both individual citizens and r epresentatives of organizations that wish to be contacted when the DEP releases rulemaking information. During the week of July 29, 2010 the Department mailed out approximately 150 letters to people and entities on the Agency Rulemaking Subscription Service List, including all other natural resource agencies within state government. The text of that letter follows and is italicized in order to differentiate it from other text contained in this Report. Maine's DRAFT 2010 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report Available for Public Co mment until August 27, 2010 The Department of Environmental Protection has pr epared a draft 2010 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for submission to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as required of Sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, and in fulfillment of the reporting requirements of 38 M.R.S.A. Section 464.3.A of the State of Maine's Water Classification Program. This report is available for public comment untilAugust 27, 2010. Reviewers of the document should pay particular attention to the categories and listing methods required by the USEPA for the surface water assessments in this report. These methods are de scribed in Chapter 4. Specific surface waterbody attainment and impairment assignments can be found in the Appendices (a separate file). The appendices are broken into three waterbody types: rivers/streams, lakes, and estuarine/marine waters. Categories 1-3 are for waters that are not impaired, categories 4 and 5 are for water segments that are impaired for one or more uses. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 15 The draft documents (pdf files) can be found on the Department's website at: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/draft.htm We encourage you to review the docum ent and provide comment on this year's report.

Davies 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 16 Maine Department of Environmental Protection State House #17 Augusta, ME 04333 PRESS RELEASE : On July 29, 2010 the Department of Environmental Protection issued a press release designed to inform the public of the availability of the draft 2010 305b Report. This release also described how the DEP was seeking public comment on water quality listings in the Report. Between fifteen and eighteen radio, television and print outlets around the state received the press release and it was also linked to a news headline on the Department's homepage. The release also went to the Associated Press, which places the release on its \"wire\" for other media outlets to run, if they so choose. The text of that press release follows and is italicized in order to differentiate it from other text contained in this Report. DEP Seeks Comment on Water Quality (AUGUSTA)\u2014The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is soliciting public comment on the latest review of the health of Maine's lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters. Once the review recei ves final Environmental Protection Agency approval, the water quality ratings in the 2010 Integrated Water Q uality Monitoring and Assessment Report help to determine planning and funding priorities for water quality improvements. The DEP is asking the public to comment on the draft report now posted on the web: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/draft.htm Comments become part of the public record and are printed in the final version of the report. The comment deadline is 5:00 PM, August 27, 2010. The Department encourages the public to review and comment on the evaluations contained in the Integrated Water Quality Report. . \"These a ssessments drive decisions as to how particular public waters will be managed into the future. F eedback from the public on the accuracy of our evaluations is important to this process\" says David Courtemanch, Director of the Division of Environmental Assessment The report, also known as the \"305b Report\", a re quirement of the federal Clean Water Act, is a water quality snapshot. Prepared every two years, the public can look back to see if and how the assessment of their favorite lake or stream has changed. One section lists waters determined to be \"impaired\" due to problems that affect one or more officially assigned \"uses\" of the waterbody such as support of 'impaired' listing can set into motion the preparation of a specific management plan detailing activities designed to bring a wat er body back into full-use compliance,\" notes Courtemanch. \"Those activities c an range from more vigilant monitoring to complete abatement of a pollutant.\" The 2010 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring a nd Assessment Report is based on information gathered by the DEP along with other state, federal, tribal, local agencies, non-government organizations and volunteer monitoring groups. DEP analyzes data to assess the capacity of 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 17 Maine waters to support drinking water, fishing, recreation (such as swimming) and their ability to sustain aquatic life as defined in Maine's wa ter classification laws. The report also provides extensive information on the status of Maine's groundwater and wetland resources.H ighlights of this year's report include the delisting of a total of 205 bacteria-impaired river and marine waters due to completion and federal approval of a Statewide bacteria restoration plan for Maine. Three Maine lakes have also been delisted due to attainment of water quality standards. One lake and four streams have been added to the impaired waters list for the 2010 Report. SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND RESPONSES The Department received public comments from the partie s listed below. Issues raised by comments from these organizations or individuals are either quoted or paraphrased and are presented in italic typeface. The DEP response to that comment follows the comment and summarizes any actions taken by the Department in response to the comment. If the text does not indicate that any changes were made to the Draft Int egrated Report, then none were made. Support for the decision to list the Androscoggin River as Impaired by a Non-pollutant, due to inadequate passage of American shad at the Brunswick Dam, Paraphrased Comments from: Greg D'Augustine, citizen Nick Bennett, Natural Resources Council of Maine Landis Hudson, Maine Rivers Sean Mahoney, Conservation Law Foundation The Department has made an appropriate decis ion to list the Lower Androscoggin River in Category 4C (impaired by a non-pollutant). As documented by the Maine Department of Marine Resources, the Brunswick Dam on the Androscoggin River has been a virtually impassable barrier to indigenous populations of American shad for many years, resulting in decimation of the shad population in the River above the dam. Class C waters in Maine must \"support all species of fish indigenous to the receiving waters\" (38 MRSA \u00a7465(4)(C)). The Lower Androscoggin clearly fails to do this due to problems with the fishway at the Brunswick Dam, thus an \"Impaired\" listing is appropriate. MDEP Response: In March 2010 the Androscoggin River Alliance requested that the Department list the Lower Androscoggin River in Category 4C. The Department agrees that shad passage is a long-standing problem at this Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-licensed facility. The fish passage device at the Brunswick dam has repeatedly failed to allow passage of a sufficient number of shad to establish a sustainable population in the river above the dam. The FERC license requires fish 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 18 passage at the Brunswick Dam in support of a State of Maine anadromous fish restoration plan for the Androscoggin. For this reason the Department agrees and has listed the River in Category 4C. West Branch Sheepscot River, bacteria impairments Paraphrased comments from: Jennie Bridge, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 1 This waterbody was listed as impaired for bacteria in the 2002 Integrated Report but has not been officially delisted. Documentation of attainment of bacteria standards is needed for delisting. MDEP Response: We have confirmed that the bacteria im pairment was erroneously dropped in the 2004 Report. This segment has been re-listed in Category 5A for excursions of Class AA bacteria criteria and will be included in the next update of the Statewide Bacteria TMDL. Invasive Aquatic Plant Program Paraphrased comments from: Peter Lowell, Lakes Environmental Association The section on Invasive Aquatic Plants should be broadened to mention all key elements of the state program: Courtesy Boat Inspector training and grants, the role of Maine COLA's, Lakes Environmental Association, and the Maine Milfoil Initiative and plant control projects and grants . MDEP Response: The language under Invasive Aquatic Plants in the report has been revised to included reference to boat inspector training and the grant program available for local inspection and invasive plant removal projects. Maine COLA and Lakes Environmental Association are recognized as coordinators of inspector training. The Maine Milfoil Initiative, which began in the 2009 calendar year, will be included since this reporting cycle is 2007 and 2008. Eelgrass loss in the Piscataqua River Estuary Paraphrased comments from: Philip Trowbridge, New Hampshire Department of Environmenatl Services MDEP has listed the Piscataqua River as Category 3 for eelgrass loss reported by NH Dept. Environmental Services. The report indicates that eelgrass in the Piscataqua River has not been surveyed. However, eelgrass on the Maine side of the Piscataqua River has been mapped by NH every year for a decade. The only areas not assessed by NH are the tidal creeks, such as Spinney Creek, Spruce Creek, and Chauncey Creek. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 19 MDEP Response: The Department agrees with this comment and has changed the Draft 2010 Report to reflect the existence of survey data collected by NH. The Department has begun to collaborate with NH DES and others to assemble existing data on eelgrass losses in the Piscataqua River Estuary. Dioxin Paraphrased comments from: Nick Bennett, NRCM Dioxin should not be characterized as a \"legacy pollutant\". Although the process is termed \"chlorine-free\", bleaching of wood pulp with chlorine dioxide, by the paper industry, creates an interim product (HOCl) that release Cl 2 when it reacts with pulp. MDEP Response: MDEP agrees that absolute elimination of the production of dioxin secondary to the bleaching process has probably not been accomplished and is impossible to measure. Results of DEP's Above/Below test documented (by 2004 for 4 of 5 bleached kraft pulp and paper mills, and by 2005 for the last mill) that there was no measurable difference in dioxin concentrations in fish above and below each mill. If a small unmeasurable discharge is still occurring, it is not significant with respect to bioaccumulation in fish compared to the MCDC's Fish Tissue Action Level. Algae blooms in the Penobscot River Paraphrased comments from: Dan Kusnierz Penobscot Indian Nation Water quality data collected by the Penobscot Indian Nation and Maine DEP indicate that nutrient enrichment and algae blooms begin in Dolby Pond on the West Branch of the Penobscot. Blooms have occurred in 2001, 2004 and 2007. The significant algae bloom documented in 2007 resulted in a consent agreement imposed by MDEP on Penobscot River dischargers to reduce levels of phosphorus discharged to the River. The entire Penobscot River from Dolby Pond on the West Branch down to the Penobscot River Estuary and Penobscot Bay should be included in the Category 5A listing for dissolved oxygen impairment and nutrient enrichment and biological indicators. MDEP Response: The Department agrees that the Penobscot River has exhibited water quality problems, especially for nutrients in 2007. We do not have documentation that there have been excursions of dissolved oxygen below Class C standards in the segments of the Penobscot above the Mattawamkeag River, though Class B segments do have criteria excursions. The Department has previous ly listed 2 mainstem segments (Penobscot mainstem between the Mattawamkeag confluence and the Piscataquis confluence) in Category 5A due to dissolved oxygen and nutrient issues. More intensive analysis of 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 20 2007 monitoring data has confirmed that additional segments (see below) exceeded draft nutrient criteria in 2007. Furthermore, segments below the confluence with the Piscataquis River also showed excursions of dissolved oxygen criteria in 2007. In response to this confirmation and PIN's comments, the final 2010 Integrated Report has been changed to list several new sections in Category 4B - \"Rivers and streams impaired by pollutants- Pollution control requirements reasonably expected to result in attainment\" and to list other segments in Category 5A-\"Impaired by a pollutant; TMDL required\". A Category 4B listing requires that enforceable controls be in place. Due to a November 2007 consent agreement issued by MDEP that imposed reductions in phosphorus loads from the Katahdin Paper Company, the segments between Dolby Pond and the Mattawamkeag River have enforceable controls in place and are expected to attain water quality standards. Therefore the following segments have been moved to Category 4B - \"Impaired/Expected to Attain Uses\" : West Branch Penobscot below Millinocket Stream (including Dolby Pond) AU# 0102000109_205R01 mainstem above confluence with Mattawamkeag River AU# 0102000512_229R Additional segments have been changed from Category 2 (attaining for dissolved oxygen and Nutrients/eutrophication biological indicators) to Category 5A - Impaired by a pollutant; TMDL required\" Assessment of data from 2007 confirms excursions of Class B dissolved oxygen criteria and Nutrients/eutrophication biological indicators. Because these segments are affected by discharges not covered by the consent agreement the following segments have been placed in Category 5A, rather than 4B: Penobscot river mainstem from Piscataquis to Orson Island AU# 0102000506_232R Penobscotr River from The Penobscot River classification changes from riverine Class B to Estuarine Class SC at Reeds Brook in Hampden and we do not have documentation that there have been excursions of dissolved oxygen below Class SC standards in the estuarine segments. Completion of an updated Penobscot River water quality model is a top priority for the Department. Once the model is completed (draft expected in December 2010) new licenses will be issued, based on the pollutant loading limits prescribed by the model such that the Penobscot can be expected to attain water quality standards. Current conditions in the River are already much improved over 2007 due to the phosphorus reductions and suspension of operations at the Katahdin Paper mill in Millinocket. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 21 CHAPTER 3 BACKGROUND STATE ATLAS AND WATER QUALITY STANDARDS Contact: Vicki Schmidt, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: (207) 287-3901 email: vicki.l.schmidt@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov The State of Maine has a total surface area of over 35,000 square miles, the most in New England; with dry land occupying almost 31,000 square miles and the larger surface waters occupying about 4,500 square miles. With a population of about 1.3 million people, Maine also is the least densely populated state in New England. However, since most of the population is concentrated in the southern and coastal portions of the State and into bands on both sides of Interstate 95, regional population densities may vary considerably from the state's average population density. Maine's 5,780 lakes and ponds cover 986,952 acres, an area that is somewhat larger than the State of Rhode Island. There are over 7,000 perennial brooks, streams and rivers in Maine, ranging in length from less than two miles to nearly 200 miles, with an estimated total length of 53,456 miles. In 2009 the State of Maine began making the switch to the use of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) for measuring and categorizing our coastline, rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. The higher resolution of the NHD and changes in data definitions has contributed to differences from earlier reports. The NHD defines the coastline as the shoreline extending to the mouth of rivers and streams. The previous version of the Geographic Information System (GIS) boundary data layer defined the coastline as extending along the shoreline up rivers and streams to the head of tide. This created a smalle r overall figure for shoreline miles (2,756 using the NHD compared to 5,261) and a larger figure for total miles of rivers and streams (53,456 using the NHD compared to 45,176). The higher resolution data changes the overall calculated length of the combined shoreline, rivers and streams from 50,437 to 56,212 miles. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory of inland and coastal wetlands in Maine calculated a total wetland area of more than 3,300,000 acres. Also noteworthy is that at least 1,281 square miles of the state are underlain by significant sand and gravel aquifers (up fr om 1,241 square miles as reported in 2004).

Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Tel: (207) 441-9271 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/classification/index.htm The water quality of Maine is described in terms of physical, chemical and biological characteristics associated with the state's water classification program. As established in Maine statute (38 MRSA Sections 464-470), the classification program consists of designated uses (e.g. drinking water supply, recreation in and on the water, habitat for fish and other aquatic life), criteria (e.g. bacteria, dissolved oxygen and biological criteria), and characteristics (e.g. natural, free flowing) that specify levels of water quality necessary to maintain the designated uses. All State waters have a classification assignment (Lakes: GPA. Rivers and streams: AA, A, B, C. Marine and estuarine: SA, SB, SC). Wetlands are classified the same as other associated surface waters. Wetlands that are part of great ponds or natural lakes and ponds less than 10 acres in size are GPA waters. All freshwater wetlands not classified as GPA waters are class AA, A, B or C under Sections 467 and 468 according to the watershed in which they occur. Coastal wetlands are classified SA, SB or SC according to the provisions of Section 469 (Classification of Estuarine and Marine Waters). The classification program is reviewed every three years by the Department and the Board of Environmental Protection (Board). The Department and the Board conducted a water classification review process in 2009 with the result that the Maine State Legislature raised the water quality classifications (goals) for 16 rivers and streams and one marine waterbody . The Board also recommended, and the Legislature approved, that changes be made to clarify the classification of six other waterbody segments, and that a Use Attainability Analysis be conducted on one stream. HIGHLIGHTS FOR POINT SOURCE POLLUTION CONTROL PROGRAMS Contact: Brian Kavanah, DEP BLWQ, Division email: Brian.W.Kavanah@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/wastepage.htm Maine uses multiple approaches to ensure that point source discharges of wastewater receive adequate treatment prior to their release to waters of the State including: licensing, compliance inspections coupled with technical assistance in operations and maintenance, and enforcement where necessary. A number of financial assistance programs support new facility construction, elimination of discharges, as well as upgrades or additions to existing facilities. Highlights for 2008 - 2009 for these programs are summarized below or referenced by links to other documents. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 25 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE / POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM Contact: Sterling Pierce, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water email: Sterling.Pierce@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/engin.htm Department staff participate in both i ndustrial and municipal based technical assistance and pollution prevention projects. Highlights for 2008-2009 The compliance & technical assistance section of the Division of Water Quality Management provided on-site training and technical assistance to the operators of several publically owned wastewater treatment plants that discharge directly to Casco Bay or to rivers that empty into the Bay to assess the level of nitrogen removal that could be achieved through optimization of the op eration of the existing systems. Most existing public wastewater treatment facilities can remove a substantial fraction of the total nitrogen in the wastewater, but each facility requires some examination and experimentation to find the optimum nitrogen removal rates at the lowest cost. DWQM staff assisted in collection of effluent water quality data from seven facilities and visited two treatment facilities to assist the operators of those facilities to determine the best way to optimize nitrogen removal without upsetting conventional treatment or incurring significant additional costs. CONSTRUCTION OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES Contact: Steve McLaughlin, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water email: Steve.A.Mclaughlin@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/grants.htm Clean State Revolving Fund and Maine Construction Grants Program: SRF program monies are used to provide low-interest loans (2% below market rates) to communities and sanitary districts to upgrade treatment facilities. The program depends on a yearly Federal Capitalization Grant which must be matched with a 20% State Grant. Construction grants help fund wastewater projects in communities where user charges are too high to borrow money. Between January 2008 and May 2009, the Maine DEP Construction Grants Program provided grants to 9 projects and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) funded 24 projects, some with assistance from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development program grants/loans and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) grant money. These proj ects included new facilities, upgrades, additions, modifications, abatement of combined sewer overflows and refinancing for a total cost of approximately $8,504,019 in State grants and $36,679,608 in SRF loans. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 26 MAINE COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOW PROGRAM Contact: John True, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water John.N.True@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/doceng/csotech.htm Thirty-five Maine communities are served by combined sewer systems, which convey a combination of sanitary and storm water flows to wastewater treatment facilities. During dry weather, all of the sewage in a combined system is conveyed to the treatment plant for adequate treatment. However, during rainstorms or snow-melt periods, stormwater mixes with the sanitary sewage, causing flows that exceed the capacity of the sewer system. This results in combined sewer overflows (CSOs), which vary extensively in pollutant types, concentrations and loads, as well as in volume of overflow and severity of impact to the receiving waterbodies. Maine has established an aggressive program, coordinated with EPA's CSO program, to assist communities in evaluating the design, condition, activity, and effects of combined sewer systems and overflows. Highlights for 2010 Two of Maine's CSO communities, Dover-Foxcroft and East Millinocket, have completed their CSO abatement projects since the last Integrated Report and no longer have permitted CSOs. Through a joint permit with the City of South Portland, Portland Water District and Cape Elizabeth, the Department permitted the one CSO (at the Ottawa Road Pump Station) that discharges to the Atlantic Ocean (Danford Cove) in Cape Elizabeth.

These funds have been used to assist municipalities with the construction of individual or cluster-type wastewater treatment systems that we re designed to eliminate heavily polluted discharges from either already malfunc tioning systems or non-existing system (\"straight pipes\"). This amount of funding has resulted in the construction of new wastewater treatment facilities in over 300 communities throughout the state. The total estimated value of the facilities built with Small Community Grants is approximately $30 million dollars. Currently, requests for assistance outweigh available funding. Between 2008-2009, we disbursed grants totaling approximately $0.9 million dollars to 69 communities to replace 97 systems as detailed below.

In Maine, the vast majority of wastewater discharge sources have previously been licensed. Therefore, the licensing program is focused largely upon renewal of existing licenses, rather than development of new licenses. Please refer to pages 32-33 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for further discussion of Water Discharge Licensing Program. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm OVERBOARD DISCHARGE GRANT PROGRAM Contact: Tim MacMillan, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water email: Tim.A.Macmillan@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docgrant/obdpara.htm As of December 31, 2009 Maine has 1,339 licensed overboard discharges (OBDs). OBDs are discharges of wastewater from individual homeowners or businesses to surface waters (typically marine waters) where existing lots are unsuitable for subsurface disposal and no municipal system is available. OBDs typically lead to closures of shellfish growing and harvesting areas. In 1989 an OBD Removal Grant Program was established. The priorities of the grant program are to eliminate discharges that either causes the closure of shell fishing areas or that cause a public nuisance. Since the beginning of the program, approximately $6.5 million dollars have been spent in the process of removing 574 systems. The total acreage opened to shellfish harvesting since the start of the OBD Grant Program is over 18,000 acres. Acco rding to the DMR, opening and fully utilizing this much shellfish harvesting area has the potential to release a harvest with a retail value of over $4.4 million dollars annually. Highlight 2008 - 2009 A total of 96 OBD systems were removed in 2008-2009. The Maine Department of Marine Resources indicates that 126 acres of shellfish habitat attributable to the OBD Grant Program were re-opened to shellfish harvesting in 2007-2008. Please refer to pages 33-34 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for further discussion of Water Discharge Licensing Program. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 29 COMPLIANCE EVALUATION Contact: Sterling Pierce, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water Sterling.Pierce@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/wastepage.htm The Department uses a three-part program to evaluate the compliance of wastewater treatment facilities. The compliance evaluat ion program involves on-site inspections of wastewater treatment facilities, occasional sampling of their effluent quality on a selective basis, and monthly evaluation of the licensees' self-monitoring reports. Discharge licenses also require immediate reporting of any major malfunctions, bypasses or exceedances of licens e limits to DEP inspectors. Highlight for 2008 - 2009 The compliance & technical assistance unit, along with the Bureau's data management unit, undertook a project to improve the flow of effluent monitoring data from the regulated facilities to the DEP, and then on to the US EPA. In the past, all data was recorded on hardcopy sheets and mailed in to the DEP. Those data were then hand entered into our database, and then shippe d electronically to the US EPA. The Department contracted to have a web based interface constructed to allow license holders to access the site, and submit their data to the DEP electronically. Staff from the compliance & technical assistance unit trained operational and management staff at each of the licensed facilities to be able to utilize the web based system. Many facilities have taken advantage of this system and are now submitting their data to the DEP electronically. This system allows for the use of warning and error codes to assist the user in completing the necessary fields before submitting the information. This system has enhanced the quality of the data that is housed in both the DEP and EPA databases. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 30 Enforcement of Water Quality Laws Contact: Brian Kavanah, DEP BLWQ, Division email: brian.w.kavanah@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov philosophy of the DEP, BLWQ is to gain compliance and resolve problems at the least formal level that is appropriate, and to maximize the spirit of cooperation between the DEP and the regulated community. By fostering voluntary compliance with Maine's water pollution control laws, the overall effectiveness of the enforcement program is maximized and unnec essary litigation is avoided. Formal enforcement actions become necessary when violations of environmental laws are severe enough to warrant action regardless of the remediation effort, or when the violator is not responsive in preventing violations or refuses to cooperate with the DEP. Highlights for 2008 - 2009 A total of 15 water discharge enforcement formal cases were settled in 2008 and 2009. In addition to the penalties collected that provide a deterrent to violation of water quality laws and recover any economic benefit that may have been gained, the enforcement actions also included a variety of corrective actions that will improve water quality such as: upgrades to wastewater treatment facilities, elimination of discharges and Supplemental Environmental Projects. Extent of Nonpoint Sources of Pollutants and Program Recommendations THE MAINE NPS WATER POLLUTION CONTROL PROGRAM Contact: Norm Marcotte, DEP Management Program (38 M.R.S.A. \u00a7410-I) helps restore and protect water resources from NPS pollution. The basic objective of the NPS program is to promote the use of state agency-defined \"best management practice guidelines\" (BMPs) to prevent water pollution. DEP administers the NPS program in coordination with state, federal, and local governments as well as non-government organizations. State agencies conduct programs that: (1) implement state laws or rules that require people to comply with performance standards governing certain land use activities to protect water quality; and (2) promote voluntary usage of best management practices. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 31 Maine's BMP guidance manuals are available online: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/training/index.htm The 2008 NPS Management Program Annual Report and 2009 NPS Management Program Annual Report summarize the highlights and accomplishments of DEP's Nonpoint Source Program activities. Both reports are available at the following URL: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docgrant/319_files/reports/index.htm COASTAL NONPOINT SOURCE PRIORITY WATERSHEDS Contact: David 592-3157 e-mail: Dave.L.Courtemanch@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov The Department designates priority watersheds for preferential treatment. The 319 program may award grants based on the priority watersheds (Table 3-4), designated Atlantic salmon watersheds (Table 3-5) and those waters that have approved TMDLs (Total Maximum Daily Load) or are scheduled for TMDLs (Table 8-6). Listed waterbodies have both significant value from a regional or statewide perspective, and water quality that is either impaired or threatened to some degree due to nonpoint source pollution from land use activities in the watershed. Table 3-4 lists the coastal priority waters and key water quality problems that are affected. Many of these waters were previously determined by a Maine Watershed Management Committee in the 1990s. Three general impairment categories are listed. Previous lists included waters that are impaired due to high bacteria concentrations. In 2009, the USEPA approved a bacteria TMDL that applies to all state waters and those waters therefore all have priority due to the TMDL and are no longer specifically included in this list. Table 3-5 lists watersheds where there is identified critical habitat for Atlantic salmon.

Rules were last revised in 2006; another revision will be scheduled for 2010. For more information about the Maine Stormwater Management Law and Rules, including a brochure that has further information about the changes to the rules, go to the stormwater program website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/stormwater/index.htm . STORMWATER STANDARDS FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION Long Creek watershed The Department continued working on development of a general permit for stormwater discharges in the Long Creek watershed. On December 3, 2008, EPA Region 1, in consultation with the State of Maine, determined that a designation of certain stormwater discharges in the Long Creek watershed was appropriate because they are contributing to applicable water quality violations. This preliminary designation was published in the Federal Register on December 31, 2008 (http://www.restorelongcreek.org/docs/FR_notice_12-31-08.pdf ). The preliminary designation requires that property with one acre or more of impervious area that discharges to Long Creek obtain a permit under the Clean Water Act. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 33 In 2006, prior to EPA's designation determination, the City of South Portland had received an EPA grant to develop a co mprehensive watershed management plan for Long Creek. A steering committee was established, consisting of both private and public sector stakeholders. Sub-committees were also established to work through the technical and policy issues for Long Creek. Participants sought to develop a plan that would provide an economically efficient approach to restoring water quality in Long Creek. EPA's determination caused participants to become interested in developing a plan to provide an implementation scheme that would allow for complying with permit requirements. The Plan describes tiers of restoration projects that will be carried out over a 10 year period to restore Long Creek. The Plan is to be funded primarily by landowners in the waters hed, whose participation will qualify them for coverage under the general permit. During the winter and spring of 2009, the Department prepared a draft of the general permit, which was subsequently issued for public comment on July 1, 2009 and became final on November 6, 2009. EPA's October 28, 2009 final residual designation determination requires that storm water discharges from impervious areas equal to or greater than one acre in the Long Creek watershed be authorized by a permit under the federal Clean Water Act because those discharges contribute to a violation of water quality standards in Long Creek. Because enforceable standards have been established for stormwater discharges in the Long Creek watershed, which have been determined to be the primary cause of the stream's impaired status, Long Creek's listing has been moved to Category 4b. STORMWATER STANDARDS FOR MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEMS (MS4 S) AND INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER DISCHARGES Maine DEP reissued its MS4 general permit in July 2008 for 28 municipalities and 10 non-municipal entities which include state or federal facilities, Maine DOT, and Maine Turnpike Authority within the Urbanized Area as determined by the 2000 census (Table 3-6). This reissuance regulates two additional non municipal MS4s in the Greater Bangor Area, and has increased requirements for Urban Impaired Stream Watersheds. Table 3-6 Maine's regulated MS4's of Transportation; Maine Turnpike Authority State or Federal Entities: Portsmouth Naval Ship Yard (Kittery); Southern Maine Community College (S.

The Department has a responsibility to educate the public about the environment, requirements of environmental laws, and how to protect Maine's natural resources. To accomplish these goals, the Department must help to fo ster and encourage greater stewardship. In order to affect the behavior changes we need from our citizens, some programs are adopting social marketing principles including: determining target audiences and message, gathering research data on target audiences, determining effective outreach tools, and assessing the effectiveness of campaigns. Target Audiences: Youth and Teachers- The DEP conducts 50 - 70 classroom visits (over 1,500 students), Envirothon, field days (over 1,200 students), Bug Mania and Earth Science Day (both with about 2,000 students). In addition DEP funds 3-5 watershed grants per year to students and their teachers who partner with local organizations to protect a local water resource. The DEP also sponsors and organizes Water Festivals for 800 students and their teachers in the southern part of the state each year and every other year in northern Maine. The DEP conducts teacher training, both pre-service and in- service training. The DEP hires AmeriCorps interns to assist with these programs. General Public- The DEP divides the public into categories based on the message of the campaign: homeowners for yard care practices, businesses for better commercial 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 35 practices, etc. For example, the MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System) communities conducted pilot projects to encourage targeted BMPS (i.e., yard care in some communities and pet waste pick-up in others) in targeted neighborhoods with evaluation as part of their permits. In addition the DEP is partnering with the MS4s and other NGOs on a mass media campaign, \"ThinkBlue; Clean Water Starts with You\". Assessment shows that the campaign has been very effective. LakeSmart is another example of reaching out to a subsection of the public. LakeSmart is an educational program that offers free opportunities for lakeshore homeowners to learn how to manage their home and yard to protect the water quality of their lake. In January 2008, the Maine Legislature passed a law requiring all retailers to post a sign discouraging the use of phosphorus lawn products unless reseeding or starting a new lawn. In June 2008 a statewide survey of 87 stores (23% of the 386 stores selling fertilizer) showed that 87% of the surveyed stores had posted the required sign. The law has decreased the use of phosphorus containing fertilizer and increased the use of phosphorus free fertilizer. Contractors, Municipal Officials, and Other Targeted Groups - Through the NonPoint Source Training Center, the DEP reaches out to contractors, landscapers, and code enforcement officers to bring technical assistance, certification, and new training. DEP staff also train wastewater treatment plant operators, planning boards, realtors, CEO code enforcement and other audiences as needed. Assessment: We continue to include assessment in our projects to be sure we are using our resources where we can have measurable results. We evaluate programs (the number of workshops held or number of brochures handed out) but we also consider impact - what did we accomplish on the ground (or in the water) and context - who is doing what and why. This assessment makes us more effective and efficient and we know whether we are making concrete changes on the ground. Assessing whether our programs actually impact water quality will be the next step. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND ECONOMIC & SOCIAL COSTS /BENEFITS OF EFFECTIVE WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS Contact: Marianne DuBois, DEP BLWQ, Division of Watershed Management (DWM) Tel: (207) 485-1402 email: marianne.s.dubois@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Assessment of the many costs and benefits associated with water quality changes is usually a very difficult task. While it is usually possible to determine that an improvement in water quality has been gained and to indicate a qualitative sense of the benefits observed; often there is no easy way to directly assign a dollar figure to the changes and quantify this information in terms of the monetary value of benefits to human health or the environment. The economic tools that would be useful in helping to estimate the costs and benefits of improvement in water quality have not yet been fully developed. As future environmental problems grow in complexity and cost, and as public budgets tighten, demonstrating the benefits of water-quality related programs will be necessary to maintain support for continued investment in the improvement of water resources. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 36 Continued development of sophisticated econo mic tools for measuring the benefits of environmental projects and methods is essential.

The P2 program works with businesses and also provides input to DEP programs that provide BMPs for minimizing pollution sources such as stormwater runoff. The P2 Program engages in a proactive approach that utilizes the common ideals of increased efficiency, conservation of resources, reduced waste (and costs), etc. to identify those points in a process that generate pollution. Once identified, the P2 Program also utilizes many approaches like forming good habits, purchasing new products and implementing new technologies to analyze, zero in on and help to correct those portions of a process that generate preventable 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 37 pollution.

Davies, DEP, BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: (207) 441-9271 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov LISTING METHODOLOGY FOR THE 2010 305B / 303D INTEGRATED REPORT LIST Determination of water quality attainment is based on a waterbody meeting all standards and criteria established for its assigned classification (38 MRSA Section 465, 465-A, 465-B). Waters are listed by Assessment Unit (HUC) and/or waterbody segment in one of five categories of attainment (see category descriptions below). All waters in Maine are subject to a Statewide fish consumption advisory due to \"Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition of mercury\". On December 20, 2007 US EPA approved a Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) that moved all Maine freshwaters into Category 4A (TMDL is completed\"). Other category listings are established independently from the statew ide mercury advisory listing, thus all waters are listed in Category 4-A for mercury and in at least one other category. All marine waters are listed by narrative in Category 5-D \"Legacy Pollutants\" as well as in one other category, (see Marine explanation below ). Each listing provides the Assessment Unit, Waterbody Number, Name, Size, Classification, Monitored Date, and depending on assessment determination, information on impairment, notes on previous listings, or other information. Listings for all surface waters are found in Appendices II-V. LISTING CATEGORIES (1-5) Category 1: Attaining all designated uses and water quality standards, and no use is threatened. Highest level of attainment, waters in the assessment unit attains all applicable standards. Assessment is based on combined evaluation of the following information. 1. Current data (collected within five years) indicates attainment, with no trend toward expected non-attainment within the listing period. 2. Old data (greater than five years) indicates attainment and no change in any associated conditions. 3. Water quality models predict attainment under current loading, with no projected change in loading that would predict non-attainment. All estuarine and marine waters in Maine have an advisory for the consumption of shellfish (lobster tomalley) due to the pres ence of PCBs and dioxins presumed to be from atmospheric deposition or historical sources. The advisory is based on probability data that shellfish (lobster tom alley) inhabiting estuarine or marine waters may exceed the advisory action level for these substances. This Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Repo rt does not consider this statewide advisory in establishing other category listings. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 39 4. Qualitative data or information from pr ofessional sources indicating attainment of standards and showing no identifiable sources (e.g. detectable points of entry of either licensed or unlicensed wastes) of pollution, low impact land use (e.g. intact riparian buffers, >90% forested watershed, little impervious surface), watershed within state or federal reserve land, park, wilderness area or similar conservation protection, essentially unaltered habitat, and absence of other potential stressors. 5. Determination that the direct drainage area has a human population of <0.1 per square mile according to U.S. Census data obtained in 2000 and watershed conditions as described in item 4, above. For lakes, determinations are based on census data at the town level and consider all towns in the direct drainage of larger (referred to in previous 305(b) reports as \"significant\") lakes. Populations for the remaining lakes (generally less than ten acres) are determined for the town listed as the point-of-record for the water according to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Lake Index database. Category 2: Attains some of the designated uses; no use is threatened; and insufficient data or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened (with presumption that all uses are attained). Assessment is based on combined evaluation of the following information. 1. Current data (collected within five years) for some standards indicating attainment, with no trend toward expected non-attainment within the listing period, or an inadequate density of data to evaluate a trend. 2. Old data (greater than five years) for some standards indicating attainment, and no change in associated conditions. 3. Water quality models that predict attainment under current loading for some standards, with no projected change in loading that would predict non-attainment. 4. (For lakes) Probabilistic-based monitoring that indicates a high expectation of use attainment for certain classes of waters based on random monitoring of that class of waters. 5. Insufficient data for some standards, but qualitative data/information from professional sources indicate a low like lihood of impairment from any potential sources (e.g. high dilution, intermittent/seasonal effects, low intensity land use). Category 3: Insufficient data and information to determine if designated uses are attained (with presumption that one or more uses may be impaired). Assessment is based on combined evaluation of the following information. Monitoring schedules are assigned to these waters. 1. Insufficient or conflicting data that does not confirm either attainment or non- attainment of designated uses. 2. Qualitative data or information from professional sources showing the potential presence of stressors that may cause impairment of one or more uses; however, no quantitative water quality information confirms the presence of impairment-causing stressors. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 40 3. Old data, with: a. low reliability, no repeat measurements (e.g. one-time synoptic data), b. a change of conditions without subsequent re-measurement; or c. no evidence of human causes or sources of pollution to account for observed water quality condition (natural conditions that do not attain water quality standards are allowed by 38 M.R.S.A. Section 464.4.C). 4. (For lakes) Current data indicates a return to (or a trend towards) attainment standards over the past few years but requi res confirmation; or conversely, that trophic or dissolved oxygen profile eval uation suggests deteriorating conditions requiring further study and verification. (Since lakes respond over a longer period of time and can be highly influenced by weather attributes, it is appropriate to recommend additional monitoring before attainment is determined.) Note that many lakes have been removed from this category during this cycle to better comply with EPA recommendations for placement of wate rs into this category; only one lake remains). Category 4: Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses, but does not require development of a TMDL. A water body is listed in Category 4 when impairment is not caused by a pollutant; or, if impairment is caused by a pollutant, but where a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) has already been completed, or where other enforceable controls are in place. An impaired waterbody will be listed in Category 5 if both a pollutant and a non-pollutant are involved that would independently cause an impaired or threatened condition. Waters are listed in one of the following Category 4 sub-lists when: 1. Current or old data for a standard indicates either impaired use, or a trend toward expected non-attainment within the listing period, but also where enforceable management changes are expected to correct the condition, 2. Water quality models that predicted impaired use under loading for some standard, also predict attainment when required controls are in place, or, 3. Quantitative or qualitative data/informati on from professional sources indicates that the cause of impaired use is not from a pollutant(s) (e.g. habitat modification). 4-A: TMDL is completed. A TMDL is complete but insufficient new data exists to determine that attainment has been achieved. Note 1: As of the 2008 cycle the 4A category now includes all freshwaters in Maine that were listed in previous cycles in a narrative Category 5-C \"Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition of mercury\" due to the Statewide fish consumption advisory due to mercury. On December 20, 2007 US EPA approved a Regional Mercury TMDL for the Northeast. Note 2: See also the section titled \"Summary of Statewide River and Stream Attainment Status\" below for comments about the 2009 US EPA approval of a Statewide Maine Bacteria TMDL. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 41 4-B: Other pollution control requirements are reasonably expected to result in attainment of standards in the near future. Waterbodies where enforceable controls have a reasonable expectation of attaining standards, but where no new data are available to determine that attainment has been achieved. (Enforceable controls may include: new wastewater discharge licenses issued without preparation of a TMDL, other regulatory orders, contracts for nonpoint source implementation projects, regulatory orders or contracts for hazardous waste remediation projects). 4-C: Impairment is not caused by a pollutant. Waters impaired by habitat modification that is a result of human activity. Note : Natural conditions that do not attain water quality standards and criteria are allowed by 38 M.R.S.A. Section 464.4.C. Waters that show impairment due to natural phenomena are listed in Categories 1 through 3. Category 5: Waters impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s) and a TMDL is required. Waters are listed in one of the Category 5 sub-lists when: 1. Current data (collected within five years) for a standard either indicates impaired use, or a trend toward expected impairment within the listing period, and where quantitative or qualitative data/information from professional sources indicates that the cause of impaired use is from a pollutant(s), 2. Water quality models predict impaired use under current loading for a standard, and where quantitative or qualitative data/in formation from professional sources indicates that the cause of impaired use is from a pollutant(s), or, 3. Those waters have been previously listed on the State's 303(d) list of impaired waters, based on current or old data that indicated the involvement of a pollutant(s), and where there has been no change in management or conditions that would indicate attainment of use. 5-A: Impairment caused by pollutants (other than those listed in 5-B through 5- D). A Total Maximum Daily Load is required and will be conducted by the State of Maine. TMDL schedules are assigned based on the value of a particular water (considering size, public use, proximity to population centers, and level of public interest for water quality improvement), the nature of the impairment and the source(s) of the problem, available information to complete the TMDL, and availability of staff and contractual resources to acquire information and complete the TMDL study. Projected schedules for TMDL completion are included in Chapter 8 as well as in the Appendices. 5-B: Impairment is caused solely by bacteria contamination. A TMDL is required. Certain waters impaired only by bacteria contamination may be high priority resources, such as shellfish areas, but a low priority for TMDL development if other actions are already in progress that will correct the problem in advance of TMDL development (e.g. better compliance). Certain small streams that are impaired solely by bacteria contamination but where recreation (swimming) is impractical because of their small size are listed in 5-B. A projected schedule of TMDL completion is included where applicable. Waterbodies impaired only by Combined Sewer Overflows, where 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 42 current CSO Master Plans (Long-Term Control Plan) are in place, will be monitored to demonstrate that water quality standards are attained and that provisions are in place for both funding and compliance timetables. See the section titled \"Summary of Statewide River and Stream Attainment Status\" below for comments about the 2009 US EPA approval of a Statewide Maine Bacteria TMDL. 5-C: Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition of mercury and a regional scale TMDL is required. Due to EPA approval of a regional scale TMDL for the control of mercury all of Maine's Category 5C waters have been administratively moved to Category 4A. 5-D: Impairment caused by a \"legacy\" pollutant. This sub-category includes: 1. waters impaired only by PCBs, dioxins, DDT, or other substances already banned from production or use. It includes waters impaired by contaminated sediments where there is no additional extrinsic load occurring. This is a low priority for TMDL development since there is no controllable load. 2. coastal waters that have a consumption advisory for the tomalley (hepatopancreas organ) of lobsters due to the presence of persistent bioaccumulating toxics found in that organ. This is a low priority for TMDL development since there is no identifiable and controllable load. DELISTING FROM AN IMPAIRED TO AN UNIMPAIRED CATEGORY . Because there are a number of listing options available in the integrated list, some waterbodies may be removed from the previous \"impaired waters\" list, i.e., 303(d) list,, however, only under certain circumstances. The State must provide new information, to EPA's satisfaction, as a basis for not listing specific waters that had been previously included on a 303(d) list. Acceptable reasons for not listing previously listed waters as provided in 40 CFR 130.7(b) may include situations where: The assessment and interpretation of more recent, more accurate or paleolimnological data demonstrates that the applicable water quality standard(s) is being met (list in Category 1, 2). The results of more refined water quality modeling demonstrate that the applicable water quality standard(s) is being met (list in Category 1 or 2). It can be demonstrated that errors or insuffici encies in the original data and information led to the water being incorrectly list ed (list in Category 1 or 2). It can be documented that there are changes in the conditions or criteria that originally caused the water to be impaired and therefore originally led to the listing. For example, new control equipment has been installed, a disc harge has been eliminated, or new criteria adopted (list in Category 1, 2, or 4-B). The State has demonstrated pursuant to 40 CF R 130.7(b)(1)(ii), that there are effluent limitations required by State or local authority, which are more stringent than technology-based effluent limitations, requi red by the Clean Water Act, and that these more stringent effluent limitations will result in the attainment of water quality standards for the pollutant causing the impairment within a reasonable time (list in Category 4-B). The State has demonstrated pursuant to 40 CFR 130.7(b)(1)(iii), that there are other pollution control requirements requ ired by State, local, or federal authority that will result in attainment of water quality standards for a sp ecific pollutant(s) within a reasonable time (list in Category 4-B). 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 43 The State included on a previous Section 303(d) list some Water Quality Limited Segments beyond those that are required by EPA regulations, e.g., waters where there is no pollutant associated with the impairment (list in Category 4-C). A TMDL has been approved or es tablished by EPA since the last 303(d) list (list in Category 4-A). Chapter 8 Tables 8-1a, 8-1b, 8-2 and 8-3 present waters that have been delisted from Maine's 2008 impaired waters (303d) list. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA Tables 4-1 through 4-3 provide the designated use categories and the criteria (with references) used to assess a water's attainment of the use. A determination of non- attainment is only made when there is documented, quality assured, evidence (e.g. monitoring data) indicating that one or more criteria are not attained. Such data are also weighed against evidence that there are plausible human-caused factors that may contribute to the violation of criteria (38 MRSA Section 464.4.C).

Data from unique events such as a spill, an accident, a short-duration license exceedance, or a drought or flood are not used in an assessment determination. The following general principles for each criteria type are used in making an assessment: Biological Criteria: River, stream, and wetland benthic macroinvertebrate and algal samples are collected in accordance with the Biomonitoring Program Quality Assurance Project Plan. Stream macroinvertebrate and algal assessments are based on statistical models that predict attainment of tiered aquatic life uses (Classes AA/A, Class B, and Class C). The stream macroinvertebrate model is described in Maine DEP Rule Chapter 579: Classification Attainment Evaluation Using Biological Criteria for Rivers and Streams . For streams and rivers, aquatic life criteria are deemed to be attained when the applicable biocriterion is met with probability greater than 0.60. Final determination of attainment may in some cases be made by professional judgment, applied in accordance with the procedures described in Maine DEP Chapter 579. The Biological Monitoring Program recently completed an algal bioassessment model applicable to wadeable streams and rivers with rocky substrates. The Department is implementing initial use of the provisional stream algal model, along with the existing stream macroinvertebrate m odel, to assess attainment of aquatic life criteria in the 2010 Integrated Report. Chapter 579 will be amended to include the algal model, following standard public review protocols, after it has been adequately tested. The Program also is currently developing a predictive model using macroinvertebrates to evaluate wetland attainment of aquatic life criteria. In the interim, The Department has used wetland macroinvertebrate data and provisional metrics to interpret attainment of narrative aquatic life criteria for wetlands for the 2010 Report (Appendix IV). Ambient water quality criteria, whole effluent toxicity testing, and other biological sampling are also used to determine if other components of the biological community, such as fish, meet the aquatic life uses. Lake Trophic State: Assessment is based on measures of transparency, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus and color (Table 4-4). When lakes lack this information, a trophic determination made by DIF&W is used, if available. Their determination is more subjective and generally applies to the lake system as a whole including adjacent wetlands and fisheries productivity. Trophic determination is tracked by source (DEP or DIF&W) in the assessment database. Table 4-4 Lake Trophic State Parameters and Guidelines Numerical Guidelines for Evaluation of Trophic Status in Maine * (Note: Dystrophy is not often evaluated as a trophic category separately from categories below.) Trophic Status 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List Eutrophic SDT3 > 8 meters 4-8 meters < 4 meters CHL a < 1.5 ppb 1.5 - 7 ppb > 7 ppb Total Phosphorus3 SDT, CHL a, and Total Phosphorus based on long-term means. 2 No repeated nuisance algal blooms. 3 If color is > 30 Standard Platinum Units (SPU) or not known, chlorophyll a concentration (CHL a), dissolved oxygen and best professional judgment used to assign trophic category. 4 TSI = Trophic State Indices are calculated when a dequate data exists and color is at or below 30 SPU. * This table is a duplicate of Table 4-26 in the Lakes Section of this Chapter ( appears twice for convenience). Support of Indigenous Species: Assessment based on the known absence of a species that previously was documented as indigenous to a waterbody in historical records collected by state or federal agencies or through published scientific literature; or based on non-attainment of water quality criteria or absence of critical habitat necessary to support indigenous species. Dissolved Oxygen: Assessment of dissolved oxygen is based on the results of repeated measurements, collected over time. Single excursions of the criterion or excursions within the range of sampling or instrument error (as established in a Quality Assurance Project Plan) may not be used in every case unless there is corroborating evidence of reasonable potential for impairment of a use. Assessment may also be based on the use of water quality models (e.g. QUAL2E) based on present or expected loadings. New legislation provides that dissolved oxygen in the thermocline and deeper waters of a riverine impoundment will not be used for measurement of water quality attainment. Ambient Water Quality Criteria: Assessment is based on measured exceedance of Statewide Water Quality Criteria (or Site-specific criteria where they may exist), or reasonable potential to exceed the criteria following EPA's Principle of Independent Applicability and Technical support document. Single excursions of the criterion or excursions within the range of sampling or instrument error (as established in a Quality Assurance Project Plan) may not be used in every case unless there is corroborating evidence of reasonable potential for impairment of a use. Assessment may also be based on the use of water quality models (e.g. dilution models) based on present or expected loadings. Nutrient/Eutrophication Biological Indicators: The Department is proposing nutrient criteria for evaluating attainment of water quality standards for fresh surface waters. Nutrient enrichment can cause negative environmental impacts to surface waters, such as algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen concentrations, excessive growths of filamentous algae or bacteria, and generation of cyanotoxins. Methods described in the proposed rule (Chapter 583: Use Attainment Evaluation Using Nutrient Criteria for Surface Waters ) will be used to make decisions about attainment or impairment of designated and existing uses of surface waters under the State's water quality classificationlaw. This proposed rule also describes how the Department will use the attainment determinations in the listing of impaired waterbodies and the establishment of nutrient discharge limits in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits. The rule is scheduled for the public rulemaking process with the Board of Environmental Protection during 2010. For more information, please visit the following website: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/rules/Other/nutrients_freshwater/index.htm . 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 47 Non-numeric listing criteria for this cause of Aquatic Life Use (ALU) impairment consist of documentation of abnormal biological findings that indicate nutrient enrichment in rivers and streams. Excess nutrients impair ALU through alteration of habitat, changes in dissolved gases like oxygen, from excessive growths of plants and algae, resulting in diurnal dissolved oxygen sags, and alteration of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. Bacteria: Assessment is based on repeated measurements to establish an annual geometric mean. Instantaneous (single sample) criteria are not used for water quality assessment due to the high variability associated with a single measurement. There must be a plausible human or domestic animal source of the bacteria for an impairment determination to be made (38 M.R.S.A Section 465, 465-A, 465-B). Water Color: Assessment based on repeated measurements of discharge performance data (pulp and paper discharges only). General Provisions: pH based on repeated measurement (between 6.0 and 8.5 for freshwaters; 7.0 and 8.5 for marine waters), however, certain naturally occurring waterbody types (e.g. bogs, aquifer lakes, high elevation lakes) or events may naturally have low pH and affect downstream waters. Use impairment from solids is subjectively determined. Radioactivity in surface water is not presently monitored. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 48 INTEGRATED REPORT LISTS OF CATEGORIES 1 THROUGH 5 Table 4-5 Summary of State Waters Attaining and Not Attaining Standards Waterbody Type Total Assessed for Attaining of WQ Standards - Assessed for Designated Uses Total with Insufficient Data for Assessment - Not Assessed for Any Designated Uses (Category 3) Total Attaining All WQ Standards - Supporting All Designated Uses (Category 1) Total Attaining At Least One Standard - Supporting at Least One Use, But Not All Standards Assessed (Category 2) Total Not Attaining One or More WQ Standards - Not Supporting One or More Uses - But Not Needing a TMDL (Category 4) Total Not Attaining One or More WQ Standards - Not Supporting One or More Uses - and TMDL is Needed (Category 5) River & Stream Miles 4,347 606, 780* 76,080* Stations 82 9 0 75 2 5 Freshwater Wetland Acres size undeter- mined size undeter- mined 0 size undeter- mined size undeter- mined size undeter- mined Tidal Wetland Acres N/A 1 N/A 1 N/A 1 N/A 1 N/A 1 N/A 1 River and Stream mile summaries for each reporting ca tegory were generated by the Maine Assessment Database (ADB) and may be somewhat different from river and stream miles reported in Table 3-1. * Includes 6 Category 2 lakes (22 acres) on coastal islands, all 6 lakes are not assigned to mainland HUCs. ** These figures do not include those waters listed under Category 4A for atmospheric deposition of Mercury. \u00ba All estuarine and marine waters capable of naturally supporting lobster propagatio n are affected by a shellfish (lobster tomalley) consumption advisory due to the presence of PCBs and dioxins.

Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Tel: 207-441-9271 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/classification/index.htm Maine has four water quality classes of rivers and streams: AA, A, B, and C (38 M.R.S.A. Section 465). Each classification assigns designated uses and water quality criteria (narrative and numeric), and may place specific restrictions on certain activities (Table 4-1 and 4-16) such that the goal conditions of each class may be achieved or maintained. Definitions of terms used in the classification are provided in 38 M.R.S.A. Section 466. Class AA waters are managed for their outstanding natural ecological, recreational, social, and scenic qualities. Direct discharge of wastewater, dams, and other significant human disturbances are prohibited. Tiered aquatic life use goals in water quality standards direct that the biological condition of this classification be approximately Tier 1-2 on the Biological Condition Gradient (Davies and Jackson 2006; USEPA 2005) Class A waters are managed for high quality with limited human disturbance allowed; aquatic life use goal approximately Tier 1-2 on the Biological Condition Gradient. Direct discharges are allowed but highly restricted. Physical and chemical characteristics should be similar to natural conditions. Class B waters are general-purpose waters and are managed to attain good physical, chemical and biological water quality; aquatic life use goal approximately Tier 3 on the Biological Condition Gradient. Well-treated discharges with ample dilution are allowed. Class C waters are managed to attain at least the swimmable-fishable goals of the federal Clean Water Act, including protection of spawning for indigenous fish species. Aquatic life standards require maintenance of the structure and function of the 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 54 biological community; aquatic life goal approximately Tier 4 on the Biological Condition Gradient.

The last triennial review of water quality standards and classifications was completed in 2009. The Department conducted statewide workshops and direct mail and telephone outreach to obtain public input and to solicit proposals for consideration to change the management classification assigned to specific waterbodies. The Board held hearings that resulted in recommendations to the Maine State Legislature for the upgrade of part or all of 16 rivers and streams and one marine waterbody. The Board recommended and the Legislature also approved changes to statutory language to clarify the classifications of 6 other waterbodies, and to conduct a Use Attainability Analysis on 1 impaired stream to determine its highest attainable goal condition. The current distribution of waters assigned to these four water quality classes is summarized in Table 4-18: Table 4-18 Percent Distribution of River/Stream Water Classes Class Percent of Major* Mainstem River Miles Percent of Total River and Stream Miles AA 27.5 % 5.6 % A 22.3 % 43.8 % B 29.6 % 49.2 % C 20.6 % 1.4 % * Major mainstem rivers are rivers that have a watershed of >500 square miles. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 55 SUMMARY OF STATEWIDE RIVER AND STREAM ATTAINMENT STATUS Contact: Susan P. Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: 207-441-9271 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov The Integrated Assessment Water Quality Report to Congress requires the assignment of each Assessment Unit into one of five categories (Section 4-1, Assessment Methodology). A water is determined to be impaired if one or more of the uses assigned by its classification in not attained, as determined by the criteria assigned to that water class. An overall use attainment summary is provided in Tables 4-6 and 4-19. The 2010 use attainment assessment reports on assessment units amounting to 31,215 miles of rivers and streams that are tracked in the Assessment Database (ADB).

The 2010 assessment assigned 4,338 miles (14%) of rivers and streams to Category 1 (fully attaining all uses other than statewide mercury advisory as explained in Category 5C below). The Department has determined through monitoring and evaluation that large areas of the state should be included in this category where there is signi ficant protection afforded by either state or private conservation efforts. Maine is fortunate to have entire sub-watersheds where there is little to no human habitation, few roads and only minimal disturbance (typically well managed forestry operations that are well buffered to protect water quality) or significant conservation ownership. Category 2 (Appendix II Category 2 ). The 2010 assessment assigned 25,378 (81%) miles of rivers and streams to Category 2 (fully attaining all uses other than statewide mercury advisory as explained in Category 5C below). The increase was primarily due to new bacteria data, collected under the Statewide Bacteria TMDL, showing attainment of recreational uses Category 3 (Appendix II Category 3 ). The 2010 assessment assigned 314 (1%) miles of rivers and streams to Category 3 (insufficient information to determine attainment). Most of these segments have been assigned to Category 3 because of inconclusive or conflicting monitoring data. One new segment was added to Category 3 in 2010 because an initial evaluation of potential non-attainment requires re-sampling to confirm. Category 4 (Appendix II Category 4 ). Category 4 impaired waters do not require the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). In September of 2009 EPA 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 56 approved a Statewide Maine Bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load that resulted in the removal of 34 bacteria-impaired segments from Category 5A and 5B to Category 4A. An additional 28 segments were also removed for 2010 due to either determinations of full attainment (ie, Category 2) or due to ongoing impairments of other uses (Category 5). The TMDL addressed bacteria impairment s caused by Eschericia coli in freshwaters. The waters covered by the Statewide Bacteria TMDL are located in 13 of Maine's 21 major watersheds (8-digit hydrologic unit code basins). Category 4 has been administratively increased by 247 miles in 2010 due to approval of the Statewide Bacteria TMDL, among other reasons. Waters in Category 4 are placed into one of three subcategories: 4-A for waters that already have a TMDL that has been approved by EPA 34 new segments have been added to Category 4-A as compared to the 2008. All of these waterbodies have bacteria impairm ents and have been moved from Category 5-A or 5-B to Category 4-A due to their inclusion in the Maine Statewide Bacteria TMDL, approved by US EPA in September 2009., 4-B for waters where there is an enforceable mechanism in place to bring the water into attainment (e.g. new or re-newed wastewater discharge license; court order, etc.) 2 segments have been moved into Category 4-B due to existence of enforceable mechanisms to bring the waters into attainment, 4-C for waters where there is no pollutant involved in the impairment problem One new segments has been added to 4-C since 2008 Two segments on the West Branch and upper mainstem Penobscot River (to the confluence with the Mattawamkeag River) have been moved directly from Category 2 to Category 4B. Analysis of 2007 monitoring data during this reporting cycle documented non-attainment of dissolved oygen and nutrient/eutrophication biological indicators. The Board of Environmental Protection issued an Administrative Consent Agreement on January 17, 2008 requiring reductions in phosphorus loading and establishing that enforceable controls are in place so the segments were delisted to Category 4B. Category 5 (Appendix II Category 5 ). Impaired waters that require the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) determination. The 2010 assessment assigned 730 miles (2%) of rivers and streams to Category 5 (impaired for one or more uses as well as statewide mercury advisory as explained in Category 5C below). This is a net decrease of 260 miles in Category 5. Waters in Category 5 are placed into one of four subcategories: 5-A - waters impaired by pollutants; a priority for TMDL development, The reduction of Category 5-A river and stream miles between 2008 and 2010 is almost entirely due to removal of 34 bacteria impairmented segments as noted above . Twenty-five miles on the mainstem Penobscot have been added to Category 5A. Final draft TMDLs for 7 non-point source affected segments and two point source affected segments are scheduled to be subm itted to EPA in fiscal year 2010. 5-B- waters impaired by no causes other th an bacteria from Combined Sewer Overflows or other sources (except statewide mercury advis ory as explained in Category 5C below); a lower priority for TMDL development. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 57 no new segments have been added to 5B and existing 5-B segments have been removed to Category 4-A for bacteria impairments 5-C- waters impaired by atmospheric deposition of mercury (Inactive Category due to EPA approved Regional Mercury TMDL ). All freshwaters in Maine have an advisory for the consumption of fish due to the presence of mercury presumed to be from atmospheric deposition. A Regional Mercury TMDL was approved by US EPA ma king these waters Category 4A. This Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report does not consider this statewide advisory in establishing other category listings. The advisory is based on pr obability data that a stream, river, or lake may contain some fish that exceed the advisory action level (Maine uses a lower action level of 0.2 mg/kg (edible portion) than t hat established by the USEPA). Any freshwater may contain both contaminated and uncontam inated fish depending on size, age, and species occurrence in that water. The advis ory applies to all freshwaters because it may be impossible for someone eating a fish to be able to tell where the fish originated and whether or not it has a high level of mercury. 5-D for waters impaired by the residuals of \"legacy\" activities. No new segments have been added to Category 5-D as compared to 2008. Number of Segments that have been Delisted. Due to EPA approval of the Statewide Bacteria TMDL, sixty-one river and stream segments impaired by Escherichia coli bact eria have been removed from the Category 5-A list and placed on the Category 4-A or Category 2 lists for 2010. Six additional waters have been delisted to either Category 2 or Category 4-B due to control or elimination of other pollutant causes As with any assessment of this kind, the identification of impaired waters or delisted waters cannot be considered complete but rather is a reflection of the findings at a particular point in time, relative to the level of monitoring effort expended by the agency and other cooperating contributors. LISTING CAUSES , STRESSORS AND SOURCES OF IMPAIRMENT Cause and stress information for rivers and streams is provided in Table 4-9. Sources of impairment are provided in Table 4-13. Maine DEP uses the EPA Assessment Database (ADB) to track changes in water quality for Maine rivers, streams and lakes. The ADB is enabling increasingly accurate and consistent tracking of causes, stressors and sources as the database is populated and updated from cycle to cycle. Causes (Table 4-9): The greatest number of impaired miles (689) is due to toxic contamination, including legacy pollutants such as DDT, dioxin and PCBs. For most mainstem river segments that are affected by pulp and paper mill discharges, dioxins have been listed in Category 4-B since 2004. While absolute elimination of the production of dioxin from the pulp and paper bleaching process has probably not been accomplished, measureable differences above and below sources of dioxin are no longer detectable. However, those same segments are listed in Category 5-D for legacy sources of PCB and dioxin contamination found in fish tissue. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 58 Non-attainment of aquatic life criteria, as determined by observations of biological effects, accounts for 298 miles of impairment. Most of these miles were assessed via benthic macroinvertebrate biocriteria. Two stream segments have been placed on the impaired waters list this cycle due to assessments using algal indicators of impaired aquatic life uses. Oxygen depletion accounts for 368 miles. Sources (Table 4-13): Atmospheric deposition of mercury affects all waters of the State and is the largest single source of pollution. Legacy pollutant sources such as dioxin, PCBs and DDT affect 606 miles. General agricultural NPS sources affect 337 miles. It is important to understand that m iles attributed to causes and sources in Tables 4-9 and 4-13 may be listed more than once if a waterbody is subjected to several different types of disturbance. MAIN STEMS OF MAJOR RIVERS Most of the mainstem rivers are in good condition and are attaining their classification (mostly Class B or C quality). Significant segments of the St. John, Allagash, East and West Branches of the Penobscot, St. Croix, and Kennebec Rivers are Class AA and A). The primary impairment issue on the larger rivers is non-attainment of the Fish Consumption use, with segments of the Androscoggin, Kennebec, Penobscot, Salmon Falls and Sebasticook Rivers listed in either Category 4 or Category 5. Tissue monitoring studies have found legacy PCB and dioxin contamination in mainstem rivers. Needed monitoring has had to be re-scheduled for some mainstem river segments due to lack of appropriately low flow levels required for water quality modeling (e.g., Penobscot, Sandy River, lower Androscoggin River). 2010 was a low flow year allowing collection of several needed monitoring datasets. Two segments on the West Branch and upper mainstem Penobscot River (to the confluence with the Mattawamkeag River) have been moved directly from Category 2 to Category 4B. Analysis of 2007 monitoring data during this reporting cycle documented non-attainment of dissolved oygen and nutrient/eutrophication biological indicators. The Board of Environmental Protection issued an Administrative Consent Agreement on January 17, 2008 requiring reductions in phosphorus loading from upstream mills thus establishing enforceable controls for these segments, so they have been delisted to Category 4B. An additional three Class B segments below the confluence with the Piscataquis River to Reeds Brook (where water quality classification changes to marine SC) have been listed as impaired for dissolved oxygen and Nutrients/eutrophication biological indicators. A water quality model with updated monitoring data is currently in development by the Department (See Response to Comments) Data submitted by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Water Resources program documented high algal growth and large diur nal swings in dissolved oxygen on the Meduxnekeag River mainstem, at some locati ons affected by extensive agricultural land use. Downstream portions of the Meduxnekeag are currently in Category 4A due to US EPA approval of a TMDL in 2001 to address elevated phosphorus. The segment upstream of the TMDL study area has been listed in Category 3 for 2010 indicating a need for further investigation. Three (3) of Maine's Combined Sewer Overfl ow (CSO) communities (Dover-Foxcroft, East Millinocket, and Milo) have completed their CSO abatement projects and no longer have permitted CSOs in the Penobscot watershed. CSOs continue to occur on 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 59 segments of other major rivers. In 2009, the Department completed a statewide bacteria TMDL that establishes a restoration and management plan for all sources of bacteria, including CSOs. In 2007, the Board of Environmental Protection was petitioned by dischargers and environmental advocates to rescind per mits that had been issued following EPA approval of a TMDL for the Gulf Island Pond segment of the river. As a consequence of that process, the water quality models for that segment were recalculated and recalibrated. Permits are presently being revised. Since 2006 when the new permits came into effect, the impoundment has not experienced algae blooms, however it continues to have episodes of low dissolved oxygen (http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/topic/gip/index.htm ). Revised permits and proposed improvements to the instream oxygenation facility are projected to bring Gulf Island Pond into attainment. In 2009, the Lower Androscoggin River (Lisbon Falls to Brunswick) was proposed for upgrade from Class C to Class B. The Board of Environmental Protection declined to recommend the upgrade, as did the Maine State Legislature. However, a Resolve was passed by the Legislature directing the Department to accelerate monitoring and modeling on this segment in the interest of reviewing this proposal in the future. Monitoring and assessment could not be conducted in 2009 due to excessive flows but will be attempted again in 2010. Also concerning the lower Androscoggin River, the mainstem segment between the Pejepscot Dam and the Brunswick Dam, is listed in Category 4C (Impaired by non-pollutant). Information provided to the Department from the Department of Marine Resources indicates the segment fails to support American shad. The dam at Brunswick and the fish passage device repeatedly fail to allow passage of a sufficient number of shad to establish a sustainable population in the river above the dam. This facility is a FERC licensed facility with a requirement for fish passage as part of a State-adopted restoration plan for this species.

AQUATIC LIFE MONITORING 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 60 BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF RIVERS AND STREAMS Contact: Leon Tsomides, DEP BLWQ, Division of Leon.Tsomides@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/biomonitoring/index.htm The Biological Monitoring Program assesses the health of rivers, streams, and wetlands by evaluating the composition of the resident biological communities. In the 1980s, the Maine Legislature passed the Water Classification Law and made an initial assignment of each river and stream reach in the state to one of four established classes (AA, A, B, and C Table 4-17). Subsequent Water Quality Reclassification initiatives since 1986 have reassigned waterbodies to more appropriate (usually higher quality) management classifications Class AA and Class A have the same aquatic life criteria and biological expectations (\"as naturally occurs\"). Data collected in accordance with Maine's biocriteria protocol are analyzed to predict the likelihood of a waterbody attaining the aquatic life criteria of its assigned class (i.e. AA/A, B, and C). In 2003, MDEP adopted numeric biocriteria in rule Ch. 579 (for rivers and streams) which describes the process used to make aquatic life decisions using the benthic macroinvertebrate community. MDEP recently completed biological assessment methods for benthic algal communities of wadeable streams and rivers with rocky substrates. MDEP used the provisional algal model, along with the stream macroinvertebrate model to evaluate attainment of aquatic life criteria for rivers and streams for the 2010 Report (Appendix II). MDEP is also currently testing biological assessment methods for wetland macroinvertebrate and algal communities and provisional assessments of wetland condition are provided for the first time in this 2010 Integrated Report (Appendix IV). More detailed information on wetland monitoring and assessment is described in Chapter 5.

Additional topics required under Section 314 addressed in the 2006 report include: Maine's definition of Significant Lakes Trophic Status of Significant Publicly Owned Lakes Lake Rehabilitation Techniques Acid Effects on Lakes Toxics in Maine lakes Trend analyses and Climate considerations. A number of tables reappear in this report at the request of EPA Region I staff. Monitoring of Maine lakes continues to include reliance on a strong volunteer-based program, the Maine Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program (www.mainevolunteerlakemonitors.org ) as well as both targeted and probability based monitoring performed by state staff. The Lake Assessment Section participated in a US EPA Region I probability-based lake monitoring effort in 2006 as well as the National Lake Assessment (NLA) effort in 2007. The results of the NLA survey help to put the overall condition of Maine lakes in perspective nationally and add additional data on the lakes visited by the EPA-State teams. The NLA reinforced the conclusions 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 62 that our lightly developed watersheds continue to support lakes in full attainment of most designated uses. ATTAINMENT OF CLASSIFICATION The state designated a subset of the total population of lakes as 'Significant Lakes' as requested by EPA under Section 314 in the early 1990s. Table 4-20 summarizes numbers and acreages for all lakes having an identification number as well as the subset of Significant Lakes. Table 4-20 \"All\" and \"Significant\" Lake Category Information Maine Lake Population Summary Number Acres All Lakes (40%) actively assessed to determine classification attainment status are: Aquatic Life Support, Fish Consumption, Recreation In/On, and Drinking Water Supply (after disinfection/treatment). Table 4-21 summarizes how lake attainment status relates to specific Listing Categories used in the 2010 report. Table 4-21 Summary of Listing Categories and Subcategories used in the 2010 Assessment of Maine lakes. Listing Category Category Summary 1 Attaining all standards 2 Attaining some standards; assumed to attain others 3 Attaining some standards; Insuffi cient / no data / info to determine if standard(s) are met for use that may be impaired 4a TMDL complete 4b Expected to meet standards 4c Not impaired by a pollutant 5a TMDL needed 5c Regional TMDL needed due to airborne Hg deposition Brief summaries of lakes by Listing Category follow. Lake specific changes are included in Chapter 8, \"Summary of 2010 Category Changes\" as well as in the appendix. Category 1: Lake waters attaining all designated uses and water quality standards, and no use is threatened. For the purposes of this assessment, lakes having no population in their direct watersheds have been listed in 'Category 1, Attaining all standards', with the exception of four lakes which are listed in category 4c, in non-attainment of the Aquatic Life Use (habitat) due to non-pollutant (hydrologic modification). The number of lakes listed in Category 1 is 2,857, totaling 295,443 acres. Waters are summarized by the 10-digit HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) within which they are located (Appendix 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 63 III, Category 1). No lakes have moved in or out of this Listing Category since the 2008 reporting cycle. Category 2: Lake waters attaining some of the designated use(s), no use is threatened, and insufficient data or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened (with presumption that all uses are attained). The Department is highly confident that these waters attain the following designated uses: drinking water (after disinfection / treatment), recreation in/on the water, fishing (excluding fish consumption), and as habitat for fish and other aquatic life. Category 2 contains 2,890 lakes or 606,236 lake acres. Waters are summarized by the 10-digit HUC within which they are located (Appendix III, Category 2). Nine lakes (9,762 acres were moved from Categories 3, 4a and 5a into this category because additional data or information indicates that they are in attainment of some designated uses and presumed to be in attainment of the others. Category 3: Lake waters with insufficient data and information to determine if designated uses are attained (with presumption that one or more uses may be impaired). There is currently 1 lake covering 410 acres listed in Category 3 (Appendix III, Category 3) designated as 'Significant'. This lake has a deteriorating trophic state and may or may not be in attainment of 'aquatic life' and/or 'primary contact' criteria. This lake (Cochnewagon) was treated with alum nearly 25 years ago. The treatment improved water quality for about one decade; data collected over the last 15 years suggest that the lake has returned to its former trophic state. A sediment core has been obtained to determine the historic trophic state so the Department can better establish a trophic target. Eight of these lakes (9,128 acres) were moved to Category 2 and one lake (8,239 acres) was moved to Category 5A during this assessment. No lakes were moved into this Category in 2010. Category 4: Lake waters that are impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses, but do not require development of a TMDL. There are currently 29 lakes covering 76,080 acres listed in Category 4. These lakes fall into two subcategories: waters on which TMDLs have been completed (4A) and waters with impairments not caused by a pollutant (4C). Category 4A contains 24 lakes totaling 27,116 acres. This includes the addition of 2 lakes (3,658 acres) for which TMDL studies have been completed since the 2008 report. Completed TMDL documents for these waters are posted on the DEP website at the following URL: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/tmdl2.htm Five lakes (48,964 acres) continue to be listed in Category 4C, lake water impairment not caused by a pollutant. All of these lakes are in non-attainment of aquatic life (habitat) standards due to hydromodification (drawdown). Note: For the 2008 and 2010 cycles the 4A category now includes all freshwaters in Maine that were listed in previous cycles in a narrative Category 5-C \"Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition were of mercury\" due to the Statewide fish 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 64 consumption advisory due to mercury. On December 20, 2007 US EPA approved a Regional Mercury TMDL. Category 5: Lake waters that are impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s), TMDL development is required. Three sub categories have been designated under Category 5; however lakes have been listed in only one. Category 5A includes 3 lakes (8,783 acres) which are designated as 'Significant' (lakes impaired by pollutants, and require a TMDL to be conducted by the State of Maine). This total reflects the movement of 2 lakes (3,114 acres) to Category 4A. Appendix III, Category 5A indicates target dates for TMDL completions. Table 4-22 summarizes individual use support for the lakes in Category 5A. Table 4-22 Individual Use Support Summary for Lake (acres) in Category 5a (TMDL Needed) Designated Use Non- Attainment Attainment Drinking Water Supply (after disinfection/treatment) 0 8,239 Aquatic Life use Support 8,783 0 Fishing (other than fish consumption covered in Cat. 4a) 0 8,239 Recreation In / On 5440 8,239 Navigation, Hydropower, Agriculture & Industrial Supply 0 8,239 Causes or Stressors resulting in non-attainment and Sources are summarized for all impaired waters in Tables 4-10 and 4-14 in Section 4-3 of this document.

This summary is compiled using the numerical criteria in Table 4-4. Table 4-23 summarizes the trophic distribution of Maine Lakes. Table 4-23 Trophic Status of Maine Lakes Significant Lakes All Lakes Trophic Category Number Acres Number Acres Assessed Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 65 3,857 56,986 4-24 summarizes techniques used to rehabilitate lakes. Table 4-24 Lake Rehabilitation Technique Summary (Section 319 Projects) Rehabilitation Technique Watershed Treatments BMPs associated with Public & Private Road Management BMPs associated with Shoreline Erosion Control / Bank Stabilization Other Lake Protection/Re storation Controls Public Information/ Education Program/Activities Section 314 requires reporting on Acid Effects on lakes. Maine is fortunate to be located a considerable distance from many sources of atmospheric deposition that result in acidification of surface waters. Some smaller headwater and seepage lakes having naturally low pH are likely slightly more acidic due to such atmospheric inputs but not to levels that have conclusively altered the biota or caused Maine to consider mitigation activities. Recovery from acidic deposition is apparent in lakes in the northeast, including the high elevation lakes of Maine (HELM). Regionally, approximately half of the acidic lakes in the 1980s are now non-acidic (pH > 5). In the High Elevation lakes, only four of the 12 lakes acidic in the 1980s were acidic in 2009. An important response to decreased acid rain has been an increase in the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in recovering surface waters across the northern hemisphere. This result has led to a shift in the source of acidity from inorganic sources (acid rain), to natural (DOC) sources. This shift in acidity is responsible for the relatively unchanged pH status of acid sensitive waters despite significant decreases in inputs of acid rain to the systems. While recovery in ANC appears to still be incomplete, recovery in pH is much more complete. This conclusion is consistent with ample paleolimnological evidence. Because data collected after April of 2009 is not included in this report, the following table has yet to be updated. Table 4-25 provides a summary of acidity assessment efforts in Maine lakes and Table 4-26 summarizes source estimates for high acidity in Maine lakes.

The Lake and River Protection Sticker, the funding mechanism for the Department's work on invasive aquatic species, was merged in 2008 with the freshwater watercraft registration to reduce administrative costs and therefore increase funds to lake groups conducting invasive plant prevention and control projects. Any boater with out-of-state registration is still required to purchase the Lake and River Protection sticker to affix next to their out-of-state registration before launching on freshwater. As of December 2009, 31 inland bodies of water are infested with invasive aquatic plants. Of bodies of water, 26 are infested with variable milfoil ( infestations since the 2008 report include Eurasian water milfoil in Salmon Lake in Belgrade and hydrilla in Damariscotta Lake in Jefferson, the second known Maine infestation for each species. Each infestation is confined to a relatively small portion of the lake and the Department is working to prevent spread and manage the respective infestations. The Damariscotta infestation was the first in the state to be discovered by a volunteer trained by Maine Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program's Invasive Plant Patrol Program which is funded by revenues from the Lake and River Protection Sticker, required on all motorized watercraft launched on Maine inland water. As in 2007, nearly 50,000 Courtesy Boat Inspections were conducted in 2008 (2009 inspection data are being processed as of December 2009). Inspectors recorded at least 114 \"saves\" in 2008, instances where an inspector found and removed a confirmed invasive aquatic plant from a boat before entering or after leaving the water. Maine's statewide Courtesy Boat Inspection Program is managed by Lakes Environmental Association (LEA), a regional watershed protection organization based Bridgton, under a contract with the Department. Training of boat Inspectors is done jointly by LEA and the statewide Maine Congress of Lake Associations. The Department offers annual grants to local groups coordinating boat inspection programs and removing invasive aquatic plants from lakes and ponds. The source of funding for these grants is revenue from the Lake and River Protection Sticker. The grant program is administered by LEA through the aforementioned contract. Cash and in-kind match from local lake groups and municipalities exceeds the amount granted by the Department. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 67 The diatom Didymosphenia geminata (didymo) still has not been documented in Maine as of December 2009. The Department and Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife produced and distributed signs warning of the didymo threat and advising anglers how to prevent spread and the Department has been distributing information about preventing spread through much of our outreach materials and events. Both Departments collaborated with Fly Fishing in Maine to erect three pilot self-service angler equipment wash stations in Maine in 2009. ESTUARIES / OCEAN Contact: David Courtemanch, Director, Divi Dave.L.Courtemanch@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/coastal.htm Maine has three classes for the management of estuarine and marine waters: SA, SB, and SC. SA waters are managed for high water quality with limited human interference allowed. No direct discharges of pollutants, including those from finfish aquaculture, are allowed in SA waters. SB waters are general-purpose waters and are managed to attain good quality water. Well-treated discharges of pollutants that have ample dilution are allowed. SC waters are managed for the lowest water quality, but they must be fishable and swimmable as well as maintain the structure and function of the biological community. Well-tr eated discharges of pollutants are allowed in SC waters. Each class is managed for designated uses and each has dissolved oxygen, bacteria and aquatic life standards (see Table 4-27 below).

The last triennial review of water quality standards and classifications was completed in 2009. The Department conducted statewide workshops and direct mail and telephone outreach to obtain public input and to solicit proposals for consideration to change the management classification assigned to specific waterbodies. The Board held hearings that resulted in recommendations to the Maine State Legislature for the upgrade, from Class SB to Class SA, of one marine waterbody (The Basin in Phippsburg). The current distribution of waters assigned to three marine water quality classes is summarized in Table 4-28: Table 4-28 Area and Percentage of Marine and Estuarine Waters in Each Classification Class Square Miles Percentage SA 218 7.66 % SB 2,599 91.32 % SC 29 1.02 % Total 2,846 100.00 % This chapter provides an assessment of the degree to which water quality supports the designated use defined by the State of Maine statutes for the protection of aquatic life. Designated uses in this chapter and in Chapter 7 (Public Health - Related Assessments) are divided into two broad use categories: protection of human health and protection of aquatic life. The protection of these uses will result in the protection of other uses (e.g. navigation, industrial process and cooling supply). Applicable monitoring results and attainment assessments are summarized within each of these two categories in this chapter as well as in Chapter 7. SOURCES OF MARINE MONITORING DATA The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the National Coastal Assessment/University of Southern Maine/DEP, the BioDiversity Research Institute (BRI), the Department of Marine Resources (DMR), the Maine Healthy Beaches Program, the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (CBEP), and a variety of volunteer monitoring groups such as the Friends of Casco Bay and Spruce Creek Association monitor Maine's coastal waters. DEP monitors toxic contaminants in tissues and assesses water quality using data collected by DEP and other organizations. DEP also participates in the Gulf of Maine Council's Gulfwatch Project that surveys toxic contamination in mussel tissue in the Gulf of Maine. In 2005 and 2006, DEP monitored lobsters along the Maine coast for metal contamination under the EPA's National Coastal Program. BRI monitored toxic contaminants in the eggs of three species of birds collected in Casco Bay in 2008. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 69 DMR monitors for indicators of human pathogens (e.g., fecal coliforms) and biotoxins (e.g., Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning). The purpose of DMR monitoring is to protect human health by managing shellfish harvest areas (see Chapter 7 of this report). During the current reporting cycle, the Maine State Planning Office Coastal Program and University of Maine Cooperative Extension/Sea Grant were responsible for managing and coordinating the Maine Healthy Beaches Program in partnership with numerous local beach managers and volunteers (see Chapter 7 of this report). The Healthy Beaches Program was transferred from the Maine State Planning Office to DEP on January 1, 2009. The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (CBEP), funded by EPA's National Estuary Program, monitors and also supports other monitoring efforts in the Bay, through Friends of Casco Bay (FOCB) and other entities and coordinates the National Coastal Assessment for the entire Maine coast with the assistance of Maine DEP. The CBEP did not submit new data for inclusion in this report. The 2010 State of the Bay report, which follows-up on the 2005 report, will be available in late May 2010 at the CBEP website: http://www.cascobay.usm.maine.edu/ . The GoMOOS (Gulf of Maine Ocean Observation System) program, which is now part of the GMRI (Gulf of Maine Research Institute), provides, compiles and analyses data on the Gulf of Maine that is collected from buoys, satellites and radar. Since most of the buoys are located in offshore waters, the data were not used for this assessment. Nearshore buoys are maintained and operated by Bowdoin College in Harpswell and by the University of New England in Saco Bay. GoMOOS also had a buoy at the mouth of the New Meadows estuary but at present it is not in operation. The buoy off Casco Bay is not in service at this time. The data are useful in determining signals coming from the Gulf rather than land. DEP would benefit from the placement of more nearshore buoys in order to better monitor and understand nearshore waters and land/water interactions, especially related to nutrients. Results from these various monitoring sources provide the basis for determining attainment of classification and designated uses. One of the biggest challenges ahead is to get all the data that is collected into a central location and into useable, universally-translatable formats. The DEP is working on this at present. SUMMARY OF STATEWIDE STATUS This Integrated Assessment report requires the assignment of each Assessment Unit into one of five categories (see Methodology). Specific waters are determined to be impaired if they do not attain one or more of the uses assigned by their classification (as determined by the criteria assigned to that classification). Over the past two years, the Maine DEP has been engaged with DMR in revising the way that water quality data is reported, including the development of Assessment Units (similar to what is used in the ADB for freshwaters), and in digitizing maps; these new assessment units will be used in the 2012 reporting cycle and will make reporting more consistent and easier to track. Overall use attainment summary for 2010 is provided below and in Table 4-8. Category 1: The 2010 assessment assigns no estuarine and marine waters to Category 1 because there were no waters where all Classification Standards were 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 70 monitored adequately in a waterbody segment to determine if all standards were being met. Category 2 : The 2010 assessment assigns 2,685.17 (94.35%) square miles of estuarine and marine waters to Category 2 (fully attaining*). Category 3: The 2010 assessment assigns 6.619702 square miles (0.22%) of estuarine and marine waters to Category 3 (impairment risk; attainment undetermined due to insufficient information*). Category 3 has been increased by 2.19 miles with the listing of the Piscataqua River estuary for potential eelgrass impairment and the delisting (from coast-wide Category 5D) of the upper tidal section of the Penobscot River for PCB contamination of lobster tomalley.. Category 4 : Category 4 waters are impaired for one or more uses* but do not require the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) either because a TMDL is already completed, pollutant of concern is otherwise controlled, or impairment is due to a nonpollutant. Category 4 has been administratively increased from 0 to 153.7 square miles in 2010 because all Category 5-B-1 estuarine and marine waters in Maine (waters impaired by bacteria only) were moved from Category 5 B-1 to Category 4-A (TMDL for impaired use completed) due to USEPA approval, on September 28, 2009, of a Statewide Bacteria TMDL. Furthermore, a number of assessment units without segment sizes we re moved from category 5-B-2 (waters impaired by bacteria from Combined Sewer Overflows) to Category 4-A because of the same statewide bacteria TMDL. Categories 4-B-1 and 4-C remains unchanged for estuarine and marine waters. Category 5: The 2010 assessment assigns 2.67 (0.09%) square miles of estuarine or marine waters to Category 5 (impaired for one or more uses*). This Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report does not consider the statewide lobster tomalley consumption advisory that is in place (for all estuarine waters capable of supporting lobster) due to the potential presence of PCBs and dioxin*. Category 5 impaired waters require the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) determination. Waters are placed in one of four subcategories: 5-A for waters impaired by pollutants, 5-B-1 for waters impaired only by bacteria, 5-B-2 for waters affected by bacteria from Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO), 5-D for waters impaired by the residuals of \"legacy\" activities. Bacteria may impair either recreational uses (swimming) or shellfish consumption us es, or both. Shel lfish consumption impairments only apply to waters naturally capable of supporting the shellfish- harvesting use (i.e., waters of high enoug h salinity for propagation of shellfish. Category 5-A remains unchanged for estuarine and marine waters at 2.67 square (0.09 %) miles. All previous listings in categories 5-B-1 and 5-B-2 have been moved to Category 4-A due to the completion of a statewide bacteria TMDL. Category 5-D remains unchanged at 2,846 square miles (coast-wide)*. As with any assessment of this kind, the identification of impaired waters cannot be considered complete but rather is a reflection of the findings (to date) relative to the level of effort expended by the agency and other cooperating contributors. * All Maine estuarine and marine waters capable of supporting lobster, assigned to any Integrated Report categories have an advisory for the consumption of shellfish (lobster tomalley) due to the presence of PCBs and dioxins. The advisory is based on probability data that shellfish (lobster tomalley) inhabi ting estuarine or marine waters may exceed the advisory action level for these substances. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 71 CAUSES AND SOURCES OF IMPAIRMENT IN CATEGORIES 4 AND 5 Cause and stress type information is provided in Table 4-12, while information on sources of impairment is provided in Table 4-16. The general category of \"toxics\" is by far the cause/stressor that impairs the largest area of marine and estuarine waters in the State. In fact, the \"toxics\" subcategories of PCBs and dioxins impaired all 2,846 square miles of marine/estuarine waters that were assessed in 2010 due to the statewide lobster tomalley consumption advisory described in the previous section. By comparison, each of the other remaining general causes is responsible for impairing areas of a few square miles or less. Improved management of bacterial sources of impairment that cause shellfish closures should result from development and approval of the Statewide bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load. Bacterial contamination was the listed cause of impairment for approximately 154 square miles of estuarine waters. Industrial point sources have been the largest contributing source category for dioxin. Recently there has been no measurable difference in dioxin concentrations in fish above and below each mill. Though small, unmeasurable discharges still may be occurring these are not significant with respect to bioaccumulation in fish compared to the MCDC's Fish Tissue Action Level. Some industrial loads that are treated through municipal point sources are additional sources although pretreatment is required in most cases. These industrial sources account for most of the shellfish (lobster tomalley) consumption listed waters where dioxins remain the primary contaminant. TOXICS The removal of combined sewer overflows over the past several years has improved environmental quality in some of Maine's harbors. However, many locations, for example Kittery, Portland, Boothbay Harbor, Rockland and Searsport, still have toxic pollution problems from past activities. These activities include papermaking, shipbuilding, energy production (e.g., gasworks), tanning, and metal working. Toxics derived from these industries include dioxin, pesticides such as DDT, metals, and PCBs. Landfills were also often located on the coast (e.g., Eastern Promenade in Portland) and continue to be sources of toxic pollutants. More recent elevations in toxic pollution, especially from PAHs (pol ycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and metals (e.g., lead, copper, zinc), are related to increases in urban development and boat related activities. Direct untreated discharges through combined sewer overflows still deliver toxic pollutants and bacteria to Maine's coastal waters during and after storms. Some toxic pollutants (e.g., PAHs, mercury) are deposited from the air. SURFACE WATER AMBIENT TOXICS (SWAT) MONITORING PROGRAM Contact: Barry Mower, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) email: Barry.F.Mower@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website with annual reports: http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/swat/index.htm 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 72 A two-year (2005-2006) cooperative study funded by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the National Coastal Assessment Program and SWAT examined contaminants (including mercury, cadmium, and lead) in lobster tomalley along the Maine coast. Elevated mercury levels in tomalley appear to persist in Penobscot Bay. Lead levels in tomalley appear to be decreasing. See the 2007 SWAT report for more information. In 2007 and 2008, blue mussel ( Mytilus edulis) tissue was collected from 26 sites (13 per year) along the Maine coast and analyzed for metals. Elevated lead levels were detected at ten sites, but the lead levels appear stable or reduced when compared to past data. Elevated mercury levels were detected at four sites. Comparison to historic mercury data is difficult due to data quality issues with older data. Additional sampling should be undertaken to provide trend analyses for all metals of interest. See the 2008 SWAT report for more information. An analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in five bluefish ( Pomatomus saltatrix) collected in Saco Bay near Old Orchard Beach in 2008 showed that the concentration was well above Maine CDC's Fish Tissue Action Level of 11 ng/g. The concentrations were also similar to previous data from Saco Bay and all recent data since 2001 in Maine. See the 2008 SWAT report for more information. In 2008, the SWAT program funded the BioDiversity Research Institute (BRI) and collaborators to expand upon the 2007 broad-based contaminant study on Maine birds, measuring both historical and emerging chemicals. Out of the 23 species studied in the first year, it was determined that three required additional study in 2008: common loon (Gavia selected because loons act as bioindicators of lacustrine habitat throughout Maine, and peregrines and plovers are potentially at risk of bioaccumulating contaminants at levels above adverse effects thresholds. The compounds analyzed in nine egg composites were mercury (Hg), polychlorinated findings are: Hg, PCBs, PBDEs, PFCs, and OCs continue to be detected in birds living in diverse habitats across Maine; PFCs were detected in all samples. Hg was detected in loons and peregrine falcons at levels above adverse effects thresholds. PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate, used as a fabric protector and in paints and cleaning agents) in common loons was detected at levels above adverse effects thresholds suggested for chickens. Androscoggin Lake had the highest level. The peregrine falcon sample from Mount Desert Island had the highest contaminant load, potentially from feeding on terns. Piping plovers continue to have contaminant levels higher than we expected for an invertivore, an animal that feeds on insects and other invertebrates. The loon samples did not show a specific spatial pattern, suggesting that within the lacustrine ecosystem, contaminant levels may be dictated by point sources, watershed characteristics, and/or food web dynamics. Like the 2007 results, PCB, PBDE, PFC, and OC levels are positively correlated, indicating that birds with high levels of one compound tend to have higher levels of the others. PBDEs and PCBs have one of the strongest relationships. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 73 DecaBDE is found in all three species, but not within each sample. See the 2008 SWAT report for more information. The full report can be accessed at: http://www.briloon.org/contaminants/documents/Goodale_contaminants_2009.pdf NUTRIENTS A principal indicator of nutrient enrichment in Maine's coastal waters is green macroalgae, Ulva (formerly known as Enteromorpha ) intestinales that looks somewhat like green spaghetti. If temperatures, sunlight levels and nutrients (nitrogen) are sufficiently high, green algae proliferates, especially in more protected areas such as on mudflats, around piers and docks, and in protected harbors. This alga reproduces by releasing gametes into the water, which when present in sufficient concentrations may create conditions resembling a phytoplankton bloom. Green algae has become more apparent and more widespread in the past few years and its density and distribution may be increasing. It has been present in some extremely protected areas for many years. In 2009, green algae was not as prominent because of the cool summer with limited sunlight, which may have limited the growth of the algae. In Maine between Kittery and Bar Harbor there is now evidence of nutrient enrichment. From Bar Harbor east to the Eastport area, the principal source of nitrogen is offshore; this nitrogen from outside the Gulf of Maine promotes green algae growth on some of the more protected flats in Cobscook Bay near Eastport. Nitrogen is distributed down the coast by the Maine coastal current which usually turns offshore in the waters off Penobscot Bay. However, during certain weather conditions (e.g., northeast winds), the current may extend further down the coast. \"Red Tide\" is also carried in this current; Red Tide is discussed in Chapter 7 under Toxic Algae. A survey of the extent of Ulva along the Maine coast will be conducted in 2010. In 2008, the Maine DEP provided a report to the Maine Legislature on the development of marine and estuarine nutrient criteria. http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/report/2008/nutrient_criteria_report_2008.pdf That report incorporates data from numerous sources including the Friends of Casco Bay, the National Coastal Assessment, and other EPA data (Gibson 2004, 2005) as well as other studies of sources of nutrients. Since that report, additional data has been collected with the assistance of EPA Region I. The Department has set a target date of 2012 to develop draft criteria. PROTECTION OF MARINE LIFE (DESIGNATED USE : HABITAT FOR FISH AND ESTUARINE / MARINE LIFE ) ATTAINMENT OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN STANDARDS Three water body segments are listed as impaired waters (three in Category 5-A and one in Category 4) because they do not attain state standards for dissolved oxygen. The reasons for non-attainment are varied and include natural factors such as benthic respiration and physical circulation factors, as well as potential loadings from point and 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 74 nonpoint sources. The draft Royal River Waste Load Allocation Study recommends delisting the estuary for dissolved oxygen. The estuary will remain in Category 5 because of high bacteria counts and closure of the shellfishery. The draft Mousam River Waste Load Study indicates that the majority of oxygen loss is due to benthic respiration and circulation factors and that the Kennebunk treatment facility has only a very marginal effect. Upgrades are occurring at that facility and the estuary will be reevaluated after those occur. The upper New Meadows estuary and \"Lake\" (estuarine salinity) does not meet dissolved oxygen standards. The presumed cause is the partial impoundment on Old Route 1 at the Brunswick-West Bath town line. A modeling study is being conducted to better understand causes and determine solutions. The Piscataqua River estuary has a completed TMDL however implementation in ME and NH is incomplete. Generally, data from various studies and volunteer monitoring show oxygen levels along the cost to be adequate to protect marine life. Some estuaries have oxygen levels that do not meet their classification criteria and MDEP has concluded that many of these instances where criteria are not attained are a result of natural processes. The Maine DEP is initiating a study in cooperation with the USEPA to assess benthic respiration in a number of high quality / least impacted estuaries to assess expected background values. EELGRASS HABITAT The State of New Hampshire has listed the Piscataqua River Estuary (Lower Piscataqua River, NH Assessment Units NHEST600031001-02-01 and NHEST600031001-02-02) in its 2010 Impaired Waters List (303(d)) list for Aquatic Life impairment for due to loss of eelgrass. Maine DEP has not yet completed analysis of available eelgrass data to assess whether there is a similar problem on the Maine side of the Piscataqua River estuary. Maine has not yet developed marine nutrient criteria that might be used to interpret effect of nutrients on eelgrass. For these reasons, Maine has elected to list the Piscataqua River Estuary under Category 3 with a planned monitoring date of summer 2010. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION Ocean acidification is a topic of mounting concern worldwide as a consequence of rising atmospheric CO 2. For the 2008 Integrated Report, and again for this 2010 report, the Center for Biodiversity has petitioned coastal states to list their coastal waters as threatened, in Category 5, due to information they have gathered indicating that marine ecosystems may already be experiencing declin es in ocean pH. Maine is not listing any coastal waters due to acidification because there is no evidence that Maine waters are currently affected. Waters are listed in Category 5 as threatened when there is an expectation that impairment of a designated use is anticipated in the next listing cycle. Maine waters are not expected to show impairment of use in that timeframe. Nevertheless, Maine agrees that ocean acidification may be a significant concern for the future. The USEPA, in an agreement with the Center for Biodiversity, is taking public comment on the topic of ocean acidification and future listing of coastal waters.

New Initiatives: As a result of Legislative direction, the Division was required to amend its rules relating to stream crossings, Chapter 305 Permit by Rule Standards, Section 10 Stream crossings. These rules are major substantive rules which mean that any 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 76 amended rule is subject to final approval by the Legislature. The Division developed new crossing standards after reviewing other efforts across the country and the Army Corps of Engineers regulatory program. Chapter 305 amendments were provisionally adopted by the Board of Environmental Protection in December 2009 and are currently pending before the Legislature. The Legislature has the option of amending the rule, limiting its application or delaying its implementation. Final action by the Legislature is expected by June 2010.

DEVELOPMENT OF WETLAND WATER QUALITY STANDARDS Contact: Jeanne DiFranco, DEP BLWQ, Division of (207) email: Jeanne.L.DiFranco@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Websites: (EPA) (Wetland Water Quality) www.epa.gov/owow/wetlands/regs/quality.html (General Water Quality Standards) www.epa.gov/ost/standards/ Background: In Maine, wetlands are included in the definition of \"Waters of the State\" contained in the Protection and Improvement of Waters Act, 38 M.R.S.A. Section 361-A, and are further defined as either \"fresh surface waters\" or \"estuarine and marine waters\". As waters of the State, wetlands are subject to all pertinent provisions of the Maine Water Classification Program statute (38 M.R.S.A. Section 464 et al.) including designated uses, narrative biological criteria and the State's anti-degradation policy. Wetlands that are part of great ponds or natural lakes and ponds less than 10 acres in size are considered GPA waters. All freshwater wetlands not classified as GPA waters are classified under Sections 467 and 468 (Classification of Major River Basins and Classification of Minor Drainages) according to the drainage basin in which they occur and the classification of associated water bodies. Where not otherwise specified, wetlands assume the default classifications li sted for tributaries, since virtually all wetlands in the State drain to other water bodies via surface and/or ground water. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 77 Coastal wetlands are classified according to the provisions of 38 M.R.S.A. Section 469 (Classification of Estuarine and Marine Waters). For the purpose of determining attainment of designated uses for the current Integrated Report, DEP is considering only aquatic life use at this time. The following is a summary of pertinent narrative aquatic life criteria: Class GPA waters, including wetlands associated with great ponds and natural ponds and lakes less than 10 acres in size: Habitat for fish and aquatic life must be characterized as natural. Must have stable or decreasing trophic state, subject to natural fluctuations, and be free of culturally induced algal blooms which impair use and enjoyment. Fresh surface waters not classified GPA, including wetlands associated with rivers and streams: Class AA: Habitat for fish and aquatic life must be characterized as free-flowing and natural. Aquatic life shall be as naturally occurs. Class A: Habitat for fish and aquatic life must be characterized as natural. Aquatic life shall be as naturally occurs. Class B: Habitat for fish and aquatic life must be characterized as unimpaired. Must support all indigenous aquatic species without detrimental changes in the resident biological community. Class C: Some changes to aquatic life allowed. Must support all indigenous fish species. Structure and function of the resident biological community must be maintained. The Maine DEP Biomonitoring Program assesses the condition of rivers, streams and freshwater wetlands by evaluating resident aquatic macroinvertebrate and algal communities. River and stream biomonitoring data have been used successfully for many years to inform a variety of program s, owing to the existence of carefully developed tiered aquatic life numeric biocriteria based on sound statistical modeling. Examples of programmatic applications of biological information include ambient monitoring and trend analysis, evaluation of water quality classification attainment, impact assessment from point and non-point sources, land use activities, toxic contaminants and hydropower projects, and providing data for TMDL development. Use of wetland biomonitoring data for regulatory and management decisions has been limited in comparison to river and stream dat a, however in recent years requests to 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 78 the Biomonitoring Program for assessments of potential wetland water quality impacts from regulated activities have increased. Although Maine has narrative biological criteria for all surface waters, DEP staff relies heavily on best professional judgment when interpreting the criteria for wetlands. The Biomonitoring Program is developing wetland-specific biological criteria based on tiered aquatic life uses to provide other programs with consistent assessment s of wetland condition and impacts from regulated activities. A standardized approach to determine wetland class attainment will allow the Department to fully integrate wetlands into its water quality monitoring program, and to fulfill federal reporting requi rements under Sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Wetland Aquatic Macroinvertebrate Biocriteria Development Data Collection: The Biological Monitoring Program is currently working to develop biological criteria for wetland macroinvertebrates. Over the past 2 years, DEP biologists evaluated macroinvertebrate data collected from Maine wetlands between 2000 and 2008. Sites were targeted to encompass a gradient of human disturbance including reference (minimally disturbed) sites and severely degraded wetlands. Monitored sites were typically lacustrine or riverine fringe wetlands containing areas of emergent and/or aquatic bed vegetation. Associated physical/chemical data, water and algae samples and habitat information were collected at all sites. In addition, human disturbances observed at each site were recorded and scored in the field to identify potential environmental stressors and enable biologists to estimate the relative degree of wetland and watershed alteration. The resulting DEP Human Disturbance Score encompasses sub-categories for hydrologc and vegetative modifications in the wetland and surrounding buffer, evidence of chemical contaminants, relative degree of impervious surface in the watershed, and other observed potential non-point sources of pollutuion. The DEP Human Disturbance Ranking Form and all other field and laboratory methods are available on the DEP Biological Monitoring Program web site at http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/biomonitoring/material.htm. Reference Site Criteria and Ordination: Fifty-one minimally-disturbed reference sites were selected using the following objective criteria: Watershed land use 95% or greater \"natural\" (ie forest or wetland) based on GIS analysis; Total DEP Human Disturbance Score 10 or less, with no single disturbance category greater than 5; and Specific conductance less than 100 uS/cm (only 8 of the 51 sites exceeded 50 uS/cm). In addition, candidate reference sites were screened for atypical habitat characteristics and potential causes of impairment observed in the field that might warrant exclusion from the reference set. This reference set was used in subsequent statistical analyses to develop biological metrics, impairment thresholds and other tools described below 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 79 to inform DEP biologists' expert judgment water quality class attainment determinations. Ordination of macroinvertebrate relative abundance data for reference sites was performed using non-metric multidimensional scaling to identify potential patterns in species composition due to wetland types samp led (lacustrine or riverine fringe) or ecoregions. Results indicated no significant differences in macroinvertebrate community composition among ecoregions or between wetlands associated with lakes and ponds vs. rivers and streams for the wetland types sampled. Biological Metric Development: Over 100 macroinvertebrate community attributes were tested as potential metrics of wetland condition. Quantile plots of reference and non-reference data sets were compared to determine if cumulative distributions differed significantly. For attributes expected to increase with human disturbance, the 95 th percentile of reference data was generally used to define the upper limit of the range of natural conditions. The 5th percentile of reference data was used to define the lower limit of natural conditions for attributes that decreased with human disturbance. In a few cases, biologists adjusted the upper or lower limit based on individual patterns observed in reference distributions. Biologists also examined scatter plots of macroinvertebrate attributes in relation to data representing various human disturbance gradients including total percent watershed and buffer alteration, percent watershed imperviousness, specific conductance and the DEP Human Disturbance Score to identify portential metrics and biological thresholds. Taxa Optima, Tolerance Values and Maine Tolerance Index: Environmental stressor variables and macroinvertebrate data were used to calculate weighted average taxa \"optima\". Optima values indicate preferred environmental conditions for individual taxa, and predict whet her a species is typically found in high quality or degraded waters. Taxa optima values were calculated for specific conductance, total phosphorus, percent impervious surface and total human altered area within a 1000 meter buffer, and the DEP Human Disturbance Score. Optima values for these 5 environmental variables were used to calculate individual taxa tolerance values. A community level weighted-average index was then calculated from individual taxa tolerance values. The resulting Maine Tolerance Index (MTI) is similar in concept to the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index for aquatic macroinvertebrates commonly used in stream bioassessments, but uses only Maine data. Environmental Inference Models: Macroinvertebrate data and taxa optima values were used to build statistical models that predict individual stressor levels and infer site-specific environmental conditions at sampled locations. The inference models will be used to help diagnose stressors and determine the relative impact of multiple stressors. Inference models were calculated for specific conductance, total phosphorus, percent impervious surface and total human altered area within a 1000 meter buffer, and the DEP Human Disturbance Score. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 80 Wetland Biological Condition Gradient Model: In addition to wetland class attainment determinations, the Biomonitoring Program developed a wetland Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) model2 to provide a common scale for comparing biological condition among different aquatic resource types. The BCG model describes how 10 ecological attributes change in response to increasing levels of environmental stresso rs. It encompasses taxonomic composition and tolerance, non-native taxa, organism condition, ecosystem functions, scale dependent factors, spatial/temporal extent of impacts and ecosystem connectance. The BCG is divided into 6 condition tiers, ranging from \"natural\" (Tier 1) to severely altered conditions (Tier 6). A priori Class Attainment and BCG Model Determinations: DEP biologists evaluated 201 wetland macroinvertebrate samples and assigned Maine water quality attained class using narrative biological criteria as guidance. Narrative desciptions in the Biological Condition Gradient model were also used to assign a BCG tier for each site. Supporting data to inform this process included macroinvertebrate taxa lists, metrics, impairment thresholds, individual tolerance values, the Maine Tolerance Index, and environmental inference model results. Initial class and BCG tier attainment determinations were made independently by each biologist, and the rationale for attainment decisions was documented. This process was conducted without knowledge of site loca tions or physical/chem ical data to allow for an objective evaluation of biological condition. Once all individual determinations were made, a consensus process was used to determine the attained class prior to revealing the site locations if results varied among the team members. Consensus results were then cross checked with site locations, field notes and physical/chemical data to verify that biologists' attainment decisions made sense based on all available data. DEP will use these data and associated ex pert judgment class assignments as a baseline to develop and calibrate a statistical model to predict the attained water quality class of new wetland samples. This process is similar to those used for stream macroinvertebrates and stream algae, and will include extensive peer-review during development. When completed, DEP plans to incorporate the predictive model into the state's water quality standards and criteria program.

Wetland biomonitoring is coordinated with the State's river and stream biomonitoring program using a 5-year rotating basin schedule. DEP conducts sampling for aquatic macroinvertebrates, epiphytic algae and phytoplankton. Associated physical and chemical data are obtained through field measurements and analysis of water samples. Habitat descriptions, Cowardin classificati on, hydrogeomorphic setting, substrate, and dominant plant species/community type are also documented. In addition, the DEP Biomonitoring Program uses a Human Disturbance Score as part of a rapid assessment of environmental stressors. This information is used to characterize relative levels of human disturbance, identify sources and causes of degradation, and verify that candidate reference wetlands are actually minimally-disturbed. Currently, annual monitoring is focused primarily on emer gent and aquatic bed wetland habitat, including freshwater lacustrine and riverine fringe wetlands. Additional wetland types may be monitored in the future as resources allow. Annual Monitoring for 2008-2009: In 2008, DEP conducted biological monitoring and assessment of 28 wetlands, focusing on the Androscoggin River basin. A subset of these sites was targeted in urban watersheds where river and stream biological data were also collected. This project was part of an effort to develop tools to improv e the TMDL process for waterbodies that do not attain biological criteria. Nine wetland compensatory mitigation sites were also included in monitoring for 2008 to evaluate methods to assess biological integrity of restored, created and enhanced wetlands. Both the TMDL and wetland mitigation site assessment projects were funded by EPA Region 1 through 104(b)3 grants. Data analysis for these projects is currently underway, and results are expected to be available later in 2010. Biological monitoring in 2009 focused on the Aroostook and St. John River basins, including 20 wetland sites. DEP Biomonitoring Program staff conducted cross-training with staff from the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to assist with their efforts to develop a tribal wetland monitoring program. DEP also collaborated with the York County Soil and Water Conservation District to monitor a wetland adjacent to an experimental forest and document baseline conditions prior to logging. The goal is to ensure that forestry management practices used will prevent adverse impacts on wetland health. Summary of Wetland Aquatic Life Use Attainment For the 2010 305(b)/303(d) Integrated Water Quality Assessment Report, DEP has included provisional water quality attainment determinations for 91 wetland assessment units. Attainment decisions are based only on narrative aquatic life use criteria and were made using the expert judgment process described above. In future years, it is anticipated that DEP will refine this process and will develop and test a statistical model 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 82 for use as numeric biocriteria. EPA require s that each assessment unit is placed into one of five categories (Section 4-1, Assessment Methodology). For this provisional wetland reporting cycle, DEP did not make assessments on 83 monitored sites that biologists agreed c ould not yet be assigned to an EPA listing category with high confidence. Various reasons not to assess a site in this reporting cycle include: 1) Macroinvertebrate sample abundance and/or taxa richness were below minimum values required by DEP's assessment protocols, resulting in an \"indeterminate\" attainment call; 2) Based on expert judgment consensus, a site barely attained or just missed attaining its legi slative class by a small margin, and planned revisions of the assessment methodology are li kely to result in a different attainment determination; 3) The monitored site was not typical of the wetland habitat appropriate for the assessment methodology; 4) Site conditions were highly atypical during the sampling event (i.e. extreme high or low water levels); 5) There were human errors in following monitoring protocols. DEP anticipates including additional sites in the 2012 report following refinements to the assessment method and collection of additional monitoring data. A summary of wetland attainment status follows, and also appears in Table 4-5. Information on the status of individual wetland assessment units may be found in Appendix IV: Maine Wetlands Assessment Category 1: Wetlands attaining all designated uses and water quality standards, and no use is threatened. No wetland segments are assigned to Category 1 since present assessment only addresses attainment of aquatic life use. Other designated uses were not evaluated and the DEP is still considering appropriate criteria and methods. Category 2: Wetlands attaining some of the designated use(s), no use is threatened, and insufficient data or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened (with presumption that all uses are attained). DEP determined with high confidence that these waters attain their assigned aquatic life use based on aquatic macroinvertebrates. In addition, a review of other available data including physical/chemical attributes, field- based stressor information and spatial data do not indicate potential causes of impairment. Category 2 contains 75 wetland assessment units. Category 3: Wetlands with insufficient data and information to determine if designated uses are attained (with presumption that one or more uses may be impaired). There are 9 wetland assessment units listed in Category 3. Wetlands assigned to this category have conflicting or insufficient available data to determine attainment status with relative certainty. For the sites listed, there is significant evidence of human stressors, with the presumed likelihood they are causing impairment of one or more uses. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 83 Category 4: Wetlands impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses, but do not require development of a TMDL. Two wetland assessment units are listed in Category 4B (Expected to Attain Standards). These sites do not currently attain their aquatic life uses based on aquatic macroinvertebrate bioassessments, but pollution control requirements are expected to result in attainment once implemented. For both of these sites, the associated river and stream assessment units are also listed under category 4B. Category 5: Wetlands that are impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s), TMDL development is required. Five wetland assessment units are listed in Category 5A. These sites do not currently attain aquatic life uses based on aquatic macroinvertebrate bioassessments, and there are no pollution control requirements in place that are expected to result in attainment. For all 5 sites, associated river and stream assessment units are also listed under Category 5A. DEP anticipates that the required TMDLs will address attainment issues for both wetland and river/stream assessment units.

When applications for any wetland alterations are logged in, the amount of fill or area to be altered is also entered by wetland type and geographical location. This system enables the Department to monitor and report on annual wetland losses. Currently, the database is in need of quality assurance checks and possible data updates or revisions. DEP plans to complete this work as soon as feasible. Wetland mitigation and DEP permitted impacts for 2008 and 2009 are summarized in Tables 5-1 and 5-2 below, however these data should be considered provisional at this time. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 84 Table 5-1.

Important sources of groundwater contamination in Maine include disposal activities such as landfills and septic systems, leaking storage facilities, agriculture, and sites contaminated with spilled hazardous materials or by previously unregulated activities. Generally, the ground water supply in Maine is adequate. The total withdrawal of ground water by all water users is less than one percent of the annual ground water recharge each year. The remaining annual ground water recharge is lost through evapotranspiration or discharges to ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams. Seasonal variations in water tables can lead to local ground water shortages. The Maine Drought Task Force (convened by the Ma ine Emergency Management Agency) publishes information on Maine ground water and surface water levels at the following website: www.maine.gov/mema/drought Ground water is withdrawn from three basic ty pes of aquifers in Maine: unconsolidated glaciofluvial deposits (stratified drift or sand and gravel aquifers), till, and fractured bedrock. The stratified drift deposits are the most favorable for development of large volume water supply wells, but these deposits are limited in size and distribution (less than about 10% of the state). Discontinuous bedrock aquifers underlie the entire state and are used for domestic, commercial, industrial and agricultural purposes, and for small public supplies such as schools, restaurants, and summer camps. Wells in till do not generally yield large quantities of water and are most often used for individual domestic water supplies. BACKGROUND The protection of Maine ground water is an issue of concern at all levels of government. Serious ground water pollution problems that have occurred throughout the State and elsewhere have heightened the need for protecting ground water supplies. A few municipalities and regional planning agencies have conducted ground water quality assessment studies, but programs for comprehensive assessment of the quality of ground water resources are needed. Maine's ground water protection programs emphasize three areas of effort: 1. State interagency coordination of ground water programs; 2. Assessment of ground water protection problems, including enhancement of the Environmental and Geographic Analysis Database (EGAD); and 3. Statutory changes and building upon implemented state ground water protection programs to increase ground water protection and risk reduction. Please refer to page 124 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for a table of State groundwater protection programs (Table 6-1). http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 88 ASSESSMENT OF GROUND WATER QUALITY In Maine, ground water is classified by its suitability for drinking water purposes. Under the Maine Water Classification Program, ground water is classified as either potable (GW-A) or unpotable (GW-B). Water is unpotable when the concentrations of chemical compounds detected exceed either the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) or the Maximum Exposure Guidelines (MEG) as defined in the Rules Relating to Drinking Water administered by the Maine D epartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Although there are many localities where ground water is unpotable and highly contaminated, no ground water is currently classified GW-B. The state is not currently attempting to designate non-attainment areas. AQUIFER RISK ASSESSMENT Contact: John Hopeck, DEP email: John.T.Hopeck@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docgw/aqua_index/index.htm The state is actively assessing ways to use existing groundwater data and spatial data discussed below to evaluate relative risk to existing and potential water supplies. An ongoing study is evaluating the cumulative impact of residential, commercial, and industrial development on 300 of the signi ficant sand and gravel aquifers mapped by the Maine Geological Survey. The method provides a relative comparison of the risk of adverse impact through the Aquifer Quantitative Use Assessment, or AQUA, Index. Non-point source risks due to population and tr avel corridors are treated as a function of the density of impervious surface in th e aquifer polygon, by subtracting the total road covered or road salt influenced acreage, evaluated as a 75 foot buffer on either side of the centerline of the road, from the total number of acres of an individual aquifer. This also uses road density as a surrogate for population density and a range of possible non-point discharges. The balance of the remaining acreage was divided by a factor based on the presence and relative risk of petroleum tanks (underground/aboveground storage tanks (USTs or ASTs)), former tank locations (i.e. possible legacy of contamination) and potential or actual sources of contamination to groundwater (as derived from Environmental Geographic Analysis Database (EGAD) Site Data). The resulting number, still in units of acres, is divided by the original acreage to give the dimensionless AQUA index, which can also be expressed as a percent. An AQUA index of 1 or 100% m eans no impact. In general, larger overall acreage in combination with remoteness or other limits on development result in a higher AQUA index. This index may be used to assess the relative risk to future or present municipal, private, or commercial drinking water uses and to identify those aquifers most at risk from commercial/indus trial development or residential pressures. Overall, 77 high yield aquifer locations (26%) are non-impacted (4,881 acres or 16% of total acres), 145 (48%) are less than 50% impacted (8,540 acres or 29% of total acres), and 78 (26%) are more than 50% impacted (13,325 acres or 55% of total acres (29,746). Of the non-impacted high yield sand and gravel aquifers, 18% have public water supply wells. Of the aquifers with AQUA values between 1.0 and 0.5, 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 89 28% have public water supply wells, while of those with AQUA values less than 0.5, 38% have public water supply wells. AQUIFER CHARACTERIZATION ACTIVITIES Contact: Tom Weddle, DOC BGNA, Maine Geological Survey, Applied Geology Division Director, Section Tel: (207) (MGS) is at the \"average characteristics\" stage in characterizing the physical and chemical attributes of the State's stratified drift aquifers. While site specific data do exist for some aquifers (primarily in the vicinity of ground water resource evaluation projects and contamination sites), complete physical pictures of most aquifer systems do not exist. Hard data on the exact natural chemical processes controlling ground water chemical evolution that occur along a flow path in sand and gravel aquifers are also lacking. MGS has some ambient water quality data but has not yet fully characterized any particular aquifer system. Please refer to page 126 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for further discussion of aquifer characterization activities. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm WATER RESOURCES PLANNING COMMITTEE Contacts: Robert Marvinney, Maine email: Mark Tel: (207) 287-7842 email: Mark.T.Margerum@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov In 2007 the Maine Legislature enacted \"An Act Concerning the Sustainable Use of and Planning for Water Resources\" (P.L. 2007, Chapter 399). This law created the Water Resources Planning Committee, which is chaired by Robert Marvinney, Director of the Maine Geological Survey. The Committee is presently focused on the work of the Maine Geological Survey to conduct water resource investigations in the Freeport watersheds that host the public water supply wells for the Town of Freeport. The law also created a new licensing requirement for \"Significant Groundwater Wells\" under the Natural Resources Protection Act. Under this provision large groundwater withdrawals are now regulated by the DEP. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 90 SIGNIFICANT GROUNDWATER WELLS Contact: John Hopeck, DEP BLWQ, Division of John.T.Hopeck@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/nrpa/si gnificant_groundwater_wells/index.htm Although Maine has abundant water when recharge and use are averaged over the state, certain large wells may have local adverse effects on protected resources and wells on nearby properties. Installation and operation of these wells, with certain exceptions, is now regulated under the Natural Resources Protection Act. Applicants must demonstrate that the extraction of groundwater will not have an undue unreasonable effect on waters of the State, groundwater-related natural resources, and existing uses, including, but not limited to, public or private wells. Applicants must submit adequate background data, including stream flows and wetted perimeter and wetland water levels, pump test data and analysis, and a site-specific plan for monitoring groundwater elevation, precipitation, and other relevant hydrogeologic criteria. The Department must consider both the direct effects of the proposed withdrawal and its effects in combination with existing water withdrawals. Ongoing work by the Maine Geological Survey is evaluating whether or not the cumulative impacts of groundwater withdrawals in some larger watersheds may exceed the minimum amounts required to supply all existing uses, including both water supply and streamflow. OVERVIEW OF GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION SOURCES Most ground water contamination in Maine originates from nonpoint source pollution rather than point source pollution. The following discussion focuses primarily on nonpoint contamination sources that appear to be responsible for most ground water contamination in the State: agriculture, hazardous substance sites, spill sites, landfills, leaking underground storage tanks, septic systems, and shallow well injection. Please refer to the 2006 report beginning on page 127 for additional background information on other sources of contamination, and for additional information on the sources listed above. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm PETROLEUM STORAGE TANKS AND PRODUCT SPILLS Underground Tanks Contact: Bruce Hunter, DEP BRWM, Division of Technical Services 287-7672 email: Bruce.E.Hunter@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Websites: (General Information) www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/ust/ 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 91 (Rules for UST Facilities) www.maine.gov/sos/cec/rules/06/096/096c691.doc Leaking Underground Tanks and Drinking Water Wells The Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Remediation Priority List tracks clean-up sites and provides an objective scoring system to determine which sites receive scarce clean-up dollars. In general, the higher the score, the more quickly resources are allocated to clean up a site. Table 6-1 shows the number of sites placed on this Priority List and the change since the previous 305b report.

Many of the sites on the pr iority list are home heating oil tanks which are typically aboveground storage tanks (ASTs). Table 6-2 shows the number of private water wells and public water supplies contaminated by petroleum products or threatened with contamination by petroleum products as of October 2009. Note that one active site can contaminate or threaten more than one well.

On December 1, 2009 new petroleum cleanup guidelines went into effect based on the toxicity of petroleum fractions in addition to target compounds typically found in petroleum. The remediation approach is based on the analytical method that fractionates petroleum using two different tests pioneered by Massachusetts. The tests are: Volatile Petroleum Hydrocarbons (VPH) and Extractable Petroleum Hydrocarbons (EPH). These tests will replace GRO (Gasoline Range Organics) and DRO (Diesel Range Organics) that have been used by Maine for the past 20 years or more. The new guidelines are described in a document titled \"Remediation Guidelines for Petroleum Contaminated Sites in Maine\", November 20, 2009. Legislative Changes For several years new underground petroleum storage tanks (USTs) in Maine have been prohibited from being installed within 300 feet of a private well and within 1000 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 92 feet of a public water supply well. In 2008, this restriction was applied to retail and distribution aboveground petroleum storage tanks (ASTs) as well. For several years new USTs have faced stringent siting requirements when the proposed location is on or over a sand and gravel aquifer. Although not yet final, these same restrictions are expected to be applied to retail and distribution ASTs as well in the year 2010. In 2006, legislation closed a loophole that allowed the underground piping associated with a motor fuel AST to meet less stringent requirements than the underground piping associated with a UST. These stricter requirements became effective July 2007, with the exception of diesel ASTs with underground piping, which had a later deadline of July of 2009. A final deadline of January 2011 will take care of all \"grandfathered\" underground piping systems installed before June of 1991 that are not equipped with leak detection. Above Ground Storage Tanks Contact: David McCaskill, DEP BRWM David.McCaskill@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/abovegroundtanks Above Ground Storage Tank Spill Information Maine averages over one heating oil spill per day from ASTs at single family residences (See Figure 6-1). One reason for this statistic is that ASTs are commonly used in Maine. The 2000 U.S. Census figures show that 80% of Maine households are heated with oil. The vast majority of these households have 275 gallon ASTs located either in the basement or outside the residence. In 2008, the Maine Legislature passed a new law (Public Law 2008, chapter 569) to protect existing public and private water supplies, as well as future water supplies (i.e. sand and gravel aquifers), from the threat s of spills and leaks from aboveground oil storage tanks as well as other types of businesses that have historically posed a significant risk to drinking water (junkyards, auto body repair and automobile maintenance , dry cleaners, metal finishers and commercial hazardous waste storage facilities ). As of October 1, 2008, Maine law (38 M.R.S.A \u00a7 1391-1399) prohibits the installation of new aboveground oil storage tank (AST) facilities, such as motor fuel storage facilities and bulk fuel plants, in areas where an installation is likely to pose a threat to drinking water. The specific prohibitions are: No new ASTs within the source water protection area of a public drinking water well, or within 1000 feet of the public water well (whichever is greater), and No new ASTs within 300 feet of a private well (except for a private water supply well located on the same property as a facility and serving only that facility). The law applies to new petroleum storage facilities. Existing facilities or facilities under construction where the Department has det ermined a substantial amount of money or effort has been expended on the completion of the facility prior to the effective date of this law are exempt. Heating oil tanks for use on the premises are exempt. The law 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 93 now places both AST and underground oil storage tank (UST) facilities under the same siting restrictions regarding proxim ity to public and/or private drinking water wells. The statute also authorizes the Department to promulgate regulations restricting the location of new AST facilities and the other previous described business on significant sand and gravel aquifers mapped by the Maine Geologic Survey in a manner similar to existing restrictions on new UST facilities. Following input from stakeholders, these rules were adopted by the Maine Board of Environmental Protection on October 15, 2009. Since the law designated this rule as \"Substantial\" it has been submitted to the Legislature for review during the current session. The final rules should be out by early May of 2010.

Of these events, 915 do not have completed reports and, therefore, are not included in this discussion. An estimated 89% of these responses involved discharges of petroleum products to soil and/or groundwater. During this period, response services personnel discovered over 21 wells that had been contaminated from these spills. Due to further investigation and report completion, these figures are subject to change. Table 6-3 provides information on the 2,158 spills that had completed spill reports.

The agricultural community uses chemicals for pest contro l and weed eradication; in addition, many farmers apply chemical fertilizers and manure to their agricultural lands. These are all major potential sources of ground water contamination. The major areas of chemical application include potato fields in Aroostook County, blueberry barrens in Hancock and Washington Counties, and apple orchards and forage cropland in Central Maine. Pesticides and nitrates are the main categories of agricultural ground water contaminants.

By applying manure and other nutrients only in the amounts needed for crop production and in a way that will consider nearby sensitive resources, fewer nutrients will leave the site and impact water quality. Studies of Maine farms where nutrient management pr actices have been implemented show that water quality within a watershed can be significantly improved.

The Division of Remediation investigates and mitigates the risk posed to public health and the environment from these sites. The Department may undertake the investigation and clean-up themselves, but more often compels potential responsible parties to undertake the work, through either the state's uncontrolled sites program (for smaller sites) or via one of two federal programs: the federal RCRA program for recently operated sites, or the CERCLA program (the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response and Comprehensive Liability Act, aka Superfund) at sites where operators are not longer viable. Additionally, many sites are investigated and remediated under one of two voluntary programs: the Brownfields Program, which partially funds the work with federal dollars, and Maine's Voluntary Remedial Action Program (VRAP).

This responsibility rests with DHHS because the treatment and disposal of human sanitary waste has been historically considered a public health issue. The Subsurface Wastewater Unit within the Division of Environmental Health promulgates and administers the Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules. The Program also maintains microfiche copies of all plumbing and subsurface wastewater permits that have been issued statewide from 1974 to 2004. During the period from January 2008 through May 2009 the Program processed approximately 16,400 internal and external plumbing and subsurface wastewater permits. Nitrates and Septic Systems The Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory (HETL) database contains the results of water tests done on private wells. This database provides the largest sample of private well nitrate concentrations in the state. Assuming that the HETL database for nitrate-N represents Maine ground water quality, data from January 2008 to May 2009 indicate approximately 98% of wells sampled have concentrations below 5 mg/L, well below the 10 mg/L drinking water standard for nitrate-N (Table 6-9). This percentage has remained steady for the past few reporting cycles. Table 6-5 Nitrate-N Frequency 2.51 to 5.00 4.2 4.5 5.6 5.01 to 7.50 1.2 1.1 2.0 7.51 to 10.00 0.4 0.5 0.5 Greater than 10.0 0.3 0.2 0.0 Number of Analyses 6,000 7,100 2,197 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 100 1HETL database for private well analyses between 1/1/08 and 5/31/09. 2HETL database for private well analyses between 1/1/06 and 5/31/07. 3HETL database for private well analyses between 1/1/04 and 5/31/05. Bacteria Private well testing for bacteria identifies a greater contamination potential from bacteria than from nitrate. In public and private drinking water supplies, coliform bacteria are used as the indicator of microbial contamination. The Primary Drinking Water Standard for total coliform bacteria is 0 colonies per 100 ml. Table 6-7 shows that larger percentages of dug wells test positive for bacteria than drilled wells. This lends support to the belief that dug wells are more susceptible to bacterial contamination than drilled wells. Table 6-8 shows recent well testing data, however HETL no longer distinguishes bet ween dug and drilled wells in its reporting.

Glacial aquifers in these materials contain large volumes of easily extracted water, but are highly vulnerable to contamination. Groundwater monitoring at large commercial and industrial sites shows that the volume of pollutants discharged to these infiltration systems gener ally exceeds the treatment capacity of the soil and aquifer. Chloride is the most common pollutant, but data also indicate that changes in chemical conditions in the infiltration systems can release accumulated metals and other pollutants to the underlying aquifer over time. These data are consistent with findings in other states and in the European Union, and have been cited by EPA in a recent summary of stormwater recharge methods. Ongoing work on stormwater management rules is intended to encourage infiltration, where geologically feasible, from low-pollutant sources, while discouraging concentrated discharges to groundwater from large areas of connected impervious surface. Groundwater monitoring will continue at currently-monitored sites. Metallic Mining Contact: Mark Stebbins, DEP email: Mark.N.Stebbins@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/miningpage.htm The only metallic mining activity conducted in the State during the reporting period was an exploratory drill program undertaken by Golden Hope Mines for a zinc-silver- copper-gold project at a prospect known as Big Hill in Pembroke, Washington County. The company has since completed its drilling program and plugged all of the drill holes. No additional work is planned for the site. Gravel Pits Contact: Mark Stebbins, DEP BLWQ, Mark.N.Stebbins@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/miningpage.htm The Maine DEP has licensed 723 mining sites (gravel pits & rock quarries). Within the last few years the department has seen an increase in the number of quarries licensed. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 103 Recent changes to performance standards now include a variance provision for excavation into ground water. Previously, a separation distance of one to five feet was required between the base of the excavation and the seasonal high water table (SHWT). In general, prior to issuing any variance to excavate gravel from below the SHWT, the Department investigates the dewatering potential for adjacent wells and protected natural resources. The DEP has issued approximately 48 variances to excavate gravel and rock from below the wa ter table. These sites are extensively monitored for both ground water levels and quality. Several groundwater studies for large rock quarries have indicated the potential to dewater adjacent streams. In a few cases, the Department has placed conditions on the operator's permit that require changes to the pumping rate or temporary cessation of dewatering to ensure that there are no unreasonable adverse impacts to protected natural resources or existing water supply wells. To date, the Department has not observed the direct dewatering of any protected natural resource due to mining from below the water table at these sites. In 2008, the department experienced its first encounter with acid rock drainage from an aggregate quarry located in Northern Maine. The culprit rock unit was a sulfidic pelite containing pyrite, that was blasted through at the quarry. The blasted rock is now exposed to air and water and the acid generation is occurring. As a corrective measure, the reactive rock has been mixed with a layer of limestone and capped with clay. Water quality results prior to corrective action indicated high sulfate and iron concentrations with a specific conductance value of 2859 us. With the addition of alkaline material, the pH of the drainage is 5.36. The department continues to monitor the site for acid rock drainage.

Well s shown are those which were sampled. For 2010 the ambient ground water quality monitoring network consists of 1206 public water supplies. Each of the selected public water supplies is provided by only one source of water: either a drilled well in bedrock; a dug well in glacial till; a drilled well, well point, or dug well in glacial outwash sand and gravel or recent sandy alluvium (Figure 6-2). Some of the wells are large community water supplies; some are non- transient, non-community water supplies. Analytical results for periodic, routine sampling of raw water were provided by the DWP. Not all the well samples were analyzed for the all the same chemical constituents every time they were obtained: frequency depends on the type of water supply and the population served. Nevertheless, the DEP believes that the selection represents ambient ground water quality in the three major geologic settings that provide ground water in Maine. Sand and gravel aquifers are often high yield water sources and are often found in developed areas, and are therefore vulnerable to contamination. Bedrock aquifers, though not usually hydrologically connected, underlie the whole state and are mostly used as private water supplies, as are glacial till aquifers. The locations of the wells used to indicate ambient water quality are shown in Figure 6-3 and a summary of the 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 105 ambient water quality data is in Table 6-9.

Although discovery of existing contamination is expected to continue, future reports of contamination are expected to decline as the State's ground water protection initiatives continue to be implemented. These programs stress contamination prevention rather than remediation.

During the current reporting cycle, the Maine State Planning Office Coastal Program managed the program through a partnership with the University of Maine Cooperative Extens ion (UMaine Extension) and Sea Grant and numerous local beach managers and volunteers. The Healthy Beaches Program was transferred from the Maine State Planning Office to DEP on January 1, 2009. All participating beaches, including State Parks, conduct routine monitoring of beach water quality from Memorial Day through Labor Day. When exceedances occur, resampling is conducted for those sites. Private beach owners are responsible for their own monitoring programs unless they are working with the local municipality and MHB. Often private beaches do not conduct any monitoring. In Maine, the monitoring of town owned beaches and providing public notification of beach status, is the jurisdiction of the municipality. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated the Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health (BEACH) Act of 2000 in response to the growing concern about public health risks posed by polluted coastal swimming beaches. MHB is a voluntary program and includes these components: water quality assessment and public notification of beach status, education and outreach, and working with communities and program partners to identify and remediate pollution sources through applied research and special studies. The assessment program includes measurement of critical factors that affect the health of the beach environment as well as the health of people who visit them (for participating beaches only).

A goal of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is to have these areas meet their designated use of \"Propagation and Harvest of Shellfish.\" Shellf ish areas are closed by DMR if the area is found to have elevated levels of bacteria or if the area is determined as threatened by potential sewage pollution problems (proximity of wastewater outfalls or intense storm runoff events). Water samples are collected and tested for fecal coliform bacteria at least six (6) times annually from each of the more than 2,000 established sampling sites that are located along the entire Maine coast. The shoreline survey includes a visual inspection of the shoreline to determine the location and magnitude of potential sewage pollution and toxic contamination problems. TOXIC ALGAE (RED TIDE) Contact: Darcie Couture, Toxin Monitoring Director, DMR BRM, Public Health Marine Biotoxin \"Red Tide\" is used to refer to rapid increases in numbers of microscopic marine algae that contain potentially lethal toxins. The toxin is transferred to humans by the ingestion of shellfish that have filtered the organisms into their systems. The toxin affects humans by paralyzing the central nervous system and, in high doses, may cause death. DMR's Biotoxin Monitoring Program monito rs levels of PSP (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning or \"Red Tide\") and other marine biotoxins in the shellfish and waters of Maine. Shellfish samples are collected statewide between April and October and evaluated at the Biotoxin laboratories in West Boothbay Harbor and Lamoine. When toxin is found approaching quarantine levels, closures of shellfish harvest areas are implemented. Maine has historically had high levels of PSP during the warmer periods of the year. While red tide is a water quality issue, it is not a direct cause and effect relationship with human-caused pollutants. Closures, therefore, are not reported as violations of water quality standards. For information on closures, call DMR's hot line 1-800-232-4733 or 207-633-9571or visit the web at www.maine.gov/dmr/rm/public_health/closures/shellfishhotline.htm 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 114 Ocean Fish and Shellfish Consumption Advisories Contact Andrew Smith, DHHS Maine CDC, Environmental and Occupational Health Program Tel: (207) 287-5189 email: Andy.E.Smith@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dhhs/eohp/fish/ Waters attain their \"Clean Water Act-designated use for Fishing,\" whenever government agencies issue fish and/or shellfish consumption advisories. These advisories are designed to let citizens know that there may be an increased risk to their health if they choose to consume certain species of fish or shellfish. Since 1992, human health consumption advisories have been in place to warn the public against the consumption of lobster tomalley due to high levels of toxic contaminants. No evidence of elevated levels of these contaminants was found in lobster meat. The advisory was expanded to include bluefish and striped bass in 1996, also due to detection of elevated levels of toxic contaminants in their flesh. The advisory for striped bass and blue fish was substantially revised in June 2009 based on recent sampling data from Maine and other Atlantic coastal states. The entire Maine coast (for waters naturally capable of supporting lobster propagation and harvest) is only in partial support of its designated use for fish ing due to these consumption advisories. Toxic contamination found in lobster tomalley is presumed to originate in Maine waters, which leads to their listing in Category 5-D for non-attainment due to legacy pollutants. Toxic contaminants found in migratory or pelagic finfish are presumed to have been acquired largely outside of Maine waters where the fish spend most of their lives. Thus, advisories for marine finfish are not listed as causes of non-attainment. Advisory Overview Current information, with a last revision date of June 3, 2009, on ocean fish and shellfish advisories as adapted from the Maine CDC is as follows: WARNING About Eating Saltwater Fish and Lobster Tomalley Warning: Chemicals in some Maine saltwater fish and lobster tomalley may harm people who eat them. Women who are or may become pregnant and children should carefully follow the Safe Eating Guidelines. It's hard to believe fish that looks, smells, and tastes fine may not be safe to eat. But the truth is that some saltwater fish have mercury, PCBs and Dioxins in them. All these chemicals settle into the ocean from the air. PCBs and Dioxins also flow into the ocean through our rivers. These chemicals then build up in fish. Small amounts of mercury can damage a brain starting to form or grow. That's why babies in the womb, nursing babies, and young children are at most risk. Mercury can also harm older children and adults, but it takes larger amounts. PCBs and Dioxins can cause cancer and other health problems if too much builds up in your body. Since some saltwater fish contain several chemicals, we ask that all consumers of the following saltwater species follow the safe eating guidelines. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 115 Specific Ocean Fish Consumption Advisories Safe Eating Guidelines Striped Bass and Bluefish: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant, nursing mothers and children under 8 years of age should not eat any striped bass or bluefish. All other individuals should eat no more than 4 meals per year. Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, and Tilefish: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant and children under 8 years of age are advised to not eat any swordfish or shark. All other individuals should eat no more than 2 meals per month. Canned Tuna: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant and children under 8 years of age should eat no more than 1 can of \"white\" tuna or 2 cans of \"light\" tuna per week. All other ocean fish and shellfish, including canned fish and shellfish: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant and children under 8 years of age should eat no more than 2 meals per week. Lobster Meat and Tomalley Consumption Advisories Lobster Meat: Consumption advisories do not exist for lobster meat. Lobster Tomalley: Recommended to completely avoid consumption of lobster tomalley. While there is no known safety considerations when it comes to eating lobster meat, consumers are advised to refrain from eating the tomalley. The tomalley is the soft, green substance found in the body cavity of the lobster that functions as the liver and pancreas. Test results have shown that the tomalley can accumulate contaminants found in the environment.

The results are forwarded to the MCDC who is responsible for recommending the warnings on eating fish based on the presence of chemicals (MSRA 22 \u00df 1696 I) . MCDC does so in the form of Fish Consumption Advisories, which can be seen with additional information at http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/eohp/fish/ . There is a statewide Fish Consumption 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 116 Advisory for all freshwaters because of mercury and additional advisories for specific waters because of other contaminants. Mercury Statewide Fish Consumption Advisory Based on monitoring of mercury concentrations in freshwater fish from all over Maine, the Maine Bureau of Health ( now MCDC) issued a statewide advisory for all Maine lakes and ponds in 1994 and expanded it to include all freshwaters in 1997, and revised in 2000 as follows: Pregnant and nursing women, wo men who may get pregnant, and children under age 8 SHOULD NOT EAT any freshwater fish from Maine's inland waters. Except, for brook trout and landlocked salmon, 1 meal per month is safe. All other adults and children older than 8 CAN EAT 2 freshwater fish meals per month. For brook trout and landlocked salmon, the lim it is 1 meal per week. DIOXIN Dioxin levels in fish from Maine rivers continue to decline, approaching background at some locations but still exceeding background at others. An evaluation of the need for fish consumption advisories due to the presence of dioxin-like compounds in fish requires a comparison to a health benchmark. The ME-CDC uses a health benchmark that is expressed as a toxicity-weighted concentration of dioxin-like compounds in fish tissue, referred to as a \"Fish Tissue Action Level\" or FTAL. For the present report, the ME-CDC compares the most recent data on contaminant levels to its current FTA Ls for dioxin-like compounds of 1.5 parts per trillion (ppt) for protection of cancer-related effects and a 0.4 parts per trillion FTAL for protection of noncancer related effects. The FTAL of 1.5 ppt for cancer related effects has been used by ME-CDC since 1990. The FTAL of 0.4 ppt for noncancer effects is based on the same toxicity data relied upon since 1990, but has been adjusted downward to account for the substantial background exposure we all get from the presence of these chemicals in most dietary foods. For the first time since 1987, there was no dioxin monitoring for this summer 2009. We expect to resume in 2010 perhaps monitoring in alternating years. The ME-CDC has evaluated recent data that can be seen at http://mainegov-images.informe.org/dep/bl wq/docmonitoring/dioxin/report_2007.pdf RIVER AND STREAM SPECIFIC FISH CONSUMPTION ADVISORIES The dominant causes for the following fish consumption advisories are identified as dioxin/furans/coplanar PCBs, total PCBs, and total DDTs (DDD + DDE + DDT). ME- CDC is currently reviewing all the fish c ontaminant data since 2003 and expects any revisions to the fish consumption advisories to be issued in spring 2010. Current advisories are listed on next page. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 117 Department of Health and Human Servi ces Guidelines about Eating Freshwater Fish Warning: Mercury in Maine freshwater fish may harm th e babies of pregnant and nursing mothers, and young children. SAFE EATING GUIDELINES Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant, and children under age 8 SHOULD NOT EAT any freshwater fish from Ma ine's inland waters. Except, for brook trout and landlocked salmon, 1 meal per month is safe. All other adults and children older than 8 CAN EAT 2 freshwater fish meals per month. For brook trout and landlocked salmon, the limit is 1 meal per week. It's hard to believe that fish that looks, smells, and tastes fine may not be safe to eat. But the truth is that fish in Maine lakes, ponds, and rivers have mercury in them. Other states have this problem too. Mercury in the air settles into the waters. It then builds up in fish. For this reason, older fish have higher levels of mercury than youn ger fish. Fish (like pickerel and bass) that eat other fish have the highest mercury levels. Small amounts of mercury can harm a brain starting to form or grow. That is why unborn and nursing babies and young children are most at risk. Too much mercury can affect behavior and learning. Mercury can harm older children and adul ts, but it takes larger amounts. It may cause numbness in hands and feet or changes in vision. The Safe Eating Guidelines identify limits to protect everyone. Warning: Some Maine waters are polluted, requiring additional limits to eating fish. Fish caught in some Maine waters have high le vels of PCBs, Dioxins or DDT in them. These chemicals can cause cancer and other health effects. The Bureau of Health recommends additional fish consumption limits on the waters listed below. Remember to check the mercury guidelines. If the water you are fishing is lis ted below, check the mercury guideline above and follow the most limiting guidelines.

Public health concerns arise because some of the contaminants are individually linked to numerous toxic effects ranging from allergic reactions and respiratory impairment to liver and kidney damage, and damage to the central nervous system. Additional public health concerns also arise because information is not available about the health impacts of many contaminants found in groundwater. Due to uncertainties in the relationships between exposure to contaminants and impacts on human health, public health efforts are based on identifying the probabilities of impacts (i.e. risk assessm ent). Conducting a risk assessment for combinations of contaminants that are commonly found in groundwater is difficult because there are no generally accepted protocols for testing the effects of contaminant interactions. The primary route of exposure to contaminants is through ingestion of drinking water, although exposure is also possible through contact with skin and inhalation of vapors from groundwater sources (bathing, food preparation, industrial processes, etc.) Because groundwater generally provides base flow to streams and rivers, environmental impacts include toxic effects on benthic invertebrates, fish, wildlife and aquatic vegetation. This also presents a public health concern if the surface waterbody is a source of food and recreation. In some areas of the State there are probably links between low-level, long-term groundwater quality degradation and the water quality of streams and brooks during low-flow conditions.

The WHPP continues to be a voluntary program for Maine's public water suppliers, with all reduced or waived monitoring tied to approved protection programs. To be eligible for reduced or waived monitoring, a system must have an approved local Wellhead Protection Plan (WHPP) and have completed a waiver application. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 119 SOURCE WATER ASSESSMENT PROGRAM Contact: Andrews L.

Protecting a water supply source has long been recognized as the cornerstone of providing safe drinking water. The most effective source protection method is to keep the area contributing water to the supply open and undeveloped. The Maine Drinking Water Program's (DWP) recently completed five year assessment of source protection for public water supplies identified rapid residential and commercial development in source protection areas as the most significant threat to water quality and quantity, and few water suppliers are prepared to deal with these risks. Public Water Systems (PWS) have a very limit ed suite of tools for source protection: they can purchase land, inspect existing activities, and ask local government to enact (and enforce) protective ordinances. Only one in five of Maine's community water systems have effective source protection plans in place after more than fifteen years of encouragement and incentives. FINISHED WATERS Contact: Andy Tolman, DHHS Maine CDC, Divi sion of Tel: (207) 287-6191 email: andrews.l.tolman@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.medwp.com The Drinking Water Program (DWP) is the front line enforcement agent of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the rules and regulations set forth in the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The requirements of SDWA apply to the approximately 2,000 public drinking water systems in Maine. There are 70 water systems that use surface water as their primary source and these all have water treatment systems and watershed protecti on programs. Of the approximately 1,880 ground water systems, 876 have some form of treatment on-line (and this number is likely to continue to rise) while the remaining systems have no treatment and serve raw water. Water testing on finished water is the primary means for assessing public water system compliance while verifying the quality of water that is reaching consumers. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 120 PRIVATE WELLS Contact Andrew Smith, DHHS Maine CDC, Environmental and Occupational Health Program Tel: (207) 287-5189 email: Andy.E.Smith@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dhhs/eohp/wells/ The State of Maine has one of the highest per capita uses of domestic household wells for drinking water in the U.S. Based on data from Maine's 2003 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), 52 percent of the state's population relies on private domestic wells for their drinking water. Despite the fact that the majority of Maine residents obtain their drinking water from private household wells, the State does not have an environmental health services program focused specifically on meeting the needs of private well owners. Please refer to pages 162-167 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for additional information on Maine's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Protection Programs, and Finished Water and Private Well information. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm RADON Contact: Bob Stilwell, DHHS Maine CDC, Division of Environmental Health, Radiation Control Program Tel: (207) 287-5698 (or 800-232-0842 in Maine) email: Bob.Stilwell@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dhhs/eng/rad/hp_radon.htm Not all public health concerns that involve ground water are caused by pollution released from human activities. The presence of naturally occurring radioactive radon gas in ground water drawn from granite bedrock aquifers and overlying soils has long been recognized as a problem in Maine. Based on studies of miners and more recently on people living in homes with high radon concentrations, medical researchers have shown that high radon levels in air are associated with increased incidence of lung cancer. Radon in water supplies is a concern because radon is readily released into the air from water. Therefore the health concerns stems more from inhalation of the radon rather than drinking the water. A large number of Maine wells have radon concentrations that through normal household water use, release concentrations of radon into the air that are as high or higher than the concentrations associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer. The average concentration of radon in public or private water supplies in Maine ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 picocuries/Liter (pci/L). The Maine State Toxicologist set a maximum exposure guideline (MEG) for radon in water of 4,000 pCi/l, effective January 1 2007. For private wells with radon in water concentrations between 4,000 pCi/l and 10,000 pCi/l, the Toxicologist recommends investigation of the total radon risk in the structure from water and soil gas (air), then making a decision to reduce 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 121 radon based on the amount of risk the occupants are willing to accept and the resources available for radon risk reduction. For private wells with radon concentrations of 10,000 pCi/l or higher in water, the guidance recommends reducing the radon in water concentration regardless of the radon in air concentration. The new radon in water MEG is also being used by the Drinking Water Program when evaluating new community water supplies and new non-transient, non-community water supplies.

The current Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for arsenic is 50 ppb (parts per billion); however the EPA has recently proposed lowering the MCL to 10 ppb in drinking water. The Maine Bureau of Health has set a maximum exposure guideline (MEG) for arsenic in domestic well water at 0.01 milligrams of arsenic per liter of water (which is equal to 10 ppb). This is also the same amount that the World Health Organization currently recommends. A 1994 - 1995 study of about 600 randomly selected wells indicated that, statewide, about 1 to 2 percent have arsenic levels greater than 50 ppb. However, about 10 percent have arsenic levels above the MEG of 10 ppb. Currently a source or sources for all arsenic detected in well water has not been determined. However, preliminary work by the MGS, University of Maine Department of Geological Sciences, DEP, and DHHS indicate that the problem is of statewide significance and that the arsenic concentration in ground water is most likely the result of both natural processes and human activity. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 122 CHAPTER 8 SUMMARY OF IMPAIRED WATERS Table 8-1a and 8-1b present specific Causes of impairment that have been removed from the list of Impaired Waters (the\"303d List\") for the specified river and stream segments.

Data used in making decisions on the status of Maine waters are collected, analyzed, and evaluated according to the standards contained in the Department's QMP or Quality Management Plan (Revision 2, as approved by EPA-New England, June, 2003). The Plan documents DEP's Quality Management System (QMS) which applies to all program areas and activities in the Maine DEP. The QMS uses a rigorous internal second-party audit approach to managing for quality, in addition to program- level QA/QC activities. The latter are documented in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) developed and implemented for each program area. SOPs are included in all Quality Assurance Project/Program Plans (QAPPs) applicable to environmental data gathering and analysis. ENVIRONMENTAL AND GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS DATABASE (EGAD) Contact: Chris Halsted, EGAD Pr ogrammer/Analyst, MDEP (for access to MDEP data via Google Earth projects on the internet) The Maine Environmental and Geographic Analysis Database (EGAD) stores site and water quality information in a relational database using Oracle technology and spatial locations using Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Spatial Database Engine (SDE) software. The database includes data from groundwater and surface water samples as well as sediment and biological samples and other pertinent information. To date (February 2010), data from the following MDEP programs involved in monitoring activities has been incorporated: Environmental Geology, Biological Monitoring, SWAT (Surface Water Ambient Toxics; freshwater and marine), Dioxin Monitoring, Rivers-Stream TMDL, Rivers and Healthy Beaches; data from the Lakes Assessm ent program has been partly incorporated . There are a total of 18,841 sampling sites in the database and a total of 5.1 million samples each of which has one to many results records; ~1.8 million of these samples are used in water quality assessments in general. Approximately 750 groundwater sites and 100 surface water sites are added to the database every year. 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 203 Data collected by MDEP staff or submitted by contractors or laboratories are loaded to EGAD using a standard EDD (Electronic Data Deliverable) which offers automated quality control. The EGAD system allows complete integration of all data via spatial relationships. Database functionalities exist to assess trends in water quality information, satisfy requests for data, assist in answering inquiries, provide automated analysis, and enable customized reporting and map-making. The database allows rapid access to information which is critical for emergency response for hazardous materials spills. MDEP staff can also geo-locate, browse and access all EGAD data together with related site and monitoring information on the Internet via several Google Earth projects. The ability to access a large variety of data quickly, easily and in a number of different formats allows staff to identify resources that require protection, such as lakes, streams, or municipal or private wells, and to target monitoring efforts. Water quality assessment results are stored in Maine's version of the EPA Assessment Database (ADB) and a link to a prototype ArcMap project shows geo-referenced assessment units and the water quality geodatabase. MDEP envisions that all raw water quality data in support of the Integrated Report will ultimately be stored in EGAD. The GIS-facilitated link to ADB assessments will ultimately allow for waterbody assessments via a fully geo-referenced Maine ADB . Since 2008, EGAD has been exporting Maine water quality data to the national EPA database (STORET) via WQX, the Water Quality Exchange system; to date only data from SWAT and River-Stream TMDL programs have been transferred to WQX (export of Healthy Beaches data to WQX is also imminent) . Like MDEP staff, the public can also access Maine surface and groundwater data as well as related site and monitoring information data via Google Earth. WATER QUALITY GIS AND THE NATIONAL HYDROGRAPHY DATA (NHD) Contacts: email: douglas.suitor@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov The MDEP Bureau of Land & Water Quality is highly active in designing, creating, and maintaining hydrologic and terrestrial spatial features for use in water quality decision making programs for the State of Maine. Our primary objective over the last year (2009) has been to assist in establishing The National Hydrography Data (NHD) as Maine's core hydrographic dataset. We have a dedicated staff person who has attained national NHD Stewardship certification and whose performance measures include incorporating all our water quality information into NHD format. The NHD base data, as well as all supporting spatial data sets regarding water quality, are housed at the Maine Office of GIS for efficient on-line access through the MEGIS Internet Data Catalog ( http://megis.maine.gov/catalog ). The MEGIS Internet Data Catalog is provided at no cost and is suppor ted by Maine's Legislative initiative (L.D. 2116 \"An Act to Establish the Maine Library of Geographic Information (Chapter 649). The initiative established data custodians within Departments to organize, catalog, and provide access to public geographic information to all levels of government and to the 2010 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine DEP 2010 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 204 public. The MDEP and BL&WQ are highly supportive and involved with this process for disseminating all spatial components of water quality information and analysis activities. An additional goal that is becoming well established is the creation of on-line tutorials for our staff as well as outside users of NHD. These programs will ensure easy access and retrieval of water quality information for DEP users as well as all State and national users of Maine based GIS water quality information. LISTINGS ON INDIVIDUAL WATERS See Appendices II through V (separate document) for listing information on specific waters. Appendices include assessments for rivers/streams, lakes, wetlands and estuarine waters. "}
