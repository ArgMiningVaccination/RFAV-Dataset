Did you know that the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables to eat per day is five to 13 servings? If one serving is equivalent to a medium sized fruit or a cup of leafy greens, just imagine eating at least five of those a day. Our low consumption of fruits and vegetables may be attributed to our busy lifestyle. Fruits and vegetables aren't exactly the easiest and the quickest to eat. Think of the effort needed to buy, wash, peel and cut fruits before you eat them. Or to shop for vegetables, then bring them home to wash, prep and cook them. Those are the days where JUICES become a lifesaver. It's so easy to make juices. All you need is a juicer or a blender, vegetables and fruits, and maybe some spices to add a little kick. Fresh juices are rich in nutrients, easy to digest, taste delicious, are a healthy addition to your regular meals, not to mention helps you to get your five-a-day fruit and vegetable requirement. Here are six delicious everyday juice recipes you'll come to love. Do note that as fruits are high in natural sugars, it would be a good idea to base your juices mainly off vegetables and use fruits as a flavouring. Health and nutrition experts also recommend using juices as a supplement to your daily intake rather than relying on juices alone for your nutritional intake. Once you've made your juice, be sure to down it fast as fruits and vegetables that are turned from solids into liquids, tend to lose their nutrients quicker. 1. The Immune System Kick This power combo is just what your body needs for days when you're feeling under the weather or when there's a bug going around in the office. Ginger's antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties help to combat the onset of illnesses. The additional vitamins A, B, C and D from the carrots and orange also help boost your body's defense. Recipe: 4 small carrots + 1 orange + half lemon + 1\" piece ginger 2. The Basic Detox Year-end parties and gatherings are inevitable, and sometimes you just can't help but to feast and treat each meal as a cheat meal. The consequences are evident in the days following when you feel bloated and indigested from too much of oil, salt and sugar in your meals. Keep this simple combination on hand whenever you need a quick pick-me-up. The tartness of the apples helps to balance out the carrot juice, and the addition of ginger gently kick-starts your system into shape. Recipe: 2 carrots + 2 apples + 2 tablespoons ginger 3. The Hydration Boost Whether you're clearing your annual leaves or going for your long-awaited Christmas-by-the-beach trip, you'll be spending extended periods outdoors and under the sun - longer than you may be used to if you work in an air-conditioned office. In the event you find yourself dehydrated or sunburnt, whip up this concoction in your blender. Lettuce, cucumber and celery have very high water content (up to 96%) and replenishes your body's water levels quickly. Recipe: Half cucumber + 2 cups lettuce + 2 celery stalks + 2 apples + 1 orange 4. The Post-Workout Juice If you're looking to tone up or slim down by working out (Christmas and Chinese New Year are just around the corner, after all), have a protein-rich post-workout meal or drink to replenish your energy levels and help the body recover quickly. Iron-rich spinach helps you to maintain stamina, and tomatoes are great in boosting your body's absorption of iron. Plus, it's affordable to make on your own. Recipe: 2 tomatoes + 1 large handful of spinach + 1 lemon/lime + 4 sprigs basil (optional) 5. The Energy Lift Why reach for a sugar-laden doughnut or a pack of chips for a short spurt of energy, when you can have a tasty juice that will give you energy for longer? Nature's answer to energy boosters: a power-packed beetroot juice. This recipe uses all parts of the beetroot including its leaves, and is packed with beta-carotene and Vitamin C. You may add ginger for a zing or cinnamon powder for added aroma. Recipe: 2 beetroots and leaves + 2 carrots + 1 orange + half inch ginger 6. The 3+2+1 Meal It's inevitable that we skip a meal every now and then, whether it's due to our unpredictable schedule or a last-minute meeting. Whatever your reason, remember that treating your body to a good meal replacement is better than feeding it with junk food, or no food at all. Just blend 3 cups of green + 2 cups liquid + 1 cup fruit to make a tasty and filling juice or smoothie that will wade you through your next meal. Here are some ideas and options to mix and match: Greens: Spinach, lettuce, watercress, cucumber, broccoli celery Liquid: Coconut water, fresh juice, green tea, water Fruit: Banana, papaya, pineapple, pear, apple Recipe: 3 cups of green + 2 cups liquid + 1 cup fruit Reference articles are intended for informational purposes only.
