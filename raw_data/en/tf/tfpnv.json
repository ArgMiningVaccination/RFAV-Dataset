Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses , 1 September 2021. ECDC: Stockholm; 2021. \u00a9 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , Stockholm, 2021 TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 1 September 2021 Key messages Providing all eligible individuals with the recommended dose regimen should remain the current priority for COVID -19 vaccination programmes in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA ). It is important to distinguish between ' booster ' doses for people who responded adequately to pr imary vaccination and additional doses for those with weakened immune systems who did not respond adequately . Booster doses are given to vaccinated people (i.e. those who have completed a primary series of COVID -19 vaccination) to restore protection after it would have waned. On the other hand, a dditional doses as part of a primary vaccination series may be given to people with severely weakened immune systems, as they may not achieve an adequate level of protection from the standard primary vaccination. When assessing the need for possible booster doses of COVID -19 vaccine from the public health perspective, it is important to keep in mind the main objective of the vaccination strategy (i.e. preventing severe cases of COVID -19). Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease should preferably be chosen as the primary outcome of interest for assessing whether there is a clear need for a booster dose in specific groups. The available evidence at this time regarding 'real world ' vaccin e effectiveness and the duration of protection shows that all vaccines authorised in the EU/EEA are currently highly protective against COVID -19-related hospitalisation, severe disease and death, suggesting there is no urgent need for the administration of booster doses of vaccines to fully vaccinated individuals in the general population . The option of administ ering an additional vaccine dose to people who may experience a limited response to the primary series of COVID -19 vaccination, such as some categories of immunocompromised individuals (e.g. solid organ transplant recipients), sh ould already be considered now . This is to be seen as an extension of the primary vaccination series for these specific groups, and not as a booster. Consideration could also be given to provid ing an additional dose as a precaution ary measure to older frail individuals, in particular those living in closed settings (e.g. residents of long -term care facilities). Full vaccination against COVID -19 of all eligible family contacts and close contacts , including professionals providing care, of immunocompromised and vulnerable individuals should also be considered . Close monitoring of vaccine effectiveness data and breakthrough infections, particularly among vulnerable groups at risk of severe COVID -19 and among those living in closed settings , should be continued, and decisions adapted accordingly , should a substantial decrease in effectiveness be noted in one or more population groups.

Characteristics of the other four variants designated as VOCs by ECDC .................................... 38 When in contact with individuals at risk of severe disease, physical distancing (when applicable), the wearing of face masks (especially when physical distancing cannot be kept), and hand and respiratory hygiene remain pivotal measures for reducing the ris k of SARS -CoV-2 transmission. These non-pharmaceutical intervention s should always complement vaccination, in particular in high -risk settings such as long -term care facilities or hospital wards with patients at risk of severe COVID -19. More solid data ar e needed to inform future policies on booster doses. Knowledge gaps are particularly related to the appropriate correlate of protection to consider for the different population groups and the time from primary vaccination series until a booster dose should be given , and duration of immunity according to e.g. different age and risk groups, vaccine product, dosing interval, variant of concern (VOC) , and homologous/ heterologous schedule. Prospective vaccine effectiveness studies, as well as surveillance of breakthrough infections in the general population and in specific groups, are needed to answer these questions. The b enefit s and risks of possible booster doses need to be clearly outlined and compared. Benefits may include increas ed protection against severe disease, mild -to-moderate disease, post COVID -19 condition (often called ' long COVID '), SARS-CoV-2 infection, and virus transmission. Risks include possible safety concerns and public health implications (e.g. impact on vaccine confidence and uptake, global availability of vaccines). Communication about possible additional vaccine doses should be carefully considered and delivered in a transparent, proactive, and clear way to avoid affecting vaccine confidence. The distinction between strengthening the response to primary vaccination series, for example in immunocompromised individuals , and boosters for waning immune response or vaccine escape, should be clearly made. In the context of many countries outside of the EU/EEA still struggling to receive and administer enough vaccine doses to their populations, special consideration should be given to the current global shortage of COVID -19 vaccines , which could be further worsened by the administration of booster COVID-19 vaccine doses for the general population in EU/EEA countries . TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 3 Background and rationale The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of concern (VOC) has caused apprehension due to its increased transmissibility and virulence , combined with some potential partial escape from the protection induced by currently available COVID -19 vaccines. As a result , the need to administer an additional dose of COVID -19 vaccine to people has been discussed in several European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries , with some considering additional vaccine doses for specific population groups this autumn. This is a complex and dynamic evaluation that needs to take into account several dim ensions and potential implications. The assessment of the need for additional doses involves the regulatory authorities , such as the European Medicines Agency ( EMA), which assess the balance of risks and benefits to individuals ; national immunisation technical advisory groups (NITAGs) , which assess, in addition, the population -level impacts and programmatic considerations; and national public health authorities, which are responsible for the vaccination programmes. Currently , COVID-19 vaccines in the EU/EEA are primarily procured through the European C ommission 's procurement process, with some countries having separate national procurements for nationally authorised vaccines. There is a need for a continued review of the spread a nd characteristics of the circulating VOCs and of variants of interest (VOIs) , of the evidence of duration of immunity following vaccination and natural infection , and o f vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by VOCs (e.g., the Delta VOC), to support this complex assessment and better understand potential public health needs for additional vaccine doses and their implications . Scope of this document This document aims to provide the target audience with interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses. The most recent evidence regarding vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection due to the circulating variants and regarding duration of immunity will be briefly summarised. Considerations around the implementation of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses will also be discussed. This document does not aim to provide recommendations about the administration of additional doses of COVID -19 vaccines but summarises the current evidence and outlines options for consideration by public health authorities . Target audience The target audiences for this document are the European Commission, the Health Security Committee (HSC), th e EU/EEA National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) ' collaboration , and national public health institutes and ministries of health in the EU/EEA, as well as public health experts and decision -makers at national and subnational level s. Epidemi ological situation Epidemiological trends As of week 3 3 (ending 22 August 2021), the overall 14- day case notification rate for COVID -19 in the EU/EEA was 204.3 per 100 000 population (country range: 7.0-602.6). This rate has been stable for t hree weeks, with increasing trends observed in 1 6 countries. The 14 -day case notification rate in people aged 65 years or older for the EU/EEA, based on data reported by 2 4 countries, was 82. 8 per 100 000 population (country range: 6 .0-191.9), and this pooled rate has been stable for two weeks. Increasing trends were observed in 1 5 countries. Overall hospital admissions due to COVID -19 have been stable for four weeks. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate for the EU/EEA, based on data reported by 1 3 countries, was 1.0 per 100 000 (country range: 0. 1-2.0) population , and this pooled rate has been stable for two weeks. The 14 -day COVID -19 death rate has increased to 9 .6 deaths per million popu lation compared with 7 .4 deaths the previous week [1]. To date, the highest notification rates have been reported among younger age groups. However, increases in cases in older age groups, as well as increases in COVID -19 hospitalisation indicators, have also been observed in several countries. While milder cases of COVID -19 have also been seen in vaccinated individuals , albeit at a lower extent, the majority of hospitalisations are currently occurring among unvaccinated individuals [2-5]. The high number of reported cases observed in the current weeks is expected to continue given the ongoing increase in the occurrence of the Delta VOC, which has now become dominant in the EU/EEA. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 4 Vaccine roll -out As of 22 August 2021 (week 33 , 2021) , over 520 million vaccine doses have been administered in the EU/EEA. Since the start of the COVID -19 vaccine deployment in December 2020, the cumulative vaccine uptake in the adult population (aged 18 years and older) in the EU/EEA has reached 7 5.6% for at least one vaccin e dose (range 2 1.1- 92.5%) and 6 6.7% for the full vaccination course (range 19.3- 90.3% ) (30 reporting countries) [6]. The c umulative vaccine uptake is higher in target groups that have been prioritised since the beginning of the vaccine rollout, in particular the elderly and healthcare workers (HCW s). In people aged 80 years and above, the median vaccine uptake among EU/EEA countries is 86.5% (range 1 9.7-100%) for at least one dose, and 84. 8% (range 1 8.2-100%) for the full vaccination course (2 7 countries reporting). Fifteen countries have already administered the full vaccination course to more than 80% of the population aged 80 years and above [7]. Nevertheless, the progress in the rollout is unequal across EU/EEA countries (Figure 1), and approximately 3 8 million people have not yet completed their primary vaccination course . As vaccine uptake has increased in priority groups ( the elderly, residents in long -term care facilities , healthcare workers, etc.) , countries have progressively expanded the rollout to include younger age groups, in some cases to the entire population including children aged 12 years and above. Figure 2 presents the median weekly cumulative uptake of full vaccination by age group among EU/EEA countries. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 5 Figure 1 .

TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 6 Figure 2 . Median cumulative uptake (%) of full vaccination by age group in EU/EEA countries Source: TESSy (data from 27 countries , as of 22 August 2021). Distribution of variants of concern and variants of interest As of 1 5 August 2021, the following variants are listed as of concern for EU/EEA: B.1.1.7 (Alpha, first detected in the United Kingdom ( UK)); B.1.1.7+E484K (first detected in UK); B.1.351 (Beta, first detected in South Africa); P.1 (Gamma, first detected in Brazil) ; and B.1.617.2 (Delta, first detected in India) [8]. The median (range) of the VOC s reported in all samples sequenced from the 1 6 EU/EEA countri es with sufficient level of sampling and a valid denominator was 9 6.8% (29.4-99.4%) for Delta, 0 .7% (0. 3-65.1%) for 0.1%) for B.1.1.7+E484K. The median (range) of the VOI s reported in all samples sequenced in this period for the 1 6 EU/EEA countries with sufficient level of sampling and a valid denominator was 0.0% (0.0 -1.0%) for B.1.621, 0.0% (0.0 (0.0 -0.0%) for C.37 (Lambda) . The Delta VOC is the most common variant in EU/EEA countries , and the proportion is still increasing in the majority of countries. Among the countries that reported an adequate sequencing volume, Delta now account s for at least 95% of all sequenced viruses in in 11 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain , and Sweden ). The proportion of Alpha VOC has been decreasing in the majority of EU /EEA countries. Community transmission and outbreaks due to the Beta a nd the Gamma VOCs are reported, but there is no clear overall increasing trend for these variants according to the available data in the European Surveillance System (TESSy) and the GISAID EpiCoV database . For this reason, Delta is currently by far the mos t relevant variant to consider when planning for possible additional vaccine doses. Variant characteristics and evidence for impact on transmissibility, immunity and severity ECDC regularly assesses new evidence on variants detected through epidemic intelligence, rules -based genomic variant screening, and other scientific sources. Currently, five variants designated as VOCs by ECDC are under TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 7 surveillance in the EU/EEA and around the world: Alpha, .1.1.7+E484K, Beta, Gamma , and Delta VOCs . Another six SARS -CoV-2 variants are considered as VOI by ECDC, and additional variants are being monitor ed [8]. Variants of concern For the VOCs , clear evidence is available indicating a significant impact on transmissibility, severity and/or immunity that is likely to have an impact on the epidemiological situatio n in the EU/EEA , as well as immunity following vaccination and on vaccine effectiveness . Delta VOC is currently the most common variant in EU/EEA countries and the proportion is still increasing . The spread of the Delta VOC should be consider ed when planning for possible additional vaccine doses. Additional information on the characteristics of the other VOCs is provided in the Annex. Delta The Delta VOC is associated with increased transmissibility and virulence compared to other previous variants [9], causing more severe illness in unvaccinated people . Patients infected with the Delta VOC were more likely to be hospitalised than patients infected with Alpha or non-VOC SARS -CoV-2 lineages [10,11] . A comparison of secondary attack rates (including in households) of the Alpha and the Delta infections showed that the Delta VOC has higher rates of secondary attack compared to Alpha . However, these data wer e not yet corrected for vaccination status [12]. A recent study from China characterises a transmission chain originating from one individual infected with Delta . The results showed that the viral loads of the Delta VOC infections were on average ~1 000 greater compared to A/B lineage infections during the initial epidemic wave in China in early 2020, suggesting potentially faster viral replication and greater infectiousness. Furthermore, the results showed that the time interval from the exposure to a positive PCR test in the quarantined population was on a verage about six days in 2020, prior to the emergence of the Delta VOC, while it was four days in the Delta VOC cases in 2021. However, this study is not conclusive , as case numbers for 2021 were small and sampling may have occurred earlier in the course o f disease during this outbreak compared to sampling in 2020 [13]. Several studies provide emerging evidence that vaccine effectiveness against infection with the Delta VOC is reduced compared to infection with Alpha VOC. Vaccine effectiveness against severe, critical or fatal disease still remains high after full vaccination [10,14] . However, vaccine breakthrough infections can occur, and preliminary evidence suggests that fully vaccinated people becom ing infected with the Delta VOC can have high viral loads , although decli ning more rapidly than in unvaccinated individuals [15]. Variants of interest For VOIs, evidence is available on genomic properties, epidemiological evidence or in -vitro evidence that could imply a significant impact on transmissibility, severity and/or immunity, realistically having an impact on the epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA. However, the evidence is still preliminary or is associated with major uncertainty. Recently, several outbreaks caused by the two , VOIs Lambda and B.1.621 , were reported in the EU/EEA. Evidence indicating an impact of these variants on immunity following vaccination and on vaccine effectiveness is increasing. Lambda The Lambda variant was first detected in Peru and classified as a VOI based on its high circulation rates in South American countries and the presence of critical mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein . These mutations may contribute to its increased transmissibility and could result in susceptibility to re -infection or a reduction in protection provided by current vaccines [8]. In a study performed in Chil e, researcher s used plasma samples from healthcare workers who received a two-dose scheme of the inactivated virus vaccine CoronaVac and performed a pseudotyped virus neutrali sation assay. The results showed that neutralisation was decreased by 3.05-fold for the Lambda VOI compared to the wild type (lineage A). Based on the se results, the authors suggest an increased infectivity for the Lambda VOI and immune escape from neutrali sing antibodies elicited by CoronaVac [16]. Similar results were presented in another study in which the authors demonstrated a higher infectivity with viral vectors pseudotyped with the Lambda spike protein. Furthermore, t he authors showed that the virus was neutrali sed with a 2.3- 3.3-fold . However, the virus was neutrali sed well by a therapeutic monoclonal antibody cocktail [17]. The findings of increased transmissibility and /or reduced neutralisation of Lambda by vaccine -induced antisera were confirmed by other in vitro studies from Japan and the United States ( US) [18,19] . Of note, all these studies were published as preprints and need to be interpreted with caution. B.1.621 The B.1.621 variant was first identified in Colombia and is currently listed as a VOI by ECDC and WH O [8,20] . No WHO label is currently assigned for this VOI. B.1.621 was detected in several countries in South and Central America, the US, but also in several European countries ( Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany , Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK, etc .) [21,22] . Genomic and evolutionary substitutions in the spike [21], among them the mutations R346K, E484K, and P681H, which have been reported to show reduced neutralisation by antibodies [23-25]. Scientific studies describing the characteris tics of B.1.621 are limited , but preliminary pseudovirus neutralisation TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 8 data from the UK indicate that sera from vaccinees show decreased ability to neutrali se the B.1.621 VOI compared to the first wave virus and the Alpha VOC, with a magnitude of change similar to the Beta VOC. Furthermore, sera from individuals who have been infected with the Delta VOC do not have strong neutralising activity against either the Beta VOC or the B.1.621 VOI [22]. In a study investigating a cluster of B.1.621 VOI infections in Italy, the virus was isolated from a patient sample to perform a neutralisation assay with human sera collected from 37 individuals between 10 and 20 days after the administration of the second dose of Comirnaty . All sera efficiently neutralis ed the B.1.621 VOI isolate, suggesting that this VOI is not a concern for vaccine efficacy [26]. The data have to be interpreted with ca ution, as case numbers were small and further studies are needed. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 9 Vaccine effectiveness: update of the evidence Vaccine effectiveness against SARS- CoV- 2 infection by severity (mild /moderate disease, severe disease, hospitalisation, death) and variants of concern The overview of COVID -19 vac cine effectiveness in this section of th e report is largely based on: A living systematic review of COVID -19 vaccine effectiveness studies conducted by the International Vaccine Access Center at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the WHO [27,28] . Results from relevant observational studies are published on a weekly basis [29], including forest plots by vaccine product, disease outcome , and VOC [30], with the latest update provided on 12 August 2021. The McMaster University Health Forum COVID -END Evidence Network to support Decision -making living evidence synthesis on efficacy and effectiveness of available COVID -19 vaccines for variants of concern #6 version 15: 11 August 2021 [31]. ECDC has als o analysed evidence of vaccine effectiveness comparing partial vaccination to full vaccination in a recently published technical report [32]. Based on th e evidence from the above sources, overall , vaccine effectiveness from EU -authorised vaccines , including Comirnaty, Spikevax and Vaxzevria, show strong protection against symptomatic disease, severe disease , hospitalisation and death following a full vaccination course in the general population, in residents of long -term care facilities ( LTCFs) and in older adults . The majority of studies were conducted on the wild -type SARS -CoV-2 or when the Alpha VOC was the predominant variant in circulation. The e vidence shows that full vaccination with COVID -19 vaccines is effective against SARS -CoV-2 infection caused by wild -type SARS -CoV-2 in the general population, with vaccine effectiveness estimates in general ranging between 80 to 90% [33]. The vaccines have been shown to have lowered effectiveness against infection by the Beta VOC but have remained effective against infection by the Alpha VOC. In studies from various countries , there is some emerging evidence of reduced effectiveness against infection and mild- to-moderate disease with the Delta VOC compared to the Alpha VOC, however effectiveness against severe disease and death seems to be maintained at a high level for the moment . General population Twent y-three studies from a range of different countries and vaccines , included in the living systematic review o f vaccine effectiven ess, reported mean vaccine effectiveness estimates against symptomatic disease after complete vaccination (7 days post final dose) that range d from approximately 82 to 97% for Comirnaty; 89 to 99% for Spikevax and 78% for Vaxzevria. V accine effectiveness estimates from seven studies against severe disease after complete vaccination (7 days post final dose) range d from approximately 92 to 100% for Comirnaty and 90 to 96% for Spikevax. Vaccine effectiveness estimates from 25 studies against hospitalisation after complete vaccination (7 days post final dose) range d from approximately 87 to 99% for Comirnaty; 90 to 91% for Spikevax; 89 to 100% for pooled analysis of mRNA vaccine data (Comirnaty and Spikevax) and 95% for pooled analysis of Comirnaty, Spikevax and Vaxzevria. V accine effectiveness estimates against death from nine studies after complete vaccination (7 days post final dose) range d from approximately 91 to 98% for Comirnaty and 99 to 100% for pooled analysis of mRNA vaccine data (C omirnaty and Spikevax) [30]. These studies covered vaccine effectiveness data for different VOC and were carried out at different time points in different contexts . Studies with variant -specific estimates Beta VOC A test -negative case control study f rom Qatar showed vaccine effectiveness estimates against severe, critical or fatal disease caused by the Beta VOC in the general population estimated at 100% (74- 100) [34]. Alpha VOC Studies assessing vaccine effectiveness following complete vaccination against symptomatic infection caused by the Alpha VOC in the general adult population from Canada [35] and the UK [36] show estimates ranging from 89 to 94% for Comirnaty, approximately 92% for Spikevax , and 75% for Vaxzevria. Vaccine effectiveness estimates against severe disease or hospitalisation caused by the Alpha VOC from studies conducted in the general population in Qatar [34] measuring severe/fatal disease, in Canada [35] on hospitalisation or death, in the UK [37] and the US [38] on hospitalisation , range from approximately 95 to 100% following two of Comirnaty, 94% for Spikevax, 86% Vaxzevria , analysis from mRNA vaccines data (Comirnaty and Spikevax). TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 10 Vaccine effectiveness against infection, symptomatic infection, severe disease and hospital isation caused by the Delta VOC With the i ncreasing spread of the Delta VOC which i s fast becoming the dominant variant in most EU/EEA countries, studies on vaccine effectiveness against the Delta VOC are crucial to determine the potential need for booster doses. There are continuously emerging data on the level of protection that full vaccination with the COVID -19 vaccines provide against infection, symptomatic infection , severe disease, and hospitalisation due to the Delta VOC. Studies of D elta VOC : specific estimates A test -negative case-control study conducted by Sheik et al. in the general population in Scotland between 1 April and 6 June 2021 showed that the effect of the full vaccination course of Comirnaty or Vaxzevria on infection with the Alpha VOC appeared to be higher when compared to th e Delta VOC. They showed 92% ( 95% CI: 90- 93) protection following two doses of C omirnaty against the Alpha VOC compared to 79% ( 95% CI: 75- 82) 73% protection (95% CI: 66- 78) 60% ( 95% CI: 53- 66) against t he Delta VOC following two doses of Vaxzevria [10]. A test -negative case control study from Qatar in those over 12 years old assessed the effectiveness of Comirnaty and Spikevax against infection with the Delta VOC, with 2 175 cases with confirmed Delta VOC infection and matched controls. They found that vaccine effectiveness against SARS -CoV-2 infection, symptomatic but only 53.5% ( 95% CI: 43.9-61.4) following 14 days a fter the second dose of Comirnaty. In comparison, effectiveness estimates following 14 days of one dose of Spikevax w ere 79% ( 95% CI: 58.9- 90.1) following two doses. Effectiveness against severe, critical , or fatal disease due to the Delta VOC remained high at 89.7 % (95% CI: 61- 98.1) earlier studies in the same population in Qatar , vaccine effectiveness following two doses of Comirnaty against the Alpha VOC was estimated at 89.5%. The authors suggest that this may reflect some waning of Comirnaty protection over time, it may be the normalisation of behaviour of those that are fully vaccinated , or it could be related to immune escape by the Delta VOC [14] . A test-negative case control study in Ontario, Canada, with 421 073 participants from the general population found 87% ( 95% CI: 64- 95) vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease from the Delta VOC following complete vaccination (7 days post final dose) with Comirnaty and 78% ( 95% CI: 65- 86) effectiveness against hospitalisation due to the Delta VOC after two doses of Comirnaty (7 days post final dose ) [35]. A test -negative case-control study from England in the general population with 19,109 cases and 171 834 controls found estimates of vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta VOC of 88.0% ( 95% CI: 71.8) effectiveness following two doses with Vaxzevria [36]. There is evidence of high vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation caused by the Delta VOC from a test - negative case -control study in England in patients seeking emergency care services with subsequent hospitalis ation, which found 96% ( 95% following two doses of Comirnaty ( 14 days post final dose ) and 92% CI: 75- 97) following two doses of Vaxzevria (14+ days post final dose ). These vaccine effectiveness estimates are similar to the estima tes found against hospitalisation caused by the Alpha VOC [37]. A study from England using the REal -time Assessment of Community Transmission -1 (REACT -1) analysed prevalence trends and their drivers using RT -PCR s wab-positivity data from round 12 (between 20 May and 7 June 2021) and round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021) estimated vaccine effectiveness against infection based on self -reported vaccine status. They found estimated vaccine effectiveness against i nfection in round 12 of 64% (95% CI: 11 ( 95% CI: 19 -97) compared to infection of 49% ( 95% CI: CI: 23 - 78) in round 13 (estim ates were not provided by vaccine product) [39] . A study based on a large community -based survey of randomly selected households across the UK found that full vaccination with either Comirnaty or Vaxzevria was still effective against new infections from the Delta VOC, with vaccine effectiveness of but effectiveness was reduced compared to the Alpha VOC. They found that a single dose of Spik evax has similar or greater effectiveness against the Delta VOC as single doses of Comirnaty and Vaxzevria. The results also suggest that the effectiveness of two doses of Comirnaty declines faster compared with two doses of Vaxzevria , but after four or fi ve months the effectiveness of the two vaccines would be similar, although the long -term effects would need to be studied further. The authors also found that two doses of either Comirnaty or Vaxzevria provided as least the same level of protection against infection as previous natural COVID -19 infection and that people who had been vaccinated after natural infection had even more protection against laboratory -confirmed infection than vaccinated individuals who had not been naturally infected before [40]. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 11 Studies from the period when Delta VOC was predominant In a retrospective cohort s tudy in 77 607 adults in Minnesota, US comparing effectiveness of Comirnaty to Spikevax from January to July 2021 during which either the Alpha or Delta VOCs was highly prevalent (with the Delta VOC prevalence increasing from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July) , the authors found high vaccine effectiveness of both vaccines against hospitalisations : Spikevax [41]. The study found , however that in July the effectiveness against infection was substantially lower for Spikevax at 76% ( 95% CI: ( 95% CI: 13- 62). The study found that individuals vaccinated with Spikevax were about half as likely to experience breakthrough infections as individuals vaccinated with Comirnaty [41]. A study by Rosenberg et al . in New York, US, using state -wide immunis ation, laboratory testing, and hospitali sation databases looked at rates of new laboratory- confirmed COVID -19 cases and hospitali sations by vaccination status among those who received the C omirnaty, Spikevax or Vaxzevria vaccines. During the period from 3 May to 25 July 2021, the vaccine effectiveness against new COVID -19 cases declined from 91.7% to 79.8% ; yet the vaccine effectiveness against hospitali sation remained quite stable, ranging from 91.9% to 95.3%. The noted decline in vaccine effectiveness against new COVID -19 cases coincid es with an increase from <2% to >80% of the Delta VOC in the US region and relaxation of NPIs [3]. A study from the US, with 21 hospitals in 18 states , evaluated the duration of mRNA vaccine ( Comirnaty and Spikevax ) effectiveness in individuals aged 18 years a gainst hospitalis ation from COVID -19 during 11 March - 14 July 2021. Effectiveness against hospitalis ation from COVID -19, including groups at higher risk for severe COVID- 19, was sustained over the surveillance period, at 86% (95% CI: 82 -88) overall. The sustained vaccine effectiveness estimates were unchanging among subgroups at highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID -19, including older adults, adults with three or more chronic medical conditions, and those with immunocompromising condit ions (although vaccine effectiveness was lower immunocompromised conditions (63% ( 95% 95% CI: 87- 92)) but was sustained over time in both populations ). The Delta VOC-specific vaccine effectiveness w as not assessed in the study but the authors state that estimates were similar during June- July when there was higher circulation of the Delta VOC compared with March -May when Alpha was the predominant VOC [42]. The Danish public health institute has published a n official communication of an analysis of data from 2,000 breakthrough infections between 1 March to 3 August 2021 including the period when the Delta VOC has become predominant in Denmark . They found a high vaccine effectiveness against infection due to the Delta VOC following two doses (14 days post second dose) vaccine effectiveness estimates were slightly lower than against the Alpha VOC. They also found high vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisations due to the Delta VOC although the majority of patients hospitalised during the period when Delta VOC was dominant were much younger than during the period when Alpha variant was dominant [43]. A study from Israel used the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Health database of all residents of the country who became fully vaccinated before 1 June 2021 (n=9 395 923) (unvaccinated, vaccinated and previously infected individuals) to estimate vaccine effectiveness of full vaccination from Comirnaty (seven days post second dose) against documented SARS -CoV-2 infection and severe COVID -19 in different age groups, adjusted for week of infection, past PCR testing, demographic group , and sex. They estimated that the vaccine effectiveness against infection for people aged 60 years or older decreases from 73% ( 95% CI: 66- 78) for those who became fully vaccinated in the seco nd half of March to 57% ( 95% CI: 52- 62) for those who became fully vaccinated during the second half of January. A similar decrease in vaccine protection is shown for the other age groups. There was also a decrease in the protection of the Comirnaty against severe disease for the 60+ age group 90) between those vaccinated four months before the study to those vaccinated six months before the study. For the age group 40 -59 years, the corresponding vaccine effective ness was decreased from 97). The study authors point out that data on unvaccinated individuals were not directly available and some individuals who were not vaccinated may differ in important characteristics , which co uld result in biased estimates. In addition , the vaccination polic ies in Israel differ to other countries , as Israel use d only one vaccine ( Comirnaty ) and had a three-week interval between the two doses . The current analysis also used data from July 2021, a time when , for the majority of the Israeli population , at least five months passed from the second dose to the outbreak of the Delta variant. The study authors conclude that the vaccine seems to be highly effective even after six months compared to the unvaccinated population, but its effectiveness is significantly lower than it was closer to the vaccination date [44] . TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 12 Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection by risk group ( residents of long -term care facilities , older adults, immunocompromised individuals ) Residents of long -term care facilities Studies from Denmark, France , Spain and the UK on vaccine effectiveness following a full vaccination course in residents of LTCFs when wild -type or the Alpha VOC was predominant show that COVID -19 vaccines were protecting against symptomatic infection, in particular there was evidence of high vaccine effectiveness against severe disease in this risk group, although slightly lower when compared with estimates from the general population [45]. Estimates range d from approximately 75 to 97% effectiveness against hospitalisations f ollowing two doses of Comirnaty [48,49] , with 88% for analysis for mRNA data (Comirnaty and Spikevax) [48] and 89 to 98% effectiveness against death following two doses of Comirnaty (7 days post final dose) [48,49] with 97% with pooled analysis from Comirnaty and Spikevax [48]. Estimates from studies on vaccine effectiveness against SARS -CoV-2 infection in LTCF residents range d from 53 to 66 % following full vaccination with Comirnaty and 71 to 81% following full vaccination with Comirnaty or Spikevax [48,50- 53]. Beta VOC A retrospective cohort study of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisations caused by the Beta VOC in 378 LTCF residents in eastern France conducted between January and [52] estimat 94) vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death after two doses of Comirnaty (7 days post final dose) . Gamma VOC In a Gamma VOC outbreak in a single LTCF in Canada, Ontario in 60 residents and 83 staff the vaccine effectiveness against severe disease in residents was calculated as 78.6% (95% CI : 47.9-91.2) after two doses of Comirnaty or Spikevax ( 14 days post final dose) [53]. Delta VOC A study from the US using weekly data reported by nursing ho mes to CDC during the period soon after vaccine introduction (1 March to 9 May 2021) compared to the time during the Delta VOC predominance ( 21 June to 1 August 2021) found that two doses of Comirnaty or (95% CI: 70.0- 78.8) effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing home residents during March to May based on reports from 3,862 facilities, which then declined significantly to 53.1% ( 95% CI: 49.1- 56.7) during June -July based on reports from 14 917 facilities . Vaccine effectiveness estimates d uring the intermediate period (May -June 2021) were lower than those during the pre-Delta period but were not significantly different [54]. As yet , there are no vaccine effectiveness studies published with the Delta VOC-specific estimates against severe disease or hospitalisations in LTCF residents. Older adul ts Several vaccine effectiveness studies in older adults fro m various countries , including a study from Brazil on the Gamma VOC, and studies with the Alpha VOC as the dominant variant at the time of the studies from Denmark, Finland, the UK, the US, Israel and a multi -country study, show ed strong protection against symptomatic infection and seve re disease (hospitalisation) following complete vaccination (7 days post final dose) in older adults. Alpha VOC In people 60 years of age and older estimates against symptomatic infection when the Alpha VOC was the dominant variant range d from 76 to 90% following two doses of Comirnaty [57-59] and 89% of Vaxzevria [55]. Vaccine effectiven ess estimates in people over 60 years of age against hospitalisation range d from approximately 87 to 93% following two doses of Comirnaty [48,60] and 94% with pooled analysis from both Vaxzevria and Spikevax [59]. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease following two doses of Comirnaty in individuals 80 years and over in the UK was 88% ( 95% CI: 84- 90) [60]. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisatio n following two doses of Comirnaty in those 80 years and over, from studies from the UK and Israel , range d from approximately 75 to 93% [27,32,63- 65]. Gamma VOC In a test -negative study in Sa o Paulo, Brazil with 61 164 participants over the age of 60 years , the vaccine effectiveness was 77.9% ( 95% CI: 69.2- 84.2) against two doses of Vaxzevria [63]. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 13 Immunocompromised individuals There are currently limited data on COVID -19 vaccine effectiveness in people who are immunocompromised. Based on the current evidence from Israel, the US and Qatar , it has been shown that vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalisation following full va ccination with the Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines in certain groups of immunocompromised individuals was reduced when compared to non -immuno compromised individuals. A retrospective cohort study comprised of 14 697 fully vaccinated patients who received a n mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty or Spikevax ) by Khan et al . showed that vaccine effectiveness against SARS -CoV-2 infection was 80% among individuals with inflammatory bowel disease on immunosuppressive medication [64]. Chemaitelly et al conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess mRNA ( Comirnaty or Spikevax ) vaccine effectiveness among kidney transplant recipients (n = 782) registered with the national public healthcare provider in Qatar. This cohort study estimated vaccine ef fectiveness against SARS -CoV-2 infection at 46.6% (95% 66.0% (95% CI: 21.3 -85.3) 42 days and 73.9% (95% CI: 33.0- 89.9) 56 days after the second dose. Additionally, vaccine effectiveness against any severe or fatal COVID -19 disease was estimated at 72.3% (95% CI: 0.0 -90.9) days after the second dose, 85.0% (95% CI: 35.7-96.5) 42 days after the second dose, and 83.8% (95% CI: 31.3 -96.2) 56 days after the second dose [65]. This analysis was conducted when the Alpha and Beta VOCs were dominant. A US multicentre case-control analysis by Tenforde et al ., including 1 210 adults hospitalis ed between 11 March to 5 May 2021, evaluated mRNA (Comirnaty or Spikevax ) COVID to prevent C OVID -19 hospitalis ations. This analysis showed that vaccine effectiveness was significantly lower among patients with immunosuppression patients with an active solid organ or he matologic malignancy or solid organ transplant, vaccine effectiveness was 51.2% (95% CI: - 30.7-81.8). This analysis was conducted when the dominant VOC in circulation was Alpha (59.7% of sequenced viruses) [38]. Chodick et al . conducted a retrospective cohort study in Israel that evaluated the Comirnaty vaccine effectiveness at 71% (95% CI: 37- 87) among immunosuppressed individuals (which included recipients of hematopoietic cell or solid organs t ransplant, patients under immunosuppressive therapy, with asplenia, and chronic renal failure: advanced kidney disease, dialysis, or nephrotic syndrome) compared to 90% vaccine effectiveness (95% CI: 79- 95) overall in preventing SARS -CoV-2 infection confirmed with RT -PCR, between seven to 27 days after full vaccination . This analysis was conducted when the dominant VOC in circulation was Alpha [66]. Breakthrough infections in immunocompromised individuals In Brosh -Nissimov et al. 's retrospective cohort study of 17 hospitals in Israel, 152 patients fully vaccinated with Comirnaty developed COVID -19 and required hospitalis ation more than seven days after the second vaccine dose. A proportion of 40% ( n=60) of the patients was immunocompromised (most common causes were chronic corticosteroid treatment , chemotherapy or anti -metabolite treatment, solid organ transplantation and anti - CD20 treatment). Overall, this cohort of patients had a high rate of predisposing co -morbidities to severe COVID - 19 (hypertension (108; 71%), diabetes (73; 48%), congestive heart failure (41; 27%), and (37; 24% (29; 19%) cancer (36; (6) having no co -morbidities [67]. Antibody response immunocompromised individuals following a primary vaccine A reduction in antibody response or reduced immunogenicity from mRNA vaccin ation (Comir naty or Spikevax ) has been detected in the following groups of individuals including those: taking immunosuppressive medications, like rituximab , and HIV-positive individuals with lowest CD4 counts (not similar to the general population) [77]. Evidence of effects of an additional COVID -19 vaccine dose in immunocompromised individuals Initial studies have shown that an additional COVID- 19 vaccine dose in immunocompromised individuals enhances antibody response. Several studies thus far have looked at seropositive responses with a third mRNA COVID -19 vaccine dose in immunosuppressed people. Among immunocompromised individuals who had no detectable antibody response following a full COVID- 19 vaccination course , 33-50% developed an antibody response to an additional third dose [83-87]. Vaccine effectiveness against infection and onward transmission (test positivity, viral load, secondary attack rates) Viral load Studies of viral load in SARS -CoV-2 positive individuals conducted during late 2020 to early 2021 indicated that viral load was reduced in those who had received a C OVID -19 vaccine. Very recent results now indicate that vaccination may have less effect in initially reducing viral load in infections caused by the Delta VOC . TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 14 A cohort study by Marks et al . identified 314 patients with COVID -19 using the electronic registry of the Epidemiological Surveillance Emergency Service of Catalonia (Spain) . A secondary attack rate of 17% was found with a variation from 12% when the index ca se had a viral load lower than 1 \u00d7 106 copies per mL to 24% when the index case had a viral load of 1 \u00d7 1010 copies per mL or higher . This analysis showed that viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS -CoV-2 transmission [83]. A retrospective collection and analysis of positive SARS -CoV-2 test results performed at the Maccabi Healthcare Services central laboratory in Israel, between 21 December 2020 and 11 February 2021 found that the viral load was reduced for infections occurring 12 to 37 days after the first dose of the Comi rnaty vaccine. By looking at the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) over time, Levine- Tiefenbrun et al found that the mean viral load decreased 12 days after vaccination with the first vaccine dose, and that Ct values of positive samples collected 12 -37 days after vaccination with the first dose of Comirnaty (a second dose having been given on day 21 for all samples taken after day 21) were highe r than Ct values of positive samples during the first 11 days after vaccination [84]. A small single -centre retrospective study of nursing home residents who had asymptomatic COVID -19 showed that receipt of a single dose of the Comirnaty vaccine was associated with lower nasopharyngeal viral load than in those who had not been vaccination. The mean log 10 viral load was higher in unvaccinated (9.5 ; 95% CI : 9.3-9.8) compared to vaccinated residents (7.1 ; 95% CI : 5.4-8.8), respectively (p = 0.004). A limitation of this study is the small study size [85]. Petter et al. traced the Ct values of SARS -CoV-2 positive test conducted between 1 December 2020 to 30 January 2021 at the MyHeritage COVID -19 testing lab in Israel. O verall, it was estimates that vaccination reduce d the viral load by 1.6x to 20x in individuals who were positive for SARS -CoV-2 [86]. A recent study by Pouwels et al ., conducted with the Office for National Statistics COVID -19 Infection Survey in the UK, showed that individuals experiencing D elta VOC infections after two vaccine doses (with Comirnaty or Vaxzevria) had comparable peak levels of viral load to unvaccinated infected individuals . With the Alpha VOC, those infected after being vaccinated had much lower peak levels of viral load [40]. However, a study from Singapore showed tha t the viral load in individuals infected with Delta VOC after full vaccination decline more rapidly than viral loads in individuals naturally infected with the Delta VOC [87]. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS -CoV-2 transmission by healthcare workers to household members Studies conducted when the Alpha was the predominant VOC circulating have shown that vaccination of healthcare workers reduced the risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection in household members. A study by Salo et al . used national databases in Finland to assess indirect COVID -19 vaccine effectivene ss among vaccinated healthcare workers and their unvaccinated adult household members. An indirect effectiveness (reduced transmission ) of 8.7% (95% 10 after of mRNA (Comirnaty or Spikevax) vaccine , from healthcare workers vaccinated to a household spouse , was observed [88]. A national record linkage study in Scotland by Shal et al showed that household members of vaccinated healthcare workers had a lower risk of infection from SARS -CoV-2 compared to household membe rs of unvaccinated healthcare worker (rate per 100 person -years 9 .40 versus 5 .93; HR 0. 70, 95% CI : 0.63-0.78) [89]. Other studies o f vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 transmission Several studies, from Spain, England, Israel, and the Netherlands , conducted when Alpha was the predominant VOC, have shown vaccine effectiveness against transmission ranging between 58-88%. A prospective cohort of close contacts of SARS -CoV-2 positive individuals (20 961 participants) 18years old from Navarra, Spain , showed a vaccine effectiveness of 65% (95% CI : 56-73) against infection in close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 positive index cases 14 days after full vaccination with Comirnaty . Whole genome sequencing was conducted on 17% of infected contacts and showed dominance of the Alpha VOC (n=865; 68.9%) [57]. A cohort study in England, during the period 4 January 2021 to 28 February 2021, illustrated that contacts of vaccinated SARS -CoV-2 cases ha d lower odds of being secondary cases if the index case wa s vaccinated 14 days before testing positive . The unadjusted odds ratio for being a secondary case if the index case was vaccinated with Vaxzevria (vs. index case not . analysed the effectiveness of vaccination with Comirnaty against household transmission of SARS - CoV-2 in Israel, using two different analytic approaches applied to data from the Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS) centrali sed database from 15 June 2020 to 24 March 2021. From their analysis, vaccine effectiveness against susceptibility to infection was 80 -88%, and the overall vaccine effectiveness against transmission was assessed at 88. 5% [91]. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 15 Based on routine contact monitoring data from the Municipal Health Services in the Netherlands, De Gier et al. estimated the vaccine effectiveness against transmission and the vaccine effectiveness against infection among household and other close contacts of confirmed cases of SARS -CoV-2 infection between 1 February and 27 May 2021. A vaccine effectiveness against transmission of 71% among household contacts of fully vaccinated index cases was observed. Specifically , for each vaccine, vaccine effectiveness against transmission values were estimated at 58% for Vaxzevria, 70% for Comirnaty, 88% for Spikevax and 77% for the Janssen vaccine [92]. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 16 Duration of protection: update of the evidence Immunological memory is essential to protect from recurrent infection with the same virus. Immune cells specific for the virus , such as T and B cells are activated, modified during initial infection or vaccination , and help to fight the infection. B cells start to differentiate into so called plasma cells to produce antibodies against different compartments (antigens) of the viru s. Neutrali sing antibodies play a n important role in inhibiting entry of the virus into cells. Additionally, virus -specific T cells can destroy infected cells and monitor the inflammation. They are also crucial for the development of highly virus -specific B cells. After initial infection, memory T and B cells , as well as antibody -producing plasma cells persist in the body. Memory cells can quickly be reactivated after re- entry of the virus and persisting antibodies can inhibit invasion and mark the virus p articles to be phagocyt osed. The magnitude and decay rate of the different response types is very heterogenic, depending on the virus or vaccine, severity of disease and the individual itself. So far , the rate of re -infection is the best way to assess the duration of protective natural immunity . Moreover, immunological assays that measure specific immune responses, such as virus- specific antibody levels, especially for neutralising antibodies, have been used to estimate the duration of immunity. However, to date, the correlation between measured immunity and clinical protection from SARS -CoV-2 infection still needs to be established. Duration of protective immunity following primary vaccination Several studies have shown that COVID -19 vaccin ation is able to induce a robust immune response towards the spike protein of SARS -CoV-2 with the generation of T and B cell -antibody responses. So far, three studies have correlated antibody (IgM and IgG) titres to vaccine efficacy (VE). Earle et al. assessed the relationship between antibody levels and VE of seven COVID -9 vaccines and detected a correlation between VE and virus -specific antibody levels [93]. Khoury et al. reported a correlation between ne utralising antibody levels and the protection against symptomatic infection [94]. A recent preprint analysed participants (n=30 415) from the Coron avirus Efficacy (COVE) phase 3 trial and found a corelation between binding and neutrali sing antibodies with VE of Spikevax and risk of COVID -19 [95]. Neutrali sing antibodies reach their peak level approximately one week after the second dose and declin e over time; however, they remain detectable at least 6 months post vaccination [96]. A recent study compared antibody levels between age groups and reported lower levels of spike- specific, and especially neutralising antibodies , in the older adults compared to younger individuals after vaccination with Comirnaty [97]. This suggests that older adults may have a weaker immune response to the vaccine . However , it is still not known what antibody levels are needed to protect from severe, symptomatic disease or infection with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, these studies did not consider the impact of vaccine generated memory cells on the duration of protective immunity . The widely used serological tests, which are used to measure antibody levels, do not measure T cell responses. Several studies have investigated if the vaccine is able to induce spike -specific T cell responses. A study from Singapore detected activated spike- specific T cells already 10 days after the first does of mRNA vaccination in 20 healthcare workers and T cell responses were associated with the onset of vaccine efficacy [98]. The generation of a strong T cell response after vaccination was further confirmed by a recent study from the US [99]. A preprint from the PITCH (Protective Immunity from T cells to COVID -19 in Health workers) consortium that analysed 503 individuals showed that T cell responses are further boosted in naive individuals after the second dose, with better response in individuals with longer dosing intervals [100] . Even though induction of memory T cells has been observed, the durability of these cells and role in protecting from infection remains unclear. Interactions between T and B cells are critical for the development of most humor al immune responses and the generation of long-lived antibody secreting plasma cells and memory B cells . These can be protective in response to vaccination or infection [101,102] . Studies have shown that mRNA vaccination elicits a robust antigen -specific B- cell memory and antibody response comparable to natural infection [103] , although Wang et al. also pointed out that the neutralising potential of the antibodies generated by the mRNA vaccine against variants was reduced . These studies have limitations due to their small sample size and underrepresentation of older age groups. The vaccines generate a robust immune response with the generation of memory cells which have the potential to provide protective durable immunity. It is still unclear if the different vaccines induce a similar immune response , since most studies have investigated the immune response from mRNA vaccines. As SARS-Cov-2 is a respiratory virus that infects the upper and lower airways , it is important to trigger a robust immune response at the sites of infection. In natural infection, memory cells persist in the respiratory tract and can rapidly recall an immune response [104] . Virus-specific antibodies , which can inhibit the entry of the virus, have been detected in the mucosa after vaccination and persist for at least three month s [105] - the duration of these TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 17 antibodies is not known. Lack of or weak mucosal immune responses after vaccination could lead to infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the presence of memory cells that are directed to the site of inflammation could prevent severe disease in infected individuals. Further research is needed to determine the duration and protective role of vaccine -induced immune responses to protect from disease and /or infection . There is only limited evidence available on the differences of immune responses between age group s after COVID -19 vaccines . Data from influenza vaccine effectiveness studies have shown that vaccine effectiveness may be reduced in older individuals [106] . Furthermore, h igher transmissibility , exposure to higher viral loads , as well as partial escape of the virus variants from cellular and humoral responses , characteristics all linked to the currently dominant Delta VOC, can have a negative impact on protective immunity. In a recent pre-print from a randomised controlled clinical trial, vaccine effectiveness of Comirnaty again st laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 was confirmed to remain above 80% for up to six months after receiving the primary vaccination series [107] . A gradual decline from the peak vaccine effectiveness of 96.2% (95% CI : 93.3- 98.1) observed between seven days and two month s from the second dose was reported between two months and four months from the second dose (vaccine effectiveness = 90.1% ; 95% CI : 86.6-92.9), and between four months and the data cut- off (vaccine effectiveness = 83.7% ; 95% CI : 74.7-89.9). A preliminary retrospective cohort study from Israel compared the incidence rates of breakthrough infections between early (January -February) and late (March -April) vaccinated individuals with Comirnaty and found that earlier vaccinate d individuals had a statistically significant breakthrough infection compared to later vaccinated individuals [2]. No differences between age groups were observed. A recent study from Israel investigated waning immunity of the Comirnaty vaccine using data from th e Ministry of Health database on 4 785 245 residents of Israel who became fully vaccinated before 1 June 2021. Data included vaccination dates, PCR tests, hospitalisation admission date, severity , and demographic variables. The study compared the rate of i nfection among individuals vaccinated at different time s and reported a reduction in protection in all age groups , pointing towards a potential waning of protective immunity . The rate of SARS -CoV-2 infections among those aged 60 years and above vaccinated in January was 3.2 cases for 1 000 people , compared to 2.1 and 1.6 for individuals from the same age group vaccinated in the second halves of February and March , respectively . For the analyses of severe disease among those aged 60 years and abov e, the rate of severe cases who were fully vaccinated in January is 0.29 for 1 000 persons, and is reduced to 0.23, 0.15 and 0.10 for those who were fully vaccinated in February, March , and April -May, respectively. The authors conclude that the results show immunity waning in all age groups after six months from vaccination . Further studies are need ed to assess if the increase of breakthrough infections and reduced vaccine effectiveness is a result of the waning of protective immunity or due to other factors , and whether these results are generalisable to other contexts [44] . Duration of immunity following natural infection There is limited evidence on the duration of protective immunity against the reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 virus. A study from Qatar suggests that natural infection protection against reinfection was 95% among individuals who tested positive and it lasted for at least seven months [108] . A study among health -care workers in the UK estimated a reduced risk of reinfection of 83% for at least five months after primary infection , while another study demonstrated 89% protection against reinfection lasting a t least six months [109] . The reported reinfection events are rare and occur in less than 1% of all COVID -19 cases [108] . A recent study conducte d in Denmark found that protection against repeat ed SARS-CoV-2 infection was robust in most individuals, protecting more than 80% of the naturally infected population younger than 65 years against reinfections . However , individuals aged 65 years and older had less than 50% protection against SARS -CoV-2 reinfection [110] . A study in Italy also concluded that reinfection events were rare, and that natural immunity elicited a protective effect for at least one year [111] . However, the observation pe riod of the study ended before the beginning of spread of SARS -CoV-2 variants and it is unclear how well the natural immunity against wild -type virus would protect against the various variants. In addition, over 70% of baseline positive cases in this study were hospitalised , suggesting a severe disease. As the disease severity influences the strength of the immune response against SARS -CoV-2, the observed duration of protective immunity and reinfection rate might be significantly influence d by the study coh ort [111] . Severa l studies have investigated the presence of SARS -CoV-2-specific antibodies and their neutrali sing effect to estimate the duration of immunity after a natural infection. Waning of SARS -CoV-2-specific antibodies have been describe d and the rate is dependent on the antibody specificity. Nucleoid capsid -specific antibodies have been shown to wane faster than spike -specific antibodies [112] . Waning of neutralising antibody levels have been reported around six months post-infection . However, antibody dynamics vary greatly between individuals, depending on disease severity, duration, and age [119,120] , e.g. higher levels and persistence of neutralising antibodies has been associated with more severe disease. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 18 Even though antibody levels are often used to assess duration of immunity, a direct correlation between protection against reinfection and neutrali sing antibody levels is still lacking, and waning neutralis ing antibody levels might be mitigated by the presence of cellular immunity. Different types of immune response and immune memory are generated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. E ach of those ha ve distinct kinetics, resulting in complex interrelationship between the abundance of T cell, B cell, and antibody immune memory over time. Substantial immune memory is generated after COVID -19, involving all four major types of immune memory , with about 95% of subjects retain ing immune memory for at least six months after infection [115] . Circulating antibody levels are not predictive of T cell memory [116] . Thus, further research is needed to determine the duration of immunity against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Little is known about the capability of new variants to escape the immune response generated by a natural SARS - CoV-2 infection. According to Public Health England National Surveillance of Reinfections, the r isk of reinfection with the Delta VOC may be higher ( aOR 1.46 ( 95% CI: 1.03-2.05)) compared to the Alpha VOC. The data showed that the risk of reinfection was not elevated for the Delta VOC if the primary infection was less than six months ago (aOR 0.79, (95% CI: 0.49-1.28)) but was higher for those with a prior infection more than six months ago (aOR 2.37, (95% CI: 1.43-3.93)) [117] . TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 19 Current recommendations regarding additional COVID -19 vaccine doses in the EU/EEA and beyond According to EMA's summary of product characteristics (SPCs) of COVID -19 vaccines authorised for use in the EU/EEA , no additional dose is currently recommended after the primary vaccination schedule [118] . Nevertheless, the adoption of polices and protocols on the off- label use of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses after the primary vaccination schedule is rapid ly evolving in the EU/EEA and beyond. Based on the most recent available information (see Table 1), eight EU/EEA countries ( Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxemb ourg, and Slovenia ) are currently recommending the use of an additional vaccine dose or booster dose (i.e. third dose for two -dose schedule and second dose for single -dose schedule vaccines), while Germany is planning its implementation in the a utumn, and a decision is currently under discussion in 13 EU/EEA countries. All protocols , of those currently in place, recommend the use of an additional dose in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals (see Table 1 for specific indications and definitions of eligibility due to immunodeficiency ). In Austria, the indication is extended to other population groups , such as the elderly (65 years and above ), LTCF residents, individuals with chronic diseases, individuals with a primary vaccination series with a vector -based vaccine , and front-line workers (details in Table 1 ). In Hungary, any individual aged 18 years or older becomes eligible for an additional dose six months after the completion of the primary vaccination series, but the additional dose is especially recommended fo r the elderly, those with chronic illness , and immunosuppressed individuals . The time interval of the administration of the additional dose varies from a minimum of four weeks to nine months after completion of the primary vaccination schedule for population groups considered at higher risk; and from four to 12 months for eligible individuals from the general population . When specified ( four countries), it is recommended that mRNA -based vaccines be used for the additional dose, including in case of heterologous combination ('mix and match '); in Hungary , heterologous vaccination is strongly recommended, but homologous is available if there is a contraindication for the heterologous vaccines . The scenario regarding the use of boosters or additional vaccine doses is evolving rapidly outside of the EU/EEA. On 30 June 2021, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) of the UK published a report with an overall outline of a booster programme to possibly begin in September 2021 , with the primary objective being to maximise protection in individuals most vulnerable to serious COVID -19 ahead of the winter months [119] . Where possible, a synergistic approach to the delivery of C OVID -19 and influenza vaccination could support delivery and maximise uptake of both vaccines. The first stage of the booster program in the UK would include: adults aged 16 years and over who are immunosuppressed ; those living in residential care homes fo r older adults ; all adults aged 70 years or over ; adults aged 16 years and over who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable; and frontline health and social care workers . A second stage could follow as soon as practicable and would include : all adults aged 50 years and over ; adults aged 16 to 49 years who are in an influenza or COVID- 19 at-risk group [120] ; and adult household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals . The benefits of booster vaccination in younger adults will be considered when more information will be available. On 12 August 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration updated the emergency use authori sations for both Comirnaty and Spikevax to allow for the use of an additional dose in certain immunocompromised individuals, specifically solid organ transplant recipients or those who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise [121] . Following the meeting of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP) on 13 Augus t [122] , an update of the clinical recommendations on the use of COVID -19 vaccines, including the use of an additional dose as part of a primary vaccination series in immunocompromised individual s, is pending. On 18 August , a joint statement from public health and medical experts was released by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with a proposed plan for COVID -19 booster shots with the objective of maximis ing vaccine -induced protection and prolong ing its durability , provided regulatory FDA allowance and ACIP recommendation are granted . This was based on the evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease and the consideration that protection a gainst severe disease, hospitali sation, and death might diminish in the coming months, especially among those most at risk of severe COVID -19 or who were vaccinated early in the campaign. The administration of the booster doses could begin in a utumn, starting with individuals who were fully vaccinated earliest in the vaccination rollout (eight months since the completion of the primary series) , including healthcare workers , residents of long -term care facilities , and elderly people [123] . At the end of July, following the resurgence in COVID -19 cases and increasing circulation of the Delta VOC, Is rael initiated a national plan to administer booster doses of Comirnaty , starting with the elderly. Currently , adults aged 50 years and above , HCWs , individuals with a high risk of severe COVID -19, LTCF residents, people in detention TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 20 settings and people wo rking in detention settings , who have completed the primary vaccination series over five months ago , are all eligible to receive a third dose [124] . Table 1 . Recommendation on the use of an additional vaccine d ose in EU/EEA countries (as of 2 6 August 2021) Country Recommendation Notes Ref. Austria2,4 Yes Indication : (off-label use) for population groups at high risk (65+ years , LTCF residents , immunocompromised individuals and with chronic diseases, individuals with primary vaccination series with Vaxzevria or COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen) ; people over 18 years of age from the following population groups: personnel from nursing homes for the elderly and retirement homes ; healthcare workers; p ersonnel from mobile care, support, nursing and 24 -hour care , as well as car egivers; staff in educational institutions . Timing: 6-9 months after completion of primary series for population groups at high risk ; 9-12 for population groups from the general population (18 years or older). Adjustments will be made as new scientific evidence suggesting different duration of protection emerges. Other considerations : an mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty or Spikevax) should be used for the additional dose regardless of which product was administered as part of the primary vaccination series. The Austrian NITAG does not recommend the use of serologic assays to evaluate protection following vaccination in the general population because no clear correlate of protection has been defined yet. In particular cases (e.g. , immunocompromised individuals ), titres of neutrali sing antibodies can be measured and used to support evaluation of protection .

TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 23 Public health considerations when assessing the need for additional doses of COVID -19 vaccines Objectives of vaccination strategy When assessing the need for possible booster doses of COVID -19 vaccine from the public health perspective, it is important to keep in mind t he main objective of the vaccination strategy (i.e. preventing severe cases of COVID - 19). Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease should preferably be chosen as the primary outcome of interest for assessing when there is a clear need for an additional vaccine dose in specific groups. Close monitoring of vaccine effectiveness data, particularly among vulnerable groups at risk of severe COVID -19 and among those living in closed settings, should be continued, and decisions adapted accordingly, should a su bstantial decrease in effectiveness be noted in one or more population groups. Population immunity and viral circulation Overall population immunity against SARS -CoV-2, and viral circulation, are factor s to consider when evaluating urgent needs for a booster dose. Although no correlate of protection has been identified so far, recent and representative seroprevalence studies [135] could provide some indirect evidence of population immunity , although this may wane over time . By the end of 2020, before the COVID- 19 vaccination campaigns had started, seropositivity from national surveys in Europe suggested low national SA RS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (<10%) across the European region , with the exception of sub -national populations that had experienced intense community transmission . Population immunity could be broadly estimated by knowing the vaccination coverage and the propor tion of the population with a previous natural infection. However, factors like waning immunity may affect the validity of this estimation . High vaccination coverage across age groups can be considered as a determinant of low viral circulation and reduced risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, waning immunity , and the presence and level of circulation of immune -escape variants , need to be added in to the equation. Populations to prioritise for additional vaccine dose An important criteri um for the choice of groups to prioritise for additional vaccine doses is the protection of groups at risk of severe disease due to reduced or waning immunity or due to vaccine escape of circulating variants of concern like the Delta VOC. Individuals with reduced response to the primary vaccination series should probably be considered a priority group for an additional vaccine dose. Certain groups of immunocompromised individuals, such as solid organ transplant recipients and other indivi duals with a similar level of immunosuppressi on, may benefit from an extra COVID -19 vaccine dose as part of their primary series to mount a better immune response against SARS -CoV-2. Vulnerable groups with possible earlier waning of immune response to the primary series, such as frail elderly , where immunosenescence may lead to faster waning of immune response , could also be considered a potential priority group for an additional dose , in particular if living in long -term care facilities wh ere outbreaks caused by the Delta VOC among fully vaccinated individuals have been observed. In general, all individuals at increased risk of severe COVID -19 for medical reasons (e.g ., underlying conditions) or with high exposure to SARS -CoV-2, could also be considered as potential target groups for a booster should a substantial decrease in vaccine effectiveness against severe disease be detected . Other groups for consideration of a booster dose could be healthcare workers and other staff who work in close contact with individuals at risk of severe COVID -19. Timing (season and time since primary vaccination) The timing of the potential administration of booster doses could be of great importance and should be based on epidemiological and practical considerations . Generally speaking, vaccination and boosting of immunity obtain the maximum impact if administered before an epidemic wave and the minimum impact if administered at the end of an epidem ic wave. Monitoring the epidemiological situation is therefore of key importance in deciding when a n additional dose could be best administered in the presence of clear signs of reduced vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID -19 at least in some target groups . Timing is also important for disease s that follow a seasonality pattern , like respiratory infections. Vaccinating before the beginning of the autumn, when people start spending more time indoors, could be an example of such an approach that would again aim at anticipat ing an epidemic wave and therefore maximise the impact of the vaccination. This is similar to what is routinely done with vaccination against seasonal influenza. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 24 Moreover, the timing (and type) of completion of the primary series is a lso of importance for waning immunity, as the more recently completion is the more unlikely the need for a booster, unless a new VOC emerges and spreads with strong vaccine -escape potential. Possible concomitance with influenza vaccination campaign The c o-circulation of influenza viruses during the ongoing COVID- 19 pandemic in the autumn and winter months could have severe consequences for vulnerable populations and place an additional burden on health systems already strained by COVID -19. Unlike ahead of the influenza season 2020/21, a large part of the vulnerable population is now fully vaccinated against COVID -19 [6]. However, uptake differs amongst countries and, in light of continued community transmission of SARS -CoV-2, potentia lly waning immunity , and circulating variants of concern, additional preventative measures remain highly important. Seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns are well established in EU/E EA countries, al though uptake and acceptance is often suboptimal among target groups [136] . Influenza vaccinati on campaigns usually occur during the autumn in order to provide adequate protection in time for the start of the influenza season. Healthcare workers, older adults , pregnant women, individuals with chronic health conditions and children under five years old continue to be important target groups for influenza vaccination. Risk groups for influenza are overlapping with groups most at risk of severe COVID -19 disease including hospitalis ation and death. Ahead of the 2020/21 influenza season in the northern hemisphere, the WHO Regional Office for Europe published recommendations for influenza vaccination during the COVID -19 pandemic [136] . These recommendations highlight the need to ensure the best possible protection against influenza among risk groups, decrease the number of people requiring me dical care as a result of influenza infection to limit pressures on health services while also reducing the potential for SARS -CoV-2 exposure while seeking treatment for influenza or being admitted to hospital for influenza. In addition, since pressure on health systems remains high due to the pandemic, it is important to reduce sickness among health workers and other healthcare providers who are essential to the COVID -19 response. In light of the ongoing pandemic, alternative approaches to the administrati on of influenza vaccination should be considered, including measures to minimi se the risk of COVID -19 transmission. There could be several benefits to the co -administration of possible COVID -19 vaccine booster doses with seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns , in presence of clear signs of reduced vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID - 19 at least in some target groups. The infrastructure for seasonal influenza vaccination is already in place and can be modified according to the epidemiologi cal context of COVID -19. If co-administration with influenza vaccination were chosen, adaptations would need to be made to the programmes . Risk groups for the two diseases overlap to a large part. In terms of COVID -19 vaccination, EU /EEA countries have pri marily prioritised older adults , residents and personnel of long -term care facilities (LTCF), healthcare workers, social care personnel, and people with certain comorbidities [137] . As further vaccine doses become available, many EU/EEA countries are now in the stage where vaccination is offered to any adult individual irrespe ctive of age, underlying condition, or priority group. Some countries are also offering vaccination to children aged 12 years and above [6] . The US American Committee on Immunisation Practices ( ACIP) state in their recommendations that COVID -19 vaccines and other vaccines may be administered at the same time [138]. A pre-print paper on results from the phase 3 randomi sed trial of the safety and efficacy of NVX -CoV2373 (Novavax) shows that the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of the COVID -19 vaccine is maintained while co -administered with the seasonal influenza vaccine, with only a slight decrease in vaccine efficacy from from co -administration of other vaccines has not shown any particular safety or effectiveness concern , although mRNA vaccines have never been co -administered with other vaccines . Measuring r esponse to vaccination Measuring the immune response following vaccination could be considered when selecting individuals that may need an additional vaccine dose. However , as previously discussed, there is currently no established correlate of protection against COVID -19 even at the population level . Neutralising a ntibodies have been suggested as possib le surrogate indicator s, but evidence is inconclusive . In addition , measuring response to primary vaccine series would also pose relevant logistical challenges related to the need for testing for e.g., antibodies in all vaccinated individuals, or all in dividuals belonging to selected risk groups, some weeks after the completion of their primary vaccination series. Finally , there is a variety of serological tests currently available and a lack of standardisation that do not allow for comparisons. Absence of seroconversion could instead be used in specific groups (e.g. , the immunocompromised, elderly frail individuals) to inform the need for additional doses. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 25 Previously infected individuals Studies of single -dose regimens of Comirnaty, Spikevax , and Vaxzevria in previously infected individuals indicate that antibody and cellular immune responses are comparable to na\u00efve individuals who complete the two -dose regimen , but data on the long -term d uration of protective immunity are currently sparse [145,146] . There is also currently v ery limited evidence on clinical endpoints, such as the risk of laboratory- confirmed infection and symptomatic disease, for previously infected individuals receiving just one dose of a vaccine intended as a two-dose regimen [142] . Given the current evidence gaps, as a precaution, consideration should be given to the c ontinued administration of a full-dose regimen to those individuals at greatest risk of severe outcomes following SARS -CoV-2 infection . However , no evidence currently suggests the need for a further additional dose [32] . Challenges in the documentation of a previous infection could complicate the implementation of different approaches for previously infected and na\u00efve individuals , such as deprioritising boosters for previously infected and vaccinated individuals. Additionally, t he situation in the EU/EEA is rather complex regarding the administration of different vaccine product s (including heterologous schedules) , the timing of the primary series, interval s between doses, the completion of the primary series overall and by age group, and vaccination coverage overall and by age group , and it could become challengin g to propose generally valid tailored approaches with the current evidence base. Communication When communicating with the public, a clear distinction needs to be made between (i) additional vaccinations that may be needed for some people who are either im munocompromised or old er frail adults and who may therefore need an extra dose to facilitate their developing a good immune response against COVID -19, and (ii) booster shots that aim to address waning immunity o r the emergence and spread of a vaccine escap e variant in otherwise healthy, previously vaccinated people. While there is evidence to support the former, and, as shown in Table 1 above, this policy is now being considered by several EU/EEA countries, the synthesis presented in this report indicates t hat there is not yet a strong, evidence- based rationale for the latter. Clarity about the distinction between these two strategies is important as any confusion may undermine vaccination uptake, either among immunocompromised and old frail adults where the option of the extra dose should be considered, or among people in the wider population who have not yet been fully vaccinated. Previous studies, from both before and during the COVID -19 vaccine rollout, have shown that when vaccine benefits or effectiveness are perceived as limited, uptake can be sub -optima l [143,144] . Since c ommunication relating to an additional vaccine dose may undermine people's positive perception of COVID -19 vaccine effecti veness, messages to the general publi c should therefore continue to highlight their effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalisation and death , including in relation to the VOCs currently circulating throughout the EU and the need to accept a primary vaccination offer if not done so yet . For immunocompromised people, community engagement strategies - such as two -way dialogue with relevant national and local support groups - can facilitate authorities' understand ing of target populations' perceptions about the vaccine as well as any access challenges they may face, and this can enabl e them to design and implement tailored and effective health messaging [145] . Looking ahead, it is clear that both the evidence base and the epidemiological circumstances are evolving, and that some national authorities may decide to provide booster vaccinations to the wider population in the coming weeks and months. Through trusted spokespeople and using the well -established risk communication principles of consistency, transparency about uncertainty, and clarity [146] , the public should in the meantime be kept informed about scientific and epidemiological developments . This will facilitate people's understanding of the rationale to amend the vaccination pr ogramme to include booster shots , should such a decision be made, which is essential if high levels of uptake are to be achieved. Global equity and supply With many countries still struggling to receive and administer enough doses of vaccine to their populations, consideration should be given to the current global shortage of COVID- 19 vaccines that could be further worsened by the administration of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses in EU/EEA countries. The WHO recently called for a moratorium on booster shots until at least the end of September 2021 in order to improve the availability of vaccines for low - and middle -income countries [147] . Potential concerns around further viral mutations and the emergence of new VOCs in other continents are also to be considered by EU/EEA countries when choosing wh ether to provide additional doses to large proportions of already fully vaccinated populations , as this could further delay the primary vaccination series of eligible individuals in several non -European countries , cause additional burden globally from COVID -19, and facilitate the emergence of new VOCs . Equity considerations within countries and within EU/EEA should also be taken into account. TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 26 Final considerations Closing the immunity gap with the primary vaccination series (i.e. vaccinating those who h ave not yet completed the primary series) for all eligible individuals should remain the current priority of COVID -19 vaccination programmes in the EU/EEA. It is important to distinguish between booster doses for people who responded adequately to vaccinat ion and additional doses for those with weakened immune systems who did not respond adequately. Booster doses are given to vaccinated people (i.e. people who have completed a primary vaccination) to restore protection after protection would have waned. On the other hand, additional doses as part of a primary vaccination series may be given to people with severely weakened immune systems, as they may not achieve an adequate level of protection from the standard primary vaccination. Moreover, reduced vaccine effectiveness due to waning immunity should also be differentiated from reduced vaccine effectiveness caused by vaccine -escape. Although both phenomena may be occurring simultaneously, and are therefore sometimes difficult to disentangle, they may lead to different considerations and decisions (e.g. , changes in the formulation of the booster vaccine). When assessing the need for possible booster doses of COVID -19 vaccine from the public health perspective, it is important to keep in mind the main objective of the vaccination strategy (i.e. preventing severe cases of COVID - 19). Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease should preferably be chosen as primary outcome of interest for assessing when there is a clear need for a n additional vaccine dose in specific groups. The available evidence on ' real world ' vaccine effectiveness and the duration of protection shows that all vaccines authorised in the EU/EEA are currently highly protective against COVID -19-related hospitalisation, severe disease, and death, suggesting no urgent need for the administration of additional doses of vaccines to fully vaccinated individuals in the general population. The option of administ ering an additional vaccine dose to subjects who may experience a limited response to the primary series of COVID -19 vaccination, such as some categories of immunocompromised individuals (e.g. , solid organ transplant recipients), sh ould already be considered now. This is to be seen as an extension of the primary vaccination series for these specific groups, and not as a booster. Consideration could be given to providing as a precaution an additional dose to older frail individuals, in particular those living in closed settings (e.g., residents of long-term care facilities). Close monitoring of vaccine effectiveness data, particularly among vulnerable groups at risk of severe COVID -19 and among those living in closed settings, should be continued, and decisions adapted accordingly, should a substantial decr ease in effectiveness be noted in one or more population groups. Full vaccination against COVID -19 of all family contacts and close contacts, including professionals providing care, of immunocompromised and vulnerable individuals should also be considered . When in contact with individuals at risk of severe disease, physical distancing (when applicable), the wearing of face masks (especially when physical distancing cannot be kept), and hand and respiratory hygiene remain pivotal measures for reducing the risk of SARS -CoV-2 transmission. These non -pharmaceutical interventions should always complement vaccination, particular ly in high- risk settings such as long -term care facilities or hospital wards with patients at risk of severe COVID -19. More solid data are needed to inform future policies on booster doses. Knowledge gaps are particularly related to the appropriate correlate of protection to consider for the different population groups and time from primary vaccination series, and duration of immunity according to e.g. different age and risk groups, vaccine product, dosing interval, VOC, and homologous/heterologous schedule. Prospective vaccine effectiveness studies, as well as surveillance of breakthrough infections in the general population a nd in specific groups, are needed to answer these questions. The b enefit s and risks of booster doses need to be clearly outlined and compared. Benefits may include increased protection against severe disease, moderate disease, post COVID -19 condition (ofte n called ' long COVID '), SARS- CoV-2 infection, and virus transmission. Risks include possible safety concerns and public health implications (e.g., the impact on vaccine confidence and uptake, global availability of vaccines). Data on the co-administration of COVID -19 vaccines and vaccines against other diseases (e.g., influenza) are currently limited, although no safety or reduced effectiveness concern has emerged from co -administration of other vaccines to date . Safety data on COVID -19 vaccine booster dose s are currently limited. Possible dose- related adverse events associated with vaccination could be elicited by additional vaccine doses. In case of the administration of booster doses, close post -authorisation monitoring of potential adverse events should be performed as rare adverse events TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 27 are unlikely to be captured by pre -authorisation studies. An appropriate dosage for boosters should be determined ahead of authorisation for each vaccine product. A strategy for monitoring the safety and effectiveness o f heterologous boosting will need to be prepared as it may not be possible to gather these data from pre- licensing studies. For decision -making, it will be critical to identify the moment when offering a booster dose to specific target groups will become p referable over the goal of reaching all eligible people with primary vaccination series. This decision could be based on several factors, e.g. challenges in reaching unvaccinated pockets of the population with diminishing returns in terms of vaccine covera ge, demonstrated decreased vaccine effectiveness against severe disease in specific groups or overall. Communication about possible additional vaccine doses should be carefully pondered and delivered in a transparent, proactive and clear way to avoid any c onsequence on vaccine confidence. The distinction between strengthening the response to primary vaccination series, in e.g. immunocompromised individuals , and boosters for waning immune response or vaccine escape, should be clearly made. In the context of many countries outside of the EU/EEA still struggling to receive and administer enough doses of vaccine to their populations, special consideration should be given to the current global shortage of COVID- 19 vaccines that could be further worsened by the administration of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses in the EU/EEA countries.

Neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 lineage P. 1 by antibodies elicited through natural SARS -CoV-2 infection or vaccination with an inactivated SARS -CoV-2 vaccine: TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 37 TECHNICAL REPORT Interim public health considerations for the provision of additional COVID -19 vaccine doses 38 Annex. Characteristics of the other four variants designated as VOCs by ECDC ECDC regularly assesses new evidence on variants detected through epidemic intelligence, rules- based genomic variant screening, and other scientific sources. Alpha Several studies provide evidence of increa sed transmissibility of the Alpha VOC [8,153- 155], based on contact tracing data from the UK. Attack rates are around 10 -55% higher across most age groups when the case is infected with the Alpha V OC compared to earlier circulating variants in the UK [151] . In addition, studies in the UK and Denmark demo nstrate that the Alpha VOC is associated with increased severity and mortality. The hazard of death associated with the Alpha VOC is 61% (95% CI: 42 -82%) higher than with pre -existing variants [152] and infection with lineage the Alpha VOC is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation compared to other lineages (adjusted odd ratio (OR) 1.64 (95% CI: 1.32- 2.04)) [153] . Researchers in the UK demonstrated that rates of COVID -19 reinfection are not higher for the Alpha VOC compared to other pre -existing variants [154] . Several studies on vaccine effectiveness from EU authorised vaccines including C omirnaty, Spikevax, Vaxzevria show strong protection against symptomatic disease, severe disease, hospitalisation and death following a full vaccination course in the general population, in LTCF population and in older adults [34-38]. B.1.1.7+E484K Data about transmissibility, severity and immunity of this variant are still very limited. However, the E484K mutation of the spike protein has been associated with a reduction in neutralisation activity by convalescent and vaccinee sera in multiple studies. For instance, this mutation was shown to reduce the antibody neutrali sation compared to a wild type variant when introduced in the USA -WA1/2020 background [23]. Another study evaluated the neutrali sing activity against SARS -CoV-2 variants of the serum of healthcare workers vaccinated with CoronaVac. They found that the neutrali sation efficiency was significantly decreased for viruses with the Beta, Gamma VOCs or B.1.526 (Iota) VOI genetic backgrounds ( which all carry the E484K spike protein change) compared to the Alpha VOC and B.1.429 (which do not carry the change) [155] . Beta The Beta variant was first identified in South Africa and data show that this lineage was likely to have emerged after the first wave of the epidemic in September 2020. The Beta variant r apidly replaced other variants in the country, suggesting that this lineage may be associated with increased transmissibility or immune escape [156] . A study from Qatar showed that the effectiveness of Comirnaty against any documented infection with the Beta VOC was 75.0% (95% CI: 70.5- 78.9) at 14 or more days after the second dose [34]. Another study investigated the efficacy of Vaxzevria in South Africa with a multi -centre, double -blind, randomised controlled trial [157] . A two - dose regimen of this vaccine did not show protection again st mild -to-moderate COVID -19 caused by the Beta VOC. In a secondary- outcome analysis, efficacy against the Beta VOC was not evident (vaccine efficacy (VE), 10.4%; 95% CI: 76.8- 54.8). No cases of hospitalisation for severe COVID -19 were observed in the stu dy, making the trial findings inconclusive with respect to whether Vaxzevria protects against severe COVID -19 caused by infection with the Beta VOC. Gamma In January 2021, Japan reported the detection of a new SARS- CoV-2 variant in travellers who arrived a t Tokyo airport from Amazonas state, north Brazil [158,159] . The Gamma VOC is thought to have emerged in Brazil in November 2020. It was detected in samples collected in December 2020 in Manaus through genomic surveillance, after a rapid increase in hospitali sations [160] . In a recent modelling study, P.1 was estimated to be 1.7 to 2.4 times more transmissible compared to other variants circulating in Brazil. In the same study, protection against reinfection by Gamma or non -Gamma VOC was estimated; the Gamma VOC evades 21 to 46% of protective immunity elicited by a previous infection (wi th a non -Gamma VOC) compared to other variants [160] . Another study evalua ted the levels of Gamma VOC neutrali sation following natural infection and vaccination with CoronaVac, an inactivated COVID -19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech. The vaccine has been approved in several countries, among them Brazil, China, Mexico, Thail and, and Turkey ; it has not been authorised for use in the EU , but is under review. Plasma from COVID -19-convalescent donors had six times less neutrali sing activity against the Gamma VOC compared to the B -lineage. Moreover, five months after booster immun isation with CoronaVac, plasma from vaccinated individuals failed to efficiently neutrali se the P.1 variant. This suggests that Gamma VOC may escape from neutrali sing antibodies derived from previously circulating "}
