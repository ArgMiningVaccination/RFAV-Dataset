The reduction of time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB are the most important priorities in the control of the global TB epidemic, but shortfalls in conven tional diagnostics of TB have significantly compromised this fundamental objective. Recently, the development of novel, rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)1 has generated great anticipation as a new strategy in addressing this important issue in TB control; however, the impact of NAATs on patient care improvement has not yet been well -characterized. With an ambitious End TB Strategy that aims to reduce TB incidence by 90% by 2035 and provide universal drug -susceptibility testing (DST), a comprehe nsive understanding of the evidence on test accuracy, impact of time delays in TB patient care, and cost and cost -effectiveness of these novel TB diagnostics are required to better guide relevant policy decisions. The overall objective of this manuscript -based PhD thesis, therefore, was focused on a comprehensive assessment of the impact (diagnostic accuracy, patient and clinically important impact, cost and cost -effectiveness) of novel rapid molecular diagnostic tests for TB that have promising potential to improve TB patient care. This thesis is presented based on three manuscripts: 1. Impact of molecular diagnostic tests on TB diagnostic and treatment delays: a systematic review In this first manuscript, we conducted a systematic review and meta -analysi s to critically summarize and assess the impact of NAATs approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) on diagnostic and therapeutic delays compared to the standard diagnostic methods for drug susceptible (DS) and drug -resistant (DR) TB. We used both nar rative and quantitative methods. We first developed a conceptual framework for defining time delays from the onset of disease symptoms to the initiation of anti -TB treatment. We also developed a checklist to assess and validate the quality of time delays r eported based on five important methodologic 1 Xpert MTB/RIF (TB -LAMP) 5 and contextual components to determine usefulness and comparability of the time delays . A total of 39 eligible studies evaluating time delay impact of NAATs (Xpert and LPA) were included in our review. Despite g eneral evidence that the molecular TB diagnostics improved time delays in TB care, we found significant methodological inconsistencies and inadequacies in defining, evaluating, and reporting time delays across all studies. Subsequently, in this review, we elaborated on the importance of societal and health system factors associated with the time delays in TB care. Finally, we discussed how future research on time delays can utilize improved methodologies and reporting to properly inform future policy and im plementation strategies of these next generation assays for TB diagnosis. 2. Xpert MTB/RIF testing in a low TB incidence, high -resource setting: limitations in accuracy and clinical impact In this second manuscript, we studied diagnostic accuracy, feasibi lity, and potential patient - relevant impact of a point -of-care (POC) Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF (Xpert), the first automated molecular test for TB, in a low -TB-burden, high resource setting. Our study of 502 patients enrolled in a university hospital TB clinic in Mont real, Canada showed that Xpert had a diagnostic accuracy much lower than those reported in the settings with high disease burden. As Xpert was not approved for clinical use in Canada, we assessed its hypothetical potential impact on time delays in diagnosi s and treatment of TB and found that POC -Xpert could reduce delays in laboratory -based diagnosis of TB, but would have minimal impact on treatment delays. We concluded that the role of POC -Xpert was limited in the context of less extensive disease and in s ettings where the health system is well -resourced, and operational, diagnostic, and clinical guidelines are well -established. 3. Cost, cost -effectiveness, and affordability of the loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for TB in high TB burden , low resource settings In this third manuscript, the main objective was to assess cost -effectiveness of TB-LAMP , a novel molecular diagnostic test, in high TB burden, low resource settings. We used decision analytic modelling to simulate a cohort of patie nts diagnosed with TB in settings where Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing is not offered, parameterized for two countries with lower multi - drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR -TB prevalence): Malawi and Vietnam. We for sputum smear microscopy (SSM) and add -on test to 6 SSM in smear negative patients, to the base case algorithm with SSM followed by clinical diagnosis in those patients with negative SSM. We performed a wide range of sensitivity analyses (one or two way, prob abilistic, and scenario sensitivity analysis) to test the robustness of our findings. Our results indicate that both TB -LAMP strategies were cost - effective when comparing to the World Health Organization (WHO) willingness -to-pay (WTP) threshold levels. The se conclusions did not change in the range of sensitivity analysis performed in our study. However, given TB -LAMP's lack of capacity to detect DR -TB, financial constraints in low income countries and emergence of novel automated point -of- care molecular tes ts for TB, policy makers must cautiously evaluate operational and financial feasibility prior to introducing this technology. The future portfolio for TB diagnostics offers a great promise for much improved global TB control strategies; however, limited re sources mandate that we evaluate them in both clinically and economically meaningful ways prior to their implementation in routine practice. This PhD thesis highlights the importance of a comprehensive assessment of diagnostic accuracy, patient relevant im pact, cost and cost -effectiveness in evaluating novel diagnostic tests for TB, and provides relevant methods and empirical evidence that can better inform current and future directions of the decision making process in global TB control.

In all 3 manuscripts, I am the first author. In the first manuscript (Chapter 3), we were the first group to perform a systematic review and meta - analysis on the impact of WHO -approved NAATs on reduc ing time delays for diagnosis and treatment of DR and DS -TB. In addition, we provided a revised framework to define and clarify key time delay components relevant to the diagnosis and treatment process of patients with symptoms of TB. We are also first to develop a criterion for evaluating the quality of reporting time delays. The second manuscript (Chapter 4) is one of the first studies to empirically address the impact of Xpert in low -incidence, high -resource settings with full mycobacterial culture and d rug susceptibility testing capability. It is the first evaluation of Xpert MTB/RIF in Canada and one of the first studies to evaluate its impact at the point -of-care. This manuscript was published in Clinical Infectious Disease in 2014. The third manuscrip t (Chapter 5) is the first cost-effectiveness study for the TB -LAMP assay. This study was also the first to provide a scenario sensitivity analysis to assess cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP used in conjunction with Xpert. The findings from this study were pr esented at the WHO Expert Group meeting on TB - LAMP assays and will be used for the WHO's policy guideline development for TB -LAMP. 15 Research Ethics Ethics approval was not required for Manuscript 1 and 3 (Chapter 3 and 5 ) as it was a systematic review and decision analysis.

An estimated one -third of the world's popu lation is infected with TB, and nearly 9 million new TB cases and 1.5 million TB deaths occur each year (2). Although globally, TB has stead ily declined each year since 2000, the majority of the disease burden continues to lie in low and middle income countries (LMICs) with the countries in the South - East Asian, Western Pacific, and African regions accounting for more than 80% of the total TB incidence reported in 2013 (2). Canada has one of the lowest overall TB incidences world -wide (3); however, its TB problem is unevenly spread across the country with TB rates astoundingly high amongst immigrants from endemic countries and Aboriginal populations. These two populations accounted for more than 70% of all reported cases in 2013 (3). Early case detection and prompt treatment are the most critical steps of the global TB control strategy (4). However, several studies have shown that diagnostic delays are very common (5, 6), partly beca use TB diagnosis continues to rely on century -old tests such as sputum smear microscopy and chest radiography. Consequently, more than one third of all TB cases were undiagnosed or unreported (2), underscoring the urgent need for a diagnostic tool that is accurate, can be placed at near the patient care, and is simple to operate. Such a tool would have significant impact on TB control through an interruption of transmission and potentially improving treatment outcomes in those diagnosed earlier (7, 8) . Against this backdrop, new sources of funding and innovative product development partnerships were fo rmed (9), which has stimulated greater efforts in developing novel diagn ostic platforms (10). These phenomena have led to development of commercialized nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as Line Probe Assays (LPA) and Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) that offer major advantages of speed and sensitivity. WHO's endorsements of these technologies (11, 12) have subsequently led to unprecedented efforts to scale -up these technologies globally (13-15). However, these tests are expensive to perform and actual diagnostic coverage and utilization have been limited to intermediate or higher level laboratories, implying limited patient level impact, particularly on diagnostic a nd treatment delays. 19 With the growing number of innovative TB diagnostic tests on the horizon (10), it is important to address current knowledge gaps regarding NAAT accuracy and t heir greater effects; gaps of particular note are 1) test accuracy in low TB incidence settings, 2) feasibility and impact of innovative approaches in test implementation (e.g. point -of-care test setting) and 3) actual impact on patient care, particularly in reducing diagnostic and treatment delays. In addition, it is also critical to understand the cost -effectiveness of novel NAATs which could potentially bring incremental value in further improving the diagnostic capacity for TB in resource -limited settin gs, specifically in those areas where current NAAT platforms cannot be implemented . This knowledge will be vital in providing directions for policy and guideline development in the post -Xpert era. 1.2 Thesis aim and objectives Therefore, the over arching goal of my thesis is to address these important knowledge 'gaps' to help shape future policy development of novel TB diagnostic tests. Throughout my thesis research, I focused on an array of issues and produced a wide range of scientific evidence, includin g evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, clinical and patient impact, and cost and cost - effectiveness of NAATs, which are essential to the policy decision making process. The aims and specific objectives of each chapter of my thesis research are as follows: 1. To systematically review the evidence regarding the reduction in diagnostic and therapeutic delays for drug -susceptible (DS) and drug -resistant (DR) forms of TB, with the use of the WHO -approved NAATs, and following specific objectives: A. To critically summar ize and quantitatively assess the impact of the WHO - approved NAATs on time delay reduction for the diagnosis and treatment of DS and DR -TB B. To develop a conceptual framework for defining time delay components for TB diagnosis and treatment C. To propose a syst ematic approach for appraising methodological and reporting quality of time delay estimates 2. To study feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of the point -of-care Xpert in a low - incidence, high resource setting, with the following specific objectives: 20 A. To assess the technical performance (diagnostic accuracy, limits of detection) and feasibility of the point -of-care Xpert in a high throughput clinic specialized in TB with the test performed by healthcare workers who are not laboratory trained B. To assess potential clinical impact of the point -of-care Xpert on reducing diagnostic and treatment delays 3. To assess cost -effectiveness of loop -mediated isothermal amplification assay for TB at peripheral in resource -poor, high TB - burden se ttings, with the following specific objectives: A. To assess cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP assay as a replacement -on test to sputum smear microscopy (SSM) in settings with low multi -drug resistant TB where Xpert is not used as a routine diagnostic t est, and in areas with low and high HIV prevalence B. To assess cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP assay as a replacement or an add -on test to SSM in settings with Xpert available as a routine diagnostic 21 Chapter 2: Literature review 2.1 Tuberculosi s 2.1.1 Global epidemiology of tuberculosis Tuberculosis ( TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that primarily infects the lungs (pulmonary TB), but can also infect other parts of the body (extra -pulmonary T B) (16). As one of the world's most important transmissible causes of morbidity and mortality among adults, TB accounts for an estimated one-third of the world's population, with nearly 9.6 million new TB cases and 1.2 million deaths occurring each year (17). Subsequently, someone in the world is newly infected with MTB every second and more than 2 billion people are infected with MTB in total . Though the TB prevalence has been reduced by more than 42% from 1990 estimate s (Figure 1a) (2), the TB disease burden continu es to be concentrated in the 22 high endemic countries with no or limited signs of improvement in TB incidence in the vast majority of these countries (Figure 1b). Of these 22 high -burden countries , China, India, and Indonesia cumulatively accounted for mo re than 40 % of the total global disease burden (Figure 2). Figure 1a.

Shaded areas represent uncertainty bands. (2) In these countries, the problem of TB is compounded by poor management of active TB, which is a result of limited diagnostic tools and inconsistent supply and use of essential antibiotic drugs. Consequently, more than 37% of the TB and 75% of isoniazid -resistant form of TB with or without resistance to other first -line drugs , were undiagnosed and unreported, potentially fueling a wide spread of antibiotic resistance strains, co-infections with HIV , and influencing other socio -economic factors , all of which result in great challenges for TB control programs in resource limited settings. Likewise, low case detection rates continue to be a major concern, and early 23 diagnosis and r apid treatment to interrupt transmission remain the top priorities for global TB control (18). Figure 2. Global distribution of estimated TB incidence by rate and absolute number, 2014 , Global Tuberculosis Repor t 2015 (pg. 19) . * The size of each bubble is proportional to the size of the country's population. High -burden countries are shown in red. (2) 2.1.2 Tuberculosis in Canada TB continues to be an important health problem in Canada (19). While overall inci dence continued t o decrease to the low level of 4.7 per 100,000 persons in 20 12 (Figure 3) , this figure masks important disparities in rates (Figure 4) (19). Canada has seen consistent growth in the number of temporary and permanent residents entering and residing in Canada since 1985. With a considerable proportion of these immigrants coming from high TB endemic countri es, the TB rate among foreign -born residents is more than 14.8 per 100,000, a rate 6 fold higher than the Canadian -born, non-Aboriginal population. In 20 13, foreign -born individuals accounted for 71 % of all reported TB cases in Canada (19). Drug -resistant TB is 24 very uncommon in Canada and is well below the global levels. In 2008, only 1.1% (15) of the 1359 isolates repor ted to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) were classified as multi -drug resistant (MDR -TB). Figure 3. Annual number of reported tuberculosis cases and incidence rate in Canada 1990 - 2012 (3) Figure 4. Annual number of reported tuberculosis cases and incidence rates by population: 2002 - 2012 (20) TB incidence in Quebec was below the national level at 2.9 per 100,000 and new cases in Quebec accounted for approximately 15% of 1640 total reported cases in Canada in 20 13 (3). More and more immigrants are choosing Quebec as their residence ; in 2000 , it was the third most settled province , and new immigra nts in Quebec now account for more than 20% of all immigrants to Canada in 2013 , making it the second most settled province, next to Ontario. 25 Within Quebec, Montreal accounted for more than 86% of immigrants settling into the province. The TB rate in the Canadian -born Aboriginal population continues to be the highest of the three groups, at.19.9 per 100,000 accounting for 19% of the total cases reported in 2013 (19). Even compared to other Aboriginal groups in Canada, the Inuit population have a disproportionately high rate of TB, with the Inuit population in Nunavut having the highest TB incidence , at a rate of 154.2 per 100,000. The urgency of this problem is underlined by Nunavut ha ving just recorded its highest incidence of TB in the past 10 ye ars, with over 100 cases in 2010 (21). 2.2 Diagnosis of tuberculosis 2.2.1 Current challenges in diagnosis and care of tuberculosis Early diagnosis and prompt treatment i s the cornerstone of TB control (18). Although case detection is acknowledge d to be the first critical step (4), several studies have shown that diagnostic delays are very common (5, 6) partly because TB diagnosis continues to rely on century -old tests , such as sputum smear microscopy and chest radiography. Thus, missed or delayed diagnosis results in ongoing transmission, mortality, and social and economic consequences. Lack of rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic tests is a major hurdle in controlling the global burden of TB. While this very problem is most significant in developing countries with high burden of TB, Canada , where there are ample resources and the best diagnostic tests available for TB , is not exem pt from this problem, as existing TB diagnostic tests either are subject to their inherent limitations, or they cannot be performed at the point -of-treatment. Smear microscopy: Direct -Neelsen [ZN] staining) remains the most widely used test to diagnose TB. Although the technique is inexpensive, specific and not technically demanding, it has several limitations including unacceptably low sensitivity in di agnosing TB and the inability to predict susceptibility to drugs used for treatment (22-24). Sputum smear microscopy (SSM) only detects TB numbers of mycobacteria in the sputum , explaining its poor sensitivity (~60%) , which is particularly low for diagnosing TB associated with HIV infection as well as disease in children. In Canada, microscopy is done via the 26 auramine staining method using concentrated specimens, with the slides read by fluorescen t microscopy (25). By definition, SSM has no role in the diagnosis of smear -negative TB cases, less contagious and the most common type of TB in low disease burden settings like Canada. To overcome the problem of low sensitivity, 3 sputum smears need to be p erformed for each patient, and this often results in diagnost ic delays and patient drop outs (26). Even in highly organized clinical settings such as in Montreal, sputum smears take, on average, 2 - 4 days for resu lts to be reported to the TB clinic. Culture: Culture is the gold standard of diagnosis and is a highly sensitive method that allows identification of MTB as well as differentiation between drug -susceptible and resistant strains. However, its benefits are often outweighed by a long turn -around -time (TAT) of more than 2 - 4 weeks (6 - 8 weeks for solid culture) and the req uirement of a bio-safety level 3 (BSL3 ) laboratory , which restricts the technology to reference level laboratories with negative air - pressure system s. While time to detection is only about 2 weeks with modern liquid -medium culture methods such as BACTEC MGIT 960 [BD Diagnostic Systems, NJ, USA], this test is expensive and not widely accessible. In Montreal, average turn -around -times for cul ture results is about 2 - 3 weeks. Likewise, considerable delays in diagnosis using culture considerably limits its utility for actual patient management, particularly in low -resource settings. Conventional molecular tests: Nucleic acid amplification test s (NAAT) have the potential to detect M. tuberculosis DNA within hours, via amplification of MTB -specific nucleic acid sequences in clinical specimens (23, 27, 28) . NAATs offer significantly increased speed compare d to culture and are highly sensitive in sputum smear -positive samples (29). However, sensitivity tends to be low in sm ear-negative cases (29). The v ast majority of conventional NAATs have complex, multi -step specimen processing and DNA e xtraction procedures, and require expensive, dedicated instruments with well -established laboratory infrastructure and highly trained laboratory staff (30), and as such , most of the conventional NAATs do not meet th e needs of resource -poor countrie s. This severely limits their potential to impact patient management in high TB -burden settings . 2.2.2 The importance of reducing diagnostic and treatment delays Delays in diagnosis and treatment are the most important impediments to effective TB control, and facilitate s continue d transmission of the infection, increase s morbidity and 27 mortality of TB patients, and ultimately contribut es to the slow and low decline in TB incidence (31). Several studies have shown that diagnostic delays are common, particularly in the low and middle income countries (LMICs) (6, 32, 33) . This is a consequence of a reliance on ineffective diagnostics in addition to patient an d health system related factors (5, 6) . According to a systematic review by Sreeramareddy and coworkers , the median diagnostic delay days experienced by patients in LMICs was 28.4 days from the initial TB specific consultation , while total median health systems delay (initial symptom evaluation to TB specific treatment initiation) was 67.8 days (6). Similar findings were reported in a subsequent systematic review that focused on 23 studies from different parts in India , with a total health systems delay amounting to a median 55.3 days (34). In a high income setting such as Montreal , diagnostic delay is also a problem , with many facets (35). Since most TB cases are sputum smear -negative, a positive culture is the only confirmatory test, and this can mean a delay of 2 - 3 weeks before correct treatment can be initiated. While smear -negative patients are not as infectious as smear -positive cases, they do contribute to disease transmission , accounting approximately for 17% of the overall TB transmiss ion as reported in a study in Vancouver (36, 37) . Another diagnostic challenge pertains to patients who are isolated because of suspected active TB. Currently, patients suspected to have active TB may sometimes be hospitalized in isolation rooms until cultures come back negative, and as this may take up to 2 - 3 weeks , considerable medical, social and financial burden s are placed on the patients , even those found to ultimately be TB negative (Figure 5) . Similarly, u nnecessary hospitalization worsens crowding, prolongs wait times, and poses an economic burden on hospitals and to the health system . 28 Figure 5. Illustrative example of cumulative individual patient costs comparing routine diagnosis and rapid point -of-care testing with Xpert. * Costs are estimated based on the WHO -CHOICE cost estimates for hospital visits and hospitalization, and the costs for tuberculosis care in Canada. In a modeling study examining factors that influenc e overall delays in TB diagnosis and treatment, it has been demonstrated that improved test accuracy, particularly in smear - negative TB patients, and access to care are key factors that can considerably improve time delays experienced by patients suspected of TB disease (38). Similarly, a systematic review assessing the factors influencing pre -treatment loss to follow -up in TB patients reported that health -system -related obstacles, particularly delays in receiving diagnostic results, were major reasons for these patients not starting TB treatment (39). Likew ise, improving health system efficiency (e.g. same -day smear) or scaling up laboratory capacity to include novel diagnostic tests (e.g. rapid molecular diagnostic test) can potentially considerabl y impact reducing time delays and , ultimately , TB incidence (40). 2.2.3 Recent advancements in diagnostic tools for tuber culosis Recently , rapid NAATs with technical designs suitable for use in LMICs have been developed and are being used in high -burden settings . The Xpert MTB/RIF\u00ae CA, USA) is an automated NAAT with the capacity to detec t both MTB and rifampicin resistance , a marker of multi -drug resistance (MDR) MTB strains, within two hours (Figure 6). 29 Figure 6. Xpert Testing process and sample preparation process for Xpert MTB/RIF , Boehme et al., NEJM 2010 (41) Its test accuracy is equivalent to that of solid culture (89%, 95% CI: 85 -92) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI: 98 -99) (42) and the us e of \"pod\" like disposable and closed configured cartridges eliminates the risk of cross -contamination and the risk of infectious -aerosol formation below that of smear preparation (43, 44) . These characteristics of Xpert make it suitable for lower biosafety level laboratories and even for use in point -of-care (POC) settings, a true 'game changer' in TB diagnosis. Since the WHO 's endorsement of Xpert in 2010 (45), there has been a surge of donor funding and an establishment of a concession ary pricing scheme for L MICs (46, 47) to facilitate the global roll -out of Xpert , particularly in high TB -burden countries. As of December 2014, more than 3,700 GeneXpert instruments and 10 million Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges have been procured in the public sector (Figure 7) (48) . Despite these efforts, X pert is still relatively costly to operate (49) and requires s upportive infrastructure (e.g. steady electricity supply) and continued maintenance of the instrument , limiting its use at labor atories with limited infrastructure as a routine test . Likewise, there still are considerable gap s in Xpert diagnostic coverage in LMICs , and routine diagnostics continue to rely on SSM and clinical diagnosis. 30 Figure 7. Cumulative number of GeneXpert i nstrument modules and Xpert (Accessed from: http://who.int/tb/laboratory/GeneXpert_rollout_large.jpg?ua=1 ) Another notable post-Xpert phenomenon is the renewed interest in developme nt of novel technological platforms for TB diagnosis which have led to diversified diagnostic portfolio for TB at all level s of the health system (Figure 8) (50). Particularly, many new tests that could potentially be an alternative or can reach much lower laboratory levels than Xpert are now available or emerging from the diagnostic pipeline for assessment of performance, feasibility, and impact in the coming years. The utility and potential impact of these new diagnostics heavily depend on current evidence of impact and limitations of previous generation NAATs (LPA and Xpert) as a routine diagnostic tests for TB. Therefore, it is critical to summarize and evaluate post-implemen tation impact of previous generation NAATs and identify gaps in research . Furthermore, a thorough assessment of cost- effectiveness of potential implementation strategies of these novel NAATs in settings with and without Xpert will be needed to ensure optim al use of health care resources and placement of these tests. 31 Figure 8. Current and emerging automated, semi -modular or non -integrated TB NAATs; their intended laboratory location and their release or anticipated time to market. (50) 2.3 Evaluation of diagnostic tests Diagnostic research is a critical component of health technology assessment (HTA), which includes evaluation of test performance , impact and assessment of value for money of diagnostic strategies (51, 52) . Likewise, diagnostic research ultimately aims to inform policy and clinical decisi on-making around the introduction and implementation of new diagnostics. Unlike evaluation of therapeutic drugs, diagnostic test evaluation does not have well -defined specific phases of diagnostic research (53-56). However, in broader terms, diagnostic research can be described as a process of following study categories (adopted from (57)): Assessment of diagnostic technical performance and accuracy (test research) Assessment of the impac t of diagnostic strategies (additional or replacement of existing diagnostics) using new diagnostic technology on: 32 Clinical management (e.g. clinical decision making process) Prognosis (e.g. changes in treatment decisions) Health outcome (e.g. patient heal th quality of life, mortality) Synthesis of evidence from multiple studies - systematic review and meta -analysis Determination of cost and cost -effectiveness of diagnostic strategies Knowledge translation into practice and policy Therefore, diagnostic rese arch is a comprehensive field of research that includes studying impact elements beyond diagnostic accuracy , such as evidence on clinical decision -making and patient -level outcomes, as well as economic benefits. 2.3.1 TB diagnostics research: the past a nd present One of the most valu able assets of a diagnostic test is its ability to dif ferentiate patients with and without disease, generally described by sensitivity and specificity (58). However, test accuracy is, at best, a surrogate for predicting clinical, patient, and public health impact. Likewise, there are a considerab le number of factors beyond test performance that can determine potential benefit of a new diagnostic test , such as clinician decisions , operational factors, and ultimately patient characteristics and behaviors. For these reasons, evidence from test accura cy studies are rated as \"low -quality\" of evidence by the GRADE guidelines , even though these accuracy studies may not be impacted by biases (59). Prior to the worldwide adaptation of Xpert , TB diagnostic research had prioritized evaluating test accuracy (60). As a result , there was a considerable lack of studies evaluating concepts beyond test accuracy, particularly in a new diagnostic test's contribution to the health care system (e.g. reduction in diagnostic and treatment delays, operational feasibility and improvement), clinical decision making, cost and cost -effectiveness in routine programm atic settings, and on patient outcomes (14). However, the land scape of diagnostic research in TB has c hanged considerably in the post - Xpert era, as novel diagnostic tests, including Xpert , possess greater potential to influence factors downstream of diagnosis than previous conventional tests for TB. Subsequently, the policy decision -making processes at glo bal agencies such as WHO have also adopted a two - step approach that incorporates secondary programmatic recommendation made after initial technical recommendation (made mostly based on evidence on test performance) (61). This 33 secondary recommendation is based on a review of clinical and public health impact after wide adaptation of a new diagnostic test. Likewise, there has been an increased number of studies evaluating impact beyond test accuracy using creative study designs (e.g. hypothetical, pre -post, and before and after) as well as diagnostic randomized control t rials (RCT). 2.3.2 Research methods for assessing impact beyond diagnostic accuracy An ideal design for assessing the impact of any diagnostic test is a diagnostic randomized controlled trial (RCT) (62, 63) . Howe ver, there are several concerns with a RCT design, in addition to them being expensive, time consuming, and logistically challenging (64). Diagnostic RCTs do not just evaluate a test, they evaluate a strategy or pa ckage that includes testing followed by some intervention. Thus, it is not easy to disentangle the efficacy of the test from the efficacy of the intervention (65). Furthermore, it is not easy to capture patient - important outcomes when ethical considerations prevent clinical decisio n making on the basis of a trial product that is not yet approved for clinical use (as in the case of Xpert) (64). Evidence from RCTs in highly controlled settings may not reflect the real world conditions where di agnostics have to be ultimately deployed (64, 66) . There are a lternative methods using quasi -experimental designs, such as before / after studies , to study a test's impact on clinical decision -making and factors th at may influence patient - relevant outcomes (e.g. diagnostic and treatment delays). These studies may be implemented retrospectively or prospectively , but given the inflexible nature of data collected retroactively from chart review, prospective studies may be preferred. In some instances, a retrospective study may be the only option when a diagnostic test is implemented solely on the basis of performance characteristics (67). Lack of randomization limits these studies from avoiding internal validity, but can potentially gain external validity through improved gener alizability of findings (67). Consequentially, by the natur e of the study design, these studies are also subject to a range of potential biases associated with the effect s of time. These may include selection bias (e.g. due to policy changes that may directly or indirectly influence patient's eligibility criteria in either period of assessment) and confounding by temporal factors (e.g. change in health care infrastructure, quality of care) (68). As in some early Xpert studies, a lack of existing policy and guidelines for new diagnostic tests will substantially limit how their impact will be studied during the initial phase of 34 diagnostic test evaluation. Hence, studies may have to rely on hypothetical designs to assess \"potential\" impact. In these studies, explicit assumptions must be made o f the criteria on which the estimated impact will be assessed. These studies may use a combination of study data, assumptions, and data from other studies to assess changes in clinical management or patient -important outcome 'had the test results been available for doctors to make specific clinical decisions.' 2.3.3 Assessing cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis diagnostic tests \"If resour ces were infinitely abundant in relation to the demand for them\", good decisions in healthcare would only be concerned about interventions that could bring the greatest benefits with minimized harm -doing. However, finite resources mean that explicit choice s must be made based on complex considerations that integrate societal values, benefits and harms relative to resource input, and expenditure priorities. Likewise, the primary role of health economic evaluations are to identify resources used against the e ffects of alternative health interventions to better inform the decision process for efficient and equitable allocation of resources. Therefore , various government and non -government organizations have put a greater emphasis on the use of economic evaluati ons in the health decision making process (69-71). Traditionally, decision analytic models have been used to evaluate economic impact of health interventions and ha ve been the primary method for conducting cost -effectiveness analysis for TB diagnostic tests (72). These decision analytic models take account of various probabilities, economic costs, and effectiveness estimates that are associated with diagnostic accuracy: true p ositive, true negative, false positive, and false negative. Though multiple outcomes can be assessed (e.g. increased case detection, treatment and health outcomes), reference case for cost -effectiveness analysis of health interventions in LMICs generally recommend incremental costs be evaluated against disability -adjusted life year s (DALY) averted, which is computed as the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) (73). As ICER is a ratio measure, it generally has no meaning unless weighed or compared against some willingness to pay (WTP) threshold such as per -capita gross domestic product (GDP) (74). Likewise, according to the WHO recommendations , a health care intervention is deemed cost-effective if ICER is within the country's per -capita GDP (69). 35 Decision analysis is a method that involves one or more technical methods such as statistics for decidi ng among competing alternatives, which the output estimates are based on a hypothetical cohort of target population . Likewise, some key parameters may be lar gely based on explicit assumptions or borrowed estimates from studies conducted in different settings/countries. Subsequently, cost -effectiveness analysis models used in TB research are subject to several important limitations. First, the models primarily rely on diagnostic test performance estimates to project outcomes important to clinical management, patients, and ultimately to public health. Additionally, they are subject to same type of limitations discussed in earlier sections ( e.g., limitations of us ing diagnostic accuracy as surrogate outcomes beyond diagnosis). Existing models are based on diagnostic algorithms and do not factor operational characteristics such as diagnostic coverage scenarios. Furthermore, a systematic review of cost -effectiveness analysis of Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRA) for the diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) has found that there are considerable methodologic difference s amongst the studies included , particularly on how cost parameters were evaluated in the model . Many studies lacked proper economic assessment of costs associated interventions evaluated in the study , neglecting important opportunity costs that may be associated with implementation and operation of an intervention (75). This is particularly concerning as cost is one of the two most important components of cost - effectiveness analysis , and the resu lt of the inclusion or exclusion of certain cost parameters may not truly reflect the realities of a given intervention (i.e. costs of implementation and scale -up of new diagnostics can divert resources from other potentially useful interventions) (72). Therefore, it is critical implement good costing practices when evaluating cost - effectiveness of a public health intervention. 36 Chapter 3: Impact of molecular tuberc ulosis diagnostics on improving time delays in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis: a systematic review 3.1 Preface Line probe assays (LPA) and Xpert MTB/RIF\u00ae (Xpert) are commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) that have been endorsed by WH O on the basis of anticipated improvement in accurate and timely diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) . Considerable efforts and commitment have been made by governments of high TB burden countries to scale -up these NAATs to improve diagnostic capacity and infras tructure of TB diagnosis. Subsequently, increasing research efforts have been made to study impact beyond diagnosis, particularly in evaluating the impact on diagnostic and treatment delays. Existing systematic reviews of these tests have been limited to summarizing diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, while there are systematic reviews assessing patient, diagnostic and treatment delays, no systematic review exists that evaluat es impact of diagnostic test and interventions on reducing time delays associated w ith diagnosis and treatment of TB. Also, there is considerable inconsistency in how time delay components are defined and assessed. These inconsistencies range from inclusion and exclusion of time delay components to inappropriate statistical assessment of time data . These discrepancies can complicate and obstruct direct comparison across multiple studies , limiting generalizability of the study findings . We used this study to critically summarize and quantitatively assess actual impact of WHO - approved NAATs on reducing time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB. Moreover, we propose an improved framework to classify critical time delay components. We also used this opportunity to develop a criteria to assess quality of time delay estimates to highlig ht methodological areas of co ncern in studying time delays, which is an area that was not adequately addressed in previous systematic reviews studying delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB. 37 3.2 Manuscript Impact of molecular diagnostic tests on TB diagnostic and treatment delays : a systematic review and meta -analysis Hojoon Sohn1,2, Madhukar Pai1,2 Affiliations 1 McGill University Department of Epidemiology & Bio statistics 2 McGill International TB Centre 3McGill University, Schulich Library of Science and Engineering 38 Abstract Rationale: Delays in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are critical obstacles for TB control. The World Health Organization ( WHO) endorsement of Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) such as Xpert MTB/RIF and line probe assays (LPA) have resulted in unprecedented efforts to scale -up diagnostic capacities in high TB burden countries (HBCs), and increasing interest in research focusing on patient impact of NAATs. Objective: Critically summarize and assess the literature concerning comparative impact of NAATs on diagnostic and therapeutic delays compared to the standard diagnostic methods for drug susceptible and drug -resistant T B using both narrative and quantitative methods. Methods: Prior to the review, a conceptual framework for defining time delays from the on - set of disease symptoms to initiation of anti -TB treatment was developed. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowle dge and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. For numeric assessment of the impact on delays, we calculated absolute mean reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic delays for each study and pooled them using random effects meta -analysis. Main Results: A total of 39 el igible studies were included in this review. We found considerable methodological inconsistencies in how time delays were estimated across the studies. Use of Xpert reduced the delays by 2.38 days (95% CI -0.09, 4.85) for diagnosis and 16.54 days (95% CI 6 .73, 26.35) for treatment of drug -susceptible TB relative to diagnosis and treatment based on sputum smear microscopy. LPA reduced delays by and 62.48 days (95% CI 27.72, 97.24) for diagnosis and treatment of drug - resistant TB respectively relative to conventional culture drug -susceptibility testing. The magnitude and significances of these effect estimates varied considerably in sub -group analyses, as studies includes were highly heterogeneous. Conclusions: Our meta -analysis showed that use of NAATs reduced both diagnostic and therapeutic delays. Future studies assessing impact of novel diagnostic tests on time delays 39 should use standardized measures of time delays, and account for factors that might influence time delay s. 40 Introduction Despite a steady decline, tuberculosis (TB) remain s a major global public health concern with more than 9 .6 million TB cases and 1.5 million death s reported in 201 4 (2). Only a third of the 480,000 estimated new cases of Mult i-drug Resistant TB (MDR -TB) were diagnosed and approximately 30% of diagnosed patients failed to receive proper treatment (2). While reducing time delays to diagnosis and treatment are important obstacles to the control of the global TB epidemic (76, 77), high TB burden countries (HBCs) continue to rely on century - old diagnostics techniques that compromise accurate and timely diagnosis of TB. Line probe assays (LPA) and Xpert commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) th at have been shown to have good diagnostic accuracy with the capacity to diagnose drug susceptible (DS) and resistant (DR) TB within 1 -2 days of sample processing (42, 78) . Anticipating improvements in accurate and timely TB diagnosis, these NAATs were endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) (11, 12, 45) . Since the WHO policy, unprecedented efforts have been made to scale -up Xpert and LPA (13-15). With solid evidence on their test accuracy, research has increasingly focused on studying their actual clinical impact (14, 61, 79 -82). While there are systematic reviews on the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert and LPAs (42, 83, 84) , and others that separately describe diagnostic and treatment delays experienced by TB patients (6, 32, 85) , no systematic review has summarized the impact of NAATs on reduction of time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB. Therefore, the main objective of our systematic review was to critically summarize, using both narrative and quantitative methods, the available evidence of the i mpact of NAATs on diagnostic and therapeutic delays compared to that of the standard of care for DS and DR -TB. We also highlighted methodological areas of concern in assessing time delays, an aspect that 41 has not been adequately addressed in previous system atic reviews of diagnostic delays in TB. Our review will contribute to on -going efforts in improving the diagnostic capacity and effective operationalization of diagnosis and treatment of TB in HBCs. Methods Study selection criteria and operational defini tions Prior to the review, a study protocol was developed based on the standard procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration (86) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) statement and checklist (87). We then developed a conceptual framework for classification of time delay components that are c ritical for operational and clinical impact of diagnosing and treating TB disease. Essential time delay components and definitions of each time delay categories were developed based on an existing framework (32, 33) and are illustrated in Figure 1. This framework provides a standardized and structural guidance in assessing time delays reported in the stud ies included in this review. Our review focuse d on the impact of the WHO -approved TB NAATs, specifically the GenoType (Fujirebio Europe N.V , Gent, Belgium ) - both referred as LPA here on, and Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay ( Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, as Xpert here on . LPAs are currently approved for testing from direct sputum (smear positive) or culture isolate (smear negative patients) who are suspected of MDR -TB (11). Xpert is currently recommended as an initial test in those who are at risk of MDR -TB or HIV associated T B and as an add -on test for those patients who ar e smear negative, but not at risk of MDR -TB or HIV associated TB (conditional recommendation with acknowledging resource constraints) (45). 42 While a variety of products with similar technological platform are available in the market, these tests are the o nly NAATs approved by the WHO, which has led to rapid scale -up and implementation at the global level. We excluded studies focused only on childhood and extra - pulmonary TB, since these conditions are difficult to diagnose and time delays are very challengi ng to assess. We included only peer -reviewed studies that assessed time delays in the process of diagnosis and treatment of TB and MDR -TB, and that used NAATs as an index test. We did not restrict our studies based on region, setting, years, language, or t ypes of study design, but only included studies with primary data, thus excluding reviews and modeling studies. Studies only reporting 'run-time' or turn -around -time of the test (e.g. \"2 hours to run \" Xpert test) were excluded from our review. 43 Figure 1. Conceptual framework of time delay components in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis 44 Search strategy, study selection, and data extraction The complete electronic search strategy is available in Appendix A. Eligible studies were identified from MEDLIN E, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge and Cochrane CENTRAL databases through searches incorporating terms associated with time (e.g. \"delay\", \"time\", \"turna round time\", \"time to treatment\") in addition to specific terms to limit search within LPA and Xpert for diagn osis of adult pulmonary TB and MDR -TB (i.e. excluded childhood and extra -pulmonary TB). The f irst search was conducted on January 10, 2014. With an extensive list of Xpert related studies published in 2014, we conducted an update search on January 31st, 20 15. Ongoing trials, if applicable, were identified based on search results from the metaRegister of Controlle d Trials (mRCT) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. References of included articles and previous systematic reviews focusi ng on diagnostic accuracy of NAATs were consulted , and experts in the fields of TB diagnostics were contacted to identify additional studies not included in the database search. The list of titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers (SGS, ZQ - screen 1, HS, SGS - screen 2). Any potentially eligible studies identified from the two screening s were selected for full -text review and independently assessed for inclusion , based on the study protocol , by two independent reviewers (HS, SGS). A full list of excluded studies with reason for exclusion was updated once discrepancies in inclusion and exclusion were resolved by the two reviewers. A standardized data extraction form was developed using Google Forms (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, U SA) to help reduce errors during data entry (88). Six of the 39 studies inclu ded in this review w ere used to pilot test the data extraction form and the data parameters were independently extracted by the two reviewers (HS, SGS). The form was subsequently revised to improve the quality of data extracted concerning study design, key 45 epidemiologic and c ontextual factors, time delay, and quality assessment. One reviewer (HS) then extracted data for the remaining studies and a second reviewer (SGS) examined all of the extracted items for any discrepant data. We abstracted numeric (median or mean) data on time delays for both the index tests (Xpert or LPA) and the comparator tests (conventional TB diagnostics) according to our operational definitions, up to the point of treatment initiation; some studies reported time or time relevant data beyond treatment i nitiation such as time to culture conversion. Units of time were converted into number of 'days' if reported in other units (e.g. months, weeks, or hours) (89-91). Quality assessment of time delay estimates Unlik e quality assessment tools for diagnostic accuracy studies (92), there currently is no established method or checklist(s) that can be used to assess the quality of stud ies investigating time delays or time to event study outcomes. Therefore, we developed a matrix of key methodologic and contextual information necessary to determine the usefulness and comparability of the time delay reported. These included 1) provision o f clear definition of measuring time delay (\"delay definition\"); 2) empirical or hypothetical assessment of time delay (\"empirical vs. hypothetical\"); 3) assessment of complete diagnostic or therapeutic time delay (\"complete impact\"); 4) use of proper stat istical methods for measurement and reporting of time delay (\"measurement and reporting\"); and 5) proper assessment and adjustment of factors that could influence time delay outcomes (\"risk factors\"). Each category was assigned values of 0 or 1 where 1 was considered positive assessment of the quality. For \"delay definition\", we assigned value of 1 if authors provided clear start and end time definitions in assessing time delay anywhere in the text. For instance, if a study reported time 46 to treatment witho ut indicating starting time or left it ambiguous, this category would take a value of 0. Studies assessing time delays based on hypothetical assessment of 'would have been' time of clinical action took the value of 0 for \"empirical vs. hypothetical\". If st udies reviewed health records or individual patient time stamp of events, a value of 1 would be assigned. If studies only assessed technical delay or just one component of diagnostic or therapeutic delay, \"complete impact\" was assigned a value of 0, 1 othe rwise. For \"measurement and reporting\", we considered median time delay with interquartile range (IQR) most adequate with reporting time delay, as time duration does not generally follow normal distribution. Thus, studies reporting medians with IQRs, with p-value statistics were assigned a value of 1. For those studies reporting mean/average time with 95% confidence interval supported by proper methodological indication (i.e. normal distribution of time in the study), these studies also took a value of 1 f or this category. Otherwise, those studies lacking these credentials (including studies lacking p -value statistics) were assigned a value of 0. If the study reported or properly adjusted for factors that could potentially influence time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB using NAATs, they were assigned the value of 1 for \"risk factors\" (randomized control studies were assigned 1 as they will generally produce balance in underlying risk factors for delays), 0 otherwise. Scores from each category were su mmed to represent 'quality' of time delay reported, with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the best. Data synthesis We first conducted a comprehensive comparative and qualitative assessment of the time delays reported using descriptive and narrative summar ies of the studies included. We calculated overall medians and IQRs of diagnostic and therapeutic delay for each diagnostic test (NAATs vs. smear, culture, and culture DST) from the respective medians reported by 47 individual studies, which were graphically summarized in box -plots. The Kruskal -Wallis test was used to test for statistical significance of the differences in the medians (93). Next, meta -analyses were conducted to assess the absolute reduction in time delay in diagnosis and treatment of TB using NAATs. Time to event and time delay data are non - normally distributed variables that are reported with medians and IQRs. This posed problems in conducting meta -analysis as 1) conventional meta -analytic methods for means require assumptions of normal distribution of the data and 2) there is lack of well -established non - parametric meta -analysis methods to summarize time delays. To cope with these cha llenges, we first converted time delay estimates reported in medians (with IQRs) into mean delay with respective 95% CI using the methods reported by Wan et al. (94). As units of delay measurements (days) were uniform across all studies, we then estimated the effect size as the raw mean differences in time between NAATs and conventional tests for both diagnostic and therapeutic delays (95). These effect size estimates of raw differences were meta -analyzed using a random effects model, since we expected that the observed variations in the delays between studies are likely to be caused by more than random chance (96, 97) . Heterogeneity was evaluated based on the I -squared statistic where a value greater than 75% is considered to be highly heterogeneous (98, 99) . Sub -group analyses were conducted to identif y possible sources of heterogeneity and to assess key factors that can variably influence magnitude of our effect size estimate. Given that the majority of the studies included are observational and that the effect estimates are time delays, publication bi as due to unpublished non -significant studies was considered unlikely and therefore was not formally assessed in this review. Data were managed and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 7.0 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and R (R Foundation for Statist ical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 48 Results Search results The complete process from screening to identifying studies included in this review is illustrated in Figure 2. After removal of duplicates, we screened a total of 7,995 titles and abstracts, which i dentified 107 studies eligible for full text review. A total of 71 articles were excluded (major reasons for exclusion listed in Figure 2). A total of 39studies were included in this review, including 3 identified after second screening. Two studies (91, 100) did not report time delays for the comparator, but were included in our review for the comparative assessment of time delays within the index test. Description of included studies Of the 39 studies included (T able 1 and 2) in this review, 24 (62%) were conducted in World Bank -classified Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), a measure based on gross national income (GNI) in 2015. Of these studies, 15 (38%) were conducted in African region, where the majority of the studies in this region were from South Africa (n = 13) either as part of a multi -center or independent study. Xpert was studied as the index test or intervention in 24 studies (62%), with 2 investigating Xpert exclusively as a test to diagnose and t reat DR - TB (both conducted in South Africa). A total of 28 studies reported HIV prevalence, of which half (n =14) were in settings with HIV prevalence greater than 50% (13 studies for Xpert, 1 for LP A) and 13% (5 studies for Xpert ) of studies were done ex clusively in those infected with HIV . There were 12 studies reporting the rate of empiric treatment for TB (all from Xpert studies) of which 5 reported - 4 from South Africa and 1 from Zimbabwe - rates greater than 40% (51 -69%). 49 Figure 2.

POCT program were generally defined by each study as Xpert testing pe rformed by non -laboratory personnel within the TB clinic. LPA was implemented within the study site (hospital laboratory) in 7 out of 15 studies (46%) evaluating LPA. Quality of included studies Figure 3 graphically summarizes the distribution of the inclu ded studies' overall quality scores and the frequency of studies receiving a score of '1' for each quality assessment category. The quality of reported time delay estimates widely varied across the 39 studies included in this review. Using our quality asse ssment scale, only two studies (5%) received a complete score of 5. Twenty nine studies (76%) received a score of 3 or lower. Major areas of concern regarding quality were 1) lack of proper assessment and adjustment of risk factors affecting time delays (7 7%), 2) improper or lack of statistical assessment of time delay (64%), and 3) lack of clear author -defined time delay s (46%). Many of the laboratory - based (28%) studies reported partial diagnostic delay, only reporting technical delays. Four studies (10 % ) used hypothetical time points to determine the time impact of the index test on therapeutic delay. A graphical summary of overall quality assessment score for each individual studies is available in Appendix B. Definitions of time delays and study desig ns When classifying reported time delays according to our operational definition and by study design (Figure 4), only one study reported all sub -components of time delay and provided overall diagnostic and therapeutic delay (124) . Only one other study (114) evaluated detailed 55 sub-components of complete diagnostic delay. A total of 16 (41%) studies (66, 89, 90, 1 01, 103, 106, 107, 112, 117, 118, 120 -122, 124, 135) reported both diagnostic and therapeutic delays whereas 8 (21%) studies (127-134) only reported technical delays (i.e. laboratory turn around or processing time ). A majority of studies (74%, n = 29) measured time delay either from enrolment or first specimen collection. The remaining 10 studies (26%) measured the delay from the time specimens arrived at the laboratory. All of the studies evaluating therapeutic de lay used anti -TB treatment initiation time as the end point in evaluating therapeutic delay. Two studies (120, 123) also evaluated time delay beyond treatment initiation (time to culture conversion, mean days in DS -TB ward, days to initiate contact tracing, mean total hospitalization). None of the studies included in this review investigated patient or pre -diagnostic delays. A total of 5 (13%) studies employed a randomized control (RCT) study design, two (2) of which were cluster RCTs. 9 (23%) studies were quasi -experimental studies using pre/post implementation study designs. 25 (64%) studies were observational studies where 4 (10%) of these studies assessed the potential impact of Xpert on time delay using a hypot hetical design. In these studies, a hypothetical design was used due to the regulatory limitations using Xpert for clinical management of TB patients. Therefore, assessing the time point on which anti -TB treatment was initiated using the Xpert test result was based on the assumption that a positive Xpert result would have resulted in immediate treatment initiation. 56 Figure 3.

Only a smaller subset of studies (9 for Xpert and 10 for LPA for meta -analysis) reported medians and IQRs for both the NAAT and a conventional test (Xpert vs. smear or LPA vs. Cultu re DST) with which the mean and variance could be estimated to calculate raw mean differences. The overall median diagnostic delay (IQR) for Xpert, smear, and culture for DS -TB were 1.02 days (1.00 - 5.00), 2.00 days (1.15 - 5.33), and 41.25 days (34.25 - 47.50), respectively. The delay observed between Xpert and smear were not statistically significant (p -value: 0.208). For drug susceptibility testing, overall median delay for LPA was 12.70 days (7.50 - 26.00), but was as long as a median of 29.30 days (24 .90 - 37.38). A random effects meta -analysis of mean differences showed that use of Xpert reduced diagnostic delays by an average of 2.38 days (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.09- 4.85) compared to smear (Figure 5A). When compared to culture (liquid), Xp ert reduced diagnostic delays by an average of 35.58 days (95% CI 18.11, 55.09). For LPA, mean reduction in diagnostic delay was 46.57 days (95% CI 28.89, 64.23) for all studies reporting at least any one - overall estimate, direct sputum, or culture isola te - comparative time delay (Figure 5B). Sub-group analyses showed this effect estimate ranged between 23.93 days (95% CI 15.04, 34.81) and 66.58 days (95% CI 41.64, 91.52), depending on sample type used (direct sputum vs. culture isolates) and by restrict ing the analysis to only those studies reporting full diagnostic delay. Since diagnostic delays reported for LPA using culture isolates as the initial sample include delays associated with obtaining primary culture results (MTB detection), the greatest red uction in diagnostic delay is achieved when direct sputum samples are used 58 (maximum of 66.58 days, 95% CI: 41.64 -91.52). Complete results from sub -group analyses are reported in Appendix B. Figure 5. Forest plots of mean difference in diagnostic delay fo r Xpert and LPA Impact of NAATs on reducing therapeutic delays A. Xpert vs. Sputum smear microscopy; B. LPA vs. Culture DST A total of 21 (54%) studies reported therapeutic delays with medians and IQRs or actual median (IQR) or mean differences (95% CI) i n time delay when NAATs were used for clinical management of TB patients. Two of these studies (118, 119) compared Xpert for treatment of MDR -TB patients and directly compared delay estimates with LPA. For treatmen t of DS -TB, overall median therapeutic delay was 2.73 days (IQR 0.09 - 5.75), while conventional diagnostic tests (smear, smear + culture, or smear + clinical diagnosis) took 11.40 days (IQR 4.92 - 28.00), which was statistically significant (p -value < 0.0 01). For DR - TB treatment, use of LPA could reduce median therapeutic delay to as low as 19.80 days (IQR 18.20 - 38.00) when direct sputum sample was used as compared to liquid culture, 59 which took a median of 80.00 days (IQR 77.00 - 86.40). When culture iso lates were used for LPA, therapeutic delay was 50.00 days (IQR 41.30 - 61.80), which was not statistically significant compared to culture DST (p -value 0.052). The pooled mean reduction in therapeutic delay for DS -TB when using Xpert (Figure 6A) as a primary diagnostic test (n = 13) was 16.54 days (95% CI 6.73, 26.35). In sub -group analyses, studies employing hypothetical design (n = 4) showed the largest mean delay reduction at 21.89 days (95% CI 5.39, 38.40). When excluding hypothetical studies and tho se studies that did not report overall (combined smear positive and negative TB patients) therapeutic delays (n = 6), Xpert only effectively reduced therapeutic delay by 4.75 days (95% CI 0.94, 8.57) (Figure 6B). When Xpert was primarily used for DST (n = 2), DR -TB treatment was initiated 20.44 days earlier (95% CI 10.31, 30.57) compared to LPA. Use of LPA for DR -TB treatment (all studies reporting any one of the three therapeutic delays) also reduced therapeutic delays considerably at 62.48 days (95% CI 2 7.72, 97.52) (Figure 6C). Maximum reduction in therapeutic delay was achieved when direct sputum samples were used as the sample for LPA testing at 73.66 days (29.30, 118.01). When culture isolates were used as a primary specimen for LPA (Figure 6D), thera peutic delay was reduced by 43.59 days (95% CI -9.77, 96.96), but it was not statistically significant, which was consistent to our findings above. When further restricting our analysis to studies that report overall (combined estimate of direct sputum and culture isolate) LPA therapeutic delay against culture DST (n = 2), the pooled mean reduction in delay was 21.96 days (95% CI 14.54, 29.37). Of all of our meta -analyses, this particular analysis was the only analysis that showed an I2 value indicating low heterogeneity (< 30%). All other analyses showed I2 values greater than 85% (mostly <95%), suggesting considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in our analyses.

LPA, including all studies (if n ot reporting overall figure, include lowest delay estimate), D. LPA, only studies reporting culture isolate for LPA testing 62 Discussion One of the advantages of TB -NAATs (LPA and Xpert) is that these technological platforms are capable of accurate bacterio logic diagnosis of TB within the \"same day\" of sample processing (44, 136) . This is in contrast to conventional methods of diagnosing TB that often delay proper diagnosis and treatment until months after a patient' s first clinical evaluation for TB. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the routine use of NAATs should translate to significant reductions in time delays to diagnosis and treatment. Our meta -analysis of mean delay reductions suggests that use of TB -NAATs re duced both diagnostic and therapeutic delays for patients investigated for DS or DR forms of TB, although there was considerable heterogeneity among studies. Of the Xpert studies reporting complete empiric therapeutic delay (excluding hypothetical studies ), all but one study (113) reported a time delay reduction of less than 14 days. Seven of these studies reported insignificant or less than 7 days of time difference in therapeutic delays when comparing Xpert interventions to the comparator strategy (generally AFB smear, clinical diagnosis, and/or culture result) (66, 101 -104, 106, 117) . All of the studies reporting therapeutic delays for Xpert were conducted in highly restrictive and controlled clinical trials of which 5 were RCTs. In these studies, high rates of empirical t reatment (> 50%) and diagnosis (generally a combination of clinical symptom evaluation, CXR, and anti -biotic trials) (137) were also reported. This has several important implications in interpreting Xpert's impact on time delays in diagnosing and treating TB. First, in settings of high empirical diagnosis and treatment, it is likely that more non -TB patients will be prescribed TB treatment at a much earlier stage. This seemingly improves the performance of the baseline practices while representing, in part, ove r-treatment. When compared with an interventi on aimed to improve time delays such as using rapid diagnostic 63 tools (e.g. Xpert ), it may bias the effect estimate towards the null (138) . This is confirmed in the multi -center RCT study where greater a proporti on of patients in the smear arm were put on treatment based on empirical evidence (197/758 vs. 130/744) (66). This effectivel y abrogates any potential time delay benefits that the Xpert intervention could have had in those patients who had smear negative TB disease. Second, operational and clinical management issues imply greater implications in realizing the potential benefit of the \"same -day\" rapid diagnostic tests as highlighted in several studies included in this review (91, 112 -114, 118, 119, 121, 122) . In Brazil, diagnostic delays in the Xpert arm were not reduced when compared to the smear arm, and additionally required more than 7 days for the test result to be reported for clinical use (103) . This is largely due to the operational problems (health system infrastructure, lack of guidelines and algorithms for management of certain patients with discordant NAAT results, etc.) observed early in the nation -wide implementation of Xpert (139) . A study by Cox and colleagues confirmed that time delays in diagnosis and treatment post -implementation of a newer technology can be improved over time with focused efforts to improve program im plementation (119) . In this study, therapeutic delays in DR -TB treatment were reduced by 38% over the one year roll -out of Xpert in South Africa between 2012 and 2013. A substantia l post -implementation reduction in therapeutic delay was observed for LPA in the same study where it was reduced from 76 days (62 -111) during the first year of limited decentralized implementation (2007) to 28 days (16 -40) 3 years after the improved implem entation program was initiated in 2009. Several studies assessing key sub -components of time delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation showed specific logistical and operational issues caused significant delay for the \"same -day\" diagnostics. Centrali zed testing of Xpert at high volume laboratories created more delays (6.3 days) than smear microscopy (3.3 days), largely caused by slower sample 64 processing and result transfer to relevant clinics (114) . The signif icance of operational and logistical consequences was greater in LPA as shown in one study, where more than 28 days of delays (of 38 total therapeutic delay days) were attributable to the components other than LPA laboratory processing (5 days) (124) . In two studies from South Africa, a \"same -day\" DST test resulted in therapeutic delays of more than 50 days, even when LPA was performed directly from sputum samples (121, 122) . Any reduction of time delays was nullified when culture isolates (smear negative presumptive MDR -TB patient) were tested on LPA, taking more than 73.5 days (vs. 78 days for culture DST) (121) , consistent with the results of the meta -analysis including these two studies. Considering the significance of the problem of MDR -TB in South Africa, these findings are alarming and highlight the importance of evaluating operation and patient level factors that can influence delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB. Our findings also highlight the need for methodological improvement and standardization in assessing time delays for diagnosis and treatment of TB. Our review found that in many instances, authors used the same ter minologies to define different components of the time delays. For instance, \"turnaround time\", \"time to detection\", and \"laboratory processing time\" were used to describe the time from specimen receipt to test result (laboratory specific time components) f or 11 studies (89, 114, 122, 124, 126 -128, 131 -134) while 10 studies (100, 106, 112, 115, 116, 118, 120, 121, 129, 135) employed these terminology to define complete diagno stic delay. Measurement starting times widely varied and were often unclear with some studies reporting \"first contact with the health system\" or \" identification of patients suspected of MDR -TB\" as the starting point of time measurement. Only 1 study repor ted a complete 4 components of diagnostic and therapeutic delays (124) and more than half (n = 22) of the studies reported diagnostic or therapeutic delays as a single estimate without providing sub -65 components of t he delay. Our findings are consistent with other systematic reviews (6, 32, 85) that suggest that inconsistencies and lack of consensus in defining components are critical obstacles in interpretation and generaliza bility of study findings. Moreover, statistical analyses of time delay outcomes were inappropriately conducted or inadequately reported in the majority (64%) of the studies. Time delay estimates were reported in 'means' with confidence intervals rather th an 'medians' with IQR without description of the distribution of the time delay data. Since normality assumption is required for computation of means and confidence intervals, this can be highly problematic for reporting time estimates, which typically are skewed and non -normal ly distributed. Some studies reporting medians did not include IQRs or reported means with IQRs. Additionally, only 15 studies (38%) reported p -values for tests of significance comparing time delay estimates between NAAT and conventio nal tests. Only 9 studies (23%) reported and assessed (analytically and by design) risk factors for time delays, further limiting our understanding of the true impact of NAATs on time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB. These methodological limitation s observed in our review may be due to the fact that for most studies, time delay outcomes were second and tertiary outcomes, and thus proper analytical assessment of these outcome measures may have been overlooked. Our review is the first systematic rev iew to summarize the comparative impact of NAATs on time delays in diagnosis and treatment of DS and DR -TB using a random effect meta -analysis for absolute mean delay differences. Our meta -analysis results are consistent with the findings observed in the n arrative assessment. However, our meta -analysis resul ts should be interpreted with caution. First, conversion of median delay estimates into means required an assumption of normal distribution where time delay estimates are non -normally distributed and pos itively skewed. This causes uncertainty in the effect estimate to be widened, where in 66 some instances, a 'negative' lower bound CI was reported for some delay measures. However, it is difficult to assess the direction or magnitude of the normality assumpti on that our conversion of medians into mean would have on the overall meta -analysis results. Second, considerable statistical power was lost when restricting studies that presented necessary data for mean conversion and direct comparison of delay parameter s. Third, high level of heterogeneity across all of our meta -analysis suggest considerable limitations in generalizability of our pooled estimates. It has long been understood that the delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB are mainly caused by the vicio us cycle of repeated healthcare facilities providing inadequate care for TB (6, 32) . This problem is an inevitable consequence of the prolonged operational and technical challenges TB control programs have faced in the LMICs. On a positive note, the global roll - out of Xpert dramatically changed the landscape of TB diagnosis in many LMIC and has led to considerable improvements in TB diagnostic infrastructure, quality of the TB control programs, and stimulated the de velopment of novel tests that could reach much closer to the patient than Xpert (140) . These positive trends will potentially have positive impact on improving time delays downstream of diagnosis and the burden of the TB disease. However, the magnitude of such effects will depend heavily on the characteristics of health system operations, as well as patient and provider behaviors in each setting (141) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the effect and mechanisms of societal and health system factors influencing overall delays in TB care post implementation of NAATs; this would facilitate the creation of better -informed policy and future implementation str ategies, and maximize the benefit of existing and future rapid diagnostic tools. 67 Chapter 4: Xpert MTB/RIF testing in a low TB incidence, high - resource setting: limitations in accuracy and clinical impact Sohn H et al. Clin Infect Dis 2014 4.1 Preface At the time of our study, Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) had just been approved by WHO and there were only a limited number of studies assessing the performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF (44, 142 -144). While there was much hype and excitement about the test, Xpert needed to be further evaluated for several reasons: 1) Although the technology is WHO -approved, there are virtually no data on how the test performs in low TB incidence settings (e.g. Canada), where most TB cases are smear -negative, and where relatively high prevalence of non -tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) creates challenges for smear microscopy; 2) Although the technology has the potential to be used at the point -of-care, currently there are no published data on i ts feasibility and potential clinical impact when the technology is placed in a clinic setting, and used by routine clinic staff with minimal training; 3) Because cultures take 2 - 3 weeks, the Xpert test has the potential to reduce diagnostic delays in sm ear-negative TB cases, but no published data existed on potential reduction in diagnostic delays that can be achieved using the Xpert assay. Thus, in this manuscript, we assessed diagnostic performance and feasibility of a point -of- care (POC) Xpert testin g strategy in a routine high throughput TB clinic in Montreal, Canada. As the use of Xpert for diagnosis and clinical management of TB patients was not approved during our study, we hypothetically assessed the potential impact of POC Xpert strategy on reducing delays in diagnosis and treatment, on the basis of the idea, 'if Xpert MTB/RIF had been used for initiation of treatment, when would TB treatment have begun?' 68 4.2 Manuscript Xpert MTB/RIF testing a low TB incidence, high -resource setting: limi tations in accuracy PhD1,4 Affiliations 1 McGill International TB Centre & Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Canada 2 Respiratory Epidemiology & Cl inical Research Unit, Montreal Chest Institute, Montreal, Montreal, Canada 3 Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada 4 Division of Infectious Disease, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, Boston, USA 69 Abstract Rational : Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF, the first automated molecular test for tuberculosis, is transforming the diagnostic landscape in low -income countries. However, little information is available on its performance in low -incidence, high -resource countries. Methods/Objecti ves: We evaluated the accuracy of Xpert in a university hospital TB clinic in Montreal, Canada, for the detection of active TB on induced sputum samples, using mycobacterial cultures as the reference standard. We also assessed the potential reduction in time to diag nosis and treatment initiation. Results: We enrolled 502 consecutive patients who presented for evaluation of possible active TB (most with abnormal chest radiographs, only 18% symptomatic). Twenty -five subjects were identified to have active TB by culture. Xpert had a sensitivity of 46% (95% confidence interval (CI): 26 -67) and specificity of (CI: 99 -100) detection Mycobacterium tuberculosis . 86% (CI: 42 -positive -negative, culture -positive subjects; in this latter group Xpert results were obtained a median 12 days before culture results. Subjects with positive cultures but negative Xpert results had minimal disease: 11 of 13 had no symptoms on pres entation, and the mean time to positive liquid culture results was 28 days (CI: 25 -47 days; compared to 14 days, CI: 8 -21days in Xpert/culture -positive cases). Conclusion: Our findings suggest limited potential impact of Xpert testing in high -resource, low-incidence settings due to lower sensitivity in the context of less extensive disease , and limited potential to expedite diagnosis beyond what is already achieved with the existing , well-performing diagnostic nucleic - acid-amplification test for sputum specimens that can detect both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and rifampin resistance within two hours, and requires minimal hands -on time. When tested i n high -incidence settings, usually with spontaneously expectorated sputum, Xpert is highly accurate, (sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 98% ) (145) . Due to its excellent performance characteristics, Xpert is transforming the diagnostic landscape in the developing world and is now being used in over 80 countries (45). Xpert has also been recently approved by the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA ) and Health Canada (146) . Nevertheless, it is conceivable that important factors in evaluating the performance characteristics of the test such as patient population, stage of disease, m ethods for obtaining sputum sample (spontaneous vs. induced) and accuracy of routine smear and culture tests may differ between high - and low -resource settings. Yet, the performance of the test has not been studied in routine use in high -resource, tertiary -care settings with low - incidence of TB (147, 148) . It is therefore critical to generate evidence on whether existing data and policies are transferrable to these settings (45). In Canada, the current TB incidence is 4.6 per 100,000 population, with most cases a mong immigrants (3). Most pulmonary TB disease in Canada (as in other low -incidence settings) i s smear -negative (66%), and therefore diagnosed only by liquid culture -based techniques that typically take 2 -3 weeks to provide a result (149) . Delays in diagnosis and treatment can increase patient morbidity and mortality (6, 32) . While smear -negative cases are less infectious than smear -positive, they may account for up to one fifth of all secondary transmission (36, 150) . Furthermore, the suspicion of TB has economic implications for the health care system, as patients may be hospitalized for respiratory isolation, while undergoing the relevant investigations. The Xpert assay may enhance accurate and rapid detection as it can detect up to 67% of smear -negative cases (145) . In addition, it might be su itable for use at the point -of-care as the test's sample reagent has potent tuberculocidal properties, thus largely eliminating biosafety concerns (43). With the use of Xpert at the point -of-care and the availabili ty of results within hours, patients can potentially be diagnosed with TB at their first visit, which would 71 conceivably shorten the time to treatment and reduce transmission. However, there are limited data on the use of Xpert at the point -of-care, outside of laboratories (110, 151) . With this study, we aim to improve the understanding of the accuracy and the potential impact of Xpert in a low -incidence, high -resource setting. Methods Study participants Consecutiv e patients aged 18 years, referred to the Montreal Chest Institute TB Clinic for evaluation of suspected active pulmonary TB were recruited. The institutional review board of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada, approved the study. Spec imen collection/processing Our TB Clinic policy is to collect induced sputum samples, using 3% hypertonic saline solution and an ultrasonic nebulizer on all patients with possible/suspected active TB. Two samples were obtained from all consenting patients on the day of enrollment. The first sample was processed in standard fashion in the clinical microbiology laboratory, including smear (Auramine O method) and liquid culture (Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube, Becton Dickinson, USA). The second sample was used for Xpert testing. The Xpert test was performed at the TB clinic according to the standard protocol for unprocessed samples, per the manufacturer (152) . Further information is avai lable in Appendix C and Figure E1. When we started the study, Xpert had been endorsed by the World Health Organization (153) . Approval of the test by Health Canada followed in 2012. Since Xpert was done outside the hospital -approved clinical lab, test results obtained as part of the study were not made available for clinical decision -making. However, following approval of the test by Health Canada (after enrollment of 394 subjects), the microbiology laboratory was alerted of any positive Xpert result and a conventional nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT; Cobas TaqMan MTB, Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) was suggested (if not already done) . 72 The reference standard was liquid culture on three processed samples, followed by phenotypic culture -based drug -susceptibility testing (DST) at the provincial reference laboratory (154) . For all discrepant results (i.e. rifampin resistant on Xpert but sensitive on DST) sequencing of the rpo B gene was performed (Appendix D ). From January 2012 a ll MTB isolates were also routinely typed using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) typing. From this data, we determined that one positive culture result (Xpert - negative) could have been due to cross -contamination in the laboratory and ther efore was excluded from all analyses. To assess the limit of detection of Xpert and the potential impact of hypertonic saline on the performance of Xpert, we added Bacille -Guerin (BCG) at hypertonic saline, then submitted these samples for Xpert sample preparation and testing as above. Statistical analysis We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert compared to the culture reference standard. We assesse d the accuracy of rifampin resistance testing on Xpert compared with culture -based DST. We assessed clinical impact of all diagnostic methods by examining the interval from procuring the first sample to obtaining the relevant diagnostic result. Furthermor e, we compared the time from first sputum collection to treatment initiation and the days of empiric treatment given prior to culture -confirmation. We compared this with the time when the Xpert result would have been available to the physician, if res ults had been shared (Figure E2, Appendix D). We used Standards for the Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) (155, 156) for reporting the study results. Results Between October 2011 and May 2013 we enrolled 502 consec utive patients who presented to the TB clinic for evaluation of possible active TB. The median age of subjects was 44 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 31 -61) and 44% were female (Table 1). Persons referred for immigration -related screening constituted the largest number of subjects (294, 59%) and only 73 93 subjects were born in Canada (18.5%). Many (44%) were born in countries with very high TB prevalence (>100/100,000). Only 12 subjects were known to be HIV positive and 15 subjects had other immunocompromi sing co -morbidities (5%). A history of prior active TB was reported by 111 subjects (22%). A sizeable fraction of subjects were referred for evaluation in the context of an immigration screen that yielded a chest X -ray with a possibly TB related abnormalit y (22%; Table 2). Others were contacts of active TB cases, who had positive tuberculin skin tests (5%). Only 18% had symptoms suggestive of active TB (i.e. fever, cough, night sweats, weight loss) and overall 74% had an abnormal chest X -ray (19% of these with findings highly suggestive of active TB, i.e. cavitation, and/or apical fibronodular disease]; Table 2). Twenty -five subjects were identified to have active culture -confirmed TB. Eleven subjects were smear positive but only 7 of these were identified to have MTB disease (3 others had non-tuberculous mycobacteria and one was a false -positive as culture/NAAT negative).

For most of these tests (37/44; 84%) the internal control failed. If Xpert yielded an invalid result, repeat testing was performed either on the same sample (if sufficient volume) or a repeat sample. All repeat testing resulted in an interpretable res ult (5 subjects did not return for repeat testing). While non-interpretable results decreased somewhat with the change from the G3 to the G4 cartridge (11.9% for G3, 95% 7.5% for G4, CI 5.0-10.8%), the number of invalid results still exceeded that reported in the literature (Table 75 3) (3). Therefore we requested an evaluation by the manufacturer. The manufacturer discovered that one lot accounted for 91% of all invalid tests but only 70% of all tests (odds ratio 5.5 for this lot compared to all other lots, CI 1.3 -23.9). Further evaluation of reasons for invalid results is ongoing with the manufacturer. Xpert accuracy Xpert detected 11 out of 25 subjects with culture -confirmed TB, for a sensitivity of 46% specificity of for detection of culture -positive TB (Table 3). The sensitivity was improved in smear -positive subjects (86%, CI: 42 -100) subjects (CI: 10 -56). While sensiti vity appeared be lower with the G4 cartridge (33%; 12 -62) compared to the G3 cartridge (67%; 30 -93), the CIs were wide and overlapping (Table 3). One subject was \"false -positive\" on Xpert as culture result was negative (no documented pretreatment). In that case, the Xpert result was confirmed by a positive NAAT in the clinical microbiology lab. Eight other subjects who were treated for TB based on clinical grounds (not -culture confirmed) were Xpert negative (no NAAT done). n N cases# Sensitivity (95% CI) Specificity (95% CI) Number Invalid* (%) Xpert results (1st test) 501 25 46 (26-67) 100 (98-100) 44 (8.8) By smear result Positive 11 7 86 (42-100) 100 (29-100) 1 (9.1) Negativ e 425 18 29 (10-56) 100 (99-100) 40 (8.6) By cartridge version G3 143 10 67 (30-93) 100 (97-100) 17 (11.9) G4 358 15 33 (7.5) *Invalid or erroneous result; CI=confidence interval; One subject with contaminated culture result excluded; # Culture -confirmed tuberculosis cases Table 3: Xpert resu lts 76 Rifampin resistance results on Xpert Only 2 isolates were predicted to be rifampin resistant on Xpert testing. Culture -based DST confirmed only one of the two to be rifampin resistant. Sequencing of the rpoB gene on the isolate that provided a discrepa nt result between Xpert and culture -based DST, identified a mutation in the 511 locus (Pro > Leu) that is captured by probe A of the Xpert (Appendix D ). Evaluation of low sensitivity Evaluation of the limit of detection of Xpert yielded 100% detection of BCG at a concentration as low as 62 colony forming units (CFUs)/ml and 80% at a concentration of 31 CFU/ml in normal saline, thus suggesting an even lower limit of detection than what was described in the original validation studies on sputum samples (2). Furthermore, the sensitivity of the Xpert was the same in samples with hypertonic saline as with normal saline. Most participants with culture -positive TB had minimal disease (Table 4). This is suggested by the fact that only 7 out of 25 (28%) culture -positive subjects were smear -positive, only 12 (44%) had symptoms at presentation and 2 subjects had no radiographic abnormalities at all. Two out of seven subjects (18%) who had only one positive culture (out of 3) were Xpert positive, while 9 out of 12 subje cts (75%) with three positive cultures were Xpert positive. In addition, a longer period to culture positivity was noted for Xpert -negative, culture -positive subjects (28 days, CI: 25 -47 days compared to 14 days, CI: 8 -21days in Xpert - positive/culture -positive cases), suggesting lower bacillary load. The mean cycle -threshold (CT) -value for all Xpert - and culture -positive subjects also was high at 28.2 (standard deviation of 2.9) suggesting a low bacillary burden even in those subjects who were Xpert posit ive (157) . The presence of symptoms upon enrollment into our study was the one variable that was predictive of X pert positivity (Table 4). 77 Characteristics Total TB cases Xpert positive n* % (n) 95% CI Age <35 >35 13 11 46 (6) 46 (5) 17-77 19-75 Gender Female Male 6 18 33 (2) 50 (9) 4-78 26-74 Country of origin Canada Other 0 24 0 46 (11) 0 26-67 Prevale nce in country of origin Low/medium High/very high 7 17 43 (3) 47 (8) 10-82 23-72 History of TB No Yes 22 2 46 (10) 50 (1) 24-68 1-98 Immunocompromising illness No Yes 24 0 46 (11) 0 26-67 0 Symptoms No Yes 13 11 15 (2) 82 (9) 2-45 48-98 Radiographic abnormalities No Yes 2 22 0 50 (11) 0-84 28-72 Number of cultures positive 1 positive 2-3 positive 7 17 29 (2) 53 (9) 4-71 28-77 Time to liquid culture positivity >3 weeks <3 weeks 13 11 23 (3) 73 (8) 5-54 39-94 *One subject with positive culture and invalid Xpert result.

Potential clinical impact evaluation The Xpert result for all subjects was available on average within two hours. However, given that subjects were not always enrolled on initial presentation to the TB clin ic, the time between the first sample and the positive Xpert result for culture -confirmed cases was a median of 25 hours, (IQR 3 -93; N = 11). A positive smear result was reported within 26 hours (IQR 25 -51), while a positive culture result was reported aft er 516 hours (i.e. 22 days; median; IQR 336 -720 hours). The actual time to treatment initiation (from initial sample provided) was 1 day for smear - positive cases (median; IQR 0 -2) and 26 days for smear -negative cases (median; IQR 4 -30). For 13 of the 18 s mear -negative cases, Xpert was negative and therefore would have not influenced treatment decisions. For the remaining five subjects who were smear -negative but Xpert positive, treatment would potentially have been started a median of 12 days (IQR 4 -23) 79 sooner, if results had been shared with the physicians. Treatment initiation would have been only one day earlier, at best, for smear -positive cases. Subjects with smear -positive results who were ultimately identified not to have TB in this study were not s tarted on TB therapy while awaiting culture results, likely because species confirmation by existing NAAT in the clinical lab was usually done within a day of the positive smear, and suspicion of clinicians was low. Thus Xpert would not have had any impact in preventing unnecessary TB treatment and possibly contact investigations in these subjects. Discussion The Xpert assay has been shown to effectively and rapidly diagnose TB in low -resource settings where diagnosis has hitherto depended primarily on sme ar microscopy, thereby potentially decreasing morbidity associated with diagnostic delay, dropout and mistreatment even if some persons with smear -negative active TB are still missed because of imperfect sensitivit y . However, the impact of the technology in low -incidence, high -resource settings with full mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing capability has not been adequately studied. With the recent FDA approval of this technology, it is important to generate evidence in low TB incidence s ettings. Our study highlights that in a high -resource, tertiary -care setting, subjects are likely to present early in their disease course with minimal disease, in parts detected as a result of active immigration screening. This is suggested by the substan tial number of asymptomatic subjects in our study and the limited number of subjects with radiographic findings consistent with active TB. Furthermore, the time -to-positivity of mycobacterial cultures in our participants was longer than the expected averag e for liquid cultures, suggesting a low bacillary load \u2014notably in those with negative Xpert results (158) . The preponderance of paucibacillary disease likely accounts for the limited sensitivity of Xpert we observed. While the results for smear -positive samples are within the range of previous observations in low resource settings, the sensitivity of Xpert for smear -negative samples is substantially lower than that reported in a recent systematic review (68% sensi tivity) (145) . However, that review involved on ly subjects who were symptomatic on presentation while in our study only 18% of subjects were symptomatic. 80 Most studies thus far published on Xpert also used expectorated sputum, while all sputum samples in this stu dy were obtained by induction. It is con ceivable that the dilution of the sample in the process of sputum induction, results in even smaller numbers of CFUs in the cartridge. This may also contribute to the lower sensitivity of Xpert in our setting, particularly since all samples sent to the cli nical microbiology laboratory for smear microscopy and culture undergo a concentration step, but for Xpert performed in the clinic, no concentration step was used (with the intent to minimize processing steps and equipment as well as biosafety concerns). A n effect of hypertonic saline (used for the sputum induction) on the performance of Xpert appears unlikely as the pH of the sample obtained with induction is likely to be only minimally different from expectorated sputum. Furthermore, an evaluation of 32 s amples using BCG to compare normal and hypertonic saline did not show any difference. A decreased sensitivity of Xpert in induced sputa has also been described in preliminary results from a study of South African adults (152) . However, studies in children have shown adequate sensitiv ity of Xpert in induced sputum (159) . It is conceivable that adults with paucibacillary disease are more likely not to produce sputum, while childre n may have many more reasons why they cannot provide a spontaneous sputum sample (e.g. inability to follow instructions), which could explain the discrepant finding. Concerns have been raised about the limited specificity of Xpert for rifampin resistance detection and thus its positive predictive value in a setting with low prevalence of multi -drug resistance (160, 161) . In this study, only two subjects were labeled as having rifampin resistant TB by Xpert, of which only one had confirmed resistance on culture -based DST. Sequencing of the rpoB gene of the isolate with the discrepant result suggested a mutation that was associated with increased failure and relapse rates in recent stud ies (162, 163) . This finding raises some concern about the predictive validity of phenotypic testing for rifampin susceptibility, and its use as the gold standard for confirmation of the Xpert rifampin resistance test. Sequence for confirmation of rifampin resistance detected on Xpert is therefore recommended (164) . In addition, our study highlights the limited potential impact of Xpert on time to diagnosis and likely also on treatment decisions in a setting where 1) the standard diagnostic algorithm with smear and culture, supplemented by confirmatory NAAT in the laboratory, performs 81 well; 2) there are excellent logistics for transport of samples and communication of results; and 3) physicians are experienced in the diagnosis and care of TB subjects (in our TB clinic, all subjects are se en by pulmonologists). However, given that Xpert was not always done on first encounter, results were not used for actual clinical decision -making and the overall number of positive cases was low, this conclusion has to be interpreted with some caution. Furthermore, it is also unlikely that Xpert will serve as a rule -out test when cultures are available, as the overall sensitivity in smear -negative TB was low and clinicians are unlikely to withhold treatment based on a negative Xpert result if clinical sus picion remains high. However, it remains possible that Xpert may have a role in more remote areas or confined populations within a high -resource country, particularly if there is a substantial community burden of TB, and the available diagnostic infrastruc ture is limited. A study is currently underway to examine the role of Xpert in Aboriginal com munities in the Canadian Arctic . Preliminary findings support a potential role for the new technology in this remote setting, where there is limited on -site labora tory capacity (Personal communication G. Alvarez) (3). Furthermore, Xpert may be useful in an i npatient setting, where patients typically present later in their disease. In this setting, Xpert may also reduce the time in respiratory isolation for patients suspected fo r having TB, and thus result in cost -savings (164, 165) In summary, we found that the impact of Xpert testin g in a low -incidence, high -resource setting is limited. These findings underscore a recommendation in the recently updated Canadian TB Standards which allows the use of Xpert MTB/RIF in laboratories, but cautions that the use of Xpert should not replace co nventional smears and cultures, and recommends that all Xpert results should be confirmed by routine smears and cultures (149) . 82 Chapter 5: Cost -effectiveness of molecular diagnostic test for tuberculosis for use in settings of low drug resistant tuberculosis 5.1 Preface Loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is the basis of a NAAT method, which a commercial version, the LoopampTM MTBC Detection Kit (TB -LAMP), can extract and amplify Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific DNA less than 2 hours at 67\u00b0C. The amplified product is detected and quantified by its turbidity, visualised by inspection or under ultraviolet (UV) light (Appendix D, Figure A1). Earlier studies have shown TB -LAM P's diagnostic performance to be equivalent to Xpert when performed in LMICs with high TB burden (166) . The low infrastructural requirement, equipment cost, and relative simple and contamination - free procedures mak e this test potentially suitable for large -scale implementation at peripheral microscopy laboratories in low resource settings where existing molecular tests, including Xpert, may not be used. In this manuscript, we compare the cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP for diagnosing pulmonary TB to that of existing diagnostic strategies (e.g. sputum smear microscopy, followed by clinical diagnosis). The comparison was performed by a simulated decision analytic model using a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients clin ically suspected of having pulmonary TB in 2 medium to high TB incidence countries with low rifampin resistance (multi -drug resistance TB prevalence). We assess two diagnostic strategies for TB -LAMP assay implementation: as a replacement test or an add -on test to sputum smear microscopy. Results from this study have been presented to the WHO as the primary health economic evidence for the WHO policy and guideline development of use of this test. 83 5.2 Manuscript Cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP assay for the diagnosis Frank Cobelens4,5, Anja H. van't Hoog4,5 Affiliations 1.

Tokyo, Japan) based on nucleic acid amplification technique (NAAT) for detection of Mycobacteria tuberculosis Though expensive compared to sputum smear microscopy, ea se of use, low equipment cost and maintenance, and better diagnostic performance might make this assay potentially suitable for use in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure. Methods: We used decision analytic modelling to simulate a cohort of pat ients diagnosed with TB in settings where Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing is not offered, parameterized for two countries with low multi -drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR -TB prevalence) with high and low TB -HIV co -infection: Malawi and Vietnam. We strategies for sputum smear microscopy add -on test to SSM in smear negative patients) to the base case algorithm with SSM followed by clinical diagnosis in those patients with negative SSM. Results: In both Malawi and Vi etnam, both of the TB -LAMP scenarios improved case detection rates to between 74 -76% and 88 -90%, respectively, compared to the base -case scenario rates of 59% and 82%. The incremental cost per disability adjusted life years (DALY) for the TB -LAMP replaceme nt for SSM strategy was between $41 and $131, which was higher than that of the add -on scenario at $39 and $123 in Malawi and Vietnam, respectively. Both strategies were cost -effective when comparing to the World Health Organization (WHO) willingness -to-pay (WTP) threshold levels. These conclusion did not change in a range of sensitivity analyses performed. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that TB -LAMP is potentially a cost -effective alternative to the base case of SSM plus clinical diagnosis in settings w here Xpert is not available or is highly expensive to implement. However, given TB -LAMP's lack of capacity to detect DR - TB, financial constraints in low income countries, and emergence of novel automated point - of-care molecular tests for TB, policy makers must cautiously evaluate operational and financial feasibility prior to introducing this technology. 85 Introduction Despite a decline in the global tuberculosis (TB) incidence, TB remains one of the most significant infectious disease problems globally. I n 2013, an estimated 9 million people developed TB, 1.1 million of whom were co -infected with the human immune -deficiency virus (HIV), with more than 1.5 million dying of the disease (2). An estimated one -third of these cases went undiagnosed or unreported, partially due to shortcomings of conventional diagnostic tests, but also poor diagnostic and health care coverage for patients suspected o f TB. Currently, sputum smear microscopy (SSM) is the most widely used method by National TB Programs (NTPs) in resource limited settings due to the low cost of the technique and the minimal laboratory infrastructure required. However, performance of this century -old test is highly dependent on the level of training and types of microscopy equipment available (167) . Molecular assays based on amplification techniques (NAAT) as \"game changing\", cost -effective solution for TB diagnosis (1). Since the WHO endorsement, unprecedented efforts have been made for its global scale -up (13), particularly in high TB burden settings. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is an automated NAAT, and case detection and rifampicin resistance detection are both included in the cartridge. However, the current diagnostic coverage Xpert have been limited to intermediate ( district ) level laboratories or tertiary care settings, reducing its potential impact on delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB. Furthermore, many low -income countries are unable to afford the Xpert MTB/RIF test, and are still reliant on smear microscopy (168) . A lower cost molecular assay that can performed at the microscopy center level has therefore been identified as a priority by many stakeholders (169) . Another type of novel molecular amplification method, loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (170, 171) is a simple and highly specific, closed -tube NAAT techni que that does not require complex laboratory equipment or infrastructure. A commercially available version, the LoopampTM MTBC Detection kit (TB -LAMP) by Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. is a contamination resistant kit (166, 170, 171) , which has a promising operational feasibility in high TB burden, low resource settings, and is particularly targeted towards use in peripheral microscopy laboratories (172) . Though a manual assay, TB -LAMP procedures are simple, is contamination -free and requires less than two hours to perform. 86 Likewise, while lacking drug resistance testing, its minimal maintenance and infrastructure requirements could make TB -LAMP a cost -favorable and performance -optimized alternative to smear microscopy in settings where affordability is an issue, where the practicality of Xpert is limited, or where drug resistant TB is not of significant concern. Therefore, t he main objective of this study was to assess the cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP as a replacement for SSM or as an add -on test to SSM in smear negative patients, compared to the standard of care in settings where Xpert testing coverage is limited. In such settings, TB diagnosis is limited to SSM followed by clini cal diagnosis for patients suspected of new infection, and culture/ drug susceptibility testing (DST) for those TB patients at increased risk of MDR). We chose settings in two countries with a relatively low Multi -Drug Resistant (MDR) -TB burden - Vietnam an d Malawi - to represent distinct scenarios with respect to TB-burden, HIV -TB co -infection, and cost. Our analysis took the perspective of public TB service provider. 87 Methods Diagnostic scenarios We compared two diagnostic scenarios that include TB -LAMP against a base case. In the base case, each presumptive TB patient submits two sputum specimens for examination by using Zhiel Neelsen (ZN) staining method. If positive, TB treatment was started. If negative, procedures for clinical diagnosis of smear -negative TB follow ed, which may include chest X -ray (Vietnam) and a course of broad -spectrum antibiotics (Malawi & Vietnam) , in addition to clinical judgement (Malawi & Vietnam) . In all strategies, conventional culture -based (liquid culture) drug suscepti bility testing (DST) was assumed for all diagnosed TB patients who had previously been treated for TB, and therefore at high risk for drug -resistance (173) . In the first alternative scenario (\"add with -LAMP added to microscopy), presumptive patients with smear negative results had a single TB - LAMP test done, followed by clinical diagnosis if TB -LAMP is negative. In the second scenario (\"replacement\" strategy), all presumptive TB patients received a single TB -LAMP test on sputum instead of SSM. Model structure and assumptions We dev eloped a deterministic decision -analytic simulation model (Figure 1) based on a previously described cost -effectiveness analysis model for Xpert (1). We simulated a cohort of 10,000 presumptive TB patients (patients presenting with prolonged cough with or without systemic or other symptoms sugges tive of pulmonary TB) through the diagnostic pathway and TB treatment; each step was governed by specified probabilities. The simulated cohort was stratified by history of TB treatment (new versus previously treated patients), HIV status (positive versus n egative), and TB drug resistance (drug susceptible versus multi -drug resistant (MDR) -TB). Costs for diagnosis and treatment were assigned to each decision pathway , and number of patients, total costs, and disability -adjusted live -years (DALYs) averted were estimated for each outcome. Analyses were done using TreeAge ProTM 2015 Software (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown MA, USA). 88 Model parameters and assumptions Key model parameters are shown in Table 1 and in the Appendix E. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of TB -LAMP were based on the systematic review presented to the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Group for TB -LAMP (174) . Based on 13 studies, the overall pooled sensitivity was 78% and spec was 98% for TB -LAMP assay. In comparison, the overall sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF were 89% and 99%, based on a Cochrane review of 27 studies (42). The model was parameterized for two distinct settings in low MDR -TB countries with varied Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) prevalence among TB patients: Vietnam (low HIV prevalence) and Malawi (high HIV pre valence). Relevant proportions of TB patients who were 1) new or previously treated presumptive TB patients, 2) HIV positive and negative, and 3) MDR and drug -susceptible (DS) were sourced from WHO annual country reports (175) . Other key parameters were adopted from the parameters used in Vassall et al, 2011 (1). With respect to our model assumptions, we assumed that 1 ) the proportion of smear -negative TB cases is determined by a fixed ratio of smear -negative to smear -positive that only depends on HIV status, 2) the probability of HIV infection is independent of re -treatment status and the probability of MDR -TB is indep endent of HIV status, 3) persons with TB who are not diagnosed for TB at their initial effort return after 3 months and undergo the same diagnostic scenario. The rates of death, self -cure, and conversion from smear -negative to smear -positive during these 3 months were taken from the literature (Appendix E). These assumptions are applicable to all scenarios/strategies in our model. 89 Figure 1. Simplified deterministic decision analytic model. 90 Concerning the diagnostic scenarios, clinical diagnosis of smea r-negative TB (clinical evaluation, antibiotic trial, and/or chest X -ray (CXR) if applicable) was treated as a single diagnostic procedure with fixed test performance characteristics, as in our earlier model (1). As diagnostic performance data of clinical diagnosis were not available for Vietnam and Malawi, we referred to the data from our Xpert model (1). In that model, clinical diagnosis performance in Uganda and India was based on that the level of utilization of CXR, with India and Uganda representing low and high CXR utilization. In Vietnam, CXR is a critical component of clinical d iagnosis of TB (personal communication with Dr. Nhung, NTP manager) , therefore, we assumed that clinical diagnosis performance would be analogous to the Ugandan scenario in the Xpert model. Contrastingly, in Malawi, CXR is not readily available for routine evaluation of TB patients, thus, corresponding to the Indian scenario from the Xpert model (1).

Model inputs: cohort composition and diagnostic parameters, by country For patient treatment outcomes, we assumed three possible states - cure, failure, and death - where these treatment outcome probabilities were differentiated by initial patient category (new vs. previously treated) and treatment regimen (first -line category I or II, second -line) based on the data available from the published literature. With regard to drug resistance, the model assumed that there were only two states: drug susceptible and MDR -TB. All cultures and DST are assumed to be on liquid culture media using Mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) and Ba ctec 960 equipment. Patients awaiting conventional DST results are started on first -line treatment, and switched to second -line treatment after 12 weeks if the DST shows MDR -TB. 92 DALYs were calculated using the standard DALY formula with 3% discount rate (69) and were based on age at presentation as observed in the TB -LAMP demonstration study sites (Vietnam and Mal awi). Disability weights were taken from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (179) ; survival estimates after TB treatment with and without HIV infection were taken from the literature (see A ppendix E for full list and references). The DALY calculations assumed that if TB is left untreated, disability is due to TB, and assumed that all TB patients co-infected with HIV receive lifelong highly activ e antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Cost parameters All diagnostic costs parameters are presented in Table 1 and were based on the results from a separate cost -analysis study conducted at the same study sites (176) . Costs of diagnostics include following costs: cost of specimen transport, laboratory process, repeat testing due to contamination, and reporting. The primary per -test cost estimate for TB -LAMP assay was based on a weighted average per -test cost, assuming TB -LAMP is implemented at all peripheral (microscopy) laboratories in each respective country. The weights were base d on the assumed distribution of peripheral laboratories in the TB laboratory network with low (60%), medium (30%), and high (10%) workloads. These workload levels were represented by average annual SSM testing volume of 1,000, 3,000, and 5,000 smears. Hig h and low estimates of the weighted average per -test cost were calculated by varying the distribution of laboratories with low (between 50 -70%), medium (25 -35%), and high (5 -15%) workloads. Costs for treatment of DS and MDR -TB were based on the health ser vices costs for TB treatment reported in a systematic review (178) . Malawi and Vietnam were considered as low-income and lower -middle income countries, respectively. These estimates included costs of hospitalization, outpatient visits, anti -TB drugs, and other provider costs (e.g. start -up costs, treatment supervision, staff and training, contact tracing, supplies and transportation). For the first -line category 2 treatment (for those previous TB patients whose diagnostics results indicate DS -TB), we assumed th at the cost is 130% (based on proportional increase in treatment duration compared to category 1 treatment) of the DS -TB treatment cost reported in the same review. As we used the perspective of a TB services provider, costs of HAART was not evaluated in o ur model. All costs were reported in 2014 US$ with local costs converted based on the average UN operational exchange rate for 2014 (180). Where applicable, all capital costs were annualized using a standard discount rate of 3% (69). 93 Sensitivity analysis Prior to conducting sensitivity analysis, we first constructed a tornado diagram to determine the order of influence on our primary cost -effectiveness estimate. This was done by varying the parameters with the degree of uncertainty obtained from the literature or other sources. When such data were not available, we varied these values at 75% and 125% of the original parameter estimate used for the primary cost -effectiveness estimate. Next, we performed a series of one -way sensitivity analyses on h ighly influential variables to assess the robustness of our model results. For diagnostic accuracy parameters (e.g. clinical diagnosis), we varied the sensitivity and specificity in opposite directions across the reported range of accuracy values, given th e trade -off between the two values (1). We conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA, Monte Carlo simulation, 10,000 iterations) to generate a 95% confidence interval around our primary cost -effectiveness estimate, based on the uncertainty range of all parameters included in our analysi s. This was done by randomly sampling each of the parameters used in our model, based on their respective distributions. (1) We also conducted scenario analysis to test cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP \"add -on\" and \"replacement\" scenarios to SSM in settings where Xpert is implemented as part of the routine diagnostic algorithm. In the base -case scenario in this analysis, Xpert is an initial test (replacement of SSM) for those at risk of MDR -TB and an add -on test only to new presumptive TB patients who are HIV positive and with negative smear result. Therefore, TB-LAMP scenarios are applicable only in patients who would receive SSM as an initial test (new presumptive TB patients). As Xpert per -test cost varies significantly with GeneXpert equipment utilization, we assumed that Xpert is placed at high t hroughput laboratories (intermediate level laboratory with daily workload of between 10 and 14 test). Results In both Malawi and Vietnam, both TB -LAMP scenarios improved case detection rates to between 74 -76% and 88 -90%, respectively, compared to the bas e-case scenario rates of 59% and 82% in each country (Table 2). While TB -LAMP is not capable of detecting DR -TB per se, improved diagnostic sensitivity over SSM marginally improved MDR -TB case detection rate as well. This was due to the increased sensitivi ty of TB -LAMP through which it detected more DR -TB cases. The diagnostic cost per TB case detected ranged between $133 -161 for 94 the TB -LAMP add -on and $131 -174 for the replacement strategies, whereas the cost for the base case diagnosis ranged between $70 -87. The incremental cost per additional TB case detected between the add -on and replacement strategies against the base case were considerably higher in Vietnam ($1015 vs $1484) than Malawi ($337 vs. $413), mainly attributable to the differences in assumpti ons on the performance of clinical diagnosis.

Cohort, cases detected, total cohort costs, and costs per TB case detected Cost-utility (DALYs) analysis results of the two TB -LAMP strategies are presen ted in Table 3. The cost per DALY averted increased in both TB -LAMP scenarios versus the base case (from $23 to $27 in Malawi and $35 to $40 in Vietnam). The replacement scenario resulted in slightly lower total DALYs averted, but with higher total cost co mpared to the add -on scenario. The incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the TB -LAMP replacement for SSM scenario was between $41 and $131, which was higher than that of the add -on scenario at $39 and $123 in Malawi and Vietnam, respectively. Bot h the add -on and replacement scenarios are well below the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 1 times the per capita gross domestic product ($255 - Malawi; $2052 - Vietnam) or gross national income ($250 - Malawi; $1890 - Vietnam) (181) . 95 Country Scenario Total Cost Total DALYS Cost per DALY ICER compared to base case, mean Monte Carlo Simulation ICER, median (2.5,97.5) Malawi Base Case 510606 21800 23 LAMP add -on 752275 28073 27 39 41 (29, 61) LAMP replacement 753090 27708 27 41 45 (31, 69) Vietnam Base Case 935482 27110 35 LAMP add -on 1135705 28744 40 123 145 (69, 294) LAMP replacement 1138067 28653 40 131 153 ( 70, 489) Table 3. Cost per DALY (US$ 2014) The results of the PSA are also shown in the same table (Table 3) and both strategies remained cost -effective against respective WTP threshold for each country. Figure 2 shows an illustration of the probability o f cost -effectiveness of both strategies against a range of the WTP threshold; the curve shows that the add -on strategy is slightly more favorable over the replacement strategy at lower thresholds. Deterministic one and two way sensitivity analyses results also showed that both TB -LAMP strategies were consistently cost -effective with all uncertain ranges tested producing ICER within the WTP threshold, for all settings. Of the deterministic sensitivity analysis results, accuracy of clinical diagnosis most sig nificantly influenced the ICER for both TB -LAMP strategies (Figure 3). Though they remained within the WTP threshold, at lower specificity (minimum 0.64) and higher sensitivity ranges (maximum 0.80), the cost -effectiveness of both TB -LAMP strategies in com parison to the base case reduces, and the ICERs increase by more than 5 times the primary ICER estimate. Changes in per -test cost based on different distributions of low, medium, and high workload peripheral laboratories did not influence the ICER no more than 15% of the primary estimate. A selection of key one or two way sensitivity analyses results are show in Figure 3. 96 Figure 2. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.

Sensitivity of our model for varied A. accuracy of clinical diagno sis, B. sputum smear microscopy in HIV positive patients, and C. per -test cost of TB -LAMP. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis varies inversely with specificity (range, 8 - 80%). ICERs are reported in US$ 2014. 97 In our scenario sensitivity analysis, ICER for both the add -on and replacement strategies was higher in settings where Xpert is implemented as a routine diagnostic test compared to the those observed in the non -Xpert base case settings. However, these ICER estimates were within the WTP threshold, suggesting that a combined TB -LAMP and Xpert testing strategy could be a cost -effective strategy in these two countries. When comparing directly between the add -on and replacement strategies, the ICER for the replacement against the add -on strategy was con siderably higher than the WTP threshold for Vietnam. This suggest that there is little incremental value for the replacement strategy over the add -on in Vietnam. With respect to case -detection, we found that a combined Xpert and TB -LAMP strategy increased case-detection; in the add -on strategy, the % of cases detected was between 96 -97% in both Malawi and Vietnam. These results are presented in Table 4. 98 Table 4. Scenario sensitivity analysis. TB -LAMP add -on and replacement strategy compared against ba se case with Xpert as a routine diagnostic test (HIV positive and smear negative, previously treated TB patients at risk of MDR -TB). Per -test cost for Xpert varied according to the placement level in the health care system (Xpert at Intermediate Lab vs. at Peripheral Lab) where costs were higher for Xpert tested at peripheral Lab.

Our model suggests that the use of the TB -LAMP assay increased the TB case detection rate (by 6 -15%) and averted DALYs (by 6 -28%). Comparing our ICER estimates to the WHO WTP threshold levels (GDP per capita), both strat egies were highly cost-effective compared to the base case of using SSM followed by clinical diagnosis (69). We found that there were minimal differences in cost -effectiveness between the two TB - LAMP strategies, though the cost -effectiveness of the add -on strategy was more favorable in both settings. Our sensitivity analyses, including the PSA, demonstrated robust ness of our model results where all analyses results showed that the use of TB -LAMP assay in Malawi and Vietnam is cost-effective. As with other cost -effectiveness analyses of molecular diagnostic tests (e.g. Xpert) (1, 72, 182, 183) , our ICER estimate was highly dependent on the accuracy of clinical diagnosis; however, our estimates remained within the WTP threshold levels in both countries. Other factors, such as per -test cost of TB -LAMP assay, increased (reflective fluorescent microscopy methods), or costs of TB and MDR - TB treatment, that varied in our analyses did not influence our cost -effectiveness assessment of TB -LAMP assay. In regards to the costs, diagnostic cost estimat es were based on bottom - up micro costing method using time and motion study (184) . Per-test cost estimates reflected a complete diagn ostic process and were calculated for varied levels of operational characteristics, where these estimates were most influenced by the laboratory's diagnostic workload (cost analysis study). In our scenario sensitivity analysis, we found that TB -LAMP assay can also potentially be cost-effective in settings where Xpert tests are being offered under the routine diagnostic algorithm. Compared to the non -Xpert scenario (primary analysis), ICER for the two TB - LAMP strategies were considerably higher, with ICER e stimates > 70% of our primary estimate. In the case of Vietnam, TB -LAMP replacement strategy was not found to be cost - effective when compared directly to the add -on strategy as the baseline, with ICER beyond the WTP threshold (ICER 7078). These findings su ggest that TB -LAMP may be most cost -100 effect ive when used in addition to SSM, particularly for presumptive TB patients whose SSM results are negative. Our findings are subject to several limitations. First, our model is a greatly simplified illustration of TB diagnosis and management, which in reality, is a much complex and dynamic process (72). Our assessment of the varied accuracy of clinical diagnosis is reflective of only a small part of the realities faced at each clinic. For example, as found in a randomized control study of Xpert in South Africa (66), any potential benefit of improved diagnostic performance can be negated by wide practice of empirical treatment. Furthermore, as shown in our results, diagnostics are a small (less than 30% of the total cost) component of the complete hea lth care process of patients investigated and treated for TB. Likewise, relying on diagnostic accuracy parameters to project costs and patient relevant outcomes (e.g. DALYs) is likely to over -estimate potential cost -effectiveness of TB -LAMP. Secondly, due to the lack of relevant data in our study settings, we did not assess the impact of reduction in diagnostic delay on treatment, patient health outcomes, and TB transmission. Additionally, our analysis was limited to the health systems perspective and TB d iagnosis and treatment at the public sector. A modeling study for India incorporating these factors has shown that a public -private mixed implementation strategy of a new diagnostic test for TB (e.g. Xpert) can considerably influence the impact of new diag nostics (141) . Furthermore, rapid NAATs have been shown to considerably reduce both diagnostic and therapeutic delays (Sohn et al., unpublished systematic review results) and may potential ly influence healthcare seeking behaviors. Moreover, given the evidence that delays experienced by presumptive TB patients were attributable to potentially unnecessary repeated visits at the primary care level (6, 32, 85) , it is likely that inclusion of patient costs and assessment in the complete societal perspective would further favor rapid diagnostic tests such as TB -LAMP. Thirdly, we rely on the annual per capital GDP (or GNI) as the WTP threshold per standard practice in evaluating cost -effectiveness when costs are projected against health outcome estimates such as DALYs (69). When these WTP thresholds are compared to ICERs calculated based on more direct and meaningful outcomes of diagnostic test performance (e.g. improved case detection), the same cost -effectiveness conclusion may not hold. Furthermore, it is importa nt to note that a cost -effective strategy does not translate to a strategy that is affordable or sustainable (1, 72) . We have addressed these issues in a separate 101 cost and affordability assessment of TB -LAMP and fo und that nationwide implementation of TB-LAMP at all peripheral level laboratories can account for a considerable portion (more than 10%) of the total annual TB budget (176) . In the case of Malawi, these costs were approximately 17% of the total projected budget for the national TB control program. Considering that a large propor tion of the annual national TB budgets in high TB -burden, resource -limited settings rely on external donor funding and highly setting specific, it is important to evaluate potential implications of the implementation of TB -LAMP on resource mobilization and financial sustainability post -implementation prior to making national level policy decisions. Conclusion Our model results demonstrate that TB -LAMP is potentially a cost -effective alternative to the base case of SSM + clinical diagnosis in settings where Xpert is not available or is highly costly to operate. Of the two strategies evaluated, using LAMP as an add -on test to patients with negative SSM results was consistently more cost -effective compared to the replacement strategy in all levels of our analy ses. However, given TB -LAMP's lack of capacity to detect DR-TB, financial resource constraints at each country, and emerging POC molecular tests for TB, policy makers must cautiously evaluate operational and financial feasibility prior to introducing this technology to their respective countries. 102 Chapter 6: Summary & Conclusion 6.1 Summary of results Diagnostic research is a n important area of study that requires a highly multi -disciplinary approach to evaluate a test's accuracy, applicability and feasibility, and clinical and economic impact. Although Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay has revolutionized the field of TB diagnostics research , with some studies now evaluating impact beyond test accuracy, the vast majority of evidence is still limited to th e realm of diagnostic performance. As TB point -of- care (POC) molecular tests emerge from development to field testing, it is imperative to address current knowledge gaps in the diagnostics field, and ultimately provide guidance on future research methods t hat could better inform policy decisions. Therefore, my thesis employed a multi -disciplinary approach in evaluating current molecular diagnostic tests for TB in three key areas of diagnostic research - synthesis of the evidence regarding the impact of NAAT s on reducing time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB, assessment of test performance and feasibility of POC Xpert test in a low incidence setting, and economic evaluation of a novel molecular assay implemented as a replacement or add -on test to sputu m smear microscopy at the peripheral microscopy centers. In my first manuscript (Chapter 3), I systematically reviewed the comparative impact of the WHO -approved nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) on improving diagnostic and therapeutic delays for TB . First, I developed a revised conceptual framework in defining time delays in TB patient care. This was used to qualitatively and quantitatively summarize diagnostic and therapeutic delays of diagnosis and management of TB patients in situations with and without use of NAATs. This review of 39 identified studies found that time delays in diagnosis and treatment of both drug -susceptible (DS) and drug -resistant (DR) forms of TB were reduced when NAATs were used for diagnosis and clinical management of TB pat ients. However, the magnitude and significance of the delay assessment varied considerably in sub - group analyses due to heterogeneity observed amongst the studies included. While studies represented a wide range of settings, a large proportion of this rese arch was concentrated in the African region, mostly in South Africa, limiting generalizability of the study findings. Considerable variations in methodological approaches exist in publications evaluating time delays, from discrepancies in defining time com ponents to statistical methods used in evaluation of time delay impact; this was likely because the majority of studies' primary 103 objectives were to test performance evaluation, and time delay assessment was evaluated as a secondary outcome; additionally, t his assessment was mostly based on retrospective reviews of medical chart and records. Lastly, a quality assessment framework was proposed to not only evaluate the quality of time estimates reported, but also to provide guidance on future research evaluati ng time delays in clinical care. Based on the proposed criteria, I found that a majority of studies lacked well -defined frameworks and methods for evaluating time delays, limiting comparability and generalizability of study findings. In my second manuscri pt (Chapter 4), I assessed diagnostic performance and feasibility of a POC Xpert testing strategy in a cohort of patients suspected of TB infection in a specialized TB clinic in Montreal, Canada, that is, in a high resource, low TB incidence setting. In contrast to earlier findings, I found that Xpert's performance and potential impact in such settings was relatively limited, largely as a result of its lower sensitivity in a context of less prevalent disease and highly efficient diagnostic algorithms and cl inical operations. More specifically, the considerably low sensitivity of Xpert in diagnosing smear -negative TB undermines its applicability as a rapid rule -out POC test and impact on patient care, given the availability of culture results and highly train ed physicians in the diagnosis and care of TB patients. Altogether, this study shows that in low TB incidence settings, Xpert results should be made use of with caution for clinical management of TB patients, and all Xpert results be confirmed by conventio nal routine diagnostics. In my third manuscript, I used decision analytic modeling methods to evaluate the cost - effectiveness of TB -LAMP assay, a rapid and simple molecular test that can be implemented in peripheral microscopy centers in resource limited s ettings. Two distinct diagnostic strategies - TB-LAMP assay used as a replacement for or as an add -on test evaluated against a baseline strategy of SSM followed by clinical diagnosis in patients with negative SSM in two low MDR -TB prevalence settings, Malawi and Vietnam. The model results suggest that use of TB-LAMP assay to supplement or replace SSM in these settings improves case -detection and health outcomes, measured by the number of DALYs averted. Evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of both intervention strategies against the WHO willingness to pay (WTP) threshold implies that both TB -LAMP strategies are highly cost -effective, with our range of sensitivity analysis results indicating robustness of this initial conclusion. As modeling studies are a way of identifying important gaps in research, this study demonstrates 104 the importance of understanding the impact of clinical diagnosis, health system operations and effec tiveness, and patients' healthcare seeking behaviors on cost and cost -effectiveness of novel diagnostics and interventions in resource limited settings. 6.2 Strengths and Limitations My systematic review (manuscript 1) is the first review to assess , post-WHO endorsement, the impact of NAATs on reducing time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB. Key strengths of this study include use of an extensive search strategy and a critical and complete assessment of delays (both qualitative and quantitative) asso ciated with both DS and DR -TB, which is based on a detailed conceptual framework evaluating time delay impact of TB diagnostic tests. The conceptual framework for defining time delay components and assessing quality of time delay estimates used in this st udy can serve as a guideline for future research evaluating time delay impact. Conversely, lack of individual patient data on time delay estimates limit methodologies used for quantitative assessment. Thus, while the quality assessment criteria is based on sound epidemiological and statistical principles, it was not developed based on validated tools. My primary research study (manuscript 2) is the first study in Canada of Xpert MTB/RIF assay and one of the first studies in a low TB burden setting. This st udy was not limited to evaluating diagnostic performance, but instead also assessed potential impact beyond diagnosis, particularly in reducing diagnostic and treatment delays. It is also one of the first studies to explore applicability and feasibility of POC testing strategies using Xpert. Key limitations of this study include the low generalizability of findings to settings that differ from a high resource, highly specialized TB clinic. Furthermore, due to the lack of Xpert's regulatory approval for use in Canada at the time of this study, the impact assessment was based on a hypothetical 'would have been' scenario; additionally, other impact further downstream of diagnosis was not evaluated. In my final manuscript (manuscript 3), I developed a decision analytic model that was based on a well -established diagnostic cost -effectiveness analysis model (I actively contributed in the development of the original model). It is the first economic evaluation of a TB -LAMP assay, which was supplemented with setting -specific epidemiologic data that represented two distinct types of high TB -burden, low resource settings. An additional strength of this study is its use of highly detailed economic cost analysis results that reflect a range of different test roll -out 105 scenarios. Furthermore, the robustness of the main study results are supported by a wide range of sensitivity analyses that include probabilistic and scenario sensitivity analyses. There are several limitations in this study. First, my decision analytic model is a much simplified illustration of the complex TB diagnosis management that is observed in high TB -burden, resource poor settings. Second, it is also a model that predicts clinical and patient impact largely based on diagnostic performance (sensitivity a nd specificity). Lastly, the model did not incorporate benefits and impact of reduced timed delays on treatment and patient health outcomes, or disease transmission due to lack of relevant setting specific data. 6.3 Implications & directions for future res earch The range of studies that comprise of my doctor al thesis provide critical and comprehensive evidence of the impact of new diagnostic strategies beyond test accuracy; this kind of evidence is now required for policy and guideline development for bodie s such the World Health Organization (WHO). My studies also help improve research methodologies used to evaluate tests' impact beyond accuracy, and highlight important areas and directions of future research in TB diagnostics. Specifically, my systematic review (manuscript 1) is the first review that critically assessed the impact of post WHO -policy implementation of new diagnostic tools on effective reduction of time delays in TB. My review highlights important limitations in current research methods in e valuating the effect of diagnostic interventions on time delays and provides an improved conceptual framework so that future research in this area can produce comparable and high quality evidence. Subsequently, the qualitative and quantitative evidence gen erated from this study support the important idea that limited improvement in time delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB is highly attributable to factors associated with health systems operations as well as physician and patient behaviors. Likewise, it is clear that future TB diagnostic research must evaluate these factors so that the impact of novel molecular TB diagnostics may be optimized. Secondly, my primary research study addressed an important gap in research surrounding test accuracy and impact of Xpert MTB/RIF used as a POC test in low incidence settings. Its documented limited impact and performance underscore the recommendation in the Canadian TB standards that use of Xpert should not replace current laboratory practice for diagnosis of TB in settings with low incidence and highly effective clinical operations. Assessment of 106 feasibility of POC testing highlighted important considerations for biosafety and logistical issues that future POC tests must consider, and provides directions for future research into the applicability of Xpert in more remote Canadian settings where testing capacity is highly limited. I did not evaluate cost and cost -effectiveness of Xpert or similar technology on TB patient care in these study settings; however, these are critical areas of research to follow up on that will provide evidence for policy development in high resource settings. In my final research manuscript (manuscript 3), I highlight the importance of health economic impact evaluations as part of diagnostic research where evaluation of the epidemiological impact of an intervention against economic costs is an important prerequisite for sound policy decision making. The results from this research provided important health economic evidence to the WHO policy an d guideline development for TB -LAMP assay. Cost-effectiveness analysis alone should not be considered as sufficient evidence for policy decision -making process; although not part of the thesis, my cost -effectiveness analysis was based on a rigorous assessm ent of the economic cost of TB -LAMP implementation strategies, and additional work on affordability of intended implementation strategies was also provided to the WHO as part of a comprehensive economic evaluation package. This study demonstrated that furt her evaluation of the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis and methods for incorporating health systems operational factors (public, private mix) is needed to maximize the benefits of rapid molecular diagnostics in low resource settings. 6.4 Conclusion This doctoral thesis , comprised of three studies, utilized multi -disciplinary research methods and approaches to highlight the variety of diagnostic research processes currently in practice. They range from evaluation of test accuracy to various impact asses sments, including assessment of cost and cost -effectiveness, with an emphasis on complete knowledge translation into practice and policy decision making. Results and findings from my research indicate that more attention is needed in understanding operatio nal, clinical, and patient factors that affect delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB, so that future evaluation and implementation diagnostic of tools for TB can be optimized to reduce burden for resource allocation. Furthermore, it demonstrates that fut ure TB diagnostics research should not only thoroughly evaluate test accuracy, but also be rigorous in evaluating potential impact beyond diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of applicability and feasibility of process innovation is an 107 important area of researc h that can synergistically effect improvement in TB care and the fight against ending TB. Finally, evaluation of cost effectiveness should be supplemented by sound epidemiological and costing data to accurately reflect specific settings and intended health interventions. These research methods should not be limited to generating evidence, but should be employed to identify gaps in research that can better support evidence -based medical decision making processes. 108 Back Matter References 1.

Set-up of testing in TB clinic All of the sample and cartridge preparation was done in the negative -pressure room used for sputum induction (Figure S1 A). The patient was asked to provide a second induced sputum sample in a separate collection container. The sample preparation was done by the test operator in the sputum induction room after the patient left the room. The test ope rator was wearing a fitted N95 mask for personal protection. The operating procedure followed the recommendation for unprocessed sputum samples (185) . The tuberculocida l sample reagent was added to the sample in a 2:1 ratio while still in the negative -pressure room. The sample was incubated for 15minutes. After incubation 2 ml of the sample was transferred to cartridge using sterile pipette. The cartridge was then taken out of the sputum induction room into a room without special ventilation (Figure S1 B), adjacent to the induction room within the TB clinic where the test was run on an open bench on a four -module GeneXpert machine. Figure E1: Sample collection and set u p of GeneXpert in the routine TB clinic setting 128 Appendix D. Sequencing on rpoB gene To determine the basis for the single isolate with discordant results from Xpert and DST rifampin resistance testing, we sequenced the 81 bp hypervariable region of the rpoB gene. Briefly, beginning with bacteria cultured in MGIT vials, DNA was extracted using the reference mycobacterial DNA extraction method (186) . Next, the rpoB hypermutable was AAACCAGATCCGGGTAGGCATG and RPO3R: 59 GTACGGCGTTTCGATGAACCCG, the protocol described by Ahamd et al. (187) . The 381 bp band was confirmed through 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis a nd then sent for Sanger Sequencing at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. The sequence was subsequently aligned to the H37rv reference genome (NC_000962.3) and the reference sequence from Xpert using ClustalW2 (188, 189) . Based on these alignments, a C1534T mutation was identified, corresponding to a true -positive readout by probe A of Xpert (189) . This mutation results in a Pro > Leu substitution at amino acid 511. Figure E2: Time to diagnosis and treatment initiation Outline of the different times it takes to obtain results from smear microscopy, culture and drug-susceptibility testing (DST). Treatment might be started empirically or based on smear - or PCR -result (if positive) or once culture result returns. Treatment might be modified based on a DST result. A positive Xpert result could potentially lead to a reduction of the time to initiation of treatment for drug -sensitive tuberculosis (TB) and in particular for drug -resistant TB if resistance is not suspected. 129 Appendix E.

Treatment outcome probabilities used in the model. 1. Drug susceptible: no multidrug resistance, data based on treatment outcomes among pan-susceptible patients 2. Drug resistant: rifampicin resistance, assumed multidrug resistanc e; data based on treatment outcomes among multidrug resistant patients 3. Patients with drug -susceptible TB treated with second -line regimens are assumed to have similar failure and death rates as patients with MDR -TB, separately for new and previously treate d cases 4. All treatment outcomes adjusted for defaulting and transfer out. 5. Failure rates for HIV -positive patients are assumed to be similar to those for HIV - negative patients, but adjusted downwards for previously treated drug -resistant cases treated with f irst-line category 2 regimen because distribution values for failure and cure would otherwise exceed 1. 6. Death rates for HIV -positive are derived by adding an excess death rate of 0.046 assuming ART (Akksilp 2007, Varma 2009, Abdool Karim 2010). 131 7. The mortali ty of HIV -infected MDR patients treated with first -line regimens is between 72 and 98% without antiretroviral treatment (Wells 2007). We assume antiretroviral treatment is given in conjunction with TB treatment, so this will lead to better survival. In stu dies from Thailand this resulted in about 5 -fold reduction in mortality (Akksilp 2007, Varma 2009). Survival will however be less than when second -line treatment is given, which according to Seung et al. (2009) results in 2 - fold increased mortality compare d to HIV - patients. So we assume a 3 -fold increase in mortality compared to HIV -negative patients (range 2 -4). Similarly we assume a 2 - fold increased death rate for HIV -infected MDR -TB patients treated with second -line regimens. 132 Patient category Probabil ity (range) distribution recovery, HIV -negative 0.10 (0.085 Triangular Table B.
