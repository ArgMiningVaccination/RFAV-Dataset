This mind-body approach blends both Western and Eastern philosophies on healing to create a whole-person-focused approach to mental health and truly holistic care. With Our Clients This mind-body approach combines pills and skills in a way that doesn't just help you find the right pharmaceutical solution but also provides you with strategies that address your development as a person. This customized mind-body strategy gives you the tools you need to navigate daily life with a greater understanding of yourself. As educators and empathizers, we believe that the person comes before the prescription and strive to help you navigate your life and the connection between your brain and your body. This will allow you to grow your relationships with yourself and those you love and will help you bridge the gap between where you are and where you hope to be. With Our Team At ICCC, we know that good supervision drives good clinical outcomes. That's why our whole-person approach extends to the way we interact with our team, the growth-encouraging environment we provide them, and the support channels we make accessible so that they are well cared for personally and professionally. We know that our clients feel safe because the people working here feel safe as well. What sets our team apart from others is the profound difference in our staff culture. Our supervision process is multifaceted and ensures that our staff are cared for, educated, and fully supported every step of the way. We're dedicated to a holistic approach to the care of staff, including interactional supervision in a humanistic environment, a parallel process that allows our clinicians to feel safe and supported in the environment in which they work. This creates a trickle-down effect in which we hold one another accountable for doing what we say we will do while supporting the professional and personal growth of everyone on our team. Fostering that environment not just for clients, but for staff as well, is paramount to the transformative outcomes we provide at ICCC. The ICCC Difference In Action ICCC's mind-body approach permeates all that we do. In our interactions with both one another and our clients, everything is integrated. Process meets the person, and we assist you in achieving your recovery, in your way, at your pace. This life you're creating is meant to be lived on your terms and we use our whole-person approach to your well-being to help you find out what that looks like and to pursue it for yourself. ICCC uses an outpatient plus model. This means that you can receive multimodal aspects of care and not just one form of treatment when you visit us. From medication management to yoga to psychotherapy, you can spend time throughout your week receiving a variety of treatment and personal development modalities. This approach means that you'll have access to far more than your general outpatient practice offers and that's with good reason. Your customized whole-person-focused treatment plan doesn't place you on one of a handful of \"cookie-cutter\" style tracks, as some other practices might. Instead, you collaborate with your clinician to design a personalized treatment plan that meets your needs. ICCC knows that yoga is often a \"work in\" as much as it is a workout and the same is true of the other modalities we use, including meditation. These mind-body approaches have a positive impact on your brain's neuroplasticity (its ability to learn, grow, and change) and so these modalities are just as much brain training as more clinical approaches. ICCC is a bridge between both sides of your brain, allowing your being side (the right brain) to commune more fully with your doing side (the left brain). From breathwork to meditation to yoga to talk therapy, our treatment approaches allow you to walk through the world more peacefully. "}
