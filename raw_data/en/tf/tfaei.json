As sustainability becomes a mainstream topic around the world, with everyone from actors to activists to Instagram influencers talking about it, period care, once again, is often overlooked in the larger conversation. That's a lost opportunity, because lately there has been an explosion of interest, with sustainable period care products flooding the market \u2014 some better than others. Typically, period products create a lot of waste. They are single-use, and are made with plastic or other synthetic and non-biodegradable materials. [Sanitary pads are the most commonly chosen product](https://uthealthaustin.org/blog/period-products) for menstrual hygiene, followed closely by tampons. Estimates are that in the UK alone, roughly [200,000 tons of menstrual waste](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/plastics_unflushables_-_submited_evidence.pdf) are generated every year. When it comes to sustainable period care products, unfortunately, there's a lack of information (and a lot of misinformation) out there. As a consumer, the most easily accessible source for information is probably the brands themselves, but greenwashing is rampant. For example, in 2019 [a university lab tested two pairs of Thinx, one of the most popular period panties, and detected the toxic substance PFAS](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/ask-ms-green/my-menstrual-underwear-has-toxic-chemicals-it). So before you decide to go for a product or brand, do some research. Here are some things you can look out for: Natural materials: Look for products with minimal synthetics like plastics, which are not biodegradable and can last on earth for hundreds of years. [Microplastics in particular are harmful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068600/), both for the environment and for human health. If unavoidable, then look for ones that use [GRS-certified](https://certifications.controlunion.com/en/certification-programs/certification-programs/grs-global-recycle-standard) recycled synthetics. Non-Toxic: Make sure the products don't contain toxins like phthalates, parabens, dioxins, or PFAS. These are oft-restricted substances that [could possibly enter your body through your vagina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3948026/), and in addition, some of these chemicals are possibly carcinogenic or could affect your hormonal health and fertility. Some of these toxins are commonly found in dyes and fragrances, so ensure that the brand is using non-toxic and/or plant-based ones, if any. Also, verify that any claims are backed with certifications like [GOTS or OEKO-TEX](https://ecocult.com/eco-friendly-ethical-sustainable-labels-certifications-clothing-fashion/). Sustainable packaging: The brand should be using [sustainable packaging](https://ecocult.com/sustainable-eco-friendly-zero-waste-biodegradable-compostable-packaging/). Go for FSC-Certified paper over plastic, even if the plastic is recyclable. Make sure the paper is acid-free and is dyed using non-toxic plant-based inks like soy. Another good option is compostable packaging, which has been certified by [BPI](https://bpiworld.org/), [TUV Austria](https://www.tuv-at.be/green-marks/certifications/), or [DIN CERTO](https://www.dincertco.de/din-certco/en/main-navigation/products-and-services/certification-of-products/environmental-field/products-made-of-compostable-materials-for-home-and-garden-composting/). Ethical Production: The brand should be transparent about its supply chain. It should tell you exactly where it's sourcing its materials from. It should be paying its workers a fair wage, and have ethical worker conditions. Look out for fair labor certifications like [SA8000 or Fair Trade USA](https://ecocult.com/eco-friendly-ethical-sustainable-labels-certifications-clothing-fashion/). Impact Work: There is still a shocking lack of access to period products in low-income countries. For example, [over 40% of menstruating girls in Bangladesh](https://www.ircwash.org/sites/default/files/bnhbs.pdf) miss school because they don't have access to adequate period products, and instead use materials like old cloth. Furthermore, not all of these women wash the cloth appropriately before reusing. So it's a big bonus if you choose a brand that is addressing period poverty or menstrual health and education. Luckily, there are more options than ever if you want to switch to more sustainable products that are better for both you and the environment: Period panties Period panties are reusable underwear that you can wear while on your period, without using disposable products like pads or tampons. Depending on how heavy your flow is, you can wear one pair for up to six hours before washing and throw them in the machine with the rest of your load \u2014 just make sure to rinse them with water once before you do. Most brands will have underwear for different absorbency levels based on your flow, and a quiz that helps you determine which pair is best for you. Some people like combining the panties with a liner or tampon on the heaviest day of their flow, but if you have the heavy-absorbency ones you shouldn't need to. If taken care of properly, one pair of period panties can last for six months to two years. I've had mine for about six months, and they're still in great condition. Look for underwear made using [organic and natural materials](https://ecocult.com/sustainable-materials/) such as GOTS certified organic cotton or TENCEL by Lenzing, or certified 100% recycled synthetics like ECONYL. Up until early 2022, all period panties used a small amount of polyester or spandex for stretch and/or in the lining. The amount is minuscule compared to the plastic in pads or tampons with plastic applicators, particularly since the underwear can be used for years, but it means they aren't recyclable or compostable \u2014 you'll have to throw them in the trash when they're done. That changed when Modi See below!

Rather than absorbing the blood like most other products, it collects it and needs to be emptied, rinsed, and reinserted every 6 to 12 hours, depending on your flow. According to multiple brands, one menstrual cup can last for up to ten years. Another mark in their favor is that you only need one per period cycle, as opposed to pads and tampons, and even period panties, which have to be changed regularly through your cycle. Only around 4% of menstrual cups on the market are produced from thermoplastics compared to single-use pads which are usually constructed of 35% plastic, and [6% for tampons](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(19)30111-2/fulltext#seccestitle120). And cups are estimated to have less than [1.5% of the environmental impact](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344919303179) of disposable pads or tampons. It's also worth noting that period cups are very easy to clean, and need less water and soap to wash than period panties. This is especially important if you're living in a drought-prone area, or don't have easy access to clean, running water. Unfortunately, since they're made of silicone, menstrual cups are not compostable, or even easily recyclable. However, there are special services through which you can recycle your cup, such as through the [DivaRecycles](https://divacup.com/divarecycles/?_ga=2.84522713.1533363715.1638544558-389805106.1638544558) program in partnership with [TerraCycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/). Reusable pads Reusable pads are similar in concept to period panties, eliminating the need for disposable pads. You attach them to your everyday underwear with snaps that come on the pad, and then just rinse, wash, and reuse. Look for ones made using GOTS certified cotton or other natural materials. Like period underwear, reusable pads also have a small amount of synthetic fabric in the construction. Organic pads and tampons A number of brands make entirely plant-based and synthetic-free single-use pads and tampons. [According to period care brand TOM](https://www.totm.com/how-to-responsibly-dispose-of-your-period-products-and-the-wrappers/), provided they're 100% natural, they can be composted, or thrown in the bin and will decompose at the landfill. The idea of tossing used pads or tampons in your home compost bin may be a bit icky at first, but as long as you wrap them properly (in biodegradable wrapping which most products will come in), you'll be fine!
