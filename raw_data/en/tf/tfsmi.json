We are happy to support our authors in making their research available to the academic community in this way. We are convinced that to make Open Access work, we need to facilitate constructive communication between researchers, libraries, funding bodies, and publishers and to experiment with new approaches and business models. Why choose Open Access? - Accessibility - research becomes freely available digitally as soon as it is published, while the print version will also be made available for sale. - Discoverability - studies have shown that Open Access publications gain more views, citations and downloads than publications with restricted access. - Compliance - Open Access publication is increasingly required by funding bodies and a Creative Commons license allows authors to easily comply with funder requirements. Why choose Peter Lang Open? - Engagement - increased visibility means more possibilities for public engagement and collaboration. - Rigour - all Open Access publications will benefit from the same rigorous peer review and editorial assessment process as non-OA titles. - Support - Open Access authors receive the full benefit of our marketing and distribution services, including flyer creation, digital and conference promotion, and an individual product page on our site.

Open Access Models at Peter Lang We offer both Gold and Green OA publishing options to our book authors. Gold Open Access Peter Lang offers authors the option to publish their work Gold Open Access for a fee to be paid by funders. With Gold Open Access, your research will be freely available online for others to read, download and share immediately upon publication and without an embargo period. Books are released under the agreed Creative Commons (CC) license. Both your print and Open Access publication will benefit from our marketing, distribution and data management services. The Open Access publication will be discoverable on the Peter Lang website, OAPEN, and national research repositories in collaboration with many research funders. We calculate our Open Access fees individually based on the requested services. Our total fees for Gold are approximately 10,000 CHF / 10,000 EUR / 8,000 GBP, with variations depending on the project and region. Green Open Access We also offer our authors the option to publish their work Green Open Access. In this model, the book is published simultaneously as a print and eBook, and the eBook is released Open Access after an embargo period. We are pleased to offer models and rates to fit the needs of authors in their respective national and research contexts.

Our Open Access Partners Greenlight from Peter Lang Open We are pleased to announce our Open Access pilot project Greenlight in cooperation with Jisc. Peter Lang is a strong advocate for Open Access publication, with over 2,000 Open Access books to date and a strong commitment to continue offering relevant Open Access models. We are convinced that to make Open Access work, we need to facilitate constructive communication between researchers, libraries, funding bodies and publishers and to experiment with new approaches and business models. Greenlight is a collective purchase model that offers institutions the opportunity to grow their lists and support Open Access publication in the Humanities and the Sciences. The package offered includes important monographs by UK authors on medicine, technology, sexuality studies and environmental studies. Participating institutions pay a one-off fee to receive perpetual unlimited multi-user access for the five titles in the package, planned for publication in the course of 2023. - Tiered pricing structure based on Jisc Banding. The fee for large-tier institutions is \u00a3750 for the package, with discounts for small- and medium-tier institutions. - The aim is to release titles Open Access at least one year after publication. - If the funding target is not met, the number of titles published Open Access will be reduced, e.g. if 40% of the target is met, two books will be greenlighted for OA release. - Total funding per collection will depend on the number and tiers of the pledging institutions. - Guaranteed perpetual multi-user access to all titles in the package for pledging institutions, regardless of whether funding has been met. - Pledging dates 1 September 2022 to 31 December 2023. - Announcement of results in early 2024.

Polly Galis, Frank French Feminism: Sex, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Ernaux, Huston and Arcan Explores key French feminist authors' representations of sex, sexuality and the body, focusing on the female body and women's sexual development, identity, experience and desire. Will Slocombe, Emergent Patterns: Artificial Intelligence and the Structural Imagination Examines the ubiquity of representations of AI in contemporary media and culture, with a view towards analysing what these representations reveal about social hopes and fears.
