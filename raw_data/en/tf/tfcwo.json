Its essence lies in an asymmetry \u2014of information, access, status, power, or control. Yet vulnerability is also context - dependent, meaning a person becomes vulnerable to somet hing when placed in a certain situation. While there is widespread agreement that research guidelines should provide protections for those who are vulnerable, there is less consensus on who is encompassed by the term and what protections are appropriate.1 In the United States, regulatory guidelines take a categorical approach to defining vulnerability \u2014 federal protections identify prisoners, children, neonates, human fetuses, and pregnant women as vulnerable populations, and specify additional protections fo r research that includes participants from 1 See Carl H. Coleman, Vulnerability as a Regulatory Category in Human Subject Research , 37 J. L. MED. & ETHICS 12, 12 (2008). PARASIDIS -FINAL (UPDATED ) (DO NOT EFTHIMIOS PARASIDIS 115 these groups.2 This Article examines the notion of vulnerability in human subjects research as it applies to members of the armed forces.3 The armed forces maintain a unique and important role in society. As the U nited States Department of Defense ( \"DoD\") indicates, its primary objective is to \"provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of the United States. \"4 An indispensable component of the military mission is military medicine, whose fundamental goal is to conserve the fighting force via preventive medicine and health care for combat -related injuries.5 As science and warfare have evolved, however, military medical personnel have taken on additional responsibilities, including wor k related to the research and development of cutting -edge weaponry.6 According to Brigadier General Dr. Stanhope Bayne -Jones, this has created \"a serious moral and practical problem \" whereby roles and fiduciary duties of military physicians and researchers oftentimes conflict in irreconcilable ways.7 The impact on service members has been striking. In the name of national security, the U.S. military locked service members in gas chambers and exposed them to mustard gas against their will,8 2 See 45 C.F.R . \u00a7 46 (2015). While the statute also states that \"mentally disabled persons \" and \"economically or educationally disadvantaged persons \" are examples of vulnerable populations, the regu lations do not set forth additional protections, or a separate Subpart, specific to these groups. Rather, the Common Rule provides general guidance that directs institutional review boards ( \"IRBs\") to consider protections that \"protect the rights and welfa re of these groups. \" Id. \u00a7 46.111. 3 For purposes of this Article, I use the terms \"members of the armed forces, \" \"service members, \" and \"military personnel \" interchangeably. 4 Our Bottom Line , U.S. DEP'T OF DEF.

I then examine markers of vulnerability for service members. These include military command structure, a nebulous boundary between treatment and research in military settings, informed consent waivers for military personnel, military culture, the predominance of force health priorities over individual heal th concerns, and governmental immunities related to claims by service members for research -related injuries.

Military medical ethics is a growing field, and my goal is to add to the literature by proposing ideas that balance principles of medical ethics, national security, and the rights of service members. I. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS : THE COMMON RULE AND SUBPARTS B-D U.S. guidelines g overning research with human subjects are codified in 45 C.F.R. Part 46, which is titled \"Protection of Human Subjects. \"25 Among these regulations, Subpart A ( \"Basic HHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects \") is often referred to simply as the C ommon Rule.26 Fifteen federal agencies and departments have adopted the Common Rule, including the DoD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( \"VA\").27 Pursuant to Executive Order 12333, the Intelligence community, including the Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\") and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (\"ODNI\"), must adhere to the Common Rule.28 Under the Common Rule, there are three primary mechanisms for protecting research subjects: informed consent; review by an institutional review b oard (\"IRB\"); and institutional assurances of compliance with federal policies.29 Among its provisions, the Common Rule requires that risks to research subjects be minimized, that the selection of research participants be fair, and that risks to participant s be reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits of the research.30 25 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46 (2015). 26 See Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects ( 'Common Rul e'), U.S. DEP'T HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS ., http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/commonrule/index.html (last visited May 18, 2016). 27 See id.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y Additional protections for certain categories of vulnerable populations are codified in Subpart B (pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates), Subpart C (prisoners), and Subpart D (children).31 Some departments and agencies that have adopted the Common Rule have not adopted the additional Subparts via regulation, while others have incorporated the protections of the Subparts via agency policy.32 For example, the DoD and VA have not adopted Subparts B, C, and D by regulation, but have adopted the protections outlined in these Subparts as a matter of policy.33 Via Executive Order, the CIA and Intelligence community are bound by Subparts B, C, and D.34 In contemplating whether, in the con text of human subjects research, service members are a vulnerable population, two general inquires must first be addressed: (1) what activities constitute research with human subjects? and (2) for purposes of human subjects research, what does it mean to b e vulnerable? A. When Do Research Protections Apply? : Distinguishing Medical Treatment from Research with Human Subjects The Common Rule and related Subparts apply solely to research involving human subjects.35 They have no legal significance for the 31 In addition, Subpart E outlines regulations governing the registration of IRBs.

As with many areas in human subjects research, the Belmont Report38 provides a particularly relevan t starting point in distinguishing between medical treatment and research. Published in 1979 by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research ( \"National Commission \"), the Belmont Report is the preeminent normative framework for U.S. guidelines governing human subjects research.39 Drafted in the wake of public disclosure of various research -related scandals \u2014including Tuskegee and the military 's secret LSD, mustard gas, and biological warfare experiments40\u2014the Belmont Report identifies three fundamental ethical principles that underlie research with human subjects: respect for persons; beneficence; and justice.41 The Belmont Report also highlights the distinction between treatment and research, and why this dis tinction is important.42 As the Belmont 36 Id. \u00a7 46.101(e). 37 Id. \u00a7 46.102(d). 38 THE NAT'L COMM'N FOR THE PROT.

Among its provisions, the Nati onal Research Act of 1974 established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research ( \"National Commission \"). One of the National Commission 's mandates was \"to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines which should be followed to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. \" Id. 42 Id.

As bioethicist Baruch Brody explains, the authors of t he Belmont Report struggled with this predicament.45 After all, medicine is both science and art, and innovation in medicine invariably relies upon risk -taking and the ability to contemplate and carry out novel sol utions to unanswered questions. Indeed, at one level, \"every physician is carrying out a small research project when he [or she] diagnoses and treats a patient. \"46 That said, from a regulatory perspective, there must be a meaningful distinction between treatment and research. In the end, the Belmont Report suggests that a medical procedure can be experimental (insofar as the procedure departs from standard care or is innovative), but that implementation of an experimental procedure does not necessarily constitute research.47 At the same time, the Belm ont Report indicates that a \"radically \" new procedure or 43 Id. 44 See, e.g. , Ruth W.

PARASIDIS -FINAL EFTHIMIOS PARASIDIS 123 \"major innovation \" should be the subject of clinical research prior to adoption as medical treatment.48 More recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( \"FDA\") has outlined ten categories that he lp draw the line between treatment and research:49 Clinical Research Medical Treatment Intent Answers specific questions through research involving numerous research volunteers. Addresses the needs of individual patients. Intended Benefit Generally designed and intended to benefit future patients. Intended to benefit the individual patient. Funding Paid for by drug developers and Government agencies. Funded by individual patients and their health plans. Timeframe Depends on research protocols. Requ ires real -time decisions. Consent Requires written informed consent. May or may not require informed consent. Assessment Involves periodic and systematic assessment of patient data. Based on as -needed patient assessment. Protections Protected by government agencies, institutional review boards, professional standards, informed consent, and legal standards. Guided by state boards of medical practice, professional standards, peer review, informed consent, and legal standards. Certainty Tests produc ts and procedures of unproven benefit to the patient. Uses products and procedures accepted by the medical community as safe and effective. Access to Information Considered confidential intellectual property. Available to the general public through product labeling. Release of Findings Published in medical journals, after clinical research ends. Individual medical records are not released to the general public. This FDA guidance provides a robust framework for distinguishing treatment from research.50 Nevertheless, important questions remain at the margins. 48 Id. 49 Clinical Research Versus Medical Treatment , U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN .

HEALTH L. & POL'Y For example, the FDA guidelines do not indicate that medical treatment must be FDA -approved.51 The guidelines also fail to identify how to deal with cases where, with respect to a given med ical intervention, some of the ten categories fall on the side of treatment, while others are more in line with research.52 Moreover, it is not clear whether each category is weighted equally, or if the answers to certain categories are determinative of whe ther an intervention is properly characterized as treatment or research. Although deriving a bright -line rule to distinguish research from treatment may be a fruitless endeavor, identifying whether a particular medical intervention constitutes research or treatment is important for a variety of reasons. These reasons include: (1) providing the patient or research participant with accurate information as to the purpose and goals of the underlying medical intervention; (2) determining who should pay for the i ntervention; and (3) identifying whi ch laws and regulations apply. As to the legal and regulatory regimes, the framework governing medical treatment includes (1) state medical boards (which are responsible for licensing and disciplining providers and healt h care professionals), (2) professional standards of care (established by peer review and expert opinions, and reviewed by courts), and (3) legal doctrines such as informed consent.53 Research is generally governed by the Common Rule and the Subparts of 45 C.F.R. Part 46,54 though 51 See id . 52 See id. 53 See, e.g. , B. Sonny Bal, An Introduction to Medical Malpracti ce in the United States , 467 CLINICAL ORTHOPEDICS RELATED RES. 339 (2009); Clinical Research Versus Medical Treatment , U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN . (Feb. 24, 2016), http://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/ClinicalTrials/ ClinicalvsMedical /default.htm. Please note that the three examples provided in the text do not represent an exhaustive list of laws and regulations governing the practice of medicine. 54 Many institutions voluntarily adopt the Common Rule requirements for all research involving human subjects even thou gh the federal requirements only mandate that, for non - government -funded research, the institution commit to complying with general principles of human subjects research as, for instance, outlined in the Belmont Report. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46 (2015) ; see also CARL H. COLEMAN ET AL ., THE ETHICS AND REGULATION OF RESEARCH WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS (2015). For further reading on the Ebola example, see Timothy M. Uyeki et al., Clinical Management of Ebola Virus Disease in the United States and Europe , 374 NEW ENG. J. MED. 636 (2016). PARASIDIS -FINAL 10:17 AM EFTHIMIOS PARASIDIS 125 FDA guidelines also apply if the research is related to a product under review by the FDA.55 In cases where a medical intervention involves both research and treatment (e.g., access to a non -FDA approved drug to treat a patient with Ebola, where the results will be used to contribute to generalizable knowledge), protocols governing both research and treatment are implicated, and the law places the burden on the participating physicians, institutions, and/or researchers to implement t he relevant procedures and protections.56 B. Defining Vulnerability For decades, protecting vulnerable populations has been a cornerstone of federal guidelines governing research with human subjects.57 According to Carl Coleman, a leading scholar on the ethics and regulation of human subjects research, \"despite the frequency with which the term vulnerability is used, little consensus exists on what it actually means in the context of human subject prote ction\u2014or, more importantly, on how a finding of vulnerability should affect the process of research ethics review. \"58 The Belmont Report notes that \"not every human being is capable of self -determination, \" and further states that, because the capacity for self-determination may be compromised due to \"illness, mental disability, or circumstances that severely restrict liberty, \" some individuals \"are in need of extensive protection. \"59 The Belmont Report also highlights that, throughout history, the benefits a nd burdens of research have not been fairly distributed.60 This notion is particularly relevant to the selection of research subjects: 55 See, e.g. , Regulations , U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN ., http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/ SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/ucm155713.htm#FDARegulations (last updated June 7, 2016). 56 See, e.g. , id. 57 See Kathy L.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y [T]he selection of research subjects needs to be scrutinized in order to determine whether some classes ( e.g., welfare pat ients, particular racial and ethnic minorities, or persons confined to institutions) are being systematically selected simply because of their easy availability, their compromised position, or their manipulability, rather than for reasons directly related to the problem being studied.61 In such circumstances, the Belmont Report indicates that special considerations should be afforded to \"[c]ertain groups, such as racial minorities, the economically disadvantaged, the very sick, and the institutionalized. \"62 While highly influential, the Belmont Report is not a legally binding document.63 Notwithstanding, the report serves as persuasive authority because it is the ethical framework that spawned a thirteen -year process of detailed deliberation and agency rule - mak ing, culminating with the enactment of the Common Rule in 1991.64 Although the concept of vulnerability is a significant component of the ethics and regulation of research with human subjects, the Common Rule does not specifically define the term \"vulnerabl e\" in its list of Definitions.65 Rather, in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.107(a), the regulations note that vulnerable populations include groups \"such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons,\"66 while in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.111 the r egulations define vulnerable populations to include groups \"such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons. \"67 Though it is not clear why there is a discrepancy within the Commo n Rule, it may be due to an inadvertent oversight in drafting. Indeed, in the NPRM published on September 8, 2015, OHRP and HHS proposed to eliminate the discrepancy by amending both sections 61 Id. 62 Id. at 19. 63 45 CFR 46 FAQs , U.S. ., www.hhs.gov/ohrp /humansubjects /guidance/ (last visited Mar.

At the same time, the identification of these five groups signals to IRBs the import ance of closely scrutinizing protocols governing a research study that involves individuals from the groups. The Common Rule dictates that IRBs must ensure that research protocols provide additional protections for studies that may include individuals fro m vulnerable populations.69 For example, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.107(a) states that, \"if an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a vulnerable category of subjects, \" that IRB should consider including \"one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects. \"70 Additionally, under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.111(a)(3), the Common Rule states that, in determining whether the selection of research participants is equitable, IRBs \"should be particularly cognizant of the special proble ms of research involving vulnerable populations. \"71 And, in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.111(b), the Common Rule provides that, as a condition of approval, IRBs must ensure that \"[w]hen some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influenc e . . . additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. \"72 Coupled with the additional protections for vulnerable populations as outlined in the Common Rule, Subparts B, C, and D codify detailed re quirements for research that includes pregnant 68 NPRM, supra note 22, at 54 ,050-51. 69 Some scholars have criticized the Common Rule for not providing sufficient guidance on how to conduct research that includes individuals from vulnerable populations. See, e.g. , Coleman, supra note 1, at 12. 70 45 C.F.R. AM 128 HOUS. J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y women, children, human fetuses, neonates, and prisoners.73 The need for the Subparts highlights a limitation of the Common Rule \u2014 specifically, that it does not provide adequate guidance as to what additional pro tections are needed for vulnerable populations. The supplemental protections, outlined in Subparts B, C, and D, include procedural guidelines addressing membership of IRBs that review research protocols involving vulnerable populations, as well as substant ive guidelines that IRBs must consider in reviewing and monitoring the research.74 For example, in a study involving prisoners, at least one prisoner or prisoner representative must be on the IRB, and a majority of the IRB (excluding any prisoners on the IR B) cannot be associated with the prison.75 Additionally, the risks to prisoners must be commensurate with risks in studies not including prisoners, the decision to participate in research must not affect parole decisions, and the selection of prisoners must be free from coercion, undue influence, or arbitrary interventions by prison staff or other prisoners.76 U.S. guidelines have opted to define vulnerability by categories of individuals, though \"the diversity of the examples makes it difficult to identify what characteristics a group must have to be considered vulnerable. \"77 The group -based classifications have been criticized by many, including President Bill Clinton 's National Bioethics Advisory Commission, which noted that vulnerability \"is sensitive to c ontext, and individuals may be vulnerable in one situation but not in another.\"78 Carl Coleman argues that vulnerability should be conceptualized in three distinct forms \u2014\"consent -based, risk -based, and justice -based\"\u2014the first two require individualized cal culations on specific people in certain situations, while the third necessitates a 73 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 46.201 -46.409.

II. MARKERS OF VULNERABILITY FOR SERVICE MEMBERS88 In many respects, military medicine and research are no different than civilian medicine and research. Military doctors conduct examinations to assess health, admini ster vaccinations for individual and public health goals, and provide treatment for acute and chronic conditions.89 Military clinical researchers must seek and obtain IRB approval for their work and are bound by FDA guidelines for medical products under rev iew by the agency.90 As in non -military settings, military physicians and researchers have fiduciary duties and are obligated to follow accepted standards of care and regulatory protocols.91 85 NPRM, supra note 22, at 53 ,939. 86 Id. at 54 ,050-51. 87 Id. at 53 ,942. 88 Portions of Subsections A, B, C, and F are adapted from Efthimios Parasidis, Emerging Military Technologies: Balancing Medical Ethics and National Security , 47 CASE W.

When placed into context, these areas of divergence represent markers of vulnerability for service members. They include: (1) military command structure; (2) a nebulous boundary between treatment and research in military settings; (3) informed consent wa ivers for military personnel; (4) military culture; (5) the predominance of force health priorities over individual health concerns; and (6) governmental immunities and limitations on tort claims by service members. A. Military Command Structure Command struc ture is embedded in all aspects of the military, and military medicine is no exception.92 Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( \"UCMJ\"), the legal system governing the armed forces, a subordinate officer must obey a lawful order of a superior officer.93 This provision applies in equal force if the order is a split - second, combat -related command given on the battlefield, or an order given on a U.S. base that relates to a medical treatment deemed by officials to be necessary for the good of the armed forc es.94 With respect to the latter, existing regulations do not limit medical -related orders to products approved by the FDA.95 And, on a number of occasions, the DoD has mandated that soldiers submit to non-FDA -approved medical products as a requirement of se rvice.96 92 See Introduction to the U.S. Army Medical Department , ARMY MED., http:// armymedicine.mil /Pages/Introduction -to-the-US-Army -Medical -Department.aspx (July 5, 2016). 93 United States v.

J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y Under the UCMJ, refusal to submit equates to disobeying an order and can result in punitive measures, including reduction in rank, docked pay, jail time, and a dishonorable discharge.97 Sanctions pursuant to this provision are not merely theoretica l. Since the 1990s, the DoD has prosecuted hundreds of service members, including military physicians who have refused administration of medical products that were not approved by the FDA for the use intended by the DoD.98 During the prosecutions, military courts consistently denied requests by soldiers to submit evidence of safety concerns, holding that such information was irrelevant to the underlying issue of whether the soldier disobeyed a lawful command.99 When compared to medical treatment deemed to be a requirement of service, the rigors of military command structure are less present in clinical research conducted or sponsored by the military. As discussed, the DoD has adopted the Common Rule,100 and Executive Order 12333 mandates that the CIA comply with the Common Rule 's guidelines.101 In addition, DoD policies provide additional safeguards for service members who are solicited for, or enrolled in, clinical trials that are conducted or sponsored by the government.102 FDA -approved medicines). 97 See Washington , 57 M.J. at 396 (noting that Airman Washington 's refusal to be inoculated with an anthrax vaccine was properly regarded as insubordination by his superior officer and the Air Force court martial). 98 Randall D.

The subject 's informed consent shall be documented as required by those guidelines. \"). 102 See, e.g. , U.S. DEP'T OF DEF., INSTR . 3216.02 , PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS AND ADHERENCE TO ETHICAL STANDARDS IN DOD-SUPPORTED RESEARCH (2011) [hereinafter DoD Instruction 3216.02 ], AM EFTHIMIOS PARASIDIS 133 These additional protections include a re quirement that commanding officers not be present during solicitation of research participants, the use of an ombudsman for group briefings with active duty personnel, and the appointment of medical monitors for research involving greater than minimal risk to research participants.103 At the same time, however, there are exceptions that negate many of the additional protections in certain circumstances \u2014notably, the informed consent waiver, which is discussed, infra , in S ubsection C. Furthermore, since the bou ndary between research and treatment is particularly amorphous in military settings, the circumstances in which the research -related protections actually apply are limited. B. A Nebulous Boundary Between Treatment and Research for Military Personnel For mili tary personnel, the line between research and treatment is particularly vague. DoD Instruction 3216.02 defines a key triggering term for Common Rule protections \u2014\"research involving human subjects\"\u2014to exclude \"[a]ctivities carried out solely for purposes of diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of injury and disease in Service members and other mission essential personnel under force health protection programs[.] \"104 Under this provision, use of non -FDA - approved products, or off -label use of an FDA -approved prod uct, is permitted so long as the reason for the use is treatment -related, rather than research -related.105 Thus, rather than focusing on the underlying medical product \u2014 and whether the product (1) is FDA -approved, (2) constitutes an accepted standard of care, or (3) has a reasonable expectation of conferring a benefit to the recipient \u2014DoD Instruction 3216.02 shifts the inquiry to the rationale underlying the use of the medical product.106 Namely, the question becomes whether military officials 103 See GUIDELINES FOR INVESTIGATORS : REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. ARMY MEDICAL RESEARCH AND MATERIAL COMMAND (USAMRMC) HEADQUARTERS REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN VOLUNTEERS , HUMAN ANATOMICAL SUBSTANCES , AND /OR HUMAN DATA 14-15 (2007). 104 DoD Instruction 3216. 02, supra note 102, Glossary, at 37. 105 Id. 106 Id.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y have indicated tha t the medical product is being used for research, or for the \"diagnosis, treatment or prevention of injury and disease. \"107 A separate DoD guidance document underscores this line of reasoning, stating that research includes \"an intervention or interaction with a human being for the primary purpose of obtaining data regarding the effect of the intervention or interaction. \"108 Thus, so long as the military casts the primary purpose of a medical intervention as treatment -related, r esearch protocols will be inapplicable. Importantly, under the UCMJ, military personnel are legally required to submit to \"treatment \" with such medical products.109 Pursuant to DoD Instruction 3216.02, activities related to an \"operational test and evaluation \" (\"OT&E\") project are excluded from the definition of \"research involving human subjects. \"110 Under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 139, an OT&E project is a \"field test, under realistic combat conditions, of any item (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or muni tions for the purpose of determining the effectiveness and suitability of the weapons, equipment, or munitions for use in combat by typical military users. \"111 Field -testing \"may often be hazardous, may involve the use of volunteers, but may not be considere d human research. \"112 Under such circumstances, regulations governing research with human subjects do not apply.113 It is unclear whether the definition of OT&E projects includes medical products, though there is nothing that affirmatively states that medical products are excluded.114 Moreover, the terms \"weapons \" or \"equipment \" arguably would include medical devices that are 107 Id. 108 U.S. DEP'T OF DEF., DOD AND OUSD(P&R) SPECIFIC AND \u00a7 (titled , \"DoD Directive 3216.02 clarification of 10 USC 980 \") (em phasis added). 109 United States v.

If U.S. service members are called into a comba t area and there is evidence that one of the belligerents has engineered a new form of anthrax that the existing anthrax vaccine is powerless against, the DoD can obtain an EUA under the BioShield Act to require that service members be inoculated with the non-FDA approved anthrax vaccine. Should this new strain of anthrax be used against U.S. troops, the DoD and vaccine manufacturer can then study the effectiveness of the experimental vaccine. Since the primary purpose underlying the use is troop protection , not research, the DoD can mandate inoculation with the investigational vaccine, and the informed consent of service members is not required.121 C. Informed Consent Waivers Coupled with the provisions of the BioShield Act, informed consent waivers are permitt ed when military officials deem a medical product to be a requirement of service.122 In such circumstances, the President of the United States is authorized to issue an informed consent waiver, so long as the use is \"in connection with the member 's participa tion in a particular military operation. \"123 This power was previously in the hands of the FDA via an interim final regulation issued by the agency, but the FDA rescinded its own interim final rule following a controversy surrounding the FDA 's issuance of a waiver during the Gulf War in the early 1990s.124 The circumstances 119 See Project BioShield Act of 2004, Pub.

In the midst of the Iran -Iraq War (1980 -1988), Iraq deployed chemical weapons against Iran.125 The U.S. government supported Iraq during the war, though, as the late Jonathan Tucker explained, the United States kept \"its support low -profile.\"126 In addition, companies from the United States, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland prov ided Iraq with chemicals and specialized equipment that Iraq utilized to build its chemical weapons arsenal.127 Iran repeatedly pleaded for assistance from the international community, and inspectors from the United Nations later confirmed that Iraq had used tabun, mustard gas, and other toxic substances against Iranian soldiers and civilians.128 In the end, the international community did not take any meaningful steps to punish Iraq for its use of chemical weapons.129 In 1990, two years after the conclusion of the Iran -Iraq War, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait.130 Shortly thereafter, the United States intervened on the side of Kuwait, cognizant of the very real possibility that Iraq might use chemical or biological weapons against U.S. service members.131 For exampl e, the CIA estimated that Iraq had over 1,000 tons of chemical weapons that were loaded into various munitions.132 Medically, there was little the military could do to protect U.S. troops, 1046, 1047 (2007). 125 See JONATHAN B.

Of the information that is in the public domain, it is clear that the FDA believed that the DoD was not being forthright in its negotiations with the FDA. The FDA claims that it granted the waiver becaus e it believed that the DoD determined that military necessity required an informed consent waiver for investigational use of unapproved products.142 On the other hand, the DoD claims that it believed the FDA had granted permission to use the products without informed consent because the FDA believed that the products were safe.143 Regardless of why the waiver was granted, as a condition of FDA permission to use investigational products without informed consent, the DoD agreed to: (1) provide information on PB t o all service members; (2) collect, review, and make reports of adverse events related to PB; (3) label PB as an investigational product that was solely for \"military use and evaluation \"; (4) ensure that each dose of the BT vaccine was recorded in each ser vice member 's medical record; and (5) maintain adequate records related to the receipt, shipment, and disposition of the BT vaccine.144 The DoD failed to comply with each of these requirements.145 [hereinafter GULF WAR ILLNESS REPORT ]. 140 Id.; see also Justice Delayed: Acknowledging the Reality of Gulf War Illness , 372 LANCET 1856 (2008).

DoD prosecutors repeatedly sought to exclude all evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of the anthrax vaccine, and military judges consistently granted these motions.159 Service members argued that the off -label use of the vaccine amounted to investigational use under FDA requirements, but military courts staunchly upheld the AVIP, 155 Id. at 2-3.

Circuit dismissed the action because it found that the FDA did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in approving the new indication during the second review.171 Since March 1998, over 2,300,000 service members have received the anthrax vaccine.172 The informed consent waivers for PB, the BT vaccine, and the anthrax vaccine were pr ovided in the context of medical treatment, not research, though the DoD gathered research -related information from the programs.173 Thus, each example fell into a \"gray area \" where research and treatment overlap. 167 Doe v.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y For informed consent waivers in research se ttings, a complex web of federal regulations and DoD guidelines apply. The Common Rule allows for informed consent waivers in limited circumstances.174 For example, under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.116(c), an IRB can waive some or all of the informed consent requirement s if the IRB determines that: 1. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; 2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; 3. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and 4. Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.175 Furthermore, though not specifically identified in the Common Rule, guidance from the FDA allows for informed consent waivers for \"emergency research, \" which encompasses situations where: [H]uman subjects who have a life -threatening medical condition that necessitates urgent intervention (for which available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory), and who, because of their condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury) cannot provide informed consent. The research must have the prospect of direct benefit to the patient and must involve an investigational product that, to be effective, must be administered before informed consent from the subject or the subject 's legally authorized representative can be obtained and in which there is no reasonable way to ident ify prospectively individuals likely to become eligible for participation.176 The informed consent waiver for emergency research does not exclude military personnel.177 174 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 46.116, 46.117 (2015). 175 Id. \u00a7 46.116(d).

The research is conducted in compliance with all other applicable laws and regulations.185 The A ssistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering maintains the authority to issue an informed consent waiver under this provision, and can delegate this authority to \"a DoD Component official who is a Presidential Appointee with Senate Confirmation .\"186 However, informed consent waivers must be placed into context \u2014 according to on e recent study, on average, 5 out of 6 products under review by the FDA fail to earn regulatory approval because the product is either unsafe or ineffective.187 As such, the use of non -FDA approved medical products involves significant risk. D. Military Culture In addition to military command, an amorphous research/practice divide, and informed consent waivers, military culture is a marker of vulnerability for service members. Speci fically, military culture may serve to compel service members to obey a request to submit to medical treatment or to participate in clinical research.

They might feel that participation could contribute to promotions, easier assignments, or special privileges; or that refusal to participate could result in demotions or other punitive measures. Moreover, the success of military operations depends in part on giving up some individual autonomy for the good of the whole; for this reason, soldiers might be coerced to participate in research if it is consi dered to be for the greater good; for example, accepting an experimental vaccine to ensure that the entire force would be protected.188 Army guidelines for clinical investigators echo these sentiments, indicating that service members \"are trained to act as a unit, so peer pressure should also be considered and minimized if possible. \"189 As public health experts Victor Sidel and Barry Levy explain in the landmark treatise, Military Medical Ethics : [B]ecause they cannot simply \"quit their jobs \" or \"file a grieva nce\" with a union, government agency, or professional organization, military personnel may not believe that they can truly refuse to par ticipate in these experiments. They may feel more like a \"captive audience \" than like \"volunteers. \" Furthermore, they ma y not be fully informed of the risks for a variety of reasons, including national security.190 This position is echoed by Paul J. Amoroso and Lynn L. Wenger, who add that \"[m]ilitary hierarchy also carries the potential for conflict between the IRB and the c ommander \" and that \"[r]esearchers must be especially cognizant of the hierarchical nature of the military and be certain that it does not interfere with the process of informed voluntary consent.\"191 The history of research -related exploitation of service members provides a stark reminder of the power of coercion that results from military culture.192 188 PRESIDENTIAL COMM'N FOR THE STUDY OF BIOETHICAL ISSUES , VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BACKGROUND 10 (2014), http://bioethics.gov/sites/default/files/VP%20Bkgrnd%20FINAL %20with%20Timeline%2009.21.15.pdf (citations omitted). 189 See U.S. ARMY MED.

Predominance of Force Health Priorities In the military, there is a \"tension between the person who has volunteered as an autonomous individual to undertake the role responsibilities of military service, and the military institution, which must in large part treat service members collectively in order to accomplish its objectives. \"193 As such, insofar as success in military missions is the driving force underlying t he very existence of the military, the maintenance of force -wide health is of primary importance.194 While public health goals also play a prominent role in civilian medicine, they are more pronounced in military settings. Furthermore, in situations where ra tioning of health care delivery may be necessary due to resource limitations, the goals of the force take precedent over the health care needs of any one individual.195 The predominance of force health priorities also impacts the confidentiality of personal medical or health -related information. According to military medical ethicist Michael Gross: During war and among one 's own soldiers, the scope of the private sphere decreases and that of the public expands as collective welfare takes precedence over an individual 's private good. Thus, a wide range of private information is relevant during war that is not particularly interesting in other settings. This includes a person 's emotional stability, propensity for aggression or unsocial behavior, or difficu lty with authority \u2014anything, in fact, that could upset the discipline and cohesiveness necessary to maintain effective fighting capabilities.196 As Maxwell Mehlman and Stephanie Corley add, because of the priority of the group over the individual, service me mbers \"must be defined according to a different ethical principle that is more in keeping with the core values of the military. \"197 These values are 193 William J.

Governmental Immunities and Limitations on Tort Claims by Military Personnel A research participant 's ability to seek legal recourse in the event of a research -related injury is an integral component of the legal framework governing research with human subjects.199 As a non - negotiable component of informed consent, the Common Rule requires that \"[n]o informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject 's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or its agents from liability for negligence. \"200 Although the DoD has adopted the Common Rule and this precise language is codified in the DoD's regulations governing research with human subjects,201 a series of governmental immunities and limitations on tort claims render this important provision virtually meaningless. For example, the Feres doctrine prevents service members from suing the government, government employees, or agents working on behalf of the government, in situations where a 198 Edmund G.

Namely, service members are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence that prevents them from taking part in research. Furthermore, this policy conflicts with the provision that indicates a superior officer shall not influence a service member's decision to participate in research.220 214 DoD Instruction 3216.02, supra note 102, \u00a7 7, at 19 -20.

Vulne rability, Service Members, and the Common Rule Arguably, existing DoD guidelines reflect a reasonable interpretation of the Common Rule 's requirement that IRBs provide additional protections for individuals who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influe nce. For example, guidelines that restrict a superior officer 's role in research participation address the possibility of coercion in the recruitment of service members for research, while the use of ombudsmen or research monitors help ensure that research - related risks are reasonable in relation to the underlying study.228 In this respect, the DoD guidelines reflect a triumph of institution - derived protections for vulnerable research subjects. At the same time, however, the DoD guidelines do not adequately a ddress all of the military -specific markers of vulnerability. For example, a superior officer 's ability to override a subordinate 's decision to participate in research represents a form of coercion and undue influence. Yet, this policy is understandable. The raison d'etre of service members is to help fulfill the military goals of the armed forces, and enrolling in research may frustrate that goal. The failure of the DoD guidelines to address all potentially problematic aspects of the military command stru cture does not, in and of itself, represent bad faith or an intentional failure to protect the interests of service members. Rather, the failure may be seen as a realistic compromise necessary to harmonize the interests of the armed forces and the military biomedical complex. While it is unreasonable to expect that research protections can or will eliminate entirely the impact of military command structure and military culture, the inability of guidelines to fully address these issues supports the notion t hat service members, as a class, are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. Other factors that support the conclusion that service members are a vulnerable population include the predominance of force -health priorities and the amorphous boundary betwee n research and treatment for military personnel. While these concerns are, to varying degrees, present in civilian contexts, national security law and DoD guidelines exacerbate the concerns for military 228 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 7(e)(1)(b) -(d), at 23. EFTHIMIOS PARASIDIS 155 personnel. Field -testing, Emergency Use Authorization s, and informed consent waivers are apt examples.229 The Common Rule places the legal burden on IRBs to determine whether individuals are vulnerable, and what additional protections are appropriate to address that vulnerability.230 This represents a flexible approach to research protections for human subjects. It would be impractical, if not impossible, for the Common Rule to outline the precise protections that must be afforded in all circumstances to different subsets of vulnerable populations. Each research project carries its own risks and benefits, and the Common Rule places this fact-based inquiry on the individual IRB reviewing the protocol.231 However, by identifying certain groups as vulnerable populations and setting forth specific guidelines for some o f these groups,232 the Common Rule helps guide IRBs in this process. The identification of specific groups also reflects a recognition by policy -makers that certain groups are de facto vulnerable. With respect to the categories identified in the federal gui delines, \"some of the groups could be considered vulnerable because they lack the capacity to provide informed consent to research (e.g., children and mentally disabled persons), or because they are unusually susceptible to coercion (e.g., prisoners). \"233 For other groups, such as pregnant women, vulnerability is not related to capacity or coercion concerns of the woman,234 but rather \"to protect the fetus from research -related risks.\"235 The diversity of rationales underscores the notion that the Common Rule mai ntains a flexible standard for determining which groups of individuals constitute a vulnerable population. Still, one 229 See supra Subsections III.A -C. 230 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46 (2015). See id . 232 See id. 233 Coleman, supra note 1, at 12. 234 Id. 235 Sara F.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y must also be mindful of the unintended consequences of identifying too many groups as vulnerable. As Levine and colleagues argue, \"if ever yone is vulnerable, then the concept becomes too nebulous to be meaningful. \"236 Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, additional protections for some vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, prisoners, and children, oftentimes have restricted their ability to partake in research, which has led to a lack of data to address the specific medical needs of individuals from these groups.237 While providing adequate research -related protections is unquestionably important, examining the safety and efficacy of medical treatments available to vulnerable groups is no less meaningful. At the same time, there is a risk of maintaining too narrow of a definition of vulnerability. One can reasonably assume that the drafters of the Common Rule understood that the s tatute includes an expansive definition of vulnerability, and that this broad definition was necessary to achieve the fundamental goal of the law, which is to provide safeguards for individuals who participate in research.238 Importantly, despite ample criti cism of the Common Rule 's framing of vulnerability,239 the NPRM maintains the precise definition of vulnerability that was set forth in 1991 ( \"likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence \"), and in fact clarifies that the most expansive constructio n of that definition is appropriate.240 As such, it is highly unlikely that OHRP or HHS believes that the concept of vulnerable populations should be interpreted narrowly. Nor should it be. Even if one takes the extreme position that everyone is vulnerable, it does not follow that everyone is vulnerable for the same reason. For example, the concerns of pregnant women differ from the concerns of 236 Levine et al., supra note 44, at 46. 237 See, e.g. , Mary C. Blehar et al., Enrolling Pregnant Women: Issue s in Clinical Research , 23 WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES e39 (2013); Sharona Hoffman, Beneficial and Unusual Punishment: An Argument in Support of Prisoner Participation in Clinical Trials , 33 INDIANA L. REV. 475 (2000). For example, a significant number of FDA -approved pharmaceuticals have insufficient data to create an accurate risk -benefit profile for pregnant women.

EFTHIMIOS PARASIDIS 157 prisoners,241 just like the needs of the homeless differ from the needs of service members. While the Common Rule \"is frequently described as a risk -based rubric . . . there is very little in the Common Rule itself or subsequent guidance that provides help with defining or assessing risk. \"242 Furthermore, as the National Research Council ( \"NRC\") elucidates, it is important to distinguish \"social vulnerability from research vulnerability, \" which means identifying \"harm that may be caused by the research participation itself and harms that may be caused by the life situation or characteristics of the research participants. \"243 The NRC explains the main difference between the two by clarifying that, while social vulnerabilities are \"real,\" they \"are not caused by the research. \"244 In applying the NRC 's guidance to service members, the following conside rations are especially relevant: (1) whether service members are vulnerable because of military -specific laws or norms; (2) whether they are vulnerable because of the type of research that they are being asked to participate in; or (3) whether they are vul nerable because they represent a certain segment of society. In other words, as applied to service members, the concept of vulnerability can be theorized as being linked to some form of coercion, factors that limit or interfere with the ability of service members to provide informed consent, or socio -economic or cultural aspects of service members that make them vulnerable because of who they are. Although some experts advocate for drawing a distinction between vulnerability based on life characteristics a nd vulnerability based on the research itself,245 a failure to take social vulnerability into consideration may propagate inequalities and disparate treatment of 241 Though not a perfect fit, an analogy to p risoners raises interesting parallels. Service members may also be deemed a captive population, given the UCMJ and the rigors of military hierarchy. And, like prisoners, service members also rely on their institution for the provision of health care (which contributes to the blurring between treatment and research) and may view participation in research as a break from day -to-day routines. 242 NRC Report, supra note 83, at 59. 243 Id. at 67. 244 Id. 245 See, e.g. , id.

For example, studies have consistently found that the odds of a person entering the military are correlated with family background, race, family structure, and parental education.246 African -Americans are over -represented in the military\u2014in 2010, African -Americans comprised 17% of the armed forces and 12.6% of the general popu lation.247 African -American women are enlisting in the military at a rate far higher than Caucasian or Hispanic women; 31% of women service members are African - American, which is double the percentage of the civilian female population that identifies as Afri can-American.248 By contrast, Caucasian women represent 53% of the women in the military while accounting for 78% of the female civilian population.249 Insofar as the demographics of the U.S. military reflect and/or reinforce socio - economic disparities, offici als have a moral obligation to ensure that federal regulations recognize these factors and provide adequate safeguards for service members. As military medical ethicist Michael Gross observes, \"during armed conflict, there is very little compunction about using persons as means.\"250 While combat -related risks are an inseparable aspect of life 246 See Alair MacLean & Nicholas L. Parsons, Unequal Risk: Combat Occupations in the Volunteer Military , 53 SOC. PERSP . 347, 359-60 (2010).

Service members have poorer high school grades than the general population and high school students with college amb itions are far less likely to enroll in the military. When compared to the general population, enlistees had fewer years of education and were more likely to have dropped out of high school.

To the extent a distinction should be drawn between combat -related risk and research -related risk, what regulatory safeguards are sufficient to balance the rights of service members and the goals of national security? What remedies should be available to service members if those protocols are breached? The answers to these questions not only guide IRB consideration of research involving service members, they also help frame the following considerations: (1) whether service members should be specifically identified as a vulnerable population in the Common Rule; and (2) whether 45 C.F.R. Pa rt 46 should include a new regulatory subpart that deals exclusively with research -related concerns of service members. CONCLUSION The U.S. military has a long and checkered history of research involving service members.251 While DoD guidelines provide some research -related protections for service members, these protections do not fully address military -specific markers of vulnerability. In addition, the DoD has the discretion to amend the guidelines,252 so the protections lack a legal permanence when compared to the protections outlined in the Common Rule and related Subparts.253 By specifying that service members are an example of a vulnerable population, federal law would not only acknowledge the DoD 's past wrongs in the context of human subjects research, it would create a more permanent regulatory framework governing research involving service members.254 Given OHRP 's extensive efforts to amend the 251 See generally supra note 206; Parasidis, supra note 11; Efthimios Enhancement and Experimental Research in the Military , 44 CONN .

REV. 1117 (2012). 252 Issuances , U.S. DEP'T OF DEF., http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives /index.html (last visited July 18, 2016). 253 Of course, the federal protections also can be amended, as evidenced by the ANPRM and NPRM. However, the process for amending the federal regulations, when compared to DoD issuances, is more transparent and contains a robust public dialogue, including a period for public notice and comment. 254 Such an amendment also will place the Common Rule in line with other codes governing research with human subjects, such as that set for th by the Council for International PARASIDIS -FINAL (UPDATED ) (DO NOT DELETE ) 10/14/2016 10:17 AM 160 HOUS. J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y Common Rule to make it more in line with contemporary trends and concerns in human subjects research, it is an op portune time to include service members as an example of a population that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. This will serve to memorialize what has already been widely acknowledged by the DoD and other experts,255 and will provide military perso nnel with additional confidence that government officials understand and appreciate the research -related risks that service members face. Importantly, characterizing service members as vulnerable does not represent an emasculation of warfighters, but rathe r is likely to contribute to warfighter empowerment. An amendment to the Common Rule may also open the door to a discussion of whether the unique research -related concerns faced by service members warrant the creation of a new Subpart to 45 C.F.R. Part 46. A new regulatory Subpart could be modeled on the existing Subparts, and could include protections such as: (1) requiring that military IRBs include service members or service member representatives; (2) requiring that military IRBs provide assurances that (a) risks to human subjects are commensurate with non -military studies, (b) the decision to participate will not impact mission or career prospects, (c) confidentiality will be preserved, and (d) follow -up medical care will be provided; and (3) requiring the mandatory use of research monitors. Of course, including service members in the Common Rule as an example of a vulnerable population does not require that an additional Subpart be created \u2014there are other categories of vulnerable populations (namely, \"physically or mentally disabled persons \" or \"economically or educationally disadvantaged persons\") that are identified in the Common Rule as such, yet do not have a distinct Subpart. Protecting vulnerable populations is one of the primary functions of fede ral guidelines governing research with human subjects. While identifying service members as a vulnerable population is not a Organizations of Medical Sciences ( \"CIOMS\") or the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ( \"UNAIDS \"), both of which identify service members as a vulnerable population. See Jason Andrews, Research in the Ranks , 49 PERSP. BIOLOGY & MED. 35, 38 (2006). 255 For example, the President 's Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues identifies service members as an example of a \"potentially vulnerable \" population. See PRESIDENTIAL COMM'N FOR THE STUDY OF BIOETHICAL ISSUES , supra note 188, at 10 EFTHIMIOS PARASIDIS 161 panacea,256 a barometer of the regulatory regime is how well it comports with foundational ethical principles and the real -world system of human subjects research. As such, regardless of whether amendments to federal law are adopted, the DoD should revisit its policies to ensure that the policies adequately address the markers of vulnerability for service members. Just as the United Sta tes calls on its military personnel to protect U.S. interests at home and abroad, service members and the public must call on U.S. officials and lawmakers to ensure that the U.S. is adequately protecti ng members of the armed forces. 256 For one, service members are not a monolithic group. Also, the Common Rule itself has its limits, as it places the legal burden on IRBs to consider appropriate protections. "}
