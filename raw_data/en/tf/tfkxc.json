The [study](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2023-061894/191478/Safety-of-COVID-19-mRNA-Vaccination-Among-Young), published June 6 in Pediatrics, was led by the Kaiser Permanente [Division of Research](https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/home) in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Importantly, there was no indication of the heart inflammation called myocarditis among the young vaccinated children, said lead author Kristin Goddard, MPH, research project manager with the Kaiser Permanente [Vaccine Study Center](https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/vaccineresearch/vaccinestudycenter/). \"We haven't seen any myocarditis or pericarditis in this youngest age group, which is very reassuring,\" Goddard said. Myocarditis has emerged as a rare side effect of COVID-19 vaccination, mostly among teenage or young adult men. Rates of myocarditis for children over 5 years old and young adults following COVID-19 vaccination in the Vaccine Safety Datalink have been [previously published](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-2274). The Pediatrics study marks the first analysis looking for serious side effects from the mRNA vaccines in young children. The study examined medical records for 23 serious potential side effects, including outcomes such as blood clots, seizures, stroke, and brain inflammation. Analyses showed no safety concern for any of the selected serious side effects. In particular, the study found no concern for seizures after vaccination, something occasionally seen following other routine childhood immunizations in children under 2 years old. Meanwhile, the CDC [previously reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7135a3.htm) on mild side effects from immunization, such as sore arms or brief fevers. The analysis covered a large and diverse group of children. It included 135,005 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 v given to children age 6 months to 4 years and 112,006 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine given to children age 6 months to 5 years. \"Parents can be assured that this large study found no serious side effects from the mRNA vaccines,\" said senior author [Nicola Klein](https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/researchers/klein-nicola), MD, PhD, director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center and research scientist with the Division of Research. \"Parents can protect their young children from COVID-19 in the same way they vaccinate their children to protect from other serious childhood diseases.\" \"Even as the COVID-19 emergency has ended, we know that the coronavirus poses a long-term, serious threat to all ages, including children,\" Klein added. \"Vaccinating children against COVID-19 benefits them by reducing the burden of illness, avoiding spreading the virus to family and others, and mitigating the small but real risk of serious illness.\" ### About the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research The Kaiser Permanente Division of Research conducts, publishes and disseminates epidemiologic and health services research to improve the health and medical care of Kaiser Permanente members and society at large. It seeks to understand the determinants of illness and well-being, and to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of health care. Currently, DOR's 600-plus staff is working on more than 450 epidemiological and health services research projects.
