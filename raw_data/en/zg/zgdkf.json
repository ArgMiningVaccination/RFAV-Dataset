In March 2020, an assessment of the latest CDC National Immunization Survey data found that more than one-third of U.S. children between the ages of 19 and 35 months were not following the recommended early childhood immunization schedule. Furthermore, a 2019 national survey found that approximately 1 in 4 parents reported serious concerns towards vaccinating their children. Vaccine hesitancy is now associated with a decrease in vaccine coverage and an increase in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and epidemics in the United States. Many studies have focused on understanding and defining the new socio-medical term, vaccine hesitancy; few have attempted to summarize past and current health communication interventions and strategies that have been successful or unsuccessful in tackling this growing phenomenon. This systematic literature review will attempt to aid public health professionals with a catalogue of health communication interventions and strategies to ultimately address and prevent parental vaccine hesitancy in the long term. Out of 1239 search results, a total of 75 articles were included for analysis, ranging from systematic reviews, quantitative surveys, and experimental designs to ethnographic and qualitative studies. For the presentation of results, a taxonomy was used to organize communication interventions according to their intended purpose. The catalogue of interventions was further broken down into specific components and themes that were identified in the literature as essential to either the success or failure in preventing and addressing parental vaccine hesitancy towards childhood vaccines.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-10-08", "cleaned_text": "Addressing Parental Vaccine Hesitancy towards Childhood Vaccines in the United States: A Systematic Literature Review of Communication Interventions and Strategies [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040590](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040590) [Vaccination and Public Health: Optimizing Vaccine Uptake through the Application of Social and Behavioral Science Theory, Principles, and Strategies]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Vaccination_vaccines )) Abstract: 1. Introduction 1.1. Overview of Parental Vaccine Hesitancy Towards Childhood Vaccines in the U.S. [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00590), [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00590)]. Vaccination programs have contributed significantly to the decline in mortality and morbidity from various infectious diseases. Most notably, vaccination has been credited with the elimination of polio in the Americas and eradication of smallpox worldwide [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00590)]. Despite being recognized as one of the most successful public health measures for controlling and preventing disease, there has been an upward trend in the perception that vaccination is unsafe and unnecessary by a growing number of individuals in the United States (U.S.) [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00590)]. As a result, hesitancy towards vaccination is beginning to threaten historical achievements that have been made in the U.S. to eliminate and reduce the burden of many infectious diseases that have afflicted humanity for centuries. [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00590)]. In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that while overall childhood immunization rates remained high during the time period 2012 to 2017, there continued to be an increase in the number of children with no vaccines at age 24 months [ [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00590)]. More recently, in March 2020, an assessment of the latest CDC National Immunization Survey data found that more than one-third of U.S. children between the ages of 19 and 35 months were not following the recommended early childhood immunization schedule [ [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00590)]. Concurrent with the increase in parental vaccine hesitancy is an increase in parents choosing to opt out their children from vaccinations required for school entry by obtaining non-medical vaccine exemptions [ [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00590)]. The consequences of the increase in parental vaccine hesitancy over the last several years can most notably be seen in the recent U.S. measles outbreaks. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 due to the nation's effective vaccination program and strong public health system for detecting and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. Today, outbreaks of measles are occurring in the U.S. at an alarming rate, as unvaccinated groups are exposed to occasional outbreaks of the measles virus from outside the country [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00590)]. A notable epidemic was the December 2014 measles outbreak among 125 children in Disneyland [ [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00590)]. Outbreaks of measles have continued in the U.S. over the last two decades. The first spike in measles cases was in 2008 with 64 confirmed reported measles cases, followed by 667 reported cases in 2014, 375 reported cases in 2018, and a record-breaking outbreak of 1,282 cases in 2019 [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00590)]. Large measles outbreaks among children are now occurring alongside an increasing number of parents either delaying or refusing to vaccinate their children against measles [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00590)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00590)]. There are numerous messages circulating widely both in support of and against childhood vaccines in the U.S. [ [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00590), [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00590)]. Parents seeking information about childhood vaccines have ample opportunity for exposure to false and misleading information about vaccines through traditional media outlets and interactive Web 2.0 and social media outlets online [ [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00590)]. The plethora of immunization misinformation online buries science-based information and greatly affects health care professionals' communication abilities and public immunization programs [ [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00590), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00590)]. Misinformation and controversies about childhood vaccines tend to focus on questioning the safety and efficacy of specific vaccines [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00590), [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00590)]. One of the more prominent controversies has been the claim that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism. This claim originated from the 1998 Lancet article published by Andrew Wakefield, which was later retracted. While there is no scientific evidence that the MMR vaccine causes autism, the 1998 article had already caused fear, confusion and distrust over the safety of the vaccine that continues to this day [ [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00590)]. Data from the last decade show that vaccine hesitancy among parents is continuing to increase as some parents begin to follow alternative childhood vaccination schedules, some become selective about which vaccines to give their child, and others refuse vaccines all together vaccine hesitancy was named one of the top 10 public health threats by the World Health Organization [ [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00590)]. According to the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), vaccine hesitancy refers to a delay in the acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place, and vaccines. It is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience, and confidence [ [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00590)]. Vaccine hesitancy has been an emerging term in the socio-medical literature and describes vaccine decision-making or a lack of \"vaccine confidence\" and results in either delay or complete refusal [ [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00590), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00590)]. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy are complex, and there are far more parents who are hesitant towards vaccines than outright refusing all vaccines [ [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00590)]. A large number of conceptual models have been developed for grouping vaccine hesitancy determinants, which have brought both clarity and confusion to understanding the determinants of this phenomenon [ [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00590)]. [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00590), [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00590), [34](#B34-vaccines-08-00590)]. However, research has shown that vaccine hesitancy is more complex, involving emotional, cognitive, cultural, spiritual, social, and political factors [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00590), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00590), [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00590), [35](#B35-vaccines-08-00590)]. Research has also shown that it matters which message techniques are used, and which messengers deliver the vaccine information [ [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00590), [36](#B36-vaccines-08-00590)]. Furthermore, the spread of false and misleading information about vaccines has led many parents to question the efficacy and safety of vaccines, dramatically impacting public understanding and trust in vaccines [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00590), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00590), [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00590), [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00590)]. [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00590), [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00590)]. Vaccination leads to the development of long-lasting and specific immunity against the infectious pathogen without any serious adverse events. Vaccination can be divided into two categories, active and passive vaccination approaches. In passive vaccination, preformed antibodies are administered just before or around the time of exposure. On the other hand, in the active vaccination approach, vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce either specific humoral (antibodies) and cellular immune responses, or both. Vaccines can be further divided into different categories: live attenuated vaccines, killed vaccines, subunit vaccines, nucleic acid (DNA and mRNA) vaccines, and vectored vaccines [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00590), [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00590)]. It is important to emphasize that an infection by a pathogen also leads to activation of the body's immune system to elicit specific immune responses capable of providing partial or complete immunity to fight off the ongoing infection or future infections [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00590), [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00590), [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00590)]. The significance of specific immune responses also lies in the fact that active vaccination leads to the generation of immunological memory, which helps the body to respond quickly and in a robust manner to prevent disease and death. Thus, a vaccine activates the body's immune system upon administration (the process of vaccination), resulting in the generation of effective immunity (the process of getting immunized) to an infection or the disease caused by a pathogen [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00590), [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00590), [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00590)]. 1.3. Components of Vaccines [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00590-t001)) [ [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00590), [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00590)]. The components that help the immune system respond and build immunity to a specific disease include antigens and adjuvants. Antigens can be small amounts of weakened, attenuated or killed pathogen that can cause disease or a defined macromolecular component (protein, carbohydrate, or nucleic acid). Adjuvants are immunomodulatory components that activate the innate immune system and help the immune system respond strongly to a vaccine to mount an appropriate and desired immune response [ [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00590)]. The other components that keep vaccines safe and stable include preservatives and stabilizers. Preservatives protect the vaccine from external contaminations, and stabilizers such as sugar or gelatin enhance the stability of vaccines during different phases of production, storage, and shipping. [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00590)]. It is only upon such regulatory approvals by the FDA that new or modified existing vaccines move forward to licensure and recommendation for use in the U.S.A. by the CDC. Thus, monitoring vaccine safety and effectiveness remains an ongoing process for any vaccine intended for public use. The CDC routinely publishes the written recommendations for vaccinating U.S. children and sets the immunization schedules based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ [47](#B47-vaccines-08-00590)]. [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00590-t002)outlines the current CDC-recommended vaccination schedule for children. Additional information about specific types of vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases can be found on the CDC website [ [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00590), [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00590), [48](#B48-vaccines-08-00590)]. 2. Materials and Methods [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00590-f001)). The search was performed in PubMed, PsychINFO, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, and Communication and Mass Media Complete databases, targeting publications from January 2008 to October 2019. Additional articles were identified through Google Scholar and other sources. The search strings included a variety of combinations of terms related to \"vaccine hesitancy\", \"communication\", and \"intervention\". The full list of search terms is included in [Table 3](#vaccines-08-00590-t003). The results were filtered to include articles that were full-text, available in English, and predominately from the U.S. International publications from a few high-income, English-dominant countries including the U.K., Australia, and Canada were also included. The databases were initially searched for articles related to the main objective: exploring key communication interventions and strategies that can be successful in addressing and preventing parental vaccine hesitancy towards childhood vaccines in the long term. The inclusion criteria required the focus of the study to be on parental vaccine hesitancy around childhood vaccines. Articles with a primary focus outside of parental vaccine hesitancy and childhood vaccines were excluded. Articles that focused on annual/seasonal vaccines (i.e., influenza), adolescent immunizations (i.e., HPV or meningitis), or adult and older-adult vaccines (i.e., shingles) were also excluded. Articles were also excluded if their focus was on strategies and interventions to solely reduce immunization pain or if the intervention broadly focused on improving immunization rates and not addressing vaccine hesitancy. This systematic literature review followed a four-step screening process. First, reference manager software was used to combine and review the search results and eliminate any duplicates. Studies with multiple publications were narrowed down to the most applicable or informative article. Second, the articles were screened by two reviewers for relevance by title and abstract. The third screening process ensured that articles were available in full text and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Lastly, articles were excluded if not relevant or adding new information to the main objective. Relevant data were collected in Excel, including the study design and methods, sample size, target audience, country of publication, study results, and study implications. A total of 75 articles were included, ranging from systematic reviews, quantitative surveys, and experimental designs to ethnographic and qualitative studies. 3. Results 3.1. Defining Vaccine Hesitancy [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00590), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00590), [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00590)]. MacDonald, in 2015, highlighted the importance of one practical definition of vaccine hesitancy for immunization program managers, policy makers, clinicians, and researchers to effectively understand and address issues around vaccine hesitancy [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00590), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00590)]. According to the WHO SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy, it refers to a delay in the acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccine services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place, and vaccines. It includes factors such as complacency, convenience, and confidence [ [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00590)]. The WHO SAGE Working Group, along with several other social scientists, further define vaccine hesitancy on the continuum of those who fully accept with few doubts, those who delay the vaccination schedule, and those who completely reject vaccines ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00590-f002)) [ [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00590), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00590), [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00590)]. Several tools have been developed to define and measure vaccine hesitancy including the Vaccine Confidence Scale, the Global Vaccine Confidence Index, and the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale [ [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00590), [50](#B50-vaccines-08-00590), [51](#B51-vaccines-08-00590), [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00590), [53](#B53-vaccines-08-00590)]. The most widely used tool specifically designed to measure parental vaccine hesitancy is the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey, which was developed in 2011 [ [54](#B54-vaccines-08-00590), [55](#B55-vaccines-08-00590)]. The PACV survey is a short and self-administered validated survey that measures attitudes and beliefs about immunization prior to health care appointments to allow health care providers (HCP) to be informed about any hesitancy parents may have towards vaccines and to assist HCP in adapting their messages and communication strategies [ [56](#B56-vaccines-08-00590), [57](#B57-vaccines-08-00590), [58](#B58-vaccines-08-00590), [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.2. Hesitancy Determinants Matrix\" outlines factors influencing the decision-making behavior to accept, delay, or reject some or all vaccines under three categories: contextual, individual and group, and vaccine/vaccination-specific influences ( [Table 4](#vaccines-08-00590-t004)) [ [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.3. Key Communication Interventions and Strategies That Address Vaccine Hesitancy [64](#B64-vaccines-08-00590)]. The interventions were categorized as those that inform and educate, remind or recall, enhance community ownership, teach skills, provide support, facilitate decision making, and enable communication. 3.3.1. Inform and Educate [65](#B65-vaccines-08-00590)] evaluated individually tailored versus untailored education materials for improving vaccination intention and positive vaccination attitudes for the MMR vaccine among parents who were surveyed and identified on a scale of vaccine hesitancy. The researchers tested web-based, individually tailored education material at four levels: image tailoring to parents' race, content tailoring to specific vaccine-related concerns, experiential tailoring for parents' past experiences, and name tailoring to the child's name for messaging content. The tailored materials had a significantly greater impact on positive vaccination intentions and attitudes towards vaccination compared to untailored information provided through general educational web pages [ [65](#B65-vaccines-08-00590)]. In another study, Jolley et al. [ [66](#B66-vaccines-08-00590)] studied the effectiveness of attempting to counter and correct conspiracy arguments about childhood vaccines. It was found that anti-conspiracy arguments were not effective in increasing a person's intention to vaccinate unless an individual was exposed to an anti-conspiracy theory message before providing the original conspiracy theory message. 3.3.2. Remind or Recall [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00590)] conducted a systematic literature review of 34 studies that used parental reminder and recall interventions based on the use of postcards, letters, the telephone, or a combination to improve early childhood immunization uptake. Researchers found that the majority of reminder and recall systems (79%) increased the likelihood of immunization uptake from study baselines by varying degrees, anywhere from 9% to 55%. In the same review, it was found that the use of tailored calendars that aim to encourage the immunization of children up to 24 months resulted in an increase in the immunization rate by 66% in the intervention group compared to 47% among the controls. In this study, calendars were tailored to the age of the baby, and included tailored pictures and messages from the family [ [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00590)]. Frew et al. also discovered that several studies employed reminder and recall systems not only for vaccine-hesitant parents but for health care providers as well. It was found that utilizing a hospital's electronic health record (EHR) to remind HCPs to discuss childhood vaccines with parents led to an improvement in early childhood immunization uptake, reflected by a reduction in missed opportunities by 36% over a 2 year period [ [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.3.3. Enhance Community Ownership [68](#B68-vaccines-08-00590)] introduced an education outreach and social marketing intervention called \"The Immunity Community\", which aimed to reduce vaccine hesitancy. The goals of the \"Immunity Community\" intervention were to 1) address parental vaccine hesitancy by empowering parents to be immunization advocates in their community, 2) improve awareness of immunization as a social norm among parents at participating sites, and 3) change those parents' attitudes and behaviors. Surveys revealed statistically significant improvements in vaccine-related attitudes: the percentage of parents who were concerned about other parents not vaccinating their children increased from 81.2% to 88.6%, and the percentage reporting themselves as \"vaccine-hesitant\" decreased from 22.6% to 14.0% [ [68](#B68-vaccines-08-00590)]. This study demonstrates the promise of using parent advocates as part of a community-based approach to reduce vaccine hesitancy. Attwell et al. [ [69](#B69-vaccines-08-00590)] evaluated the \"I Immunize\" campaign, which used a similar approach to \"The Immunity Community\" but focused more specifically on an identity and values-based approach to change vaccination attitudes. The campaign was carried out in a community that was known for their \"alternative lifestyles\" and lower-than-national vaccine coverage rates and utilized local community members to be advocates for the campaign. Community members were featured on posters, billboards, local newspapers, and social media posts, to deliver co-promoted behavioral messaging such as \"My name is Andrew, I use cloth nappies, I eat at wholefoods, and I immunize\". The results from a community-wide survey of 304 respondents showed that 60% of the intended audience members were positively influenced by the campaign messages, 17% were negatively impacted, and 23% declared no impact. The researchers of the campaign attributed the success of the campaign to the involvement of local community members at every stage of the intervention in order to fit the needs of their audience [ [69](#B69-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.3.4. Teach Skills [58](#B58-vaccines-08-00590)] studied the impact of physician communication training on parental vaccine hesitancy. In this two-arm cluster randomized trial carried out from March 2012 to December 2013 in four hospitals, mothers and providers were recruited from the postpartum units of the hospitals. The first component of the intervention involved a 45-min training that physicians went through, administered by a pediatrician immunization expert and health educator. The training was based on the Ask, Acknowledge, Advise communication framework. The second component was the delivery of paper materials with the branding \"Let's Talk Vaccines\" detailing information on how to reinforce training messages and reach non-attenders. The third component was the delivery of 6-monthly email newsletters to physicians on a webinar version of the original training. Although this training was novel, it only had a marginal effect to no effect, and further improvements will be needed for the effectiveness of this approach [ [58](#B58-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.3.5. Provide Support [70](#B70-vaccines-08-00590)] introduced an internet-based platform with vaccine information and interactive social media components to improve parents' vaccine-related attitudes. In the intervention, study participants were randomized into the following groups: a study website with vaccine information and social media components, a website with vaccine information only, or the usual care. The parents who received the vaccine information with social media components were more likely to vaccinate their child as compared with parents who received the usual care only. Furthermore, the study highlighted the importance of social media for vaccination intention [ [70](#B70-vaccines-08-00590)]. Another study conducted by Gagneur et al. [ [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00590)] evaluated the impact of motivational interviewing techniques to support new mothers and increase vaccination coverage for new infants. A single session delivered one time in the maternity wards led to a significant increase of 15% in the vaccination intention of mothers compared to mothers who did not receive the intervention [ [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.3.6. Facilitate Decision-Making [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00590)] conducted a randomized trial to increase acceptance of childhood vaccines by vaccine-hesitant parents. The researchers sought to explore the importance of facilitating decision-making for parents by delivering information on how to find accurate information on the Internet regarding childhood vaccines. The educational intervention for the randomized group included three components: (1) a short video developed by experts in vaccine safety and behavioral health, (2) an educational handout on common vaccine concerns, and (3) a handout with written instructions on how to find accurate medical information on the Internet. The researchers found that this brief educational intervention resulted in a short-term (~ 2-month long) benefit in improving parental attitudes towards vaccines [ [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.3.7. Enable Communication [72](#B72-vaccines-08-00590)] introduced the Immunization Education Package (IEP) intervention to improve physician/parent communication around vaccine risks/benefits during well-baby visits in which immunizations were scheduled. The IEP intervention design consisted of a vaccine contraindication screening test, a large colorful poster entitled \"7 questions parents need to ask about baby shots\" that was placed in examination rooms, an information sheet with answers to the seven poster questions, and an office-based in-service conducted by a local opinion leader to provide advice. Overall, IEP showed significant improvements in both written and verbal vaccine communication, and the distribution of the federally mandated Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) increased from 33% to 91% at immunization visits [ [72](#B72-vaccines-08-00590)]. Berry et al. [ [73](#B73-vaccines-08-00590)] introduced the Sharing Knowledge about Immunization Project (SKAI) to improve communication between patient and provider and to implement better support systems for health care providers to address vaccine-hesitant parents [ [73](#B73-vaccines-08-00590)]. This project explored the \"triage and treat\" approach to the clinical assessment and care of vaccine hesitancy, exploring the use of a referral pathway to a specialist immunization clinic. The SKAI approach was well received and showed an increase in parents' intents to vaccinate their children [ [73](#B73-vaccines-08-00590)]. Salmon et al. [ [74](#B74-vaccines-08-00590)] introduced \"MomsTalkShots\", a phone, tablet, and computer app that aims to increase the uptake of maternal infant vaccines and encourage communication between mothers and pediatricians. The mobile app initially screens patients based on survey questions and offers tailored vaccination information based on the parent's vaccine attitudes, beliefs, intentions, demographics, and source credibility. A full evaluation of this intervention is still underway, but initial results have revealed that women are finding the app helpful (95%), trustworthy (94%), interesting (97%), and clear to understand (99%) [ [74](#B74-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.4. Key Themes Identified in the Literature for Targeting Interventions 3.4.1. Audiences Targeted [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00590), [66](#B66-vaccines-08-00590), [75](#B75-vaccines-08-00590)]. Another group included health care providers, family members, teachers, and community members/neighborhood coalitions who were core influencers of vaccine-hesitant parents [ [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00590), [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00590), [76](#B76-vaccines-08-00590)]. These efforts have highlighted the importance of including first-time mothers/parents for future studies [ [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00590), of Vaccination suggest that education and interventions should be implemented very early in the pregnancy period since vaccine attitudes are likely formed before making vaccine decisions as parents [ [56](#B56-vaccines-08-00590), [75](#B75-vaccines-08-00590), [96](#B96-vaccines-08-00590)]. Other studies have shown that intervening as late as postpartum can be effective [ [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00590)]. Traditionally, vaccine information is provided to parents at well-child visits [ [57](#B57-vaccines-08-00590)]. However, studies have shown that parents want vaccine information before and during the prenatal period and before each of the following well-child appointments [ [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00590), [95](#B95-vaccines-08-00590)]. The stepwise delivery of vaccination information, or the delivery of vaccination information at different points in time, has also been shown to increase the likelihood of childhood vaccination. This is because more frequent reminders can positively influence parents' intent to immunize and reinforce positive beliefs and attitudes about childhood vaccination [ [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00590), [79](#B79-vaccines-08-00590), [83](#B83-vaccines-08-00590), [97](#B97-vaccines-08-00590)]. First-time mothers/parents have been cited as an important target population for the delivery of interventions to prevent the formation of vaccine-hesitancy attitudes and behaviors. This is an area for further research and evaluation for effectiveness [ [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00590), [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00590), [75](#B75-vaccines-08-00590)]. [98](#B98-vaccines-08-00590), [99](#B99-vaccines-08-00590)]. It is important to also consider information overload that can confuse parents when designing interventions, especially interventions with multiple components to address vaccine hesitancy. If the intervention is being delivered by well-known trusted messengers of health information such as HCP, it is also important to consider the burden of time and additional training for HCP [ [100](#B100-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.4.5. Content [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00590), [79](#B79-vaccines-08-00590), [85](#B85-vaccines-08-00590)]. For example, the needs for vaccination information are very dependent on whether parents are slightly vaccine hesitant, moderately vaccine hesitant, or severely vaccine hesitant [ [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00590), [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00590), [85](#B85-vaccines-08-00590)]. For parents that are lower on the vaccine-hesitancy spectrum (cautious acceptors or hesitant), the content of vaccination information that is requested is more general; parents want information about vaccine safety including balanced information about the benefits and risks of vaccination. These parents also want information about how to mitigate pain related to receiving vaccines/shots [ [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00590), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00590), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00590), [77](#B77-vaccines-08-00590)]. For parents who are higher on the vaccine-hesitancy spectrum (outright decliners or late/selective with vaccines), the vaccination information that is most often requested is more specific, such as the reasons behind combined versus single vaccines, alternatives to vaccines, the science behind how vaccines are made, technical information about vaccine production and delivery, and the reasons behind vaccine policies and recommendations. In addition, several studies have suggested that the content of vaccination information for vaccine-hesitant parents must also focus on providing information about the diseases that vaccines prevent since most of today's parents do not have first-hand experience with the more deadly diseases that are now preventable [ [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00590), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00590), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00590), [77](#B77-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.4.6. Approaches to Vaccine Messaging [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00590)]. Messaging in the form of storytelling with the use of gists, emotive anecdotes, and imagery has been shown to be among the most persuasive messaging strategies. Fear-based messaging, while effective in anti-vaccine messaging and the anti-vaccination movement, has been shown to be counterproductive in promoting vaccination ( [Table 7](#vaccines-08-00590-t007)). 3.4.7. Vaccine Misinformation and Disinformation [Table 8](#vaccines-08-00590-t008)). There are two basic types of false information: misinformation or inadvertently drawing conclusions based on incorrect or incomplete facts, and disinformation, the deliberate spread of falsehoods to promote an agenda. Combating misinformation and disinformation in the fight against growing vaccine hesitancy has proved to be very difficult. It is argued that misinformation and disinformation can be corrected with factual information [ [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00590)]. However, several studies have shown that attempting to correct misinformation and disinformation is difficult to do and can even be counter effective and reinforce strongly held false beliefs about childhood vaccines [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00590), [107](#B107-vaccines-08-00590), [111](#B111-vaccines-08-00590)] 3.4.8. Vaccine Literacy [35](#B35-vaccines-08-00590), [113](#B113-vaccines-08-00590), [114](#B114-vaccines-08-00590)]. Parents generally find it difficult to know which vaccine information sources to trust, and are confused about where to find information that they believe is unbiased and balanced. Vaccine literacy is an important factor in reducing the negative effects of exposure to misleading reports on vaccination [ [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00590), Parents often comment that they want to be engaged in discussion about childhood vaccinations with their HCP. They do not want to simply receive written material from their HCP. There have been a few interventions testing the effectiveness of posters in the physician's office encouraging childhood vaccination communication between parents and HCP. These interventions have been shown to prompt more discussion between parents and HCP [ [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00590), [79](#B79-vaccines-08-00590), [115](#B115-vaccines-08-00590)]. Social mobilization or engaging an entire community in the topic of childhood vaccination has also been shown to be an effective strategy. These are interventions that involve members of an institution, community networks, civic and religious groups, and others in a coordinated way to reach specific groups of people for dialogue and planned messaging [ [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00590), [34](#B34-vaccines-08-00590), Immunize\" campaign trained parents as vaccine advocates to mobilize their communities to be more informed about the importance of childhood vaccines [ [69](#B69-vaccines-08-00590)]. Lastly, recall and reminder systems for parents and HCP have been recommended for encouraging one-on-one discussion about childhood vaccinations [ [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00590), [97](#B97-vaccines-08-00590)]. 3.4.10. Technology-Based Communication Strategies [116](#B116-vaccines-08-00590)]. As a result, information about vaccination in particular has changed in origin, nature, and speed. The Internet and Web 2.0 now produce, relay, and significantly accelerate the spread of vaccine information. While the Internet has allowed for free and anonymously accessible information, which can empower parents to own their health-related decisions, it has come with extreme costs. Information on the Internet is uncontrolled, and searches undertaken by web users are heavily dictated by algorithms, which contribute to hearsay and even magnify and amplify it [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00590)]. Anti-vaccination messages, in particular, have largely been successful on the Internet and social media platforms, utilizing message-framing techniques such as storytelling and fear-based messaging to grab the audience's attention and influence the [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00590), [57](#B57-vaccines-08-00590), [76](#B76-vaccines-08-00590), [87](#B87-vaccines-08-00590), A closer look at the successes of the anti-vaccination messages has, in turn, led to strategic pro-vaccine communication and social marketing interventions and campaigns on the Internet and Web 2.0 to improve positive vaccine beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. In two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that utilized a web-based social media intervention, parents were referred to vaccination information on a website or on a social media platform or were given standard paper-based vaccination information from their HCP. In both RCTs, it was found that referring parents to vaccine information on websites with social media components was more effective at increasing positive vaccination attitudes than distributing standard paper-based vaccination information [ [57](#B57-vaccines-08-00590), [70](#B70-vaccines-08-00590)]. Mobile applications on smartphones and tablets have also been shown to positively reinforce positive vaccination attitudes, behaviors, and intentions to vaccinate [ [74](#B74-vaccines-08-00590), [100](#B100-vaccines-08-00590), [105](#B105-vaccines-08-00590)]. However, it is noted in several studies that for interventions interested in utilizing the Internet and social media to deliver vaccination information, it is critical to understand that this technology rapidly evolves, and therefore, these interventions need to be monitored and updated constantly [ [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00590), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00590), [61](#B61-vaccines-08-00590), [70](#B70-vaccines-08-00590)]. 4.

They are seen as trustworthy, informative, and a reliable source for answering questions and concerns parents have about childhood vaccines. | HCP's communication styles with parents are important. Poor communication and negative relationships with HCP can heavily impact parents' vaccination decisions. Furthermore, HCP's behavior and opinions about vaccination influence parents' acceptance of vaccination. HCP may not always be best equipped or have the time to address the emerging issue of parental vaccine hesitancy. This is especially true when parental questions and concerns arise from very persuasive misinformation found on the Internet and from their social network, which has proven difficult to counter and correct based on numerous studies. The literature suggests that if HCP refuse parents' requests to delay vaccines, be selective with vaccines, or alter the recommended childhood vaccine schedule, parents will continue to search for other HCP or alternative health professionals. However, literature also suggests that if vaccination is presented as the default approach and HCP engage in open discussion with parents about vaccines early and often, parents are more likely to vaccinate their children [ |Internet and Social Media (Web 2.0)||Parents often cite that the Internet and social media are trusted sources of vaccination information. In one study, up to 72% of American internet users trusted health information obtained on the Internet, and 75% evaluated the source of information only sometimes or never. This poses a tremendous threat and opportunity for individuals to be influenced by false or misleading information about want up-to-date information on current scientific information, research, and statistics related to past and current vaccines [| Parents also want information about how to mitigate the pain that is inflicted on their child when receiving a vaccine. There are clinically based guidelines that have been developed to reduce vaccination-associated pain. Parents want to be educated about pain management for vaccine injection before or on the day of vaccination the use of personal narratives when communicating vaccination information is a powerful messaging tool. It has more famously been used in anti-vaccination messaging to spread fear about childhood vaccinations. Two examples of pro-vaccine studies that have utilized storytelling include the Seattle Mama Doc and Moms Who Vax [| Messages about vaccines that express a clear gist are arguably more compelling compared to messages without gists. In general, gists are also more likely to be shared on Facebook and other social media platforms than verbatim statistics reduce psychological reactance, it is not an effective strategy among parents who already hold favorable beliefs about vaccination. Among parents who are not vaccine hesitant, the use of humor in messaging is less effective and can even be counter effective in positively influencing parents' attitudes, beliefs, and intentions towards childhood vaccinations. In addition to the use of humor, the use of enthusiasm in the messenger's tone when delivering vaccine communication is often received more positively among parents compared to unenthusiastic communication. This has been shown in the motivational interviewing techniques used in interventions aimed at new mothers [ [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00590), [81](#B81-vaccines-08-00590), [107](#B107-vaccines-08-00590), [108](#B108-vaccines-08-00590)]. It is argued that because vaccination may be considered risky given the possibility of side effects, loss-framed messages might be more effective. There is mixed evidence that loss-framed messaging is more effective than gain-framed messaging for vaccination information. Some studies affirm that loss-framed messages have the greatest impact, other studies find that a combination of gain- and loss-framed messaging is most effective, and other studies find no overall difference between loss- and is Better than Vaccine-Acquired Immunity||Some vaccine-hesitant parents claim that natural immunity is better than immunity induced by vaccines, which they believe are \"toxins\".
