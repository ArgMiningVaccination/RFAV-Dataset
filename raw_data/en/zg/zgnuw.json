This provision is Section 427 of GEPA, enacted as part of the Improving Amer ica's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103-382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new grant awar ds under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State-formula grant program , a State needs to provide this desc ription only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State-level uses. In addition , local school districts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this descript ion in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be respons ible for ensuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as desc ribed below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an indivi dual person) to include in its application a descript ion of the steps the applicant proposes to take to ensure equitable access to, and participat ion in, its Federally-assisted program for students , teachers , and other program beneficiar ies with special needs. This provision allows applicants discr etion in developing the required descr iption. The statute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equita ble access or participation: gende r, race, nationa l origin, color, disabil ity, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should determ ine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students , teachers, etc. from such access or participation in, the Federally -funded project or activity. The descr iption in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barriers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description of how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable to your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, may be discussed in connect ion with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes , but rather to ensure that, in design ing their projects , applican ts for Federal funds address equity concerns that may affect the ability of certain potent ial beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve to high standards. Consis tent with progra m requirements and its approved application, an applicant may use the Federal funds awar ded to it to eliminate barriers it identifies. What are Examples of How an Applicant Might Satisfy the Requirement of This Provision? The follow ing examp les may help illustrate how an applicant may compl y with Section 427. (1) An applicant that proposes to carry out an adult literacy project serving, among others, adults with limited English proficiency , migh t desc ribe in its application how it intends to distribute a brochure about the proposed project to such potent ial participants in their native language. (2) An applicant that proposes to deve lop instructional materials for classroom use might desc ribe how it will make the mater ials available on audio tape or in braille for studen ts who are blind. (3) An applicant that proposes to carry out a model science program for secondary students and is concerned that girls may be less likely than boys to enro ll in the course, might indicate how it intends to conduc t \"outreach\" efforts to girls, to encourage their enrollment. (4) An applicant that proposes a project to increase schoo l safety migh t desc ribe the special efforts it will take to address concern of lesbian, gay, bisexua l, and transgender students , and efforts to reach out to and involve the famil ies of LGBT studen ts. We recognize that many applicants may already be implementi ng effective steps to ensure equity of access and partic ipation in their grant programs, and we appreciate your cooperat ion in responding to the requirements of this provision.

Project lead is the federally recognized Ka.ruk Tribe (Tribe), whose service area spans the rural and underserved communities ofnorthern California's mountainous and riverine landscape in both Humboldt and Siskiyou Counties. The proposed Project has grown out of an unprecedented community-wide strategically developed proposal through which the Tribe's Depa1tment of Natural Resources will partner with the Tribe's Education Program and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Program. Partners include the Mid Klamath Watershed Council -a non-profit organization dedicated to environmental restoration and public schools: Orleans Elementary (Humboldt County's Klamath-Trinity Joint Unified School District); Junction, Forks of Salmon, and Happy Camp Elementary Schools (three independent LEAs identified as SRSAs in Siskiyou County); and Happy Camp High School (Siskiyou Union High School District). Additionally, the Project has the committed support of the University of California , Berkeley and Davis, Humboldt State University, the University of Oregon, and the U. S. Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, Fire and Fuels Program. Barriers to college and carrier readiness addressed by the Project are: poverty; lack of culturally appropriate instructional materials and culturally competent instructors; and pervasive perceptions among both students and parents that college and career opportunities are severely restricted. Opportunitie s leveraged include wide community, tribal department, tribal parents and students, public school, federal agency and academic institutional support for this project, as well as the large number of existing and future career opportunities in the natural resources. The Project's goals will be achieved by offering AI/ AN students experiential indoor-outdoor learning environments and correlated culture-and place-based K-12 curriculum. By making the important connections between the tribal identity and responsibilities, academic achievement and place-based lessons and experience, our tribal youth will be well equipped to see themselves as academic achievers and to pursue their personal career and college goals. Measureable objectives and outcomes relevant to our goals and 4-year project follow. Capacity Building: engage 2 full-time and at least one part-time dedicated staff; contract community partner and cultural practitioners. Project Management: publish 48 outreach materials to promote Project; provide 96 hours of informal outreach to AllAN youth. Teacher Trainings : develop and implement 3 curriculum and cultural sensitivity training modules for at least 40 teachers for a total of 36 trainings. K-12 Lessons: produce 16 new STEM and California Core Curriculum Standard environmenta l lesson plans; develop and implement 40 classroom and 32 field activities for hands-on educationa l experiences with land and resource management and monitoring strategies; implement 320 Tribal K-12 Curriculum lessons impacting at least 200 students at 5 schools. Workforc e Development: engage at least 32 AI/ AN youth in 64 environmental workforce development field activities; mentor 32 AI/AN youth regarding natural resource career and college opportun ities. Higher Education Opportunities : provide at least 8 on-site higher educationa l workshops/seminars led by at least 4 academic institutions that are open to local AI/ AN high school student participation. Seasonal Youth Camps: conduct 26 seasonal youth camps informed by Karuk traditional ecological knowledge; provide at least 5 cultural practitioners to speak at 85 indoor and outdoor environmental education activities, workshops and lessons. All objectives are designed based on tribal community needs and their own voiced strategies to overcome AI/AN students' barriers to college and carrier readiness. 2 CERTIFICATION REGARDIN G LOBBYING Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans, and Cooperative Agreements The undersigned certifies, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, that: (1) No Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of the undersigned, to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of an agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal grant, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

We have designed our project to be equally accessible in an effort to reach students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. Special components of our project that address participants who may be less likely to get involved in our program include collaborating and coordinating with local schools Special Education teachers to make sure project activities are complementary to the needs of Special Education students. Also, we will be receiving the input and participation of male-Karuk Tribal members to help young male students gain interest in our program and also participate in project activities. It has been identified by local school teachers that there is a lack of positive male-role-models so we want to make sure we provide these to the students so they will be more likely to participate and gain from our program.

(b)(6) (b)(6) Leaf Hillman Director DNR Karuk Tribe T xecutive Director Karuk Tribe 2 66 Attachment IV NATIVE YOUTH COMMUNITY PROJECT: KARUK PIKYA V FIELD INSTITUTE Evidence of Capacity Karuk Tribe Relevant Achievements and Successfu l Outcome s: The Karuk Food Security Project Coordinator will serve as interim Project Director until the position is filled, as per tribal policy. A tribal member and mother of 6 tribal youth -3 of which are in their final years of undergraduate and graduate studies, Lisa Hillman has built upon her 20 years' experience teaching college-level students to develop the Karuk Food Security Project into its cunent highly successful and acclaimed establishmen t. Of the many objectives progressed under her management, the Sfpnuuk Digital Library, Archives and Museum (Sipnuuk, https://sipnuuk.mukurtu.net/ ) is one of the cornerstones. Out of the original concept of a simple digital repository for document s pertaining to the Native and conventio nal food systems in the mid Klamath region, Mrs. Hillman was able to secure additional funding sources and key partners with a host of academic and non-profit organizat ions to build online digital resource for tribal communities, local residents, and the public which reflects and augments comprehensive collections of: regional food security issues, knowledge of traditional foods and materials, Nanu'avaha K-12 Cuniculum including lesson plans and supplementary materials, Karuk history, language, traditions, knowledge and living culture. Access to resources is based on Karuk defined cultural protocols. Her knowledge and experience with developing policies, protocols and grant proposals was essential to Sipnuuk's successful launch in March, 2016. With her experience in curriculum developm ent and extensive knowledge in Karuk cultural heritage, Mrs. Hillman has also developed almost 60 lesson plans for the Nanu'avaha K-12 Curriculum that meet the California Common Core State Stands and that have gained the support of the Karuk Tribe, local schools, and parents for implementation. These lessons balance western science and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to focus on culturally relevant content: the Karuk Tribe is located on the Klamath River in Northern California and is well-versed in its tribal history and has been a leader in the resurgence of using TEK to inform modern day management strategies and practices. In 2015, the proposed interim Project Director conducted three pilot Nanu'avaha Curriculum Trainings for public school teachers and administrators in two LEAs to support effective implementation ofthe Tribe's K-12 Curriculum. These were met with positive teacher feedback and requests for future trainings. Cultural sensitivity was addressed throughout each 1.5-hour training session, and tribally developed handouts provided background information on the Karuk Tribe, as well as a guide to cultural sensitivity when working with Native communities. The Karuk Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is a Tribal department that has seen exceptional growth since it was established in 1989. Founded with a single employee, DNR has grown into a multi-program department that has included over one hundred (100) employees during frre events -all sharing the common mission of protecting, promoting and preserving the cultural/natural resources and ecological processes upon which the Karuk people depend. A focus of DNR is to integrate traditiona l management practices into the current managem ent 67 regime, which is based on traditional principles and philosophy. Under the oversight of DNR, the Food Security Program has carried out over 35 Seasonal Youth Camps and Native Workshops over the past 3 years. These programs have been very well received, as highlighted in the Food Security Surveys and reinforced by the letters of support from participants' parents. Through funding from the U.S Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, DNR has also provided summer employment and training opportunities to Tribal Youth ages 16-21 for the past 3 years, employing at least 10 \"at-risk\" tribal youth each summer in natural resources related services. In addition, DNR has provided an Environmental Education Program for 4 local schools throughout the past 10 years. Activities have included hands on classroom and field experience in the fields of ethnobotany, water quality, and fisheries. With marginal funding through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Karuk Tribe Education Department has provided tutoring, scholarships, academic advising, and extracurricular activities for Tribal Youth in each of our three major communities for over a decade. Local public schools coordinate activities with the Karuk Tribe on a regular basis, and have shown continued interest in furthering collaborations to provide services their underserved students need desperately. In 2011 the Tribe began working with the ih Generation National Tribal Mentoring Program, which resulted in a Youth Wellness Program providing services to Title VII students from 2011\u00ad 2015. Cultural activities and tribal ceremonies played a major role in program activities, and the recruited community volunteers mentoring these at-risk youth reported positive results in the youth, such as drug and alcohol abstinence and school attendance improvements. Since 2012, Karuk Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Department has committed its support of DNR's Food Security Project, which offers activities and events that cultivate TEK\u00ad based subsistence living and traditional land management, as well as promotes cultural values placed on honor, respect and responsibility in AI/AN families. In 2013, the National Endowment for the Arts funded the Ikmahachraam Project (Engl. Sweathouse), which was successfu lly carried out through DNR management and encouraged participation in culturally appropriate healing sweats. Project partners include the Mid Klamath Watershed Council (MKWC), a non-profit organization which has been working in our area to restore the threatened Klamath and its upslope habitats since 2001. It is in the mutual interests of MKWC and DNR to coordinate environmental education programs in order to expose both Native and non-Native students to the combined strengths of TEK and Western science: biologists, environmental educators, and silviculturali sts make up MKWC's staff. 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute 68 Attachment V Evidence of Involvement of Indian Tribes and Parents Project staff will coordinate with the local school Indian Parent Committees to make sure that their feedback is incorporated into the project activities, outcomes, and deliverables. Meetings are held monthly or bi-monthly. Meetings attended or held by staff to gain feedback from Indian Parents regarding needs, opportunities, and potential solutions to challenges of Indian Students include: Junction Elementary School Parent Meeting: April 13t11, 2016 Karuk Education Committee: April 20th, 2016 Happy Camp Indian Parent Committee: April 26111, 2016 Orleans-Parent Meeting Karuk Education Department: May 12t11, 2016 Included in Attachment G are letters of support from Indian Parents. They have helped to inform the project design. They are very excited about this new opportunity and have expressed that it is a greatly needed project. Finally, as identified in the evaluation of our grant as part of the external evaluation process, the Tribe's Education Committee, Indian Parent Committees, AI/AN students and parents, and the 9 Tribal Council members will be asked to participate in focus group discussions and/or respond to annual feedback surveys to determine their awareness of, and satisfaction with, the Pikyav Field Institute and to elicit their suggestions for improvements in ensuing years. 69 Attachment VI NATIVE YOUTH COMMUNITY PROJECT: KARUK PIKYA V FIELD INSTITUTE Demonstration of Research Basis The proposal goals, objectives, and activities were informed by research and evidence, as shown in the References attachment. Included are multiple sources of information that support the Karuk Tribe's overarching goa] to improve the academic performance and college-and career\u00ad readiness of AI/AN K-12 students in the in Karuk Tribal Service Area. Key research used as the basis for this proposal follows by the relevant project purpose addressed: To Improve Academic Performance . The Karuk Tribe Department of Natural Resources solicited evaluative informal feedback from participation teachers in the Nanu'avaha Curriculum and Cultural Sensitivity pilot trainings. Lessons learned through this effort, in addition to the overwhelming positive formal questionnaire response from our AllAN parents, tribal leaders, and local school staff for developing these trainings, informed the initial basis for our Teacher Trainings objective for public school teachers. Key research articles that contributed to the conceptual design of this objective include: Executive Office of the President (December 2014). 2014 Native Youth Report (p. 19), retrieved from https://www.whitehouse .gov/sites/default/file s/docs/20141129nativeyouthrep01t final.pdf.

For our K-12 Lessons objective, we have used the following research-based materials to ensure that our culturally relevant and academically challenging lessons meet the California Common Core State Standards in the English Language Arts, as well as in our effort to meet the needs of local teachers and students to design additional Traditional Ecological Knowledge and STEM\u00ad based lessons that meet California's Next Generation Science Standards: Barnhardt, R. and Kawagley A.O.

Additionally, the development of the Pikyav Field Institute concept and our objectives for Higher Education Opportunitie s and Workforce Development in the natural resources and STEM fields are based not only on our own tribal needs to manage our homelands according to tribal knowledge and codes, but on projected 70 increases ofjob opportunities within the Klamath Basin due to pending dam removals and current and future wildfire conditions. We have been able to secure funding to employ tribal youth each summer in our natural resource departments, and have drawn heavily from lessons learned. In addition, we have drawn upon sources such as the following research and evidence to develop our objectives: Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (February 2012). 1994s Extension , Retrieved from http://land -grant.org/docs/FY20 l 3/94E.pdf.

Project funding for this position will be tied directly to establishing a workforce development program for the Project's targeted Al/AN youth and integrating these activities into a sustainable TANF-funded Workforce Development Project. Additional funding will be solicited for forest stewardship and wildland fire management trainings for Al/AN youths in partnership with federal, state, and tribal government agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and academic institution s. Throughout the course of the grant DNR and the Tribal Education Department will evaluate the opportunity of pursuing accreditation of the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute. This would facilitate sustainable funding opportunities for AI/AN youth; increase students' understandings of issues related to natural resources in a place-based setting; and establish eligibility for funding off-campus environmental education programs developed with partnering academic institutions , including pre-college credit for accredited field seminars. During the grant period the Tribe will formalize agreements with partnering institutions (UC Berkeley, Humboldt State, University of Oregon) to host environmental education opportunities , such as summer field research projects and K-12 STEM-related data collection activities. Finally, as mentioned within the grant, many of the local schools receive Title 7 funding (totaling over $74,000). Throughout the grant period we will work with the local schools to try to use some of those funds to the highly successful K-12 Curriculum Implementation and Teacher Training and sustain other project activities . 72 Attachment VIII Lisa Morehead-Hillman Food Security Project Coordinator Karuk Department of Natural Resources r '') I Career Synopsis Professional Preparation 12/2010 05/1988 Career emphasis in grant management, writing and reporting, educat ion and curriculum deve lopment, public speaking, and foreign languages.

Please see resume for more information regarding my experience with CA state standard s. Please see Indian Land Tenure Curriculum website or Margo Robbin s, KTJUSD Indian Education, for my experience with creating cultura l curricul um aligned with CA State standard s. I've been particip ating in the movem ent to provide community and culturally based education in American Indian communities since I was a child. I was rai sed by my mother, who is Wyandot/Ojib we Native, imparting the searc h for truth and justice. It is time for the voice of the people telling our own stories , not havin g them told by the dominant culture and its accompanying political myth s. 7 81 As an !TEPP student, I did presentations about the Native Perspective: CA Gold Rush and Missions in local elementary schools. As the social science teacher for the American Indian Academy Charter High School, we focused on the local tribes relationship with the salmon in partnership with artist Lyn Risiling, resulting in four murals on display in the UIHS Potowot. Our high school students attended and spoke at a local FERC meeting in Eureka. FERC is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , regarding the darns on the Klamath River. The students made signs, interviewed Native biologists, and learned about traditional weir and fish dam. My goal was to provide the education needed to prepare Native youth to advocate for their land, fish, culture, and sovereignty. This movement is resistance to the genocide that has been committed upon Native peoples, also in response to the systematic theft of children in the boarding school era, resulting in de-culturation and loss of identity, another form of cultural genocide. This movement to find justice, includes Tribe's rights to pass on traditions to their children in the way they see fit in accordance with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. There abounds scientific evidence and academic research showing the success of Native students in such an environment. I have committe d my life to the truth\u00ad telling process, and being ofservice to communities' work. I already have made strong relationships with many community members, families, and educators within Karuk ancestral territory, including Orleans Elementary principal Jason Henderson. I've been invited and attended Karuk ceremonies and welcomed Karuk cultural education from community members/parents in my own classroom, including Karuk language lessons. My approach is to make relationships with parents, community organizations, current teachers and other educational personnel, because the success of curriculum is based on cooperative, positive relationships based in respect with the students, parents, community, educators, and administrators. 82 Department ofNatura l Resou rces Karuk Tribe Orleans Medica l Cllnlc 39051 Highway 96 325 Asip Road Post Office Box 282 Post Office Box 249 Orleans .

During the data collection phase of the project, this concept was modified, as only one of the five volunteer interviewees had worked with Nanu'avaha at the time. Instead, participants were asked about their experiences in-classroom with culturally responsive curricula and pedagogical approaches. This research is expected to provide long-term benefits to the Tribe and local student, including: informative data on the efficacy of current teacher trainings and need for further training development; an increase in the implementation frequency of culturally sensitive and academically challenging curriculum materials, and; qualitative data on teacher experiences with and sensitivity to Karuk curriculum . Indirectly, local students will benefit from an informed approach to teacher trainings and further curriculum development. Additionally, this research seeks to broaden understanding of culturally responsive curriculum and pedagogy (CRC/CRP) through an examination of a crucial step in Native education: CRC/CRP implementation by local teachers. Data was collected in the form of interviews from elementary school teachers , the majori ty of whom are currently working to implement Nanu 'avaha or otherwise similar CRC programs within the Karuk Tribe 's Ancestral Territory and homelands . However , it should be noted that of the five participants included in the study, one was currently implementing Nanu 'avaha, two had been implementing the CRC provided by KT JUSD , and two were in the process of preparing for Nanu 'avaha implementation but had not utilized it within the class at the time of interview . As per the Protoco l with Agreement for Intellec tual Property Rights of the Karuk Tribe, I understand that the Karuk Tribe reserves the rights to all products of this research. Research Questions: To examine the implementation of CRC within classrooms serving Karuk youth, the primary research question was developed: 1. How can professional development programs be designed to incentivize educators to be more receptive to teaching culturally responsive curriculum? I attempted to garner insigh ts speaking to this by exploring the following questions throughout the semi-structured interview process: 109 a) What has worked well? What benefits to students have teachers been able to identify in the pilot lessons they've conducted in the classroom (e.g. increased levels of attention, enthusiasm for curriculum materials , length of attention span, etc.)? b) What aspects of Nanu'avaha do teachers have challenges with implementing, and why? c) What changes would they like to see with the curriculum they work with, and why? d) Are there specific characteristics about each teacher's professional and personal backgrounds that may influence the experiences they've had with the curriculum or the kinds of changes they want to see? This is a qualitative study, designed to analyze trends and emerging themes that are representative of the sample. The study is designed to focus primarily on the teachers, their experiences, and their personal and professional backgrounds. Generalizability is limited due to the niche scope of the current project, its small sample size, self-selection bias for participants, and the single method approach of the study. These limitations are explicitly stated in the thesis and data has been analyzed accordingly . For the purposes of this project, it is most significant to extract trends and emerging themes from collected data. These themes will be important in determining areas to cover in more detail during teacher preparation programs for culturally relevant curriculum such as Nanu'avaha. Project Intent/Benefits to the Tribe: This research study has gathered information and data from schools within Karuk Ancestral Territory, with the intent of garnering data regarding teacher experiences with the implementation of the Nanu'avaha curriculum program. Having a document that reflects the needs of teachers serving our Karuk students would also allow us a better understanding of the extent to which teacher preparation and characteristics impact the efficacy of cultural curriculum implementation in the classroom. Documenting information about culturally responsive curriculum and teacher involvement could also be helpful in future efforts to increase teacher sensitivity and knowledge of the cultural materials they're asked to teach. Additionally , the information gathered is expected to benefit tribal youth attending schools within Karuk ancestral territory, whose education this research hopes to inform. Methods: This is a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews as the sole source of data. Interviews were conducted with elementary school teachers within Karuk Ancestral Territory. Participants were asked about their teacher preparation programs, experiences with CRC and/or pedagogical approaches in their classrooms, and how those experiences influence both teachers and students in practice. Once collected, data was analyzed for dominant themes and characteristics regarding preparation, curricular materials, and pedagogical strategies. Findings disseminated from interviews are organized within seven themes, from which interpretations and analysis have been determined. In the following passage, a summary of conclusions and associated recommendations from each theme are detailed: Examining the Implementation of Culturally Responsive Schooling in Karuk Ancestral Territory 2 110 Preparation. Teachers discussed the benefits of Native-specific formal training methods in approaching their work within schools serving Karuk youth. Much of this discussion took place with regards to their educational preparation rather than preparation for Nanu'avaha itself, as participants had not received a formal training at the time of interview. However, insights gathered speak to the value of training programs to impart local knowledge and contextualize Indigenous experiences for educators prior to their engagement with CRC. For the purposes of Nanu'avaha , findings suggest the relevance of a mandatory training session within each school tasked with implementation, much like those designed and conducted by the Karuk Tribe thus far. Indigenous Community Support. Conclusions to be drawn from this analysis of ICS include the benefit of continuous formal support when working with cultural curricula, preferably in the form of a hired local Native representative within the classroom. Participant experiences suggest that the presence of a knowledgeable Karuk tribal member, either within the classroom during lessons or as an assistant to educate local teachers prior to lesson implementation , enhances accountability and commitment to lessons for both teacher and tribal representatives . In the same way, it increases student learning in the classroom through provision of supplementary information, which tribal members can often contribute. Informal sources of cultural learning (e.g. classroom visits from cultural practitioners , culturally-oriented field trips) were promoted as valuable and irreplaceable resources as well, as they allow for a multi-faceted and engaging learning experience for students. Connection to Local Community. Connection to the community was explored through a series of questions regarding teacher experiences transitioning into their current jobs, as well as their personal experiences building relationships to the local community . This component of the study intends to inform helpful strategies for teachers in adjusting to work within a niche cultural region such as Karuk Ancestral Territory. These qualities include exhibiting commitment to the community and a genuine motivation to teach local youth; maintaining relationships and dialogues with parents, guardians, and family members of his students, and; understanding and demonstrating sensitivity to social ills, community issues, and cultural norms. Qualities discussed as successful in assisting educators as they transition into local schools can also hold true in terms of building connections to the local community . If utilized, these strategies may prove useful in attracting and maintaining teachers within Native communities, and can provide insight for educators in their approaches to CRC/CRP. References to Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP). Participants have discussed incorporating CRP into classroom activities and experience as essential for serving Native youth and constructing classrooms that allow all students to feel safe, valued, and supported. This includes certain key elements, including: engaging students in projects that increase critical thought and understanding of their environment , from both a natural and sociocultural perspective; facilitating regular classroom discussions regarding aspects of student cultures present in the classroom; having high expectations for all students, and supporting them to see those expectations met; Examining the Implemen tation of Culturally Responsive Schooling in Karuk Ancestral Territory 3 111 facilitation of learning processes which children to can connect to personally, and; fostering interpersonal skills among students. Accessibility of Curricular Materials. Teachers were asked about relevant experiences with CRC and their feasibility from a logistical perspective . Beneficial components mentioned were: workbooks and learning games, which allows for kinesthetic learning and dynamic approaches to the lessons; lesson organization , and; inclusion of mixed-methods strategies to enhance learning with regards to local cultural materials. In the case of the one teacher implementing Nanu'avaha , having a tribal representative test run the curriculum through a demonstration lesson for the class was cited as an incredibly important resource. Areas for improvement include the need for continued assistance with aspects of cultural knowledge , especially Karuk language. This could occur in the form of an online dictionary or other auditory resources for pronunciation. Also highlighted was an interest in boxes of cultural materials relevant to Nanu'avaha, which could be kept for school or classroom use to supplement lessons, and a contact list of local cultural practitioners for teachers to coordinate with. Lastly, one teacher mentioned a need to improve the age-accessibility of materials, especially for younger grades. Barriers to Implementation. In two of the three schools incorporated within this study, Nanu'avaha had not yet been implemented. The following were mentioned as barriers: Lack of funding to purchase curriculum and/or supplementary materials Need for increased consistency from tribal programs Harmful assumptions regarding efficacy of CRC/CRP within the school system Unexpected Findings. Need for increased technology in local schools (can assist CRC/CRP) Need to recognize/respect inter-tribal community diversity in classroom Recommendations and Contributions Future researchers should aim to affirm tribal sovereignty in discussions of schooling for Native students, and should utilize methodological approaches which demonstrate accountability to the local community. This requires acknowledgement of the interconnected nature between tribal sovereignty and educational sovereignty , and should also recognize the value of community-based cultural knowledge within the classroom . Furthermore , future researchers should seek to include both qualitative and quantitative data in their endeavors to enhance the legitimacy and generalizability of their studies. Prospective teachers who may engage with schools serving Native youth should seek out resources and formal training as preparation in ways that suit their own interests, while also promoting critical thought about the historical context of Indigenous communities in the U.S. Once immersed within tribal communities, formal training should be implemented to improve understanding of the sociocultural and regionally specific context they will be working in. In these trainings, it is important to address the role of harmful assumptions with regards to Native students and communities. These Examining the Implementation of Culturally Responsive Schooling in Karuk Ancestral Territory 4 112 assumptions are a manifestation of racist ideologies which can and do impede the development of healthy identities among Native youth. These are particularly important to prioritize with respects to CRC programs such as Nanu 'avaha, but can also benefit educators without a curricular program whose students could benefit from a culturally responsive approach to pedagogy . Furthermore, Karuk training programs and associated curricula could benefit teachers and students by ensuring that the following aspects are included throughout the program: Continuous formal support in the classroom, preferably in the form of a hired Native representative A set of physical representations of relevant cultural materials to supplement lessons and improve student learning (e.g. basket materials , tools used for cultural practices) Language resources to assist teachers with Karuk language materials Contact information of Karuk practitioners willing to participate in educating local students on distinct skills and cultural aspects , which teachers can utilize in their efforts to supplement lessons with multifaceted approaches that enhance student learning . Confidentiality /Consent: All data gathered from participants has been coded for anonymity and stored in password-protected documents , so that no responses can be traced to individuals affiliated with the Tribe or local schools. Since the process of analysis has been completed , data can be destroyed or kept within tribal archives upon project finalization. Participants were given detailed information regarding the project, as well as a consent form to be signed that described the study, any risks and benefits , and information on their rights as study participants. In Section II, e, the Principles of Confidentiality are addressed in Practicing Pikyav : A Guiding Policy for Collaborative Projects and Research Initiatives with the Karuk Tribe. This principle recognizes that the Karuk Tribe , at its sole discretion, has the right to exclude information from publication and/or to require confidentiality for information, particularly with respect to information concerning their culture , traditions , mythologies , sacred sites or spiritual beliefs. In agreement with these principles, this research collaboration also agrees to explicitly describe how the research will ensure confidentiality within the research proposal and Data Management Plan. This agreement will be adhered to, as well as any proposed by the Stanford IRB, as long as it does not conflict with the needs and desires of the Karuk Tribe. Data Management/Tribal Archives: The data gathered as a part of this research project will be solely documented in electronic copies of interviews. The researchers involved will agree to provide all data, both hard and electronic copies, to a repository at the Karuk Tribe 's Department of Natural Resources , as per the Policy for Intellectual Property Rights of the Karuk Tribe Research, Publication and Recordings. We also acknowledge and support the Karuk Tribe 's right to complete access and co-ownership Examining the Implemen tation of Cultura lly Responsive School ing in Karuk Ancestral Terri tory 5 113 of any information we obtain. The Karuk Tribe will also be included as a co-author of the final research project. Risks: At the current time, no negative experiences have been reported. In moving forward, negative impacts on the cultural, social, economic or political well-being of the Tribe or Tribal members are not anticipated. Funding: Outside funding has not been incorporated in the development and implementation of the current research project. Equity/Empowerment: As per the stipulations of Practicing Pikyav: A Guiding Policy for Collaborative Projects and Research Initiatives with the Karuk Tribe, this proposed research project is designed to meet the Tribe's requirements for a fair and appropriate return. Not only will the Tribe receive all raw data gathered in the process of this research, but will also receive an electronic and two hard copies of the final product upon KRAS and Tribal Council approval. Should the Tribe wish, I will send an electronic copy of an approved final product to the administrative offices of each participating local school. Furthermore , should the Tribe wish to collaborate on any peer-reviewed article to increase readership of this research, I will willingly work with a tribally approved co\u00ad author. Research Timeline: Research conducted within this project has been upheld in conjunction with the timeline set forth by the Graduate School of Education (GSE) Honors Program through Stanford University . Data collection was conducted during the winter months of 2015-2016. Further analysis and thesis composition was completed during the late winter and throughout the spring of 2016. The project itself culminates on May 27, 2016 in accordance with the conclusion of the GSE Undergraduate Honors Program.

To aid in identifying Tribal name changes and corrections, the Tribe's previously listed or former name is included in parentheses after the correct current Tribal name.

The Karuk Tribe has a strong foundation to be able to launch this innovative project based on many years of creative and effective work by the Karuk Department of Natural Resources integrating education on bio-cultural systems into K-12 education and tribal youth development. I have had the fortunate opportunity to work with Karuk tribal members for the past decade through different collaborations with UC Berkeley. I was one of the co-founders of the Karuk\u00ad UC Berkeley Collaborative in 2008. Over the past ten years we have arranged for scores of Karuk school children to visit the different STEM departments at UC Berkeley. In 2012, we commenced the 5-year Klamath Basin Tribal Food Security Project, a collaborative research and education project between UC Berkeley and the Karuk, Yurek and Klamath Tribes, funded by the USDA's Agriculture and Food Research Institute. I have worked with the Principal Investigator , Jennifer Sowerwine on this project in collaboration with members of the Department of Natural Resources at the Karuk Tribe. These collaborative programs have supported Karuk Tribal members collaborating with UC Berkeley scientists working on a variety of projects to enhance ecosystem health, human health, cultural revitalization , and tribal youth education and development. I have had the opportunity to work closely with Tribal leaders who are committed to developing important regional restoration and recovery work within the Klamath Basin biocultural region. There is no question that engaging Tribal Youth with the goals of strengthened academic performance , college and career readiness is essential to the preservation of local ecosystems and to the economic future of the Tribal community. Supporting such engagement is a logical next step for the University of California at Berkeley in our collaborative work with the Karuk Tribe. I have conducted multiple workshops for the Karuk Tribe on how to collect, press, dry, mount, and curate plant specimens . A spectrum of ages, from children to elders, attended these workshops. We now have established a Karuk Tribe herbarium w here they can curate the mounted plant specimens and use them for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes. This herbarium will contribute to the scientific and educational programs planned for the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project. In support of the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project, I am committed to: 126 1) teaching summer workshops related to STEM disciplines at the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute 2) supporting the development of STEM-related curriculum content with an innovative learning focus 3) facilitating tailored tours for Tribal Youth to key University of California Berkeley STEM departments and programs 4) exploring reciprocal college credit opportunities at the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute In addition to the educational programs and workshops I have contributed to for the Karuk Tribe, I also bring in a spectrum of experiences in STEM education . I am a human biologist, evolutionary biologist, and an ethnobotanist and I teach a spectrum of STEM courses at UC Berkeley. I work with John Matsui, a Dean at UC Berkeley, on his Biology Scholars Program that focuses on enhancing STEM education to UC Berkeley undergraduates from underserved backgrounds . I am also a pediatrician so I have insight into how educational goals and objectives relate to the different developmental stages from birth to 18 years of age. As a faculty member at UC Berkeley I am involved in STEM education programs in K-8 public schools in the Berkeley area. This includes my involvement in the, \"Be A Scientist STEM Partnership \" with other faculty and graduate students from UC Berkeley who go into the local public middle schools to contribute to the science education. I also oversee a program where my undergraduates who have taken my human anatomy course, then go into the local public schools and teach anatomy to children in the elementary grades. So I not only believe in the vital importance of the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute, I bring in skills that will enable me to make valuable contributions to this program. The Karuk Pikyav Field Institute program is innovative and will create an educational framework that will be a model that other Native American groups can learn from. I give my strongest recommendation for the Office of Indian Education in the U.S. Department of Education to support Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project. Sincerely , Thomas J. Carlson, M.D., M.S.

Re: The Karuk Tribe's Application to the FY 2016 Indian Education Demonstration Grants Program To Whom It May Concern; I am delighted to offer my support for the Karuk Tribe's Native Youth Community Project titled the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project. As you can see this is a highly worthwhile and innovative proposal. I have engaged in multiple collaborative research projects with the Karuk Tribe's Department of Natural Resources over the past 13 years, and I welcome the opportunity to continue this collaboration through this present proposal. With my role as faculty here at the University of Oregon I am in a strong position to support the Karuk Tribe in their work to improve the academic performance, career-and college-readiness of American Indian/Alaska Native (Al/AN) students living within the boundaries of the Karuk Ancestral Territory and homelands. The fact that I am currently conducing the Karuk Tribe's Climate Vulnerability Assessment means that I regularly visit the Klamath region. Both the climate assessment and my past research will provide important resources for the project. Our past collaborative research on the health effects of altered diet, and the impacts of forest management have been used as the basis for Karuk educational curriculum. My past publications have been contributed as supplemental texts for the program. This research has included Karuk youth and young adults whenever possible. For example, I served as a mentor to Karuk high school students, assisted a recent high school graduate in preparing a research project on diabetes and health, and involved youth in the process of interviews. I have found the process of working with the Karuk Tribe enormously rewarding both personally and professionally and I am eager to continue to collaborate and assist in the successful realization of these projects. Here at the University of Oregon I am also in a position to aide with outreach and assist with research collaborations with my own graduate students as well as other faculty colleagues.

For the past three years, with funding from the U.S. Geological Survey's Tribal Liaison Office, we have conducted a four-day workshop-The Tribal Youth Workshop on Water-in collaboration with the Karuk, Pit River, and Quartz Valley Tribes, the U.S. Forest Service, and the College ofthe Siskiyous. The purpose ofthe workshop is to give Tribal youth (ages 14-18) the opportunity to discuss the meaning ofwater, learn water quality and water discharge field-monitoring techniques, and to analyze and discuss their field data while in a college setting. A goal ofthe workshop is to integrate Tribal Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Western science to show that both are critical to solve the natural resource challenges we face. One aim ofthe workshop is to inspire Tribal youth to consider careers in natural resources. To that latter end, we bring in experts to discuss wildfire management and forestry, we tour a fish hatchery and a native plant nursery, and bring in our own expertise in volcanology, ecology, hydrology , geology and disaster management into field and classroom discussions . Our collaboration with the Karuk Tribe on the Tribal Youth Workshop for Water has been a positive experience, but realize that the workshop is just a small part in engaging Tribal students in natural resource issues. Thus, I strongly support the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project proposal and its goals to train Tribal youth in TEK and Western science throughout their K-12 careers. Furthermore, I strongly agree with the project's stated goal to increase Tribal professional participation in the natural sciences both to fully represent Tribal interests in the national arena and to provide qualified candidates to fulfill (and develop) Tribal Department ofNatural Resources jobs.

The Karuk Tribe is well positioned to launch The Pikyav Field Institute Project in light oftheir years ofdedication, hard work , and innovative strategies to promote youth development and higher education opportunities for their tribal youth . The University ofCalifornia at Berkeley has b een honored to collaborate for the past decade with the Karuk Tribe , and in particular with the committed staff of the Karuk Depar tment of Natural Resources , on a range ofnatural resource , traditional ecological knowledge , youth, and other eco-cultural revitalization initiatives. I currently serve as Principal Investigator for the 5-year Klamath Basin Tribal Food Security Project, a collaborative research and education project between UC Berkel ey and the Karuk, Yurok and Klamath Tribes , funded by the USDA's Agriculture and Food Research Institu te. In this role, I have worked side by side with Tribal leaders who are deeply engaged in important regional eco-c ultural restoration work and youth educational programs within the Klamath Basin. A primary objectiv e ofour Food Security Grant is to engage youth in camps and afterschool programming , bridging western and traditiona l ecological approaches to resource assessment and management , and teaching science-based gardening and Native food curricula. As co-founder ofthe Karuk-UC Berkeley Collaborative , established in 2008, we promote networking opportunities among tribal members, the scientific community, and other partners to support youth education, triba l health, sustainable land use and cultural resource management, environmental justice, food security and food sovereignty. The Karuk-UC Berkeley collaborative has supported countless college tours, bringing Tribal youth to the UC Berkel ey campus to learn about campus and career opportunities through Cal Day and Come to College Days. Over the years, the need for a coordinated youth leadersh ip, education and development train ing program to prepare Tribal youth for higher education opportunities in the sciences, in order to build internal capacity for future Native resource management leaders in the Klamath Basin, has risen to the surface time and time again. I join the tribe in their assertion that a deeper investment in opportunities for Tribal Youth to achieve academic success, particularly in STEM fields, is necessary for both successful resource management and sustainable economic development in Karuk ancestral lands. As co-lead on the University of 130 California's Global Food Inititiative's Experiential Leaming Committee, I have a deep understanding of the value ofexperiential learning opportunities particularly for youth from under-represented communities in the STEM fields. In support of this project, I am committed to: supporting the development ofSTEM-related curriculum content with an experiential learning focus, teaching summer workshops related to STEM disciplines at the Pikyav Field Institute , facilitating tailored tours for Triba l Youth to key University STEM departments and programs , exploring reciprocal college credit opportunities and the placement of a Cooperative Extension Specialist in the Klamath Basin biocultural region. I believe this proposal is timely and important, fulfilling a critical need identified by Tribal leader ship, in Tribal programming aimed at engaging and training the next generation ofTribal youth in culturally meaningful routes to college and career readiness that will have ongoing positiv e impacts and benefits for generations to come. I hope you will consider supporting the Pikyav Field Institute Project. I trust the investment will have profound and enduring impacts on Karuk youth educational aspirations, opportunities, and engagement, particularly in the STEM fields. Please let me know ifyou have any questions about our current projec t or propo sed future partnership.

I am excited to see the efforts of the Karuk Tribe in their pursuit of a demonstration grant that will assist in building a college going culture for American Indians. The efforts of the Karuk Tribe complement many of the initiatives of Humboldt State University and specifically initiat ives of the Indian Natural Resources, Science and Engineering Program (INRSEP). The INRSEP house supports underrepresented college students in pursuit of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) major undergraduate and graduate degrees. Unfortunately, our most underrepresented students are our American Indians and Alaska Natives. We strive to be exemplary partners with our regional Tribes, such as the Karuk Tribe. The Karuk Tribe , along with other Tribal partners, assist INRSEP with our mission of blend ing scientific concepts and cutting edge technology with our ancestors' traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and indigenous knowledge systems {IKS). We believe this fore mentioned blending is the best way to create scientists that are ready to take on the perplexing challenges of our world; and rekindle humanities stewardship responsibilities to our lands . In their own ways, the Karuk Tribe shares similar goals. Through tapping back into our ancestors' managerial practices for guidance, this demonstration grant will aid in linking many initiatives shared by the INRSP house. Within our abilities, INRSEP commits to support the role that the Karuk Tribe is fulfilling as a feeder to Humboldt State University for future Karuk citizens as well as other Amer ican Indians.

Re: Support for the Karuk Tribe's Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project. To Whom It May Concern: As a Southern Cheyenne Tribal Member married to a Karuk and mother of four Tribal youth, I write this letter in full support of the Karuk Tribe's Application to the FY 2016 Indian Education Demonstration Grants Program. My children and I have participated regularly in the diverse array ofworkshops and seasonal youth camps offered by the Department of Natural Resources, learning many things about Native plants and traditional ways of harvesting and preparing foods. While we are active in Karuk Pikyavish (fix the world) Ceremonies, we appreciate being able to be around other tribal families and learning new things. At school, two of my daughters and my son have been able to learn about the Karuk culture in class through the Tribe's Nanu'avaha Curriculum. The lessons are challenging and full of useful information that pertains to them, and the vocabulary words-both the English and the Karuk words and phrases\u00ad and the writing assignments have been t hankful additions to their everyday lessons. I know that the Food Security grant is coming to a close, and I am worried that we won't have as many opportunities to learn about Karuk culture and heritage. This grant is really needed: not only to keep events and activities on our calendar, but also to put a tribal teacher in the classrooms . I really like the idea of having more science, math and technology into the lessons. I also think that having workforce development opportunities in the natural resources is needed for our youth. Of course I want my kids to go to college later, but I want them to know they can do it. By having lessons, activities, summer jobs and tribal role models in the environmental sciences, I know they will be able to see themselves as being able to do just that. With our particular location in the mountains of northern California and on the Klamath River, we have many job opportunities here that pertain to the natural resources. Please support the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project as we, and other tribal families, do: absolutely.

Barriers to ColJege-and Career-Readiness of Local Indian Students. The federally recognized Karuk Tribe (Tribe) proposes a comprehensive, community -driven, culturally appropriate, and evidence- based Native Youth Community Project. The Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project will improve academic performance, career-and college-readiness, and the college matriculation rates of American Indian/ Alaska Native (Al/ AN) students attending five small rural schools located within the Karuk Aboriginal Territory in northern California's mid\u00ad Klamath River region. The geographic area includes three SRSA-eligible (*) schools in five LEAs: Orleans Elementary, Junction Elementary* (Somes Bar), Forks of Salmon Elementary*, Happy Camp Union Elementary*, and Happy Camp High School. Because it was 80% timber-dependent before the timber industry collapsed in the early 1990s, Happy Camp (where the Tribe's central offices are located) was declared \"one of the ten most economically endangered communitie s in the United States.\" In the immediate aftermath of local mill closures, Karuk tribal unemployment peaked at 76% (Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1999). Economic recovery remains elusive-a 2015 Karuk Needs Assessment Survey identified 56% of the responding Tribal service population as unemployed. According to the California Department of Education (CDE, 2014), 75% of students in targeted public schools are socioeconomica lly disadvantaged. The CDE reports an average decline of 37% in student population in the targeted geographic area since 2001. The resulting loss of average daily attendance (ADA) and other State tax-based revenues has severely reduced both capital and operating funds essential to maintaining school infrastructure, adequate professiona l staff, and well-balanced academic offerings, including advanced placement courses. 3 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute The primary beneficiaries of the proposed Karuk Pikyav Fie/4 Institute (\"Project\") will be the 290 students, including 133 AI/ AN students, attending small rural schools located along the Klamath and Salmon Rivers between Orleans in Humboldt County and Yreka in Siskiyou County. The average AI/ AN dropout rate for the two counties is 11.65%, more than one-third higher than the 8.5% national rate. Happy Camp High School has a truancy rate of 56.76%, compared privation and academic underachievement preclude higher education opportunities for most of the targeted AI/AN students-aware of the grim reality of their situation, many students' motivation and self\u00ad esteem also suffer. Despite the Tribe's best efforts to meet the basic needs of families by offering a wide range of health, housing, and human services, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), persistent and pervasive poverty continues to threaten the health, safety, security, and academic achievement of Karuk and other AI/AN students. According to results of the most recent California Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) system in Happy Camp (2013), more than 40% of elementary school students exhibit low academic achievement; that is, only 59 .1 % of students are proficient or advanced in English and language arts, 52.2% in mathematic s, and 38.9% in science. STAR results are worse at the secondary level: among 48 Happy Camp High School students tested, 42.2% were proficient or advanced in English and language arts, 15.9% in mathematics , and 7% in science. Alarmingly, by the 11th grade, 89% were neither proficient nor advanced in English and language arts, with 28% at a basic skill level, 33% below basic, and 22% far below basic. Only 50% of end-of course (EOC) students beyond l l 1h grade had achieved proficiency or basic competency in Algebra I, and the remaining 50% were below basic or far below basic skills. Among 9th graders, 35% had achieved basic competency in earth sciences, 24% were below basic, and 6%, 4 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute far below basic (see Attachment A). According to recent reports, only one-fourth of AI/AN high school graduates who take the ACT score at the college-ready level in math, and one-third score at the college-ready level in reading-rates 50% below their White counterparts (The State of Education for Native Students, 2013). Siskiyou County comparisons of 2013 STAR test results between Al/AN students and all students verify disparities in academic achievement at targeted schools. For CST English-language arts 2nd through l l 1h Grades, 38.6% of AI/ ANs are proficient or advanced, compared to 54.2% of non-Natives; for CST mathematics 2nd through 7111 Grades, 50.99% of AI/ANs are proficient or advanced, compared to 58.54% of non-Natives. Multiple groups of community stakeholders, including Indian Parent Committees, the Karuk Education Committee, Tribal Education staff, and public school personnel, meet monthly or bimonthly to discuss the underlying causes of Al/AN students' low academic performance and identify strategies for improvem ent. Thematic in discussions of causal factors are (a) poverty, (b) a lack of culturally appropriate instructional materials and culturally competent counselors, mentors, teachers, and tutors; and (c) pervasive perceptions among both students and parents that college and career opportunities are severely restricted. Recurring suggestions for improvement include increased parental involvem ent in Al/AN students' education and increased resources to train and hire professional counselors, mentors, teachers, and tutors responsive to the specific needs of AI/ AN students. In addition, there is a need for parents, schools, and Tribal personnel to work together in cultivating a college-going culture-one that enables AI/ AN students to explore career opportunities and identify options for community college and university programs that will prepare them to advance along a variety of realistic and well-planned career paths. Community stakeholder discussions and results of a 2014 Tribal Survey on needs for culturally responsive curricula led to the Tribe's 2016 Needs Assessment for K-12 Education 5 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute (see Attachment B). The first theme corresponds with a 2014 White House Report that declared, \"Native youth-and Native education -are in a state of emergency .\" Leading causes of low academic performance included the lack of culturally relevant curriculum and culturally competent staff who understand how to reach Native youth (Native Youth Report, 2014). More recently, the National Science Board's science and engineering indicators for 2016 confirmed what has been known for decades: AI/ANs are grossly underrepresented \u00ad in-the-s-e-workforce/minorities -in-the-s-e-workforce ). Increased STEM field representation is critical to the future survival of the Karuk Tribe. In the remote, mountainous mid-Klamath River region, economic development opportunities continue to be natural resource driven. The 2012 Karuk Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) identified co-management of federal lands within the Karuk aborigina l territory and environmentally sustainable outdoor recreation and tourism initiatives among the Tribe's top five strategic priorities. The foregoing analysis of academic barriers both in and out of school demonstrate the need to address internal and external barriers to primary, secondary, and post-secondary academic achievement among Native youths. The proposed Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Project has grown out of an unprecedented community-wide partnership through which the Karuk Tribe's Education Program, Department of Natural Resources (DNR), TANF Program, and Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) will collaborate with small rural schools to improve the educationa l experiences and academic performance of Al/ AN and other students. The project utilizes approaches that strengthen and support the cultural identities of Tribal youths and, at the same time, are relevant to needs and opportun ities within local rural communities. It addresses specific gaps and weaknesses in community services, infrastructure, and opportunities for our 6 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Native youths and therefore is consistent with the FY 2016 Demonstra tion Grants for Indian Children's Absolute Priority for Native Youth Community Projects. In addition, Competitive Preference Priority One is met by serving the small rural communities of Orleans, Somes Bar, Forks of Salmon, and Happy Camp, California, and partnering with LEAs eligible under the Small Rural School Achievement and Rural and Low-Income Schools (RLIS) programs. Competitive Preference Priority Two is met by the Karuk Tribe's lead role in the project. In addition, the Karuk Tribe's DNR provides environmenta l education programs funded by the U.S. Depa1tment of the Interior (e.g., the Klamath Basin Tribal Youth Project and the Karuk Environmental Education Program) to targeted schools, aligning the project with Competitive Preference Priority Three. 2. Opportunities in the Local Community to Support Indian Students The Karnk Tribe's K-12 Nanu'avaha Curriculum' has been adopted by the school boards of three public school districts. Reported outcomes have included increased student engagement, willingness to complete lesson assignments, and a changing dynamic with \"at risk\" student population s. Local preschools, elementary schools, and high schools participating in DNR's environmental education classes have expressed overwhelming support for expanding culturally relevant materials, classes, and activities targeting AllAN students. The Karuk Tribal Council, Tribal Education Department , the Indian Parent Committees active in all three primary service areas, as well as a host of Karuk cultural practitioners, have helped to inform our lessons and current environmental education strategies. All collaborators have expressed their continued willingness to contribute to classroom and field activities: these Traditional Ecological 1 Originally developed as a culturally relevant and academically challenging K-12 Native Food System Curriculum that meets English Language Core California Curriculum Standards. 7 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Knowledge (TEK)-supported and/or versed tribal role models are implementing sophistica ted, time-tested knowledge and cultural practices developed since the beginning of time. AI/ AN youth represent the most underachieving racial group in the nation, and their absence from professional fields, especially in the natural sciences, is disheartening. The Tribe is in a prime position to change this trajectory: Professional Native role models currently lead the U.S.D.A. Forest Service and the Six Rivers National Forest. The Tribe continues to develop educational and vocational opportunities for tribal youth and has a commitment from the TANF Depa1tment to support these projects. We currently have contracted educators but need dedicated staffto implement the TEK-and Western science-based K-12 Nanu'avaha curriculum in all local schools on a regular basis. Another opportunity for our youth is a high level of interest from outside agencies, including universities, non-profit organizations, and government agencies, to participate in research and demonstration projects in our very unique ecosystems. Increased human resources are essential to increase and sustain these activities and include more AI!AN students. Through the proposed Pfkyav Field Institute Project, the Karuk Tribe will make significant improvements in the academic performance , college-and career-readiness, and college matriculation and retention rates of Karuk and other AI/ AN students. 3. Existing Policies, Programs, Practices, Service Providers, and Funding Sources The Tribe has a number of existing resources that can be leveraged to meet Project goals, in particular, programs and funding sources that now support the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Founded with one employee in 1989, the DNR has become a multi-program department with as many as one hundred (100) employees during the wildland fire season-all sharing the common mission of protecting , promoting and preserving the cultural and natural resources and ecological systems upon which Karuk people depend for their survival. DNR is committed to 8 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute integrating the Tribe's cultural heritage and TEK into environmenta l education efforts for our tribal youth: For thousands ofyears, we have continued to ... ensure the appropriate relationship between people, plants, the land, and the spirit world. We share our existence with plants, animals, fish, insects, and the land and waters [and] are responsible for their well-being. Our ancestral landscapes overflow with stories and expressions from the past, which remind us of who we are and direct us to implement sound traditional management practices in a traditional and contemporary context (DNR Eco-Cultural Resources Management Plan). DNR's Eco-Cultural Resources Management Plan (ECRMP) outlines an integrated approach to adaptive resource management, linking Western science and TEK-driven research, ethnographic interviews, data collection and analysis to inform the Tribe's contemporary management scheme and environmental education programs. The ECRMP is the foundation upon which DNR has developed its Five-Year Strategic Plan (Karuk DNR Strategic Plan, 2015). Over the past decade, DNR has built collaborative relationships to facilitate environmenta l education and workforce development opportun ities for AI/ AN youth, combining TEK with Western science in classroom and hands-on field activities, e.g., the Kaavfchvaans Project (a summer youth employment project in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, the BIA, and U.S.D.A. Forest Service); the Karuk-UC Berkeley Collaborative, which has dedicated and supported research for more than ten years at undergraduate through post-doctoral and faculty levels in the environmental sciences, related fields of law, and STEM-based education; the Klamath Connection Summer Immersion Program in collaboration with Humboldt State University (HSU), a major studies initiation into natural resources fields; and the Tribal Youth Science Workshop on Water (experiential education for four days each summer), in consultati.on and collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the College of the Siskiyous. 9 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Currently the Karuk Tribal Education Department has U.S. Department of Education funding support from a 2015 Indian Demonstration Grant. Partnering with local high schools to create a \"college culture,\" this project also provides after-school activities, broad-scope career exploration, leadership development, and a supplemental education program in Grades 6-12 at three public schools to enhance the learning experiences of Al/AN and other students. Local schools' Title VII funding is used in different ways. In Yreka it supports an Indian Day Celebration and a few cultural activities at the elementary and middle schools, and, at the high school level, a College Tour. At Happy Camp, Orleans and Junction Elementary Schools, Title VII funding supplements support for Teacher's Aide positions and classroom supplies. Now in the fourth year of a five-year funding cycle, the multi-tribal , multi-agency USDA\u00ad funded Food Security Grant has enabled DNR to work toward achieving a sustainable food system that revitalize s healthy communitie s, restored healthy ecosystems, and a healthy economy grounded in TEK and traditional subsistence practices. These efforts include measuring and monitoring designated plots to document the efficacy of land management techniques on cultural food and fiber species; implementin g and evaluating activities to teach Tribal members and school-age children about traditional resource management, food and fiber harvest, preparation and storage; and improving agro-fo restry management to increase supplies of traditional foods. Another objective was to develop a digital repository for documents related to the Klamath Basin's current and past food system. Achieved in March 2016 with the official launch of the Sfpnuuk Digital Library, Archives and Museum (Sfpnuuk Website), the mission of Sfpnuuk (storage basket) is to manage, share and enhance understanding of Karuk history, language, traditions, natural resource management, and living culture consistent with Tribal cultural protocols and the missions of the Karuk Tribe and its various departments. 10 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Sfpnuuk also serves local schools in accessing materials related to another Project relevant Karuk Food Security objective: the Karuk Tribe K-12 Nanu'avaha Curriculum. Lesson content is derived from traditional and current resource management practices, especially as they affect food, fiber, and medicinal plant resources, as well as Karnk culture and history. All lessons meet the California Common Core Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy (California Common Core, 2013) . DNR has leveraged many partnerships with higher education institutions, including UC Davis, UC Berkeley, HSU, and University of Oregon to secure valuable contributions to lesson content. Participating stakeho lders also include three Indian Parent Committees, the Tribe's Education Department, and the Tribal Education Committee. Another primary objective of the Food Secmity Grant is our operation of Seasonal Youth Camps, during which DNR collaborates with local schools to offer comprehensive multi-day activities focused on the Native foods and traditions important to each season of the year. These camps include guest speakers with TEK and western science backgrounds, food and fiber harvests, and food and fiber preparation activities within a culturally appropriate framework (see photos in Attachment C). Leveraged funding for these efforts currently includes the following: USDA Farm-to-School sub-award introducing Native foods and TEK into school-sponsored activities and developing diet-related diseases lessons for the Tribe 's K-12 Curricu lum. Charles Carter Wentz Foundation grant supports demonstrations by cultural practitioners and K-12 lessons, including a Native youth -produced video entitled \"Fire and Acorns.\" Sierra Health Foundation grant supporting AJJAN student participation in kitchen activities (preparing healthy foods) and a Native Plant Demonstration Garden and Community Garden. IMLS Museum Services Grant supports intergenerational transfer of knowledge to AJJAN youth as well as cultural heritage preservation through digital activities. 11 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute The demonstrated success ofDNR's environmental education projects has led to many other competitive grant awards from federal agencies and private foundations : e.g., Bureau of Indian Affairs, US Fish and Wildlife Services, USDA Forest Service, and the National Endowment for the Arts. In the past year alone, we have met several requests for presentations about Sf pnuuk and our K-12 environmental education projects at state, national, and inter-national conferences. B. Quality of Project Design Karuk Tribal Service Areas 1. Geographic Scope. Karuk people have lived in the mountainous mid-Klamath River region of northern California for thousands of years. With an Aboriginal Territory exceeding one million acres, our ancestors thrived in a subsistence economy supported by a strong culture-based commitme nt to land stewardsh ip. Practicing Pikyav (\"fix it\") ceremonies, the Karuk people lived, worked, and educated their youth in more than one hundr ed villages along the Klamath and Salmon Rivers and their tributaries. The place-based Pikyav Field Institute Project is built upon this history. With a current enrollment of 3,748 members another 4,200 descendants, the Karuk Tribe is among the most geographically dispersed in the nation. The Tribe's Service Area includes Orleans, Somes Bar and Happy Camp-all rural communities where K-12 students face the identified barriers to academic achievement and college-and career-readiness. Public schools specifically targeted by the proposed Pikyav Field Institute Project include Orleans Elementary (in Humboldt County's Klamath-Trinity Joint Unified School District); Junction, Forks of Salmon, and Happy Camp Elementary Schools (three independent LEAs identified as SRSAs in Siskiyou County); and Happy Camp High School (in the Siskiyou Union High School District). 12 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute 2. Project Goals. The Project's overarching goal is to improve the academic performance and college- and career-readiness of AI/AN students in the Karuk Tribal Service Area. Based on the results of recent community needs assessments and current research (Attachment B and D) we will address issues that pose barriers to AI/AN student performance and academic motivation by pursuing the following goals: a. To Improve Academic Performance. Our goal is to support local schools and AI/AN students through regular implementation of culturally relevant and academically challenging lessons based on Karuk cultural heritage and Western science in the many focal areas of environmental education. For example, a recent event for local youth included the traditional harvesting of eels, whereby traditional stories about this important fisheries resource related to eel lifecycles in cultural and historical contexts. Our lessons encourage the participation of parents and Cultural Practition ers, and facilitate students' ability to learn place-based history, science, and culture all in one lesson, an approach that is consistent with AI/AN students' demonstrated preference for experiential indoor-outdoor learning environments (Zwick & Miller, 1996) and curriculum that is culture-and place-based (Barnhardt & Kawagley, 1999). Our curriculum is designed to meet California Common Core Standards, which were adopted to ensure that students are college- and career-ready by the time they graduate from high school. We will augment the current K-12 curriculum, which focuses on standards in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language, and add lessons designed to meet the latest California -approved math and science standards, helping students achieve their college and career goals. In addition, we will improve the cultural sensitivity and STEM-related knowledge and skills of local school educators through a Pikyav Field Institute-led cultural sensitivity and curriculum training program for K-12 teachers, an approach consistent with 13 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute research recommendations for community-based learning experiences which involve immersion in multicultural settings, and interventions at a program level that include field experience and multicultural curriculum (Sleeter 2001 ; Talley 2016). b. To Improve College-and Career-readiness. Together with our project partners, we will facilitate experiential natural resource and culture-based trainings and workforce development opportunities for Tribal youth as an extension of our K-12 Curriculum. Early engagement in college and career preparation increases the likelihood of success in college and career paths (Wyatt, Smith & Proestler, 2014). Based on current and future opportunities for careers in the natural resources , this goal is informed by Tribal youths' expressed desire (82% of students surveyed) to return to/remain in the area following high school graduation. It also aligns with Goal 3 of the Karuk DNR Strategic Plan: To build capacity within the Tribe to address identified program needs, provide for long-term co-management within Karuk Ancestral Territory and homelands, and address high rates of unemployment and poverty among the tribal membership. To increase Al/AN students' career and college motivation, we will invite students from HSU's Indian Natural Resource, Science, and Engineering Program to participate in on-site Project trainings, and faci litate Al/AN high school students' participation in HSU's American Indian College Motivation Day, held annually in the first week of November. The Day features recruiters from numerous California and Oregon colleges and universities , as well as workshops specifically targeting high school freshman , sophomores , juniors, and seniors. We will also make one trip to University of California Berkeley, to attend their CalDay event in April and meet with other Al/AN students and faculty members. By the time they are ready to matriculate, students will have learned about various major subject areas, the careers aligned with those majors, available financial aid and scholarships, and how to apply to college. 1412016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute c. To Reconnect Tribal Youth with Cultural Heritage. An ongoing goal of DNR and various tribal departments is to meet the expressed desire of all 124 students surveyed, and the communities' and school districts' requests to continue cultural heritage-based educational opportunities. Over the past four years, the USDA Food Security Project's opportunities have included workshops dedicated to learning and teaching about Karuk traditional foods, fibers, medicinal plants, and traditions. Seasonal youth camps have been very successfu l, providing local school students with field experiences corresponding with our Tribal K-12 curriculum. Continuing these camps beyond the end of Food Security Grant funding in August 2017, and extending the summer camp for students ages 15-18 and the fall camp for students ages 12-14, are activities inspired by past experiences and identified community , tribal department, and local school needs. This goal will improve AllAN students' self-esteem and their understanding of impo1tant connections between K-12 lesson content, tribal identity and responsibilities, and academic achievement related to their personal career and college goals (Fox, 2006). 3. Objectives a. Pikyav Field Institute Capacity Building. Consistent with DNR's Strategic Plan, the project will build capacity by establishing the Pikyav Field Institute-a capacity-building need that has grown over the past decade. New grant-funded positions will include: 1 FTE: Pikyav Field Institute Program Manager (Project Director) 1 FfE: K-12 Environmental Education Coordinator (K-12 Coordinator) 0.25 FTE: Environ. Workforce Devel./ Internships Coordinator (Workforce Coordinator) 0.1 FfE: Environmental Higher Education Coordinator (Higher Ed. Coordinator) 0.05 FfE Administrative Operations Manager 15 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute New positions will be filled according to Karuk Personnel Policies and Procedures , which include Indian Preference in hiring. In addition to Project staff, we will contract with our Mid Klamath Watershed Council (MKWC) partners to provide western science-based field and classroom experiences on a host of resource identification and monitoring skills. It is in the mutual interests of MKWC and DNR to coordinate environmental education programs in order to expose both Native and non-Native students to the combined strengths of western science and TEK. We will supplement K-12 lessons, as weU as workforce development training and higher education modules, with input and demonstrations by our TEK-versed cultural practitioners. b. Project Management. The proposed Project will support and expand upon existing partnerships and agreements. The Project Director will coordinate Project activities, perform community outreach, ensure grant oversight, supervise the K-12 Coordinator , Higher Education Coordinator and Workforce Development/Intern ships Coordinator , and work with collaborating institutions, agencies and practitioner s to further refine, enhance, and sustain the Project. Activities and Outcome s: The Project Director will communicate weekly with targeted schools, partners/institution s, and guest speakers to schedule at least 80 K-12 lessons and at least 8 field trips for 120 K-12 students per year for hands-on experiences with resource management strategies. Yearly, the Project Director will mentor an estimated 16 tribal youth in more than 60 activities regarding environmental science car\u00b7eers. Workforce and K-12 Coordinator s will work with 7 DNR and 3 MKWC staff to provide more than IO meaningful hands-on classroom and field activities per year for at least 120 K-12 students, and 16 land management field activities for at least 8 tribal youth employees and at least 8 summer camp youth. Additionally, the Higher Education Coordinator will work with at least 3 partnering academic institutions to coordinate summer environmental education projects benefitting Al/AN students. The academic 16 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute performance of 50 AI/AN students will improve measurably, based on such indicators as improved attendance, engagement, and lesson assignment completion; grade reports; and expressed interest in STEM-related fields as college and/or career goals by the end of the third and fourth funding periods. Outreach: Quarterly, the Project Director will collaborate with at least 2 tribal departments, 1 academic institution, and 1 NGO to perform Project outreach. Twelve (12) publications will be developed and 24 hours of informal outreach given for grant-related and associated projects. Oversight: Throughout the funding period, the Project Director will work with the Administrative Operation s Manager to ensure that all grant objectives are successfully achieved. Project Sustainability: It is the goal of DNR and the Tribal Education Department to pursue accreditation of the Karuk Pikyav Field Institute as a holistic primary and secondary Indian education facility. This would facilitate sustainable funding opportunities for AI/AN youth; increase students' understandings of issues related to natural resources in a place-based setting; and establish eligibility for funding off-campus environmental education programs developed with partnering academic institutions, including pre-college credit for accredited field seminars. One option to pursue will be a tribally administered and accredited charter high school, including residential accommodations for AI/ AN youth living outside the service area. This would not only would offer challenging and culturally relevant curricula, but also integrate traditional forms of environmental education, including learning from Elders and through experience. We have already have begun a dialogue with UC Berkeley Cooperative Extension Office partners that may lead to placing a USDA Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service program representative for Higher Education and Research at the Kamk DNR, and our long-term goal is to access grant funds available to land-grant institutions such as the Children, 17 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Youth and Families at Risk and the Federally Recognized Tlibes Extension Program. This may be possible through culturally relevant programs developed collaboratively with existing UC Cooperative Extension partners, or by exploring avenues through which the Tribe can achieve land-grant status as a tribal institution , e.g. the 1994 Land Grant Institutions (1994s Extension, 2012). Realistically achievable outcomes in the proposed Project period include formalizing agreements with 3 partnering institutions to host environmental education opportunities, such as summer field research projects and K-12 STEM-related data collection activities. The TANF program has committed to collaborating with DNR to support Workforce Development services to assist Al/ANs in acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to pursue employment in the field of natural resources. Project funding for this position will be tied directly to establishing a workforce development program for the Project's targeted Al/AN youth and integrating these activities into a sustainable TANF-funded Workforce Development Project. Additional funding will be solicited for forest stewardship and wildland fire management trainings for Al/ AN youths in partnership with federal, state, and tribal government agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and academic institutions. Academic Performance c. Teacher Trainings. In 2015 the Tribe conducted three Nanu'avaha Curriculum Trainings for public school teachers and administrators in two LEAs to support effective implementation of the Tribe's K-12 Curriculum. Cultural sensitivity was addressed throughout each 1.5-hour training session, and tribally developed handouts provided background information on the Karuk Tribe, as well as a guide to cultural sensitivity when working with Native communities. Building on stakeholders ' feedback on the value of trainings for our local teachers (see Attachment B), we will develop expanded training modules that focus on cultural 18 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute sensitivity, our K-12 Curriculum, and relevant STEM content. Training will be tailored to various grade levels for implementation by project staff at all participating schools. Proposed are three training modules each (for teachers of K-3, 4-8, and 9-12 grade levels), to be implemented in each Project year in three targeted school districts (for total of 9 trainings per year). d. K-12 Lessons. The Project Director will develop Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with four (4) targeted LEAs to formalize implementation of environmental education lesson plans inside and outside the classroom, and assist in engaging cultural practitioner s. Each project year, the K-12 Coordinator will schedule and implement at least 80 K-12 Curriculum lessons for students in targeted schools, 10 classroom and 8 field activities for hands-on experiences with land and resource management and monitoring strategies. Each summer, the K-12 Coordinator will design 4 new lessons on climate change and invasive species, including STEM-related activities, and added to the existing K-12 Curriculum for a total of 16 new lessons. While these efforts previously focused on the California Common Core Standards (CCCS) for English\u00ad language arts, the new lessons will focus on Next Generation Science Standards (CDE, 2013) and CCCS for Mathematics ( CDE, 2013). Lesson objectives will include measuring and monitoring designated plots to document the efficacy of land management techniques on the quantity and quality of cultural food and fiber species; measuring and documenting water quality and quantity throughout the year in collaboration with DNR's Water Quality Division; implementing and evaluating events and activities to inform the tribal community on traditional land and resource managem ent, food and fiber harvest, preparation and storage; and improvin g agro-forestry management to increase supplies of traditional foods. College-and Career-readiness. Over 90% of the AI/AN youths currently attending K-8 classes voiced interest in attending college; yet according to reports, many of these do not 19 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute actually do so. Cun-ently, however, 82% of targeted youths are committed to working and raising families in our area at some point after high school graduation (based on questionnaire feedback). Designing K-12 Curriculum lessons around the California Standards for science and math, and balanced with TEK, will further our Al/AN students' college and career readiness. With improved academic performance, increased exposure to college opportunities, Al/ AN college students and Al/AN professionals , and growing perception s of college as an attainable goal-we expect our Al/AN students' interest in college to increase measurably. e. Workforce Development. Throughout the four-year funding period and beyond, DNR will strengthen partnerships with the Tribe's Education and TANF Department s, at least 4 federal agencies and 1 NGO to facilitate youth-focused education and workforce development in natural resource-related restoration and revitalization. The Workforce Coordinator will work closely with the Karuk TANF program to develop trainings and internships for Al/AN youth to acquire marketable skills in traditional land management practices; at least 16 field activities will prepare them for participation in projects supported by inter-agency collaborations, such as the Western Klamath Restoration Partnership project, Roots and Shoots Understory Rx project, and Prescribed Fire Training Exchange program. f. Higher Education Opportunities. Expanding upon years of pilot programs supporting college field experiences, the Higher Ed. Coordinator will leverage partnerships with academic institutions to coordinate summer off-campus satellite programs and facilitate college credit opportunities and placements for AI/ANs in Grades 10-12 pursuing studies in the fields of natural resources and environmental sciences. Building upon a number of successful pilot projects that have been implemented in collaboration with multiple post-secondary institutions and agencies, this objective will optimize environmental education for Al/AN students based on 20 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute values in the ECRMP. It also will build tribal capacity for Native Americans to assume leader ship roles in furthering the mission of the Karuk Tribe and DNR. One example is the Humboldt State University (HSU)-led project entitled \"Klama th Connection \" in which freshman stude nts enrolled in life science courses spend time with DNR in the fall and spring semesters to learn from western scientists, DNR tribal staff and TEK experts on biology, botany, fisheries , and wildlife topics and hand s-on data collection skills. HSU has committed to inviting AllAN students to participate in these on-site activities, as well as to spend follow-up days at HSU to process data in college labs and tour the campus. By the end of project, DNR will have formalized partnerships with at least 3 universities to provide off-campus satellite programs and college readiness programs for secondary school students to earn college credit for participation in the Pikyav Field Institute's on-site summer seminars . Projects designed to contrib ute to the revitalization of cultural species by restoring traditional land and resource management regimes and monitoring changes in condition through both Western science and traditional ecological knowledge-based methods will be highlighted. Cultural Heritage . Teaching Al/AN students and their teachers about their tribal cultural heritage and practices is embedded throughout the Pikyav Institute Project objectives, includin g: g. Seasonal Youth Camps. In the first Project year, the Seasonal Youth Camps will be supported by the final year of the USDA-funded Food Security Grant. Working with Food Security staff, the Project Director will design its Seasonal Youth Camps based on their experience as well as on the input and feedback of tribal staff, parents of AIJAN students, and local educators. Year 2 Pikyav Field Institute Project activities for this objective are: 2 three-day fall \"camps\" located between Happy Camp and Orleans targeting middl e school aged students and dedicated to Native food harvest, e.g. tan oak acorns and salmon ; 21 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute 3 winter \"day camps \" (one at each major population center) focusing on traditional forms of teaching cultural heritage, e.g. story-telling and making regalia and weaving baskets; 3 spring \"day camps\" located at sites near the Happy Camp and Orleans service areas that impart the TEK of managing cultural resources, e.g. preparing sites for cultural burning, imparting oral traditions, and \"digging\" for roots, bulbs, and corms; and 1 week-long summer camp targeting high-school students that leverages funding from the Education Department to support camp-sites, camp supervisors, and food provisions. One summer camp topic of particular significance is cultural fire as a traditional tool for natural resource management, its place in the Karuk ceremonial calendar, its use in traditional sweathouse healing, and its adversarial counterpart: modern day wildfires2. Other topics leading the design of summer camps could be the sacred High Country: its unique ecosystem, climate change considerations, cultural significance, and related TEK. Selection of sites for the summer camps will depend upon prevailing outdoor conditions. 4. Outcomes, Relevance, and Synergies. In terms of predicted outcomes of implementing our Nanu'avaha curriculum, it has been widely asserted by multicultural education scholars that pedagogical approaches which ignore or devalue students' diverse backgrounds are strongly associated with cultural discontinuity, low self-esteem, and poor academic achievement (Castagno and Brayboy, 2008) . Given those findings, we anticipate higher self-esteem, healthy identity development, and measurable 2For thousands of years, Karuk and other Indigenous peoples used fire as a tool to regulate and maintain the health of the ecosystem as a natural process. Starting around the early 1900s, Federal Policy implemented an aggressive fire suppression strategy that has led to \"megafires (Parker, L. 2015)\" due to the build-up of excessive brush, debris, dead trees and limbs, etc. 22 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute proactive engagement and behaviors within the classroom resulting throu gh increased implementation of our curric ulum. to improving academic performance: Strengthening/expanding collabora tions with our stakeholders to prepare 12 outreach publications promoting participation by commu nity members, AI/ AN students, and public school personnel in schoo l-and field site-based project activities per year. Providing at least 24 hours of informa l outreach to AI/ AN youth via word-of-mou th and social media networks about project activities and assoc iated projects per year. Developing 4 new STEM-based environm ental educat ion lesson plans based on California Curriculum Standards for implementation in at least four K-12 public schoo ls per year. Developing and implementing 3 tribal cultur e-based curriculum training modules for participation by at least 10 teachers at 3 K-12 public schools for a total of 9 trainings/year. Outcomes releva nt to improving college-and career-readiness include : Developing and implementing 10 hands-on classroom and 8 field activities for hands-on educatio nal expe riences with land and resource mana gement and monitoring strateg ies, e.g. climate change indicator monitoring (CoCoRaHS precipitation or Nature's Notebook). Impl ementing at least 80 K-12 Curriculum lessons for students in targeted schoo ls per year. Developing workforce development opportuniti es that result in 16 natural resource-and culture-based field activi ties for participation by at least 8 AI/AN youth employees each year, e.g. noxious weed removal, fish passage and habitat improvement, wate r quality samplin g. Collaborating on and facili tating at least 2 academic partner led STEM-field related workshops/sem inars open to participation from local AI/AN high schoo l students each year. Mentoring an estimated 16 AI/ AN youth in more than 60 mentoring activities per year regarding natural resource- and environme ntal science career and college opportunities, and 23 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute facilitating connections between youth and tribal staff; professional partnering staff, and upper-divi sion or graduate-level Al/AN college student s in STEM fields when applicable. Outcome s relevant to reconnecting Tribal youth with cultural heritage include: Conducting 9 seaso nal youth camps each year, including 2 fall and 1 summer multiple-day camps, and 3 spring and 3 winter \"day camps,\" focused on topics such as Native foods, cultural resource management, and traditional uses of fire in land stewardship practices. Participation by at least 5 TEK-versed cultural practitioners in multiple project-related indoor and outdoor environmental education activities each year. C.

Project evaluation reports, as well as feedback from Project stakeholders, will inform the direction of the Project from year to year. At the end of each Project year, the Project Director will make necessary improvements to enhance portions of the project and/or develop new partnerships in order to maximize Project efficiency and sustainability, based on the advice of the U.S. Department ofEducation's Native Youth Community Grant Manager. The Karuk Tribe has designed the Pikyav Field Institute Project based on existing needs assessments conducted with the Tribal community and local public schools, and in consultation with Tribal Council and key personnel. In addition, parents of AJJAN students were surveyed at Indian Parent Committee meetings, as well as through public schools' distribution ofsurvey questionnaires. In addition, a public meeting was held to elicit feedback from parents of Indian students on the kinds of educational activities they would like the Karuk Tribe to provide. The Tribe's Education Committee, Indian Parent Committee s, and parent focus groups will be asked to respond to annual feedback surveys on their awareness of, and satisfaction with, the Pikyav Field Institute, as well as their sugges tions for improvement s in ensuing years. 33 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute Through continuing and expanding partnerships with local public schools, Tribal T ANF, TERO, and partnering universities, we will be able to sustain many of the project activities beyond the life of the grant. Particularly sustainable are the standards-based, TEK-versed K-12 lesson plans and youth workforce development opportunities . We will continue to seek funding to maintain the Pikyav Field Institute through private foundations and other grant sources. F. Quality of the Project Evaluation Based on the foregoing Management Plan, the Project Director will conduct progress\u00ad oriented internal evaluations in preparation for annual reports to the U.S. Department of Education. Each Project year, a contract External Evaluator will conduct formative and summative assessments of progress in achieving Project outcomes, including impacts on AI/AN students' academic performance, college- and career-readiness, and interest in natural resource and environmental science-related college majors and careers. To facilitate determination of Project replicability in other locations, the External Evaluation also will include: Description s and analyses of accuracy of records and the validity of measures used to establish and report on AI/AN student participation by gender, grade level, and Project activity; Progress in achieving objectives delineated in the grant application; Obstacles encountered in achieving objectives; and Actions taken to remedy significant barriers impeding progress. Both internal and external evaluation reports, including feedback from AI/ AN parents, students, school personnel, and other stakeholder s, will inform the direction of the Project from year to year. The Project Director will make needed improvements to enhance portions of the project and/or develop new partnerships in order to maximize Project efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability, and will consult with the U.S. Department of Education's Native Youth Community Grant Manager as necessary to ensure Project success. 34 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute The Karuk Tribe has designed the Pikyav Field Institute Project based on existing needs assessments conducted in targeted Tribal communities and local public schools, and in consultation with the Tribal Council, partnering Tribal departments, and Indian Parent Committees located within the Project's geographic scope. As part of the external evaluation process, the Tribe's Education Committee, Indian Parent Committees, Al/AN students and parents, and the 9 Tribal Council members will be asked to participate in focus group discussions and/or respond to annual feedback surveys to determine their awareness of, and satisfaction with, the Pikyav Field Institute and to elicit their suggestio ns for improvements in ensuing years. The Tribe will use its competitive contract bidding process to solicit proposals from qualified professional educators to conduct annual External Evaluations of the Pikyav Field Institute Project. We are anxious to understand the extent to which our Project-enhanced K-12 Nanu'avaha Curriculum, new STEM-related Curriculum, and Cultural Sensitivity Training Workshops for public school teachers will improve academic performance and career-and college-readiness of targeted Al/AN youth. Included in the Project evaluation will be the collection and analysis ofdata on students' acquisition ofscience skills and knowledge using indoor/outdoor experiential education to enhance culture-and TEK-based lesson plans. We will also identify changes in AI/AN students' behavior, including school attendance, classroom participation in general, and interest/performance in STEM-related learning in particular. Important in this process will be an evaluation approach that employs both participatory and conventional evaluation methods so that (l) the focus of the evaluation is shaped by community voices to ensure evaluation relevance and accuracy and (2) the evaluation provides quantitative data to inform annual and final reports on the Project's achievement ofannual measurable 35 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute objectives, as well as significant increases in community collaborative efforts that promote the college- and career-readiness of AI/AN students. Evaluation stakeholders, including Project staff, local public school teachers, counselors , and administrators, the Karuk Tribal Education Department and Advisory Committee, and local Indian Parent Advisory Committees, will be integrally involved in identifying evaluative areas of inquiry, potential data sources, and interpretation of evaluation findings. Upon award of the External Evaluation contract in Year 1, the Evaluator will review existing baseline data provided by participating schools, examine current research on the academic performance and career-and college-readiness ofAI/AN students, review existing Nanu'avaha Curriculum lessons, and engage with Karuk and public school educators to finalize the evaluation approach. By the end of the first Project quarter, the External Evaluator will submit draft evaluation questions for stakeholders' reviews; their comments and suggestions will be returned to the Evaluator within three months. These combined perspectives will shape the evaluation questions to be studied, according to unique community contexts and needs. Local knowledge and expertise will help to contextualize data collection and analysis, and inform action steps in each Project year. The conventional evaluation approach will be used to obtain formative data on the project's delivery of envisioned environmental education services. The evaluation component will assess (1) effectiveness of the curriculum and cultural sensitivity trainings provided by Project staff to local educators , (2) academic performance of primary and secondary AI/ AN students in both English-language arts and mathematics, and (3) indicators of career-and college-readiness among AI/ AN high school students. The larger evaluation question framing this approach is \"How do the delivery ofourNanu'avaha lessons, teacher trainings, supplemental hands-on 36 I 2016 Native Youth Community Project: Karuk Pikyav Field Institute indoor/outdoor experiential education college-readiness, and STEM-related self-identities ofNative youth?\" To demonstrate the availability of qualified professionals who have expressed interest in bidding on the external evaluation contract, we are providing the resume of Karuk Tribal member Suzanne M.
