Your toothbrush can't always get between teeth and into periodontal pockets to remove debris, and that's where flossing comes in. Wet flossers, also known as \"water flossers\" or \"oral irrigators,\" are devices that utilize a pressurized water stream to target hard-to-reach areas and remove food and plaque. \"While a water flosser should not replace conventional flossing, it can certainly serve as a helpful step in your at-home dental hygiene routine,\" says Heather Kunen, DDS, MS, New York City-based orthodontist and co-founder of Beam Street. When looking for a wet flosser, there are a few key things to consider. Countertop flossers have a tank that holds a lot of water, while cordless models have smaller, built-in reservoirs. While most dental experts recommend flossers with a range of settings, not everyone needs (or will enjoy) high-pressure modes, so think about your preferences before you start shopping. At the Verywell Testing Lab in New York City, we tested 26 wet flossers, ranging in price from under $30 for a basic machine to $170 for a model that doubles as an electric toothbrush. We evaluated each wet flosser and assigned an overall score based on effectiveness, ease of use, settings, and overall value. An orthodontist from our Medical Expert Board review the contents of this article to ensure its accuracy, conventional versus wet flossing, and safe practices.

Adjusting the pressure settings, which are controlled by a dial at the base of the machine, is a bit awkward at first, but you get used to it. In addition to gooey cheese, it's effective at removing plaque and improving circulation in the gums. The tank holds 22 ounces of water, which the brand promises is enough for 90 seconds of flossing activity, but we were pleased to find that the reservoir was still half full after completing two full cycles. The cord that connects the flosser wand to the base is short, so you'll want to position it close to your sink basin to avoid drips and splashback. At the end of our testing, we crowned the Aquarius Best Overall, because it's effective and easy to use, and it doesn't take up much counter space.

Priced under $50, it offers five different nozzles (including a toothbrush head), a tongue cleaner attachment, and five settings. The best part? It's compact and completely cordless, making it the perfect travel flosser. The design is very clean and practical, and there aren't any excessive pieces or extensions. The H2ofloss has a 360-degree rotating head to help you target those hard-to-reach corners of your mouth, and it has a 300-milliliter reservoir that holds just enough water for a full cycle. Users with sensitive teeth or gums may find the higher pressure settings a little too intense. We noted that the higher settings were harder to control, and water got everywhere when we tried to use them.

It earned high marks for its lightweight design, which is dentist-recommended for kids and teens. It only has three settings, but we particularly enjoyed the pulse mode, which felt pleasant and did a great job removing food from between our teeth. Plus, it's easy to toggle between the settings with one hand. The reservoir only holds 150 milliliters of water, which provided 45 seconds of flossing during our tests, so it may not be ideal if you like to take your time. Still, it delivered a thorough cleaning. Included in the box are a travel case and four jet tips, and the waterproof body protects the rechargeable lithium-ion battery so you can floss in the shower.

Equipped with two flossing modes and 10 intensity settings, the Phillips Sonicare Power Flosser 5000 comes with a quad stream tip that covers a larger surface area for a deep clean. The instructions were clear and even illustrated how to use the device if you have braces. The setup process was easy, so we could start cleaning her teeth within minutes of unboxing. The reservoir was one of our favorite features\u2014the lid fits snugly, and the tank holds 18.6 ounces of water, enough for a couple of cleaning sessions. At $99, the countertop model is one of our more expensive picks, but it's compact, easy to use, and effective, so we can declare it well worth the price.

It's cordless and holds a charge for up to 20 days, with a 350-milliliter reservoir that provides 50-150 PSI of water pressure, depending on the setting. It felt as if we were brushing our teeth and flossing simultaneously, we noted. The flosser was easy to use, and the instruction manual includes easy-to-follow pictures. The five different settings are strong, normal, soft, pulse, and child mode, and there are eight interchangeable tips, enough to suit the preferences of the whole family. A digital display shows the modes, temperature, and battery level, which means a higher price tag.

We loved its ease of use and effectiveness at cleaning gummy fruit debris from their teeth in under a minute. The ample 7-ounce reservoir is easy to fill and lasts for a full minute. There are only two buttons\u2014one to turn it on and off, and the other to move between pressure settings\u2014so it's a good basic flosser. We were a little disappointed that there are only three basic modes. While it falls a little short on settings, it does come with some useful accessories, including two classic jet tips, a travel bag, a plug, and a convenient magnetic charger.

It's a basic model with just 2 pressure settings but was impressively effective at removing even tiny bits of debris from our teeth. The water pulls from a 5-ounce water reservoir, which lasts just shy of a minute and needs to be refilled often, sometimes mid-floss. The battery-operated model left our mouth feeling clean, but we felt as though there was still some residue remaining after use. Still, the two included tips were easy to swap out, and it's a great choice if your bathroom is short on countertop space.

With 10 pressure settings, two flossing brush heads, and a 16-ounce water reservoir, it cleans teeth while removing plaque and gunk from even the tiniest crevices. We love the way the buttons are stacked so that you can change the pressure easily. There is no guessing which button will change the pressure and speed. The Sonic-Fusion also has a two-minute brushing timer and a 30-second pacer to alert you when it's time to switch to a different section of your mouth. It's the most expensive model on our list, but it's a good investment if you're looking for an all-in-one dental-cleaning device.

How We Tested the Wet Flossers The Verywell Health team tested 26 wet flossers at the Verywell Testing Lab in New York City. After unboxing and setting up the flossers, testers used their assigned model to floss for at least one minute. They paid close attention to how clean their teeth felt, how effective it was at removing food debris, and whether the flosser was able to get into hard-to-reach areas. We evaluated each wet flosser and assigned a score based on the following attributes: effectiveness, ease of use, settings, and overall value. We also spoke with these dentists for their expert opinions on factors to consider when choosing the right wet flosser: New York City-based orthodontist Heather Kunen, DDS Todd Bertman, DMD, founder of Advanced Dental Arts in New York City Lisa Creaven, DDS, Galway-based dentist and co-founder of Spotlight Oral Care After our initial test in The Lab, we are continuing to test the wet flossers to see how they hold up to daily use. We'll update our recommendations with our feedback, especially in terms of battery life (which we weren't able to test in The Lab). What to Look for in a Wet Flosser Reservoir capacity Wet flossers either have a built-in water reservoir or are attached to a base with a water reservoir. If you don't plan to travel with your wet flosser, we recommend the Waterpik Aquarius and the Philips Sonicare Power Flosser 5000, which have larger water reservoirs. Flossers with bases can hold between 18 and 22 ounces of water. On the other hand, the larger the reservoir, the clunkier the flosser. If you plan on taking your device on the go, keep an eye out for a model with a smaller, more portable reservoir, like the Aquasonic Aqua Flosser. Flossers with built-in water reservoirs should last for an entire cleaning session but will need refilling more often. Battery life Water flossers are available in corded, cordless, and battery-operated models. Many options on our list have powerful rechargeable batteries that keep the flosser powered for days or weeks. If you're planning to travel, look for a model with a longer battery life that won't slow you down when you're on the go. We were particularly impressed with the MySmile Dental Flosser, which can hold a charge for up to 20 days. Ease of use Todd Bertman, DMD, founder of New York City's Advanced Dental Arts, advises choosing a water flosser with an angled tip or a flexible, swiveling head. These features help target your mouth's nooks and crannies while also spraying away large pieces of debris and food particles. It's also important to shop for a model that's easy to grip, which is \"especially useful for people with dexterity issues such as arthritis,\" says Dr. Bertman. We like the Aquasonic Aqua Flosser, which is dentist-recommended for adults and kids. Intensity Just because a flosser has several settings, that doesn't mean you'll use them all. Consider whether you have issues like gum sensitivity or deep gum pockets. According to Dr. Bertman, the pressure of a water flosser should be high enough to be effective but not so high that it causes pain, discomfort, or bleeding. (However, he notes that water flossers are generally safe, and any damage caused by intense pressure is likely to heal rather than be permanent.) \"If you are a first-time water flosser, it is best to start at a lower pressure setting and gradually work your way up,\" advises Dr. Bertman. \"Once you are more accustomed to how it works, it will be easy to find a setting that works best for you.\" Accessories Most water flossers will come fully equipped, but some have optional tips and specially designed attachments for dental work, braces, and sensitive teeth/gums. \"Patients who have trouble keeping braces or other fixed appliances clean may benefit from daily use of an oral flosser,\" says Dr. Kunen. Dentists also recommend switching up the tip or head, depending on your specific concerns. Frequently Asked Questions Are water flossers better than conventional flossing? Traditional string floss or dental tape may be some dentists' preferred choice, but water flossers are considered an adjunct to brushing and traditional manual flossing. \"It feels quite gentle, but it is quite a strong force through the little triangle between the teeth,\" says Dr. Creaven. \"It's pushing the food and debris so it will pop off the teeth and away from that area.\" Conventional and water flossing are suitable for cleaning thoroughly, but traditional flossing should be a part of your dental hygiene routine. Are there any risks to using a wet flosser? Regarding safety, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you don't want to leave water sitting in the reservoir. A water flosser that isn't well maintained can introduce more bacteria into your mouth, so Dr. Creaven recommends emptying it after each use and cleaning it often. You'll also want to pay special attention to excessive pressure. \"Since water flossers utilize a pressurized water stream to remove plaque and debris, it is important that patients don't traumatize their gums with the device,\" says Dr. Kunen. \"Follow the directions of use to prevent any damage to tissues.\" How often should I use a wet flosser? The order of the steps in your oral care routine matters. Start with a water flosser, and follow it up with a toothbrush. \"We have a general rule of thumb: A water flosser should probably be used once a day before brushing,\" says Dr. Creaven. \"There are active ingredients in your toothpaste, and you don't want to wash them away after you brush.\"Some research suggests that adding a water flosser to your routine can improve your dental hygiene significantly. One clinical trial showed that people who use a water flosser once a day and brush their teeth twice a day had improved gingival health, compared to people who brush twice daily and don't wet floss at all. Other research has indicated that routine water flossing (in addition to regular brushing) can reduce plaque and gum bleeding.\"As long as those practices are maintained, I encourage those patients who like water flossers to incorporate them into their routines as often or as little as they like,\" says Dr. Kunen.
