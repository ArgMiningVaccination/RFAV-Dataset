I must have a dark side also if I am to be whole.\" ~ Carl Jung On December 1, 2017, I was diagnosed with breast cancer at age thirty-six. I was sitting on the couch in my mom's living room, my breast bruised and bandaged from the invasive biopsy procedures, riddled with anxiety as I awaited the phone call from the doctor. When the news came, I fell to the floor and screamed. Relentless primal wails flooded through my body from the darkest caverns of the earth, reverberating and echoing through the house like thunder. It was beyond my realm of comprehension at the time that I was crossing a threshold into the most exquisite transformation of my life. I stand before you now, dear reader, to share that I wouldn't trade it for anything. As I was contemplating how to share my story, I thought about the difference between a hero's journey and a heroine's. The hero's journey is linear, based on outward movement toward a quest, conquering fears, learning a lesson, and coming back to share the wisdom gleaned. The heroine's journey is a spiral, ebbing and flowing, waxing and waning like the moon. As she evolves and grows, she spirals up and down, expanding and opening, awakening to greater levels of self-realization, and simultaneously triggering unconscious wounds that have lain dormant in the shadows. Courageously diving into these dark caverns, the heroine expresses repressed emotions or fears, acknowledges trauma, and shines a light on the darkness, giving it a voice and bringing it into the light. Through this spiraling dance, she awakens to and integrates more and more of the truth of who she is. She reclaims disowned or fragmented pieces of herself, some aspects that have been waiting lifetimes to be seen. In my experience and understanding, we have lived before, our souls reincarnating in service to our growth, evolution, and remembering our divine nature. The root cause of a wound comes forward in present-time awareness when it is ready to be healed, no matter where or when it originated, be it five years ago, five thousand years ago, or beyond. For when the heroine heals, she is healing the collective feminine as well. We are multidimensional beings who exist eternally, and although we are infinite, we experience limitation within the constructs of time. Time is actually a perception that we have the innate potential to transcend, and in so doing, we may actualize the omnipotence of our divine nature. The heroine's journey is vast, beyond these perceived limitations of time or the human body, and open to embrace all. Her journey accepts all feelings and experiences, all she has been or may be, just as a mother unconditionally loves her child and all that they may or may not become. Healing is cyclical, layered, and multidimensional. Through the experiences I am about to share, I have come to know this to be true about time, as well. When reading this book, you will notice that the sequence of events is not chronological. I'm sharing from my reality, which shifted from being a scared fifteen-year-old, to an ancient priestess, to a thirty-six-year-old woman with an IV in her arm, all within the same day. My consciousness danced across a spectrum of vibrant, luminous, expansive rainbow hues to cold, frightening, dense shades of gray and black. I saw my life as a blanket, woven with beautiful wool, intricately designed with interweaving colors. Every feeling, memory, and experience overlapped and touched. Following the thread of a feeling, I arrived in a memory, which unraveled into experiences from many different ages, some beyond this lifetime. The threads of these experiences spanned the blanket, and in the interwoven design, I became aware of recurring themes and patterns within my memories and an undeniable organization to the lessons being learned. Everything that arose was here and now, in the present, coming forward to allow for healing to occur deep down at the root. I was not looking back in time, perceiving something outside of me. I was feeling the pain, crying the tears, and expressing the anger in the present moment. The blanket was holding me tightly in a cocoon, reminding me again and again there was nowhere else to look but within. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I surrendered deeply to the divine path being set before me. Priestess of Avalon I am a Priestess of Avalon in a goddess tradition based in Glastonbury, England. I was beginning the second spiral (year) of a three-spiral (three-year) training when I was diagnosed, which intensely amplified my devotion and dedication to my path. Moving through breast cancer actually felt like part of the curriculum of my training. A priestess is a woman who lives life in service to the sacred feminine, acting as a vessel for goddess energies to flow into her community. She is a bridge between worlds, helping others open to and experience the realms of the unseen. She offers ceremonies for rites of passage and holy days, practices divination, and offers spiritual support and guidance. She is attuned to the rhythms and cycles of nature, at one with the elements, and receptive to messages from Mother Earth and all her creatures. She interprets life through symbols, archetypes, and metaphors. A Priestess of Avalon specifically works with the energies, landscape, and mysteries of the ancient Isle of Avalon, which is modern-day Glastonbury, United Kingdom. This sacred landscape is known as the heart chakra of the earth. There is a potent energy field in present-day Glastonbury/Avalon that bridges the veil of forgetting, the veil that we pass through to navigate everyday human reality. Those of us who feel the irresistible pull to Avalon, the wisdom and memories of our souls\u2014who we were before passing through that veil\u2014are held in this energy field, in the heart of the Goddess. Avalon is known for catalyzing profound transformation in the lives of those who love Her. While the land resonates with a magnificent heart field, one must enter through the shadow of the heart, coming directly into contact with disowned grief, despair, shame, self-pity, anger, rage, resentment, hatred, and disempowerment\u2014all the feelings that most people would prefer to keep hidden. We must first heal our wounds to experience true joy and ecstasy. The path of the sacred feminine is a path of embodiment. To fully inhabit the landscape of our bodies, we must explore the terrain that has been abandoned or neglected. The more we see, love, and heal within ourselves, the greater pleasure we are able to experience in our bodies and in our lives. The goddess path is about learning to embody our divine nature, bring more of our soul energy into being, and experience life fully through the gift of the senses. Our bodies are holy vessels for experiencing the sacredness of Her body, which is personified through the earth, and her Spirit, the essence of the divine feminine. The Lady of Avalon is a goddess of transformation, healing, death, and rebirth. The ancient Welsh name for the Isle of Avalon was Ynis Witrin, which means Isle of Glass, describing the glassy lake that surrounded the shores. The Lake of Avalon was an enchanted body of water that was reflective like a mirror, revealing what was hidden in the realm of the unseen and triggering what needed to be seen and healed to spiritually transform. The lake was imbued with a divine feminine spirit, known as the Lady of the Lake, who came to me as a personal guide and aspect of my own consciousness during my healing journey. She described herself this way: I am multidimensional. I am personal while also being an archetypal energy. In Avalon, many women have reigned as the Lady of the Lake. All are similar to a reigning queen on a throne. An energy imbues each woman as a whole, and yet each one is a particular emanation that holds significant wisdom and memories relevant to her particular time as the Lady of the Lake. Avalon was a sacred island of healing, divination, mysticism, transformation, and magic. The priestesses honored the Goddess in all her forms\u2014her trees, creatures, and the land\u2014as her body. King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, was forged by the priestesses of Avalon, assuring his protection and victory as long as he pledged allegiance with the Goddess of the land, honoring the old ways. There are many legends of Avalon; however, Avalon is not simply a legend whispering echoes of the distant past. Avalon exists purely within the energy field of the ancient landscape that is modern-day Glastonbury. It is a land of shimmering crossroads, with openings in the energetic heart field where one's consciousness may enter the realm of the Holy Isle. In the priestess tradition I am part of, we pull threads through the misty veils and bring the power of these mysteries into the present. Through walking the land, immersing in the water, and communing with the spirits of the old trees, memories of ancient Avalon are awakened. We honor the sacred landscape as the body of the Lady of Avalon and celebrate the ancient goddesses of the British Isles. My teacher, Kathy Jones, started a goddess temple in Glastonbury. It is the first goddess temple in Europe for more than one thousand years. The foundation of our tradition is the Wheel of Bridannia, the word Bridannia being an ode to the ancient goddess of the British Isles, Brittania, blended with the names of Celtic goddesses Brigid and Ana. This wheel is based on the Celtic wheel of the year, which is comprised of eight seasons. Each season resonates with the energies and qualities of specific goddesses, sacred trees, animals, and more.

Inanna: My Underworld Guide During my cancer experience, when I was lying in bed sick from chemo, nauseated, bald, and bones aching so badly I felt my legs might split in two, an ancient presence relentlessly knocked at my door. A feminine voice whispered the name, \"Inanna... Inanna... Inanna...\" She called out to me from the depths of the unknown, \"Sister, follow me...sister, I will show you the way.\" Her presence grew stronger and her voice louder until I embraced her story of descent into the underworld as a mirror for my experiences. My desire to understand and interpret the messages I was receiving from Inanna initiated my process of writing this book. It was through writing that her voice crystallized, and the profound nature of the lessons I was learning came clearly into focus. Inanna is an ancient Sumerian goddess who was known as the queen of heaven. Her sister, Ereshkigal, was the queen of the dead who ruled the underworld. In the story of Inanna's descent, she journeys from heaven, to earth, to the underworld to visit her widowed sister. She leaves behind instructions for her faithful servant to come for her if she does not return in three days and three nights. When Inanna arrives in the underworld, she faces seven bolted gates. The gatekeeper commands that she remove one of her royal garments to pass through each gateway. She is stripped of the trappings of the upperworld\u2014all she has identified with\u2014and arrives in the underworld completely naked. She finds Ereshkigal in agony, overwhelmed with grief and rage over the loss of her husband. Ereshkigal kills Inanna and hangs her on a hook. For three days and nights, Inanna's body hangs upside-down in the underworld. When her servant comes looking for her, she encounters Ereshkigal. Inanna's servant sits with Ereshkigal and reflects her feelings back to her; when Ereshkigal moans, the servant moans back, witnessing her in her pain. Thankful for being acknowledged, Ereshkigal allows the servant to retrieve Inanna's body. After being given food and the water of life, Inanna is resurrected. Upon permission to exit the underworld, Inanna reclaims her seven items at each gate, returning to the upperworld where she resumes her reign as the queen of heaven, the same, yet changed. In this myth, Inanna's experience with her sister is symbolic of the heroine's journey to reclaim her shadow self. Ereshkigal represents Inanna's shadow, an area of her unconscious comprised of aspects of her psyche that are hidden in the depths of the unknown. Everyone has a shadow and a dark sister or brother inside. What lives here is completely hidden and removed from everyday reality. However, the energies that exist in this domain inform the rest of our behaviors. I imagine the shadow as a dark body of water that lives beneath the landscape of our personalities. Above ground, we have our identities, the things we give value to that make up who we are in the physical world reality\u2014jobs, families, relationships, and social status. The roots of these earthly identifications are fed from the waters of the unconscious shadowy realm. Although we may not know what exists there, we are nevertheless constantly interacting with it. The shadow is home to disowned aspects of ourselves, parts of us we are ashamed of, experiences we'd rather forget, and tendencies or behaviors we'd rather not look at or are completely unaware of. Some experiences that have been banished to the realm of the shadow have truly been forgotten or blocked out. Our wounds are there, from this life and material we have brought forward to heal from previous incarnations. The shadow is rich territory because all these places hold our power. It takes energy to keep everything that has been stored in the shadow tightly tucked away. Years, and maybe lifetimes, of protective armor have been built up around the material that is held there. Inanna is stripped of this armor in the form of her possessions, which represent everything she has identified with, so she can face her shadow. The Seven Gates I have organized this book into two parts, the descent and the ascent. The descent mirrors the deconstruction of my life as I knew it with Inanna's journey into the underworld, while the gifts this transformation offered me reflect her ascent into the upperworld. Together, we rise like a phoenix from the ashes. The seven gates of the underworld serve as a chariot, a sacred vehicle that carries us together through the ebbs and flows of my story. These seven gates are significant because they correspond with the seven chakras, the main energy centers of the body. Each chakra is connected with specific organs and bodily functions, as well as different emotions. The experiences Inanna and I have at each of the seven gates of the underworld are connected with these energy centers. Through this journey, we are given the opportunity to accept, honor, and reclaim the aspects of ourselves we had forgotten and left for dead in the underworld. When Inanna and I embrace our darkness, we open to receive the healing potential that is held in the shadow of the underworld. In The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell interprets the myth of Inanna as the psychological power of a descent into the unconscious, the realization of one's own strength through an episode of seeming powerlessness and the acceptance of one's own negative qualities. I, however, do not refer to these as negative qualities\u2014they are simply a collection of energies that have been judged\u2014by ourselves or others\u2014as bad, wrong, or unworthy. When we compassionately forgive ourselves for these judgments, we untangle the web of shame binding them out of sight and open ourselves to healing. We empower ourselves by taking dominion over these energies and forgiving ourselves, instead of placing them in the hands of another to someday redeem us. Drs. Ron and Mary Hulnick, my spiritual psychology teachers from the University of Santa Monica (USM), define healing as the application of loving to the parts inside that hurt. The parts held within the shadow may hurt, but this doesn't mean they are bad, negative, or unworthy of love. In fact, it's the opposite\u2014loving and forgiving them releases them from the dark and restores their purified energy to conscious life. Ultimately when looking through the eyes of the soul, nothing is good or bad; everything is for the experience of learning and remembering our true nature, which is loving. When I first embarked on a conscious spiritual path in 2006, I didn't like acknowledging the dark. I felt that if I focused my energy there, I would attract or create darkness in my life. Instead, I concentrated on what I perceived as the light, or positive. As I have grown and evolved, I understand there is no light without dark, no day without night, no energy without rest, no growth without a lesson or catalyst. We live in a world of duality. We learn mostly through experiencing discomfort and course correcting. Seeing, acknowledging, and expressing our own darkness is the key to true spiritual growth and transformation. Overly focusing on the positive and not acknowledging the dark is spiritual bypassing\u2014denying emotions or experiences perceived as negative based on the misunderstanding that emotions like anger, sadness, or grief are not spiritual. True spirituality is about authenticity, honesty, and accepting personal responsibility. Robert Masters, a counselor and teacher I have worked with who specializes in shadow work, emphasizes the importance of learning to release clean anger. He suggests creating space for conscious rants, where we allow ourselves to let go of these emotions in a supportive environment in which no one is harmed or blamed. It's important to have tools and resources to support inner work within the shadowy realms and to connect with like-hearted people who may serve as sacred witnesses to our journey. Inanna and Venus Astrologers have connected the myth of Inanna with the planet Venus because Inanna's descent and ascent are reflected in the sky during Venus's synodic cycle (synodic meaning the meeting place of Earth, Venus, and the Sun), which lasts approximately nineteen months. During this cycle, Venus, as a morning star, descends through seven gateways which are reflected in the conjunctions of the waning moon with Venus. She then completely disappears from view, which is the time Inanna spends in the underworld. Venus is then reborn as an evening star, rising on the horizon. Her light grows stronger and more powerful as she "}
