One of my exuberant campers, would chase butterflies but would not play kickball or follow directions. One day, he seemed very different. That day, he followed the rules of the game, and even scored a run. His personality was different also, more serious and quiet , and he had no appetite for lunch. Having spent the last 30 years studying ADHD treatment effects, both positive and negative, I want to spend the next 10 learning how to sequence and deliver individualized treatments for the impairments related to ADHD and to train others who see children, adolescents, and adults in managing this commonly misunderstood disorder.\" - Mark A. Stein, Ph.D., ABPP, is the director of PEARL Clinic/ADHD and Related Disorders Program at Seattle Childrens Hospital and an investigator at Seattle Childrens Research Institute. He is also a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington. Dr. Stein currently serves as the President of the American Professional Society of ADHD and Related Disorders (APSARD). He is also a member of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology, the Society for Pediatric Research, the Society of Behavioral Pediatrics, the Society of Biological Psychiatry, the International Sleep Medicine Society, the International Society of Pharmacogenomics, and the International Society for Research in Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (ISRCAP). Dr. Stein received his B.A. from Bowling Green State University and his M.A. and Ph.D from Southern Illinois University. He had an internship with the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and a fellowship with the University of Chicago, Dept. Of Medicine. He has received many honors for his work, including being named a Fellow for the American Psychological Association, Division of Clinical Psychology, a Charter Fellow for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, and a Diplomate in Clinical Psychology, American Board of Professional Psychology. - Related Pages - Dr. Mark Stein's passion for helping children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) started three decades ago when, working as a camp counselor, he witnessed how stimulant medications affect kids - for better and for worse. - - - I am a huge fan of Dr. Stein's published research and other writing. The field of ADHD is extremely lucky to have him. - Dr. Stein is equal parts compassionate and knowledgeable. He is very comfortable chatting with children in an age appropriate manner, and he is equally adroit in communicating with parents. There is the old saying, about loss and gain. When Dr. Stein (understandably went to Seattle Children's) Chicago's loss, Seattle's gain. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date Fellow Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology 2001 Fellow in recognition of outstanding and unusual contributions to the science and profession of psychology American Psychological Association 2000 - Manuscripts in Refereed Journals - Stein, MThe War on ADHD Nature Medicine, 2013 : 19(12)1366 Published Books, Videos, Software, etc. - Accardo, P., Blondis, T., Whitman, B. & Stein, M.A.Attention Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity in Children and Adults ( 2nd Edition).

His current work explores the question: Can you improve how kids at risk for ADHD function by treating their parents first, with either medicine or parent training and exploring the sequencing of treatments? Through this work Dr. Stein hopes to improve the prognosis for young children at risk of ADHD due to genetics, as well as early onset behavior problems. Dr. Stein also conducts clinical trials of novel treatments targeting ADHD symptoms and associated impairments, including the relationship of ADHD and its treatment to sleep problems. "}
