It was first recorded in the classic of \"Jingui Yaolve\" written by Zhang Zhongjing. JHF is a promising traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with a broad application in treating inflammatory diseases. However, the clinical effects of JHF for sepsis and its comprehensive mechanisms in sepsis remained largely unknown. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effect of JHF in sepsis treatment and try to explore its mechanism with network pharmacology. Methods: The single-center randomized clinical trial was done to assess the effect of JHF in treating sepsis. In addition, we use Chinese herbal medicine pharmacology database and analysis platform to identified the active ingredients and therapeutic target of JHF. Then therapy target proteins of sepsis were screened based on many well-known disease target databases. After that, we established a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis and active components-targets docking validation was performed. Results: The analyses included 114 patients. On day 7, the median reduction of SOFA score was -2.0( interquartile range -3.0 to -1.5) in experimental group versus 0.5 (IQR -1.7 to 2.0) in control group (p=0.000), and on 15, -3.3 (IQR -1.2(IQR -1.7 to 2.0), reduction of APACHE II score was -3.0 (IQR -6.0 to 0) with JHF vs 0 (IQR -3.0 to 2) without JHF(p=0.02) on day 7. The 28-day all-cause mortality was 38 (25 of 66) in the intervention group versus 58% (25 of 48) in control group (p=0.031). The 60-day all-cause mortality was 41% (27 of 66) in the intervention group, as compared with 60% (29 of 48) in control group (p=0.023). The reduction in mean number of C-reactive protein was -48.5 (standard deviation 62.1) with interleukin-6, the in mean number was -27.3 (SD 26.8) with JHF vs -6.1(SD difference -21.2, 95%CI -37.8 to -4.6, p=0.002). The happened to tumor necrosis factor , -2.4 (SD 0.73) in intervention group vs -1.3 (SD 1.5) in control group (mean difference -1.1, 95%CI -2.1 to -0.08, p=0.035). The mean superoxide dismutase level was 127.2 (SD 31.5) in the experimental group vs 102.4 (SD 32.3) in the standard group (mean difference 24.8, 95%CI 19.39 to 40.2, p=0.002,). No significant differences were observed in the length of hospital and range of PCT. We identified 72 active ingredients and 426 target genes of JHF and successfully constructed a 'JHF-compoundtarget-sepsis' network. 116 mentioned targets revealed by GO/KEGG enrichment analysis have played a significant role in the inflammatory reaction and immunoregulation. Conclusion: JHF can regulate inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress response in sepsis. IL-17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway may play a vital role in the occurrence and development of sepsis. For sepsis, JHF may be a promising, effective treatment strategy.
