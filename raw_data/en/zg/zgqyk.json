When WWAMI began, research was not part of the program's activities . Today, faculty at the UW School of Medicine and WWAMI faculty region-wide are engaged in remarkable collaborations, as described in \"Taking Research to the Community .\" Also, when WW AMI started, there were no indications that the program would become a model for training healthcare professionals in the developing world . \"A New Vision for Kenya\" describes how that is occurring in one African nation . The founders had a major goal for WWAMI: ensuring an adequate healthcare workforce for the region . Maintaining medical students and residents to practice in the region was pivotal to meeting this goal . The presence of second-generation WWAMI students and graduates, as described in \"Sons and Daughters of WWAMI\" speaks to the success of the program in achieving this original objective and marks a wonderful family \"tradition .\" Ten years from now, when we celebrate its 50th anniversary, WWAMI will have changed and evolved in countless additional ways to meet the needs of the region \u2014 and the world . WWAMI is truly a wonderful program with far-reaching impact . Please join us in celebrating 40 years of partnership and service to the region . Paul G . Ramsey, M .D .

Body weight is controlled by complex interactions between hormones and neurons in the hypothalamus . Michael W . Schwartz, M .D ., Res . '86, UW professor of medicine, director of the UW Medicine Diabetes and Obesity Center of Excellence and the Robert H . Williams Endowed Chair in Medicine, and his colleagues studied the results of a high-fat diet in the brains of mice and rats . They found evidence of very early and lasting injury to a specific part of the hypothalamus in these animals . Using brain imaging, they also found signs of similar damage in the same area of the brain in obese humans . Their paper, \"Obesity Is Associated with Hypothalmic Injury in Rodents and Humans,\" was published in the Jan . 3, 2012 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation . Gamers help unlock the structure of an HIV protein Retroviral protease is a protein that is key to the reproduction of HIV . Scientists have spent years trying to deci- pher its crystal structure, a first step in developing therapies that might stop the protein's growth . Now they have taken a giant step forward through the development of Foldit . This video game, designed by UW faculty, challenges spa-tially savvy players to design and predict protein structure . When gamers were given the retroviral protease problem, it took them only a few days to develop a solution of sufficient quality to support scientific work . David Baker, Ph .D ., UW professor of biochemistry and adjunct professor of bioengineering, was among the authors of the study . Results were recently published in Nature Struc-tural & Molecular Biolog y . Read mor e at nature .com/nsmb/ (search for \"foldit\") . Or play Foldit at fold .it . Insulin spray and Alzheimer's diseaseIn a small study conducted by UW researchers, insulin supplied through a nasal spray was found to help slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease . The study was undertaken by Suzanne Craft, Ph .D ., UW professor in the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, and her colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System . The research - ers tested people with Alzheimer's before and after the trial for memory, cognition and functional ability . Of those r eceiving insulin rather than a placebo, two-thirds to three-quarters showed improvement . A larger study is scheduled to begin in summer 2012 . Patient Care Harborview and Northwest: Level 1 Stroke Centers The Department of Health and the state of Washington have designated Harbor - view Medical Center and Northwest Hos-pital & Medical Center as Level 1 Stroke Centers . The hospitals are two of only four facilities in King County to qualify as Level 1 Stroke Centers: comprehensive centers that excel in treatment and in providing treatment-related and educa-tional resources for other regional facili-ties . The Level 1 designation was created by the new Washington State Emergency Cardiac and Stroke System, which also establishes Level 2 Primary Stroke Cen-ters and Level 3 Acute Stroke Capable designations . These facilities include UW Medicine's Valley Medical Center (Level 2) and UW Medical Center (Level 3) . Robotic surgery helps defeat liver cancer Generally speaking, the less invasive a surgery, the faster a patient's recovery time . At UW Medical Center, James Park, M .D ., became the first surgeon in the Pacific Northwest to use the da Vinci surgical robot \u2014 a high-precision instru-ment that drastically reduces the area of incision \u2014 to remove part of a liver in a patient with cancer .

The UW Neighborhood Clinics provide primary-care services in several locations around the greater Seattle area: Bell-town, Factoria, Federal Way, Issaquah, Kent-Des Moines, Shoreline inville . The clinic system receives high marks; it has earned four consecutive perfect accreditation scores for meet-ing nationally recognized standards of healthcare from the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care . Education An invitation to the arts The School's student affairs office invites you to experience Arts in Medicine, a collaboration among medical students, faculty and staff interested in promoting the arts within our community, including visual arts, writing, music and other art forms . Visit the site at depts .washington . edu/artsmed . Students have research and community impact through investigative projects Before they graduate, all M .D . students must complete an independent investi-gative inquiry (III), a research or service requirement that provides them with the opportunity to ask \u2014 and answer \u2014 questions related to practicing medicine . Family, friends and faculty saw the fruits of the III at a poster session held Nov . 17 . Many students' posters came out of longitudinal learning experiences under - taken over the summer, either through the Rural/Underserved Opportunities Program or the Global Health Immersion Program . These programs give students hands-on training in service projects in rural, urban underserved or global communities . The posters reflected many timely issues in healthcare: from educating communities about diabetes, to preventing falls in the elderly, to ma-laria, to contraception and unintended pregnancies, to head injury/head safety in teen sports . WWAMI Celebrating 40 yearsWWAMI's 40th anniversary: we celebrat-ed it in the last issue, and in this issue, too, with stories about the students, faculty and community members who make it innovative and successful .

Correction from the fall 2011 edition The infographic accompanying the WWAMI story on page 17 in the last issue, titled \"do residents return to their state of origin to practice?,\" was titled incorrectly . It should have r ead: \"do residents return to the state where they completed their residency to practice?\" The answer to the latter, correct question is \"yes\" \u2014 and usually at a rate higher than the national average! Ravenna clinic photo: Clare McLeanSPRING 2012 7 < Feature In the fall issue, we set out to celebrate the WWAMI program, which turned 40 in 2011. WWAMI is an innovative, responsive program, one whose core objective has held steady: to train primary-care physicians and other healthcare personnel from and for a five-state region \u2014 Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. Especially in areas with too few physicians. On the following pages, we continue to celebrate the program's 40th anniversary by looking at the big picture: what WWAMI is doing for our communities and our world. Activities such as training and encouraging medical students. Fostering community-based research. And changing health-care here \u2014 and in Africa! We also interviewed several community leaders in WWAMI to get their take on the program. Enjoy!WWAMI: THE BIG PICTURE SPRING 2012 78 UW MEDICINE8 UW MEDICINEBefore Vanessa Maycumber started her first year at the UW School of Medicine, she spent two weeks shadowing a family physician at Blackfeet Community Hospital in Browning, Mont. While her soon-to-be peers were packing and spending time with friends, Maycumber was acquiring clinical experience, meeting the family physician who would be her preceptor, and learning about a community she would repeatedly return to over the course of her medical-school career. The TRUST program Maycumber is one of a select group of UW School of Medicine students who are part of a four-year-old program called TRUST (the Targeted Rural Underserved Track). TRUST offers a comprehensive curriculum, a support network and clinical experience for students interested in practicing rural medicine. Started in Montana in 2008, the track is now also available for rural-fo-cused students in Western and Eastern Washington, with plans to expand the program to Idaho and Alaska. Suzanne Allen, M.D., MPH, co-director of TRUST and vice dean for regional affairs, explains that TRUST's aim is to increase the number of primary-care physicians working in rural or under - served areas. \"The notion was to create a special track...that would really encourage students to go into rural medicine,\" says Allen. Strength in continuity The program seeks interested students, especially those from rural and underserved communities. Once accepted, students spend up to two weeks prior to entering medical school, as May-cumber did, in their \"continuity community,\" a rural health site to which they are assigned for the duration of medical school. A TRUST student's continuity community \u2014 along with receiving WWAMI Turns 40 > As a second-year TRUST student, Vanessa Maycumber spends a great deal of time learning about medicine in her home state, Montana, where she will return to practice .

QUOTABLE \"Being a doctor and having to go it on your own in a rural community is difficult . Rural physicians put in a lot of time . And being on call and being so remote causes even more stress and strain . When practicing physicians in rural areas become involved in WWAMI's educational process, they get inspired again . Training someone reinvigorates them . It reminds them of why they chose to practice in a rural area .\" FINAL WORDS \"The WWAMI success story and success model sells itself .\"SPRING 2012 9< WWAMI Turns 40 Medical student and TRUST program participant Hans Hurt helped treat patient Sharon Mills after she slipped and fell while holding a screw . Photo courtesy of Hans Hurt and the Department of Family Medicineconsistent mentoring at the site \u2014 are cornerstones of the TRUST experi-ence. \"For students to be able to go back to that same community for all four years of medical school is extreme-ly important,\" says Allen. It gives them a taste of the kinds of relationships doctors can form with patients, given time. \"The students see patients when they are having a new child and they see that same family when someone is diagnosed with cancer,\" Allen says. Students visit their community at least two other times during their first year and for their four-week R/UOP experience. (R/UOP is the Rural/Underserved Opportunities Program, which takes place during the summer between the first and second year.) During third year, students return for their most in-depth experience: a 20-week WRITE rotation (WWAMI Rural Integrated Training Experience), which includes clinical experiences in most elements of primary care, from family medicine, to psychiatry, to pediatrics. Other components of TRUST include required rural health elec-tives, participation in the School's Underserved Pathway program, career counseling and residency assistance.In the community Maycumber says that working alongside fam-ily medicine physicians in Browning is helping her understand the daily decisions and chal- lenges of rural medicine. \"One of many things I've learned is the im-portance of networking with other physicians in neighboring towns,\" she says. \"Even if you don't have all the resources, you have colleagues in other towns that you can call.\" Part of the student experience is learning about a community. During Maycum-ber's R/UOP experience, for instance, she attended a Blackfeet sweat lodge, a traditional cleansing ceremony. \"It helped me experience some aspects of their tradition,\" she says. KayCee Gardner, a fourth-year student and one of the first TRUST students to graduate, will start a family medicine residency in Billings next year. She says that the decision to apply to TRUST was one of the best choices she's ever made. \"I've learned so much,\" she says. \"I've been able to have this continual experience with one community, have established relationships with patients, gotten more hands-on rural training than the average student, and had extra classes in rural medicine.\" It's clear the students value TRUST \u2014 and the program's adminis-trators will be evaluating its progress. \"We don't have a lot of data points yet,\" says Allen. \"But we're very hope-ful that it will accomplish what we plan \u2014 the production of a larger rural healthcare workforce across our five-state region.\" ALAN KAHN Trustee, DII Asbestos PI Trust Bozeman, MontanaNOTABLE He's a Montana businessman who believes in the power of community . QUOTABLE \"The education and return of Montana students \u2014 that's an obvious benefit of WWAMI . What's often overlooked is the specialty care available to Montana residents . For instance, a friend had a terrible accident; his feet were badly cut by a pasture mower, and he was airlifted to Harborview . W e didn't know if he'd walk again, but they were able to provide expert care in multiple disciplines . He couldn't have gotten that variety in expertise here . After several surgeries in Seattle, he's fully recovered .\" FINAL WORDS \"I'm grateful that we have WWAMI . I'm grateful Montana's a part of it .\" 10 UW MEDICINE Be prepared.\" It should be a motto for teachers as well as Boy Scouts. Especially if the teacher thinks the student may faint during instruction. Kenneth Robertson, M.D., FACP , an internal medicine specialist/hospi-talist, remembers showing a medical student how to insert a central line in the intensive care unit at Ivinson Memorial Hospital in Laramie, Wyo. \"You take this big, huge long needle and go deep into the upper chest, under the clavicle, and put a catheter into the subclavian vein. Then you float a catheter close to the heart. And I looked around at the student and said, 'You're OK with this, right?'\" She said she was fine, but Robert- son wasn't surprised when she passed out moments later. Trainees don't get enough sleep, or they forget to eat \u2014 or the medical procedure is a little grisly. It happens. \"We were kind of ready for it,\" he says. Robertson is an instructor for the WWAMI program at the University of Wyoming. Having spent several years as a preceptor, he now teaches an in-troductory clinical medicine course to first-year medical students. Robertson relishes his association with teaching and with the WWAMI program. \"I've been involved since day one, minute one,\" he says.Day one, minute one Wyoming was the fifth state to become part of the WWAMI program, joining the multi-state medical educa-tion program in 1996. Robertson is one of a number of teachers who've been involved in the program from the start, teaching first-year medical students what they need to know before they head off to the University of Washington's Seattle campus for their second year. Other people are equally invested in the WWAMI program, says Matthew D. McEchron, Ph.D., assis-tant dean of WWAMI medical educa-tion at the University of Wyoming. Namely, doctors, politicians, the Wyoming Medical Society and com-munity members. \"People were com-mitted to the idea from the beginning, and a lot of people were involved in getting things started,\" he says. The state is betting that students educated in Wyoming will return there to practice, and the stakes are high. Wyoming has few big cities, and population centers are scattered, so it's hard to draw in medical special-ists \u2014 the population has to be large enough to support a practice. And, as in other rural communities in WWAMI, it can be hard to recruit and retain general practitioners. It's difficult being the only doctor for miles around.The bet, says McEchron, seems to be paying off; approximately 66 percent of Wyoming's students return to Wyoming to practice. (The national mean for medical-student returns is 39 percent.) The pull of Wyoming Wyoming attracts people like Robertson. He loves the state for its small communities, its open spaces; he's a rancher and a hunter, as well as a doctor and teacher. Pamela J. Langer, Ph.D., an associ- ate professor of molecular biology at the University of Wyoming, also felt the pull of the outdoors. \"I've always wanted to live somewhere close to mountains, so I didn't have to drive six hours to get there,\" says the Phila-delphia native. And, like Robertson, she likes the close-knit, supportive community of Laramie, evident even to casual visitors. Langer, who researches the proper - ties of spider silk for potential medical applications, is an adventurous teacher. More than once, she's used theatre as a teaching aid. For instance, she recently had undergraduate students act as enzymes and receptors in order to come to a fuller understanding of a biochemical process implicated in cancer. \"If you treat information in a different media, I think you understand it in a different way,\" she says. WWAMI Turns 40 > by Delia WardTEACHING FOR KEEPS \"SPRING 2012 11 < WWAMI Turns 40 If Langer is motivated to teach, it is, in part, because her students \u2014 in- cluding the first-year medical students taking her biochemistry class \u2014 are motivated to learn. \"I especially enjoy the WWAMI classes, because they're small, and we have discussions about a lot of things...they can be interested in everything,\" says Langer. From campus to campus One of the foundations of the WWAMI program is that all first-year students receive basically the same education \u2014 whether they're in Lara-mie, Pullman, Spokane, Anchorage, Bozeman, Moscow or Seattle. Courses have common objectives, and students at all first-year sites take common final exams to ensure the objectives have been met. \"We are very aware of what's going on at different sites,\" says Langer. She and her colleagues determined last summer that there's a 75- to 80-per - cent overlap in course topics among the sites. That said, teachers bring their own strengths to the classroom. Not everyone has Langer's creative approach, and not every teacher gives first-year students the exposure to clinical care espoused by Robertson. Pamela J . Langer, Ph .D ., is always pleased when her undergraduate students \u2014 like Lauren Johnson and Mark Wefel, left \u2014 are accepted to the UW School of Medicine . Johnson and Wefel, now first-year medical students, were teaching assistants in Langer's clinical biochemistry class at the University of Wyoming in 2011 . Photo courtesy of Pamela J. Langer, Ph.D.And, of course, each class brings something to the learning environ- ment. Last year, says Robertson, his class was very lively. \"I couldn't go five minutes without getting 10 questions about something,\" he says. This year, he says, the students were quieter, more laid-back. Regardless of class temperament, there's a real benefit to having a class of just 20 first-year students at each first-year WWAMI university. The small, integrated setting is what Wyoming students are used to, Rob-ertson says; it's a reassuring start to medical school, one that teachers hope will help cement the students' rela-tionship with the community and pull them back to Wyoming when they've completed their training. A payback plan provides another incentive to return. The state underwrites the lion's share of their tuition, and students repay the loan by practicing in the state for three years \u2014 or by paying back the money. Coming full circle The WWAMI program in Wyoming is relatively young, but it's effective, says McEchron. So are the doctors trained by the program, says Robertson. \"The [WWAMI-trained doctors] that I've run across over the years have been just excellent, all the way around,\" he says. Wendy Curran, a senior director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming Ken Robertson, M .D ., FACP , wears many hats: rancher, doctor and teacher among them . He was one of the first people to sign up to teach first-year medical students at the WWAMI-Wyoming program . Photos (including previous page) courtesy of Kenneth Robertson, M.D., FACPand the former executive director of the Wyoming Medical Society, is delighted by the program's progress. An early advocate for the development of the WWAMI-Wyoming program, she remembers the moment when she heard a student say he'd been inspired to pursue medicine by a WWAMI graduate in his hometown. \"I've come full circle,\" she said to herself, \"where the people who started the program are recruiting students.\" On a different note, she says that she sees a decided shift in what WWAMI doctors want. Students educated in earlier years were rugged individualists who wanted to run their own businesses. Today's doctors, says Curran, are less likely to want to run a business and more likely to want to focus on medicine. Robertson, who be-came a hospitalist in 2007 after spend-ing years in private practice, embodies something of both generations. Shifting demographics, lifestyle expectations, the cost of medical education. Educating medical students so that they'll return to WWAMI is a challenging proposition, one administrators continue to finesse. McEchron, like Curran, is sanguine. Because the tradition of teaching is now crossing generations. \"Many of our graduates who have returned to the state to practice are now also teaching within the pro-gram,\" he says. \"It's exciting to see the circle becoming complete.\" 12 UW MEDICINE When they were young, Donald R. Chisholm's four children had a movie they liked to watch together. It wasn't Disney, or a holiday special. It was a video of the C-section birth of the two youngest siblings, twins Hillary and Sarah. \"It was our favorite movie \u2014 the gory, bloody delivery of my sisters,\" says Alison, the oldest, with a laugh. \"It was definitely a different kind of family experience.\" At the time, the four children \u2014 the three girls, plus one son, Tyler \u2014 didn't think much about it. It was simply part of their family's culture. Their father, a 1979 graduate of the UW School of Medicine, is a respected family medicine physician in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Their mother, Robin, a former pre-med student herself, grew up with a physician as a father, and taught high-school biology and chemistry. The kids occasionally accompanied their dad on rounds and frequently ate dinner in the hospital cafeteria. People often stopped them on the street to praise their dad. \"We grew up believing that medicine would be a great thing to go into,\" says Hillary. \"Our father was clearly making a difference in the lives of the people around us.\" And one by one, they all decided to become doctors. With their father and grandfather as models and a shared interest in working with underserved populations, the choice of attending the UW School of Medicine \u2014 through the WWAMI program in Idaho \u2014 wasn't difficult. \"I knew I wanted to return to Idaho and work in a rural area, so WWAMI was ideal,\" says Alison. She recently started practicing ophthalmology in Coeur d'Alene. \"WWAMI gives you grounding in real-life medicine rather than an ivory-tower experience.\"Although Don wasn't part of the WWAMI-Idaho contingent, he's pleased that his children have had that experience. \"Clinical rotations [through WWAMI] give you critical exposure in the clinic, the operating room and other areas of training,\" he says. All in the family It's likely that most, maybe all, of the four Chisholm siblings will return to the WWAMI region to practice. Tyler is in his third year of family medicine residency in San Francisco. He plans to return to the region with his wife, Megan Mendoza, M.D. '09, another WWAMI graduate. They'd like to practice in a locale with a Spanish-speaking population, such as Yakima. Sarah is completing an ob/gyn residency in Denver and plans to return to the Northwest to practice.

'79, also gradu - ated from the UW School of Medicine . SPRING 2012 13 school, wants to focus at least part of her practice on underserved communi- ties. Alison, in addition to working in Coeur d'Alene, has done medical mission trips to Central America. Don says, \"Our hope is that all our kids will be in places where we can see them on a more regular basis. And we'd like to see excellent medical care in our community.\" Returning to Alaska Much further north in the WWAMI region, another family is starting a medical legacy of its own. Jean Tsigonis, M.D. '78, is a family physician in Fairbanks, Alaska, and a mother of five. Abe Tsigonis, M.D. '11, her oldest, is in his first year of general surgery residency in Wiscon-sin. Another child, Elizabeth, is going to medical school in California. Like the Chisholm kids, Abe understood early on the special role his mother held in the community. \"I saw my mom as a do-everything kind of person. Everyone knew her,\" he says. The kids also experienced Jean's clinical work firsthand by traveling with their parents on medical missions to the Philippines, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, among other places. They often helped with simple tasks, such as bandaging and wound care.Like his mother before him, Abe spent his first year at the Alaska WWAMI site. Attending classes in Anchorage in his first year, he says, \"it was small enough that they let me bring my dog to the classroom.\" He also enjoyed the close relation- ships he developed with his teachers at clinical rotations in Alaska, where there were no residents and few other medical students. \"On my surgery rotation it was just the doctor and me,\" Abe says. \"On my Fairbanks ob/gyn rotation, I actually got to work with my mom for a few deliveries.\"< WWAMI Turns 40 Abe M .

If it weren't for WWAMI, we'd be struggling to recruit doctors .\" FINAL WORDS \"We couldn't afford a medical school in Alaska by any stretch of the imagination .\" Abe has since married a WWAMI- Alaska classmate, Katrin Tsigonis, M.D. '11, also a first-year resident. The couple fully intends to return to their home state to practice. \"It's a place where you really get to influence the medical culture and can make a differ - ence,\" Abe says. \"And there is a huge need for doctors.\" \"I'm excited about Abe's choice,\" says Jean. \"He'll come back to Alaska, which is exactly what we need. It is critical for us to bring doctors back here.\" 14 UW MEDICINE WWAMI Turns 40 > TAKING RESEARCH TO THE COMMUNITY by Delia Ward Research takes place throughout the WWAMI region: at universi-ties, in community-based clinics, and on reservations. It's all part of a practical, multi-state initiative for providing better medical care in our communities. Take this real-life example from Pocatello Family Medicine at Idaho State University, where a woman of child-bearing age had been prescribed a medication for high blood pressure. Although she wasn't pregnant, the clinic could see a potential conflict: the drug, lisinopril, might be harmful to a fetus. Staff wondered: how many of our other patients are in a similar position? The trial balloon Enter the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) \u2014 specifi- cally, Laura-Mae Baldwin, M.D., Res. '84, MPH, the director of the ITHS's WWAMI Region Practice and Research Network. Baldwin and colleagues in the Department of Family Medicine, Al Berg, M.D., MPH, Res. '79, and Gina Keppel, MPH, had begun to col-laborate with the 18 resident training programs in UW Medicine's WWAMI-based Family Medicine Residency Network. These sites were interested in community-based research, and the question about lisinopril (and other medications with similar potential effects) provided the trial balloon they needed. In all, seven clinic sites signed on to the project, and staff, residents and fellows gathered information from more than 300 female patients. The data showed that other women were affected by prescription choices, and the clinics worked together to improve treatment. \"We identified the question,\" said Rex Force, Pharm.D., a researcher at Pocatello Family Medicine in Idaho. \"Then the collaborative process kicked in. The team at ITHS supported our idea and scaled it up to involve the network. It was a great experience.\" \"[The project] wouldn't have been possible if we had only done it at a single site,\" says Baldwin. \"We designed the project together, col-lected and analyzed the data together, reviewed the results together, and then presented the data to the [other] sites together,\" she says. Community data The WWAMI Region Practice and Research Network, led by Baldwin, is one arm in the ITHS's Community Outreach & Research Translation Core (CORT). CORT utilizes the power of community research to \"translate\" medical discoveries into therapies that Photo (Olympic Peninsula): Abigail Echo-HawkSPRING 2012 15 < WWAMI Turns 40 help patients. Dedra Buchwald, M.D., leads the second arm of CORT, the American Indian/Alaska Native Com-munity Outreach & Research Transla-tion Core. A third arm is located at Group Health in Seattle. \"Without this kind of research, you can't effect change in the health of communities,\" says Leo S. Morales, M.D., Ph.D., MPH. Morales is co-di-rector of CORT, an associate investi-gator at the Group Health Research Institute, and an associate professor of health services at the UW . Although the three arms of CORT collaborate with different clinics and populations, they meet regularly to talk about pilot programs and learn from one another. And they're working with Kari Stephens, Ph.D., and Ching-Ping Lin, Ph.D. '10, from the ITHS Biomedical Informatics Core to bring a program called LC Data QUEST to clinics in the region. LC Data QUEST pulls standardized data from electronic medical records, allowing the collection of HIPAA-compliant research data within and among clinics for approved studies. In addition to serving as a powerful data collection tool, the program can help doctors manage health screening and chronic disease \u2014 it issues auto-mated care reminders and instructions for patients who meet certain medical criteria. Eliminating the gap One of the next subjects that Baldwin and her colleagues plan to tackle \u2014 with Beverly Green, M.D., MPH, of the Group Health Research Institute \u2014 is blood pressure. Using a web-based model developed at Group Health, they've written a grant to test whether community pharmacists can help patients with hard-to-control blood pressure. The protocol worked well at Group Health. With modifica-tions, says Baldwin, it should work in the WWAMI region. Research topics like this one, which address urgent problems in primary care, are of great interest to practitioners like Jeff Kaplan, M.D., medical director of Memorial Physi-cians Group in Yakima, Wash. He and his colleagues anticipate partnering in the blood pressure study. \"We're looking for ways to change the ways we provide care,\" he says, to make medicine more efficient and less costly. (Read more about Kaplan's search for accountable care at uwmedmagazine.org.) With the work of partners like Kaplan, Green and Morales, and with support from the ITHS, research fund-ing is helping ensure that medical dis-coveries reach everyone \u2014 eliminating the gap between laboratory and clinic. \"The gap occurs when there isn't a good mechanism for disseminating re-search in communities,\" Morales says. ROBERT LUNDEEN Retired Chairman of the Board,Dow Chemical Company Deer Harbor, WashingtonNOTABLE He's a member of UW Medicine's Scholarship and Student Support Committee . QUOTABLE \"Without WWAMI, medical education in the Northwest would be, I think, in very tough shape . I've always been impressed with the high quality of the students at the UW School of Medicine . They're a bright and talented group of young people .\" FINAL WORDS \"WWAMI is a very good program .\" Baldwin agrees. \"If we used the strategies we already know work, and implemented them in communities to their full extent, we would have a much greater impact on health,\" she says. Health disparities Dedra Buchwald, M.D., UW professor of medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine, remem-bers an early meeting of the ITHS, where members discussed potential partners for community-based re-search. There were many choices, she says, given the enormous breadth of WWAMI \u2014 roughly one-quarter of the American landmass. Laura-Mae Baldwin, M .D ., and her collaborators conduct community- based research to improve care for patients in the five-state region of WWAMI . Photo courtesy of Laura-Mae Baldwin, M.D.16 UW MEDICINE WWAMI Turns 40 > Buchwald, who has worked with American Indian and Alaskan Native communities for more than 20 years, suggested that the ITHS focus on those groups. Given a broad range of challenges and special circumstances, including poverty, poor health literacy, limited educational opportunities, widely dispersed populations, and the need to respect tribal sovereignty, American Indian and Alaskan Native communities suffer from major health disparities. \"If we can make a difference with this population,\" argued Buchwald, \"we can make a change for the bet-ter in almost any population.\" Her colleagues agreed, and the American Indian/Alaska Native Community Outreach & Research Translation Core was launched. Buchwald mentions the success of one ITHS-funded project that focuses on the use of graphic materials to increase health literacy in Native populations. She is developing other projects as well; some are funded by the ITHS, while others are funded by major grantors concerned with issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and hepatitis C in Native populations. Buchwald notes, however, that there's a challenge in conducting research with tribal commu-nities or other small popula-tions prevalent in WWAMI: numbers. How do you maintain the anonymity of a 90-year-old study partici-pant if, for instance, there are only a handful of 90-year-olds in a tribe? One answer may be partnering with other tribes to increase the numbers of study participants. Another is con-ducting qualitative research instead of quantitative. Buchwald hopes the year ahead \u2014 with the help of grants from the ITHS and the National Cancer Institute \u2014 will provide some answers. Broken promises, broken hopes If numbers provide a challenge in working with Native populations, so do other circumstances. Ron Whit-ener, J.D., a UW senior lecturer in law, executive director of the UW Native American Law Center, a graduate of Buchwald's two-year fellowship for Native health researchers, and a member of the Squaxin Island Tribe, explains. In conducting \"bench-to-bedside\" research \u2014 shorthand for taking in-formation gained at the lab bench and translating it into medicine or thera-pies that help patients \u2014 a scientist recruits patients and follows protocols. Working with tribes, he says, adds another layer for the researcher. \"You have an overlay of a sovereign government,\" he says, referring to the U.S. government's recognition of American Indian tribes as sovereign nations. This extra layer can lead to misunderstandings. First, researchers and tribes may not agree on the impor - tance of the research-er's topic \u2014 or the tribe's need to invest in it. Second, some researchers may not want the tribes to have a say in the research or the manner of its publication, though such requests are well within tribal rights. Then there's the prob-lem of history. Dedra Buchwald, M .D . (left), and Karina Walters, Ph .D ., discuss future research collaborations with Native communities .

QUOTABLE \"For Idaho, having a relationship with one of the finest medical schools in the country is a really big plus . It creates opportunities for our students . We're getting some very well-trained physicians who practice in the region, thanks to the quality of education they get through the UW School of Medicine .\" FINAL WORDS \"Getting the best quality of care possible for our employees is important .\" \"Tribes have been researched to death in the U.S.,\" says Whitener, of- ten with poor outcomes. For instance, some researchers have overpromised the benefits of their studies, haven't followed up with a tribe, or have bro-ken contracts. Even so, says Whitener, tribes remain interested in research. \"They want to be involved,\" he says. \"But it has to be done in a respectful manner.\" The people and the research Karina Walters, Ph.D., agrees that a respectful approach is key to work- ing with Native populations. She's the director of the UW Indigenous Wellness Research Institute (IWRI), a professor in the UW School of Social Work, and a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. And she may soon be the newest collaborator in the ITHS's American Indian/Alaska Na-tive Community Outreach & Research Translation Core. She and Buchwald have col- laborated on projects and have shared resources and information \u2014 \"Indian country is small, and we all do a lot of work together\" \u2014 but another level of integration could raise the work in WWAMI to a new level. Instead of the bench-to-bedside approach, says Walters, \"what we would bring is the community-to-bench approach,\" where research is informed by tribal participants. Walters makes her point by recall- ing one of her own cases. Elders from a tribe in Washington, concerned about their children \u2014 some of whom were contracting type 2 or adult-onset diabetes \u2014 contacted her for help. At the same time, the elders made sure Walters knew that they viewed being overweight as part of their culture. First, Walters \u2014 an expert in the social and historical determinants of health \u2014 did some research. She found old tribal photos that showed a lean, fit people. Then she met the elders to talk about their \"original instructions,\" or the rules set out by their ances-tors. Each person in the room said the same thing: that the instructions had changed when the tribe was moved to a reservation. No longer allowed to hunt, fish or travel, they were struck by famine. To keep their babies alive, the tribe overfed them when they could feed them at all. It was an \"aha\" moment for the elders, says Walters, where they realized that a historical survival strategy \u2014 made in response to major, negative shifts in their way of life \u2014 was no longer useful. (Learn more about Walters' novel approach to the obesity epidemic in her tribe at uwmedmagazine.org.)A new twist on a good model Walters and her colleagues could bring a wealth of knowledge, ideas and approaches to work with the ITHS. And like Baldwin and Buchwald and their colleagues, Walters believes strongly in research collaboration in the WWAMI region. Collaboration is key to community- based research. If researchers have something to bring to the table, so do the communities with whom they work. It's a new twist on a good model: making sure new and workable ideas in medicine are translated out in the field. \"What we're saying is, we've got some knowledge,\" says Walters. \"But our communities also have some knowledge \u2014 how do we have these things work together?\" 18 UW MEDICINE WWAMI Turns 40 > Thirty Kenyan medical students left the University of Nairobi in October 2011. Though travel- ing by land, their purpose held all the consequence of a maiden voyage. The 30 students represented the school's first investment in enriching medical education through clinical experiences in less-populated areas. If this sounds familiar, it is because Nairobi is tacking to a course begun 40 years ago at the University of Washington: the WWAMI program, a five-state partnership in medical education. Almost immediately, the Kenyan students' feedback was validating. \"It's fantastic. They say this is giv- ing them real, hands-on experiences A NEW VISION IN KENYA by Brian Donohue that they're not able to get at Kenyatta National Hospital, the main tertiary-care hospital,\" says Carey Farquhar, M.D., Res. '97, MPH, Fel. '03. Farqu-har is a UW associate professor in the departments of medicine, epidemiology and global health. \"I just found out they're having weekly, case-based discussions through distance learning. They connect the four sites \u2014 in Garissa, Naivasha, Mbagathi and Mombasa \u2014 on a video conference, and one of the sites pres-ents a case, which is then discussed by the students and a faculty member at the University of Nairobi,\" she says. Farquhar has been integral to the university's vision: expanding clinical training beyond the capitol. She and the University of Nairobi's Dr. James Kiarie (a UW affiliate associate profes-sor in global health and epidemiology) are principal investigators of a $9.5 million grant that supports that goal. Over two weeks in May 2011, Farquhar was on point when a del-egation of Nairobi medical-school leaders visited for an immersion in the WWAMI program, the immensely fruitful partnership of UW Medicine and the states of Washington, Wyo-ming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. A core WWAMI tenet is that medical students need to learn medicine where it is practiced \u2014 in the community, not just in academic hospital settings. The Kenyan contingent learned how WWAMI nurtures stakeholder SPRING 2012 19 < WWAMI Turns 40 relationships, how faculty receive training at rural clinics, and which nuts-and-bolts issues require routine attention. Along with attending myriad presentations in Seattle, the visitors met with residents and students in Spokane, Wash., and Boise, Idaho, and visited rural clinic sites, simulation labs and classrooms. \"Students come to study in Nairobi and then they don't want to go back to the rural areas. If we give them op-portunities to do rotations as interns in those rural areas, they may actu-ally feel like working there. That's the major takeaway for me,\" says Dr. Isaac O. Kibwage, principal of the College of Health Sciences at the University of Nairobi, after the visit. The visiting delegation from Nairobi saw facilities in Boise, Idaho, and Spokane, Wash .

Equally important, they were empowered to set desired changes in motion back home. For instance, a telemedicine pre- sentation they saw in Seattle informed the weekly videoconference in which remote students and Nairobi faculty discuss patient cases. \"Distance learning with webinars is a great way to keep students feeling an-chored and connected when they're in rural sites by themselves. It gives them a chance to check in, ask 'What's going on at your site?' and exchange lessons about patient cases,\" says Suzanne Allen, M.D., MPH. As the UW School of Medicine's vice dean for regional affairs, Allen oversees the WWAMI program. She wasn't surprised to hear Farquhar's account of Kenyan students' initial feedback. It resembles the feedback she hears from students in WWAMI. \"The amount of experience they get, whether it's helping with a surgery or delivering a baby or being with a family through a difficult time \u2014 it's more hands-on than they might get here in Seattle,\" says Allen. \"Students really feel the impact they can have on patients' lives out in these smaller communities.\" 20 UW MEDICINEby Deirdre R . Schwiesow Right now, someone in Seattle is awaiting a heart trans- plant, and they may help to dramatically change the way heart failure is treated. By serving as an incubator for his or her own stem cells, this person is taking part in an experiment designed to figure out some of the mysteries of re-growing heart cells: heart muscle regeneration. It's a process that may lead to a new era in congestive heart failure therapy. \"What started out as a wild idea a long time ago \u2014 that you could use stem cells to repair the heart \u2014 has turned into a much bigger thing,\" says Charles E. (Chuck) Murry, M.D., Ph.D., Res. '92, UW professor of pathology, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Biology, co-director of the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM), and the Arra and Eva Woods Endowed Professor. This is where heart failure/transplant cardiologist April Stempien-Otero, M.D., Fel. '97, FACC (and the patients) enters the picture. Stempien-Otero directs injection of stem cells \u2014 harvest- ed from each patient's own bone marrow \u2014 into the hearts Feature > of patients who are critically ill with coronary artery disease. These volunteers are awaiting heart transplants, and, like former Vice President Dick Cheney, are using left ventricular assist devices (L VADs) to survive. Because the implanted L VADs pump blood to the body, stem cells can be injected into the heart without risk to the patient's health. After the patient receives a new heart, the damaged organ is examined to determine if the injected cells helped to regenerate heart muscle tissue. State of the heart The need for new therapies for damaged hearts is acute. \"There are about one million heart attacks in the U.S. a year,\" says W . Robb MacLellan, M.D., UW professor of medi- cine, head of the Division of Cardiology, and the Robert A. Bruce Endowed Chair in Cardiovascular Research. \"A real concern \u2014 if you make it through a heart attack \u2014 is that you develop a syndrome called heart failure.\" Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), means that the heart loses its ability to pump blood forward through the body. Major causes include coronary SPRING 2012 21 The Heart of the Matter artery disease and cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle) due to high blood pressure, toxins such as alcohol and chemotherapy, viral infections or genetic factors. \"Unlike the liver,\" says MacLellan, \"the adult heart, once it is injured, has very little capacity to regenerate itself.\" Due to the scarcity of healthy donor hearts, fewer than 2,500 heart transplants are performed each year in the U.S. Thus, many patients who need heart transplants can't get them. At the same time, no new CHF therapies that dramatically improve mortality have been developed in the last 10 years (although the survival rate after transplant has improved). \"The major advancements have been in mechanical devices, but they're extremely expensive. That's why there's so much interest in regenerative solutions,\" explains MacLellan. Experimenting with stem cells to regenerate heart cells has been going on for the past decade, but so far, he says, \"the results have been quite variable \u2014 we don't know how the stem cells work.\" \"What April is doing is really trying to study this in a systematic way \u2014 what's happening to these cells? Are they grafting to the heart? Because if we knew how they worked, we would be better able to pick patients who might benefit from the therapy,\" MacLellan says. The mystery of success Stem cells do help people with heart disease. Studies in Europe have shown increased blood flow in the hearts of patients with coronary artery disease-induced heart failure after the injection of bone marrow-derived stem cells. The mechanisms of improvement, however, are unknown. Stempien-Otero's experiment, which builds on those already undertaken, has two primary goals. The first is to determine how certain bone marrow and other stem cells can improve blood vessel formation and decrease scar tissue formation in ischemic hearts \u2014 hearts receiving insufficient blood. The second is to have her study serve as a proof-of-principle for the process of injecting cells into damaged heart tissue and then examining the cells after the heart is retrieved. by Deirdre Schwiesow Photo: Deirdre Schwiesow22 UW MEDICINE The study offers \"a way that we can very directly test different strategies for improving heart muscle structure,\" Stempien-Otero explains. Her project is part of a suite of studies at UW Medicine \u2014 funded by a grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (part of the National Institutes of Health) \u2014 ultimately aimed at developing cell-based therapies to regenerate the human heart. No ordinary clinical trial Stempien-Otero, a UW associate professor of medicine and the Craig Tall Family Endowed Professor in Heart Failure Research, is conducting her study under the auspices of the Center for Cardiovascular Biology and the Institute for Stem Cell and Regen-erative Medicine. \"[UW Medicine] is one of the few places in the country where I could have done this,\" she says. UW Medicine is a leader in cardiac regeneration research. From bioengi-neering myocardium (heart tissue), In addition to addressing this major public health issue, Stempien-Otero's program is significant because it represents \"first-in-human\" work that's being done here in Seattle. \"April's work is not just like a stan- dard clinical trial; it's a scientifically driven study to understand [the effect of the cells on the surrounding tissue],\" Extra content at uwmedmagazine.org \u00bb Bridging the Gap Between Science and PatientsThus far, Stempien-Otero has stud- ied five patients out of the 12 needed to complete this initial study. In the hearts of the first two patients, she was able to track the area where the cells were injected. \"Our ultimate goal is to be the first institution in the world to actually do pluripotent stem cell therapy,\" says MacLellan. \"This next century is about curing disease through regenerative medi-cine,\" he adds. \"We'll never be able to prevent heart attacks entirely, but for those patients who do have a heart attack, we hope to regenerate the heart back to the way it was.\" Photo: Clare McLean Patient Tony Arena (center), with Chuck Murry, M .D ., Ph .D ., and April Stempien-Otero, M .D ., is taking part in an exciting study designed to advance stem cell therapies for heart failure . \"This next century is about curing disease through regenerative medicine.\" \u2014 Robb MacLellan to using pluripotent stem cells (plu- ripotent cells can differentiate into different types of cells in the body) to regenerate heart muscle, to converting fibroblast stem cells (located through-out the body and easy to obtain) into heart cells, \"there's a very multidisci-plinary, multi-investigator approach at UW Medicine to solve what is a huge public health issue,\" MacLellan says.says Murry. \"Once you start under - standing how something works, then you can rationally try to improve it.\" \"This study is actually faster than a normal clinical trial,\" says Stempien-Otero. \"Each patient can test several different types of cells at the same time, and you can address these ques-tions much more quickly.\" The Heart of the Matter > SPRING 2012 23 The staff is so dedicated at Columbia Valley Community Health (CVCH) in Wenatchee, Wash., that you need to get up early simply to volunteer for an outreach day \u2014 one spent providing migrant workers with diabetes treatment, prenatal care and other vital services. \"The sign-up sheets fill up right away,\" says Derek Whitehall, PA-C (Spokane Class 6). That's because everyone, including the CEO, the medical director and the staff, are so committed to the mission. Caring for the underserved is a mission that Whitehall enjoys, too, and it's an ethic that MEDEX helps instill in its students. \"I bought into Ruth's vision,\" says Whitehall of Ruth Ballweg, PA-C (Seattle Class 11), MPA, chief of the MEDEX section, Department of Family Medicine. He also \u2014 like many people trained in the WWAMI region \u2014 decided to remain there to practice. Whitehall is a dyed-in-the-wool Eastern Washington resident. He grew up in the small farming community of Waterville, about 25 miles northeast of Wenatchee, and he was working in pre-hospital care when he first heard about the MEDEX Northwest program. Whitehall studied in Spokane; after graduation, he worked for a few years as the only healthcare provider in the Springdale Community Health Center before relocating to Wenatchee. Now at Columbia Valley Community Health, Whitehall has no plans to move \u2014 he and his wife want their children to grow up near their grand-parents. And CVCH is a great place to work. \"The MEDEX model of 'health- care for everyone' is exemplified by CVCH,\" says Whitehall. A non- profit, CVCH was founded as the Migrant Farm Workers Clinic, and it served the migrant workers drawn by the region's many orchards and wheat fields. These days, \"La Clinica Chiquita\" serves the Wenatchee area with \"big clinic,\" Wenatchee Valley Medical Center, Whitehall adds, is phenomenal in assisting with specialty care. The sense of community at CVCH is strong \u2014 among the provid-ers, and between providers and pa-tients. Whitehall, who's close to fluent in Spanish, had to bring in a colleague to translate part of a conversation with a patient. It turns out that the patient had seen Whitehall out mowing his lawn in the neighborhood \u2014 the kind of story you only hear in a tight-knit place like Wenatchee. \"Wenatchee is the best place in the state of Washington,\" says Whitehall. A great place to enjoy the outdoors, to raise a family, and, not least, to find meaningful work. \"MEDEX prepared me well,\" he says.

(Larry) Grouse, M.D. '72, Res. '73, Ph.D. \"Now that I'm spending more time as a patient than as a physician,\" says Lawrence D. (Larry) Grouse, M.D. '72, Res. '73, Ph.D., \"I realized that more attention needs to be paid to patient preferences and outcomes.\" Grouse is the executive director of the International COPD Coalition (ICC), a global organization that sup-ports access to care for people suffering from COPD. Although chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease is most often caused by smoking, it also can be caused by pollution and biomass fuel use. In 2009, the ICC developed a bill of rights for COPD patients. Grouse and his colleagues are using the bill \u2014 which includes the right to safe air and a safe environment \u2014 as a tool. For instance, the ICC is working with Prof. Nanshan Zhong and the Chinese Health Ministry in a global initiative to diagnose the disease early, when there may be a better chance of stopping or reversing its course. The ministry is motivated, in part, by the rise of COPD cases and related deaths in China, one of the side effects of the country's rapid industrialization. \"We obtained the strong support of the Chinese Health Minister, Dr. Zhu Chen, for our program,\" says Grouse. And on Nov. 6, 2011, the ICC presented an achievement award to Dr. Chen and the Chinese Health Ministry for their work in combating COPD.

Assefi, M.D. '97 What's a thrillionaire? Someone who enjoys giving simply for the thrill of it. The word was coined by philanthropist Ruth Ann Harnisch, but School of Medicine alumna Nassim P . Assefi, M.D. '97, has embraced it as her own. \"I came to realize early in adulthood that I had won the lottery of birth \u2014 in North America, to educated and sup-portive parents...and this perspective has fueled my deep desire to give back,\" says Assefi, a second-generation Iranian-American. One of the ways she gives back is her medical practice; Assefi works at Country Doctor Community Health Centers in Seattle, which serves people whether or not they can pay for care. She also volunteers for human rights clinics through Health Rights International and Physicians for Human Rights, networks of volunteer physicians that evaluate and advocate for torture victims. Assefi is a novelist, too \u2014 Say I Am You, her second book, explores privilege, the promises and perils of humanitarianism, and what two young Muslim women in post-Taliban Afghanistan do with their lucky lot in life. And soon, she'll be adding another accomplishment to a long list of accomplishments: the birth of her first child. \"The practice of medicine is more of a hobby for me these days than my professional livelihood, and I've never been happier,\" says Assefi.

Participants \"shared some fascinating and power - ful stories,\" says Colin McCluney, who helped organize the event. \"It was really fun and empowering.\" McCluney, who is taking a year off from his course work at the UW School of Medicine to serve as the 2011-2012 Education and Advocacy Fellow of the American Medical Student Association (AMSA), is a natural fit for this kind of activism, having long followed the road less travelled. Born in Scotland, McCluney has lived in the U.S. since 1987 and in Seattle for the last 10 years. He was taking pre-med classes at Reed College in Portland, Ore., until a music theory course changed his direction. \"I came back around to medicine eventually,\" he says. \"It's one of those things that you should be sure about before you commit the time and expense.\" A non-traditional student by virtue of his relative age and experience, McCluney also has been more active in advocacy than many of his peers. An internship at AMSA's national office the summer before he started medical school confirmed McCluney's in-terest in the student-governed organization, which represents physicians-in-training. \"Since then I've been involved in various aspects of the organization, including the 'Healthcare for All' campaign \u2014 students working toward everyone having access to medically necessary health care,\" he says. McCluney's dedication to access also informed his choice of medical school. \"The emphasis on primary care at UW and the clinical opportunities provided by the WWAMI program were really appealing to me,\" says McCluney. After the \"grand tour\" \u2014 WWAMI rotations \u2014 McCluney started his AMSA fellowship in July 2011, based at the organization's national headquarters outside Washington, D.C. \"A big part of [the draw] was the opportunity to combine the education and the advocacy pieces,\" he explains. In his role as fellow, he helps to coordinate national conferences and symposia for AMSA members, develops his mentoring skills through an intern program, directs AMSA's legislative efforts \u2014 such as contributing to a brief for the Supreme Court \u2014 and supports members' efforts through training programs and other projects. \"The fellowship is expanding my personal belief that physicians should be involved in advocacy,\" McCluney says. \"That can be writing a letter, or talking to people in your community; it doesn't have to mean writing a policy paper.\" Which brings us back to the December rally and the support of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Noting that AMSA has long pushed for access to health-care, McCluney says, \"There are all different kinds of advocacy, and one of them is direct action expression.\" Read more about AMSA at amsa.org. 34 UW MEDICINE OCCUPYING WALL STREET The Rev .

Robertson, M.D., known as \"Dr. R.,\" was one of Seattle's most influential physicians. An expert in pediatrics, toxicology, teaching and poison prevention, Robertson was born in Brooklyn, raised in New York, and graduated from the University of Rochester School of Medicine in Rochester, N.Y. He taught pediatrics at Yale University before heading to Ohio State University to chair its Depart-ment of Pediatrics. Moving to the Northwest in 1963 to work for UW Medicine and Seattle Children's, Robertson started the SPRING 2012 35Washington Poison Center. Over the next five decades, he served as direc-tor of medical education at Children's, chair of pediatrics at UW Medicine, and medical director for Washing-ton Poison Center. Robertson was a strong advocate of medical marijuana and supported an initiative to legal-ize marijuana for terminally ill and chronically debilitated patients; he also supported an initiative that advocated for patients having the right to die with dignity. He is survived by several children: Andy, Doug, Kerry Kuenzi, Kathy and Lynn. If you would like to read more about Robertson, please visit The Seattle Times at seattletimes.com.

RUBIN, M.D. Born July 20, 1921, in Philadelphia, Penn. Died Dec. 19, 2011, on Mercer Island, Wash. A member of the UW School of Medicine faculty for 57 years, Cyrus E. Rubin, M.D., was a pioneer in gastroenterology. Officially retired since 1992, he remained an active teacher, investigator and clinician. He received an M.D. at Harvard Medi-cal School, and, after an internship at Beth Israel in Boston, he served as an officer in the U.S. Army Medical Corps. He then completed further training: a residency in medicine at the VA in Framingham, Mass., a residency in radiology at Beth Israel, and gastro-enterology training at the University of Chicago. Rubin came to the Depart-ment of Medicine at the University of Washington in 1954; at the time, he and Wade Volwiler, M.D., made up the entire gastroenterology faculty. In the late 1950s and 1960s, Rubin made engineering advances in gastric and intestinal biopsies that led to the accurate diagnosis of celiac disease. Use of the Rubin Tube demonstrated that celiac sprue in children and in adults were identical disorders, and his classic 1960 paper established the diagnostic criteria for the disease. Over the years, he continued to refine endo-scopic technology and its application to diagnosis, treatment and research on gastrointestinal disorders, becom-ing an authority on celiac disease and receiving international recognition for his many accomplishments. Always mindful of patients' needs, Rubin encouraged the food industry to produce gluten-free foods to help patients adjust to their condition. More recently, he produced an online lecture series for physicians on celiac sprue and many of gastroenterology's classic texts. He was a sympathetic teacher and mentor who trained scores of gastroenterologists, including many leaders in the field. Rubin received international recognition for his accomplishments, including the major awards given by all three American gastroenterologi-cal organizations: the Distinguished Achievement Award and the Frie-denwald Medal from the American Gastroenterology Association, the Rudolph Schindler Award from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and the Clinical Research Award from the American College of Gastroenterology. The Cyrus E. Rubin Endowed Chair in Medicine at the University of Washington was created in his honor in 1997. Rubin was a generous philanthro- pist, a dedicated oenophile who grew his own grapes, an enthusiastic sup-porter of the arts, education, culture, and good causes of all kinds, a bonsai artist, an amateur archaeologist, a sing-er in the Old GI Geezers Quartet (with Dave Saunders, M.D., Don Ostrow, M.D., and Charles E. (Chuck) Pope II, M.D., Res. '61), and an all-around humanist. He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Grace S. Rubin, his son and daughter, William D. Rubin and Betsy Deutsch, and five grandchildren: Aaron Akiva, Anna and Yoni Rubin, and Rachel and Sarah Deutsch. (With thanks to Roberta Wilkes and William J.
