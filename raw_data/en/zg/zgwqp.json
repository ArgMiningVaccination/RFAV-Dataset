A feeling of gassiness accompanied by nausea, bloating, and unexplained weight loss may indicate Helicobacter pylori infection. About 44.3% of the population around the world is affected by this microbe ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5998008/)). Natural treatment of Helicobacter pylori mostly includes using ingredients with medicinal value to minimize the infection. In this article, you will know about Helicobacter pylori infection and how to manage it effectively with simple home remedies. Continue reading further. In This Article What Is H.pylori? Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori are bacteria that can enter your body and thrive in your digestive tract. After years, they can surface as [sores in the lining of your stomach](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-for-stomach-ulcers/) or the upper part of your small intestine. This infection may also lead to stomach cancer in some individuals. H. pylori infections are quite common. These bacteria are found in the bodies of two-thirds of the world's population. However, they do not cause symptoms in most people. Possible symptoms are discussed in the next section. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534233/) showed that H. pylori affects up to 50% of the world's population. Its prevalence varies across the world, with the United States having a 5% prevalence in children under the age of ten. When compared to White Americans, Hispanic and African American groups have a higher prevalence. Signs And Symptoms Stomach ulcers are one of the most prominent symptoms of an H. pylori infection. The other symptoms are mostly associated with ulcers. They may include: - Bloating - Nausea - Vomiting - Burping [Loss of hunger](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/simple-home-remedies-to-improve-appetite/) - Weight loss In some cases, the ulcers can bleed into the stomach or intestines. This could be dangerous to your health. The symptoms of bleeding ulcers may include: - Bloody stool that may be dark red or black - Difficulty in breathing - Fainting or dizziness - Fatigue [Pale skin](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/what-is-porcelain-skin/) - Vomit that may have some blood in it - Severe stomach ache While it is not common, some H. pylori infections can lead to the development of stomach cancer. This may cause a few symptoms like heartburn. Eventually, you may also notice other signs like: - Nausea - Loss of appetite - Belly pain and/or swelling - Vomiting - Weight loss without any apparent reason - Feeling full after eating a small amount Stomach ulcers were initially thought to be a result of smoking and consuming spicy foods. It was later that researchers found H. pylori to be the main culprit behind the development of such ulcers. Let's look into the causes and risk factors. Causes And Risk Factors What causes an H. pylori infection to spread from one person to another is still not known. While these bacteria have coexisted with humans for many years, the infection was found to spread from one person's mouth to another. It may also spread from feces to the mouth. Infected individuals who do not wash their hands after using the loo can spread the infection to others through food and water they may have touched. Once ingested, H. pylori can penetrate the mucus lining of the stomach, generating substances that neutralize the stomach acids. As a result, the stomach cells become increasingly vulnerable to the harsh acids. The irritation of the stomach lining due to H. pylori and the stomach acids cause ulcers in the stomach as well as the duodenumi [X]The first part of the small intestine, right below the stomach, which receives food and absorbs nutrients from it. . Factors that can increase your risk of developing an H. pylori infection are: - Living in or visiting a developing country - Sharing utensils with an affected individual - No or less access to hot water - Non-Hispanici [X]Someone who is neither Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, nor is connected to any Latin-speaking nations. African or Mexican American descent - Poor hygiene practices - Mouth-to-mouth contact - Sexual intercourse with an affected individual As you can see, H. pylori infections can be transmitted from one person to another in a number of ways.
