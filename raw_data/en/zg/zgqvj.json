This principal makes a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and fills the gap between the school, home and community . The Student Handbook on \"Beauty and Wellness\" is a part of the qualification package developed for the implementation of National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF), an initiative of Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India to set common principles and guidelines for a nationally recognized qualification system covering Schools, Vocational Education and Training Institutions, Technical Education Institutions, Colleges and Universities. It is envisaged that the NSQF , will promote transparency of qualifications, cross-sectorial learning, and student-centered learning and facilitate learner's mobility between different qualifications, thus encouraging lifelong learning. This Student Handbook, which forms a part of vocational qualification package in Beauty and Wellness for students who have passed Class X or equivalent examination, was created by a group of experts from Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE), a constituent of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in association with Labour Net India Private Services Ltd., Bangalore. This Student Handbook attempts to discourage rote learning and to bring about necessary flexibility in offering of courses, necessary for breaking the sharp boundaries between different subject areas. The Students Handbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups and activities requiring hands-on-experience. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy of Education (1986).

Indicators of good rapport include: Similar body language Same Gesture Parallel rhythm in movement and speech Same Voice tone As a beauty and wellness consultant, it is very essential to establish and ensure client satisfaction. Below are the points that will help in building good rapport with the client. 1. Words What we actually talk about and the words we use involves in building rapport, so listen out for the terminology others use and try to use their terms rather than yours. This also extends to showing common interes ts, common goals and common values. 11 Beauty and Wellness2. Tone or Voice While communicating over phone, the tone of the speaking is highly important. However, during face to face communication, body language and facial expression plays an important role to convey the message one wants to deliver. But during conversation over, only the voice is perceived by the other party. And it is the tone which does all the work for effective communication. 3.

When your actions show you are respectful, courteous and helpful, you are behaving in a professionally ethical manner. Various characteristics, principles and values contribute to the development of a high standard of professionalism. And it can be a challenge to keep those ethics in place year after year. The one trait that is absolutely essential in order to reach and remain at the highest level of professionalism is commitment. The most ethical people make a commitment to cultivate the character traits outlines above as part of their personal and professional growth. Such people often embody the following qualities as well. Self-care # As a beauty and wellness consultant, you will be seen as a kind of a caregiver. If you are to be truly helpful to others, it is essential that you take care of yourself. 12 Integrity # Maintain your integrity by making sure your behaviour and actions match your values. For instance, if you believe it is unethical to sell products you do not really believe in just to turn a profit then do not do so. On the other hand, if you feel that a client requires products and additional services for healthy skin maintenance, it would be unethical not to give the client that information. A sense of integrity also involves not talking poorly about client's haircut, not stealing and lending equipment or supplies of another person. However, it does include endorsing the price structure as well as policies of your employer. Discretion # Avoid sharing your personal problems with clients. Nor you should you ever breach their confidentiality by telling other people the concerns they may have shared with you. Make sure to maintain your professional boundaries and standards. Communication # Your responsibility and ethical behaviour extend to your communication with clients as well as people with whom you work. Your interactions must be clear and direct, not passive and withholding. Creating a clear line of communications with all those in working world will serve you well. The respect you get from your clients and peers and most important from yourself, will help you stay course. Exercise A. ASSIGNMENT 1.

Performance standards The performance standards may include, but not limited to: Performance standards Yes No 1. Identify any three types of massage 2. Demonstrate at least two massaging techniques Reflexology is the alternative treatment that involves application of pressure to specific points and areas of hands and feet with specific thumb, finger, and hand techniques without the use of oil, lotion or cream. The logic behind providing pressure on various body points is that each point corresponds to organs and systems and pressing them has a beneficial effect on the body. For example, reflexology states a specific point for thyroid gland on the palm (below the thumb). When reflexology therapist presses the point using thumb or fingers, it improves the functioning of the thyroid gland. Many people have been benefited with this therapy when used it for diseases like anxiety, asthma, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular issues, diabetes, headaches, kidney function, PMS, and sinusitis. Hands and feet pressure points are generally used for reflexology treatment. Practitioners usually used fingers or thumbs to put pressure. Alternatively, items such as rubber balls, rubber bands, stick of wood are also used. Hand Reflexology Hand reflexology is equally effective like other types of reflexology. However, hand reflexology takes longer time to give result. Therapist usually prefers foot reflexology over hand reflexology as it gives faster result. Therapist needs to hold the pressure for loner time to stimulate a hand reflexology point ashand's reflexes are located much deeper under the skin.Relevant Knowledge Session-2 Study of Reflexology 28Hand Reflexology Technique With one finger or thumb apply strong pressure on spot on the hand. Rotate the finger/thumb so the pressure is being applied in a circular motion without lifting the thumb or finger. Repeat the process for about three to five seconds on the same spot. Now move the finger/ thumb to a new spot next and repeat again for about three to five sec onds. Foot Reflexology Foot reflexology deciphers the ancient principle that all organs and glands in the body are connected to the reflex points on foot. Foot represents the body with ten reflex zones. The foot reflexology chart reflects reflex zone corresponding to a body part. Exerting pressure on these points reduces and eliminates blockage improving the functionality of the corresponding glands or organs. Foot Reflexology Technique Foot reflexology is mostly performed using thumb walking. It is performed following the given steps. Thumb walking technique Bend your thumb and put pressure with the thumb. Bend your body towards the foot while exerting pressure Move up and release the pressure and straighten your thumb. Release the pressure several times to continue thumb walking. 29 Beauty and WellnessAromatherapy Aromatherapy is a form alternative medicine that utilizes the healing power of fragrance to enhance psychological and physical well-being. In other words, it can describe as fragrant cure. Aromatherapy doesn't just work through the sense of smell alone, however. Inhalation is only one application method. Essential oils can also be applied to the skin. When used topically, the oils penetrate the skin, taking direct action on body tissues and organs in the vicinity of application. They also enter the bloodstream and are carried throughout the body. Of course, when applied topically the fragrance of the essential oil is also inhaled. Professional aroma therapists focus very specifically on the controlled use of essential oils to treat ailments and disease. There are three different modes of action in the body: pharmacological, which affects the chemistry of the body; physiological, which affects the ability of the body to function and process; and psychological, which affects emotions and attitudes. These three modes interact continuously. Aromatherapy is so powerful partly because it affects all three modes. You choose the application method based on where you most want the effects concentrated and on what is most convenient and pleasing to you. Aromatherapy is actually an aspect of a larger category of healing treatment known as herbal medicine. Herbal medicine also utilizes the healing powers of plants to treat physical and emotional problems, but it uses the whole plant or parts of the plant, such as leaves, flowers, roots, and seeds, rather than the essential oil. Aromatherapy and herbal medicine can be used individually, or they can be used jointly to augment potential healing benefits. Products Used in Aromatherapy Essential oil is the base and most important product used in aromatherapy. Apart from essential oil, a wide range of products are used for the therapy such as candles, soaps, diffusers, lotions, and fragrances. Most of these products are made from essential oil blends. Similar to essential, they also carry the therapeutic properties of essential oil and help to release stress, control mood swing, and affects overall physical health. Listed below are the products that are most commonly used to perform aromatherapy. Essential oil: Essential oils are the main products used in aromatherapy. It is derived from the natural sources like flowers, trees, fruits, vegetables and seeds. There are many essential oils available in the market. Lavender, rosemary, thyme, orange, Eucalyptus, Peppermint, Tea Tree are the common essential oils used for aromatherapy. 30Carrier Oils: Carrier oils are used to dilute essential oil before application on the skin. Essential are very strong to use in neat and undiluted form. Commonly used carrier oils are sweet almond oil, grape seed oil, jojoba oil, olive oil and apricot kernel oil. Candles: Special candles with fragrance are burned to create a soothing and relaxing environment inside the room. They come in various shapes and fragrance. Diffusers: Diffusers are similarly used as candles to live up the atmosphere to carry out aromatherapy. Many types of diffusers are available in the market. Fragrances: Different types of fragrances are sprayed during aromatherapy to create soothing environment. Soaps: Instead of regular soaps, aromatic soaps are used for aromatherapy. These soaps are gentle on skin and soothing on nerves.31 Beauty and WellnessMoisturizers: Moisturizers in the form of cream, lotion, butters are used after each treatment to moisturize the skin.

A diet that is lacking in nutrients can lead to many different health problems ranging from tiredness and lack of energy to serious problems with the function of vital organs and lack of growth and development. A balanced diet needs to contain foods from all the main food groups in the correct proportions to provide the body with optimum nutrition. The main food groups are fruits & vegetables, Protein, Dairy, Carbohydrates and fatty & sugary food. Every person is different and hence the correct diet for health may vary from person to person, however by following a diet that is varied, covers all foods groups and is low in undesirable nutrients such as sodium, saturated fats and sugar, you are well on your way to a healthy body. Guideline Daily Amounts (GDAs) Nutritional needs vary depending on sex, size, age and activity levels. So use this chart as a general guide only. The chart shows the daily amounts recommended for a healthy, balanced diet for maintaining rather than losing or gaining weight. Typically women need fewer nutrients than men with the exception of salt and fibre.

These five groups, which we'll go into more detail about, are: Fruit & Vegetables Protein Dairy Carbohydrates Fatty & Sugary foods Fruit and vegetables: Why it's important: Fruits and vegetables provide your body with lots of vitamins and minerals which are hard to come by in other areas of your diet. They also have a high water and low fat content so are a good choice for snacks. How much fruits and vegetables you need: As you probably know, the general guideline is to eat at least five portions per day. These portions must be of five different fruits and vegetables to make sure that you get a variety of vitamins and minerals.How to bring it into your diet: The easiest way to raise the amount of fruit and veg that you eat is to snack on them rather than chocolate and crisps. But as well as that, here are some simple ways to include fruits and vegetables in your diet; Glass of fresh fruit juice with your breakfast. Berries or other fruit sprinkled over your breakfast cereal. Portion of dried fruit as a mid-morning snack. A salad with lunch. A portion of steamed vegetables with your evening meal. Sweet fruit such as strawberries as a desert. Vegetable soups. 35 Beauty and WellnessProtei n Why it's important: Protein's main function is for growth and repair, so it's required for hair and nail growth, repair of nerve cells, muscle growth and repair, and healing injuries. How much do you need: The recommended daily amount of protein for an adult woman is 45g, and the recommended daily amount for an adult man is about 55.5g per day. If you regularly exercise or are trying to build more muscle, then more protein will be required in your diet. To make it easier to decide whether or not you are consuming enough protein, it's suggested that you eat 2-3 portions a day. Some examples of what is considered as a portion are: 100g meat, poultry or fish, 2 eggs, 3tbsp nuts, seeds or beans. How to bring it into your diet: Here are some ways of increasing your protein intake; Spread peanut or almond butter over your toast at breakfast. Try sprinkling seeds or nuts over a salad for lunch handful of peanuts/chana/almonds/walnuts/khakhra. Have a tuna sandwich with seeded bread at lunch. Try soy-based yogurts in place of what you usually buy. Always include a portion of meat/poultry/fish in your main meal. Dairy Why it's important: Dairy is a very good source of calcium. Calcium is important as it helps to promote strong bones and teeth. As well as this, it also regulates muscle contraction, which includes the heartbeat, so it's very important. How much do you need: It's recommended for adults to aim for three portions of dairy per day. If you are worried about your fat-intake then opt for low-fat versions. Here are some ideas of what counts as a portion; 200ml milk, 250ml soya- milk with calcium, 30g cheese, 1 pot of yoghurt. Children and teenagers also need plenty of dairy in their diet since their bones are still developing. How to bring it into your diet: If you want to increase the amount of calcium that you consume, then here are some ways of adding it to your diet; Obvious, but pouring milk over your cereal or oatmeal Some dried fruit contains small amounts of calcium so try sprinkling some over your cereal or eat a handful as a snack. 36 Eat a spinach -based salad with toasted almonds or sesame seeds sprinkled over it. Have a cheese sandwich for a lunch on the go. Have a mug of warm milk, or hot chocolate made with milk before bed. Carbohydrates Why it's important: Most carbohydrates provide a long lasting, slow release of energy which prevents an energy crash throughout the day. They are generally low in fat yet are still filling, which means you are less likely to snack on less healthy things in between meals. The best type of carbohydrates is whole-grain products. Whole grain is widely available in many types of carbohydrates, and their importance is becoming more widely known. Whole grain provides many useful nutrients which are stripped away in refined grains. They contain fibre which promotes a healthy digestive system, protein (which you already know the importance of), vitamins and minerals, and carbohydrate (mainly in the form of starch). They are also rich in anti- oxidants which prevent cancer, heart disease and diabetes. How much do you need: It's recommended that about a third of each meal you eat should be carbohydrates. You should also be aware of which carbs you are choosing in order to get the most out of your portions. Eating too much will lead to weight gain, but gram for gram carbohydrates contains fewer calories than fat and protein. How to bring it into your diet: Each meal should be based on a complex carbohydrate, along with vegetables and protein. Here are some ideas on how to bring whole-grain into your daily diet; Look for whole-grain cereals such as porridge oats, or wholegrain bread to toast for your breakfast. At lunch opt for more protein than carbs as a large carbohydrate meal can leave you feeling sleepy. There are many ways of cooking potatoes to go with your evening meal, such as making wedges, mashing potato, boiling, roasting and even shallow frying. Switch from what you normally buy to whole grain pasta and rice instead of white. Fatty and sugary foods While many people assume that fat and sugar should be cut out if you want to be healthy, this is wrong. It's important to include a little bit in your diet, it's just all about finding the correct balance. Besides, if you never treat yourself then one day you're going to binge on lots of unhealthy food, and that's really not good for you. 37 Beauty and WellnessWhy it's important: Fat is good for you in small amounts as it transports fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E & K) around the body, and it also supplies essential fatty acids. These essential fatty acids have to be supplied through diet, and research suggests that they improve your immune system as well as heart health. Fat is stored under the skin as a fuel reserve, so it's good to have a bit there, especially as it also cushions your organs. You do need to be aware though, that too much fat will cause obesity- related diseases, so just consume it in moderation. How much do you need: 1g of fat contains 9 calories, this means that it's really easy to over eat and gain weight when eating fatty foods, so you really should keep record of it. General guidelines suggest that fats should make up, at the most, 35% of the energy in your diet, and that saturated fats should cover less than 11% of your total energy intake, (this works out at 70-95g of fat per day at most). As for sugar, sugary food should only be eaten at mealtimes to prevent tooth decay, and other than naturally occurring sugars, you should attempt to reduce your intake as much as possible. Over-eating of sugary foods can lead to diabetes and obesity. How to bring it into your diet: rather than listing ways to get a fatty diet, which we all know too well, we will discuss about the ways of reducing your fat/sugar intake, and ways of replacing your bad fats/sugars with better versions. Cook food with vegetable oil instead of butter or lard. Warm olive oil can be used on bread as a replacement for butter or margarine. Make a salad dressing out of virgin olive oil rather than using salad cream or mayonnaise. Find alternatives for your unhealthy snacks, you could snack on seeds, nuts, raw vegetables or fruit rather than chocolate or crisps. Grill meat and fish rather than frying it to reduce the fat content. When grilling meat you should make sure that there is drainage for the fat so that it doesn't stay in the meat. Look for lean meat in the supermarket and always cut off fatty excess on meat before cooking. Choose reduced-fat dairy produce.

It merely means food which someone eats or need to eat to maintain the body mass as per their weight, age and height. Alteration in diet plans is required to meet the daily requirement to maintain weight i.e. for weight gain or weight loss, to build muscles by a body builder and athlete, to gain more energy to keep up with sports activities by athletes We will now discuss a few guidelines that one should follow for: i. Weight gain ii. Weight loss iii. Sports or athletes diet iv. Body building 39 Beauty and WellnessWeight gain diet A healthy diet is required if you are underweight. You would need to add more protein and carbohydrate in your diet to gain appropriate weight. While there are numerous supplements in the market that might help increase daily caloric intake, they have no real benefits when compared to smart food and lifestyle choices, which are a healthier option in the long run. 1. Choose dairy products, eggs, fish and meat over bread and vegetables. Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca. 2. Eat snack more often. Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars. Also, eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day. 3. Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories like milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks. 4. You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass. Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbbells, not fancy gym machines. If you have a high metabolic rate - which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest - you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity . 5. Be consistent. It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results. But no weight gain program will work for you if you are not regular! Remember: Heredity does play a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight, but only to a certain extent.

During consultation, you should discuss the client's general health, the health of nails and skin, the client's lifestyle and needs, and the nail services you can offer. Use your knowledge of skin, nails, and nail services to help your client select the most appropriate service. Consultation has two parts: the analysis and the recommendations. For best results, you should perform them separately and distinctly. 1. Analysis: This is the information gathering part of the consultation. Ask questions, looking closely at the client's skin and nails. Touch the skin and nails, pointing out their texture, moisture content, coloration, and condition to the client. As relevancy question concerning the client's lifestyle and at home care. As what goals the client has in mind for the nail service. 2. Recommendations: Recommendation is provided only after the above information has been gathered. Once you are aware of the client's expectation and goal, you can recommend appropriate service. Explain the benefits and results of the service and recommend home-care products with instructions on how and when they are to be used. Consultation is the first opportunity to portray yourself as a professional to your client. It should be performed in a straight forward and confident manner . You need to: Focus on the client Look at the client directly while speaking in a tone that demonstrates integrity and confidence. Support your recommendations with facts and information. Be friendly and helpful. A well-handled consultation will help establish you in the eyes of a client. It demonstrates the difference between being a professional and \"just performing a service.\" Discussing the Client's General Health To know about client's health, ask relevant question concerning his/her general health. Always read the completed health record so that you will be alert to precautions you must take during services. 47 Beauty and WellnessFor example, be particularly careful while filing the nails or pushing back the pterygium (forward growth of the cuticle) of diabetic client, and never nip the cuticles. Diabetics heal slowly and easily get infections that will not heal quickly, sometimes not at all. Clients with arthritis should have their hands held gently during the service, while clients who have circulatory disease, such as varicose veins, should be massaged very carefully. It is the responsibility of the technician to seek out information that will ensure the health of all clients. Following are some of the examples of client consultation questions:1. Do you currently or previously suffered from health conditions such as allergies, skin condition like psoriasis or bruise easily? 2. Are you a diabetic patient? 3. Are you or do you suspect that you are pregnant? 4. Have you preciously had manicure or artificial nail treatment? 5. Do you suffer from any adverse reaction? Medication related queries: 1. Are you currently taking any blood thinning medication? 2. Are you currently taking steroids? 3. Are you currently taking any antihistamines? During consultation, it is also important to discuss on client's health of her nails and skin, nail related disorders and diseases as well as contraindications of manicure. A beauty consultant should be well aware of the nail disorders and diseases. She should be able to easily identify nail disorders and diseases. If the client has a nail or skin disorder/diseases that prevents you from performing a service, you should refer the client to her physician and offer to perform a service as soon as the disorder has been treated. There are various kinds of nail disorders. Some of the nails disorders are given below: 1. Blue nails - Also known as discoloured nails, this condition is caused by poor blood circulation, a heart disorder, or tropical and oral medications. 2. Bruised nails - A condition in which a blood clot forms under the nail plate, forming a dark purplish spot, usually due to injury. Blue nail Bruised nail 483.

Nails naturally vary greatly in shape, but usually classified into five general shapes: square, squoval (square with rounded edges), round, oval, and pointed. Keep in mind the following considerations when deciding which shape to go with: The shape of client's hands The length of the fingers The shape of the cuticles The type of work the client does It is generally found that the nails should be shaped to mirror the shape of the cuticles. Only an attractive hand can afford to direct attention to itself by exaggerated shape and colour. People who perform work with their hands usually require shorter nails in order to avoid nail breakage and injury . The square nail is completely straight across the free edge with no rounding at the edge. The length depends on the client's preference. A. Assignment 1.

List two types of nail disorders and diseases Manicure Treatment Manicure is a specialize treatment for hands and fingernails that includes functions, like: shaping, removing the cuticles and nail polishing. Manicure trims your nail and gives a well groomed appearance to your hands, makes your hands feel soft to touch and also soothes or relaxes the muscles of your hand. The process of manicuring has a long history running from more than five thousand years of human existence. Since ages, men and women both have Relevant KnowledgeSession-2 Types of Manicure54been traced to enjoy a pampered and relaxing manicure service. Tools and equipment used in manicure: Different tools and equipment are used during manicure treatment: Manicure table Manicurist's stool Finger bowl Container for cotton balls Container for cotton swabs Polish remover pump container Container for disinfectant Diffuser Garbage container, High-grade disinfectant, Cotton balls and one medium hot towel, one large towel and one hand towel Bowl Manicure Table: It is used almost in all salons to provide manicure treatment Manicurist's Table: This table is used by the manicurist to sit and do manicure for the client seated on the manicure table. Bowl: While conducting the manicure, bowl containing hot water usually filled with lemon or flower to soak client's fingers in it. Manicure Table55 are as follows: 1. Nail cutter: A nail clipper (also called a nail trimmer or nail cutter) is a hand tool used to trim fingernails, toenails and hangnails. 2. Nail filer: A nail filer is a tool mainly used for shaping the edges of the nails. It may either be of emery boards, ceramic, glass, crystal, plain metal files or metal file coated with corundum (sapphire). Emery boards are used extensively than any other filer. 3. Cuticle softener: A cuticle is the skin covering at the exposed part of human body that eventually provides protection to the underlying skin. A cuticle softener softens and beautifies the cuticles. This cream will maintain the soft cuticles and pliable and prevent them from cracking or sticking to the nail. 4. Cuticle cutter: Nail technicians use cuticle cutters/ nippers to 'roll back' the cuticle. It is the stage where one can remove the excess cuticle by cutting or separating it from the base skin using the nippers.565. Hand cream/lotion- Hand creams are basically the hand moisturizer and lotions that can be applied on the hand with the neat cloths, cotton or bare hands. These cream/lotions have to be applied to provide smooth, re- hydrated, and soft skin. Hand Lotion Nail Buffer Nail Polish Remover Nail Polish Scrubber6. Nail buffer- It is used for polishing the nail in order to look shiny and more reliable. 7. Polish remover- Nail polish remover is constantly used for removing of the nail polish, it is an organic solvent, but may also include oils, scents and colouring. 8. Nail polish- Nail polish is applied to human hand or toe nails mainly to decorate and protect the nail plate. 9. Scrubber- Scrubs are used for exfoliation. People who are having the dry skin should avoid this exfoliates.57 Beauty and WellnessSteps of basic manicure process: Step 1: Gather the essentials/tools. Abrasive nail files and buffers base coat Client's arm cushion Nail polish Cuticle removers Disposable or terry cloth towels finger bowl Gauze and cotton wipe container hand creams and lotions Nail bleach Nail creams, lotions, and penetrating nail oils nail hardener Nail polish dryers polish remover Service cushion Supply tray (optional) Terry cloth mitts (optional) Top coat Trash containers Ultraviolet or electric nail polish dryer (optional) Wooden pusher Step 2: Remove any previously applied nail polish. An acetone-based nail-polish remover is a bit harsh than non- acetone removers. Step 3: Shape nails. Clip the nails, if necessary, after soaking for just a few seconds to prevent the nail from splintering when it is dry, and then gently file them into shape. A slightly rounded nail shape or square-rounded edge is generally the best way to go. Avoid metal or extremely coarse nail files to prevent splintering\u2014opt for a gently abrasive emery board or crystal nail file instead.58Step 4: Soak away. Place hands in a bowl of warm (not too hot) water and add a bit of your gentle face cleanser to the water. Avoid putting detergent or soapy cleansers in the water because they can be drying and make cuticles look worse. Soaking the cuticle before trimming is crucial, but over-soaking actually damages skin and nails, so keep it to three minutes or less. Step 5: Apply cuticle remover. When cutting away the thickened skin around the nail, apply a bit of cuticle remover cream. Step 6: Remove excess cuticle around the nail. Very gently push the cuticle back away from the nail with a cuticle pushing tool, but don't push it too far because it can damage nail growth or fray the cuticles. Be careful NOT to pull, lift, tear, rip, force, or cut into the cuticle in any way. Step 7: Use Exfoliant. Take a small quantity of exfoliant. Gently do circular massage with exfoliant and rinse off. It removes dead skin. Step 8: Moisturize. Massage a rich cream or silky oil into the cuticles and all over the hands to hydrate and replenish skin. Step 9: Prepare for polish. Moisturizing ingredients of any kind left on the nail will prevent polish from adhering properly. Using a cotton swab or pad, apply nail-polish remover over the nail's surface to remove any residue. While it helps to avoid getting remover on the cuticle because you want to keep that area moisturized, don't worry if you do because you're going to apply moisturizer on your nails again once the polish is dry. Step 10: Buffing. Buff the nails. Step 11: Paint nails in layers. If you have weak or brittle nails, use a base coat of ridge-filling nail polish to shore up the nail. A base coat also protects nails from staining and prevents chipping. Next, apply your colour polish in layers, allowing each layer to dry between coats.59 Beauty and Wellness Step 12: Reapply moisturizer and during the day reapply sunscreen! Keeping your hands and the nail area healthy requires moisturizer and sunscreen. You can't have great nails and hands without these two essential items. There various types of manicure services available that are suggested by beautician to the client depending upon requirements and nail condition. Some of them are discussed below: Hot Oil Manicure This treatment can be carried out after the cuticle work has been completed and before the hand and arm massage. The oil used should be heated to a comfortable temperature and the nails or the whole hands, depending upon the reason for the treatment, should be immersed in the warmed oil. They should be left to soak for 10-15 minutes and then the oil on the hands may be used to perform the massage. This treatment may be performed as often as required. The client may also be advised to follow the same routine at home until the condition has improved. Benefits of this treatment: Moisturizes dry cuticles Return lost moisture to flaking nails Soothe and moisturize a dry skin condition60French M anicure The French manicure is an elegant and traditional manicure. The steps involved are same as the regular one, except that the nail technician polishes the nail with a clear white outline at the tip and then finishes by applying a layer of pale pink polish all over the nails. Then the technician applies a white transparent polish to give a final touch. This procedure improves the appearance of the nails naturally. Reverse French Manicure The reverse French manicure is exactly the opposite of the French manicure where in the nail beds are painted white instead of the nail tips. The body of the nails via the tips is then painted in a transparent colour probably a neutral shade. This procedure is quite popular in Europe. Paraffin Wax Treatment This manicure treatment is performed in usual manner and a rich nourishing cream applied after the cuticle work has been completed. The hand and arm should then be completely covered in the wax, heated to 48 degree, either by immersing it in the wax or by painting the wax directly on to the hand and arm building up layers until the coating is quite thick. The whole area treated must then be wrapped in foil before being covered by towels. This maintains the heat for short period allowing the treatment to take effect.

The salt should be moistened with a small amount of water, the massage cream to be used, or a moisturizing lotion and then rubbed well into the hands, until there is a noticeable improvement in skin colour.

Benefits of salt rub treatment: It helps to improve skin colour. Help to desquamate the dead skin cells Improves circulation. Even out a fading suntan. Thermal Mitten TreatmentIt is a special manicure treatment that combines the application of heat and moisturizer.

Sufficient quantity of oil must be applied for easy movements without any resistance. Step 2: The following joint movements are usually performed at the start of the massage to relax the client.Step 3: Place the client's hand on a clean towel placed on top of a cushion. Hold her hand softly with one hand and with your other hand hold her wrist. Bend it back and forth slowly and gently but with a firm touch, five to ten times, until you feel that the client has relaxed. Step 4: Slightly lower the client's arm and hold her fingers at the base of the nail. Now slowly rotate each finger 3 to 5 times and provide a massage. Step 5: Place the client's elbow on the cushion or towel near the centre of the table and your elbows on the table at the sides of the client's elbow. Place your finger heading thumb towards the client palm, rotate gently in a circular movement in opp osite directions. 4 363 Beauty and WellnessThis movement should start from bottom side then slowly moves to centre and at last move outwards, up, and across the underside of the fingers, then back down to the bottom, centre, in a smooth pattern of altering movements of each thumb over the palm. This type of treatment makes the client feels relaxed. You can feel the client's hands relax as you perform these movements. Step 6: a) Hold the client's hand gently at the wrist with your non dominant hand and place the palm of your other hand on the back of the client's hand just behind the fingers. Press lightly and move towards the wrist, lift slightly, and move back to the original position and perform the movement. b) Perform the transition movement and then move to the fingers. Now, holding the hand with your non dominant hand, move to the finger tip. Hold each finger with your palm down and the thumb on one side of the finger, the inside of the knuckle of the index finger holding the other side. Gently move the finger back, sliding slowly towards the hand, then turn your hand over completely, moving the thumb to the other side of the finger, your palm up. Then return to the tip, gently pulling the finger. Turn the hand over, back to the original position, and push towards the back of the finger again. Repeat three to five times, then at the fingertip, move the thumb to under the fingertip, the arch of the index finger over the top of the nail plate, and gently squeeze and pull off the finger. Now, move to the next finger. Perform this movement on all fingers the same number of times, moving from small fingers to thumbs. This concludes the hand massage usually performed in the basic manicure, though the last movement of the arm massage is also performed at the end of this massage. Step 7: a) Now holding the wrist firmly but gently, glide your hand up the arm from wrist to elbow with your palm and fingers on the skin; Start your movement at fingers around the arm, applying slight pressure on the skin with the help of your fingers, thumb, and palm to induce relaxation, then move back to the wrist area with a lighter pressure on the skin. Several times repeat this movement. b) Now move to the underarm and perform the same movement. When performing the movement on the underarm, press forward, then at the end release the pressure, gently rotate the hand to the top of the arm, and pull it lightly back toward the hand. 5 6a 64c) Apply lotion on the palm of one of your hands, and then apply to the elbow while holding the arm bent and up gently with the other (cupping the elbow). Slowly slide the palm to apply moisturization to the hand above and around the elbow. Continue till 10 to 20 seconds slowly and lightly. d) Last, holding the hand with your non dominant hand, move to the finger tip, and with your thumb on top and pointer finger below, gently grab and pull the finger down to the tips. e) After the finger pulls are performed, lay both of the client's hands palms down on the table, cover them with your own hands, palms down on them, and gently press them. Perform two to three times. The client learns quickly this final movement, called \"feathering off,\" is the end of the massage.

It reflects a feeling of personal attention being given to the client with respect to the service being provided. One of the most important parts of the treatment is the consultation. At this point, you will discuss the client's needs and decide what treatment to carry out to meet those needs. In order for the client to be satisfied with the treatment you need to know what was expected. As a therapist, you must therefore be good at encouraging clients to give you this information. You must therefore have the following: To establish an effective Client Consultation, a therapist needs to possess: 1. Good Communication Skills- This might include communicating to the clients verbally or non-verbally. Verbal communication requires selection of appropriate and amicable words and tone of voice while interacting to the client.

Cuticle softener A cuticle is basically used for the covering of the outer part of the skin that eventually provides the protection to underlying skin. Main job of Cuticle is to soften and beautify cuticles. This cream will maintain the soft and pliable cuticles and prevent them from cracking or sticking to the nail. 4.

Greet the client cordially. Step 2 : Soak away. Place foot in a bowl of warm (not too hot) water and add a bit of your gentle face cleanser to the water as well any antiseptic/antibacterial liquid. Remove from water and pat it dry. Step 3 : Lift one of the client's feet from the bath. Wrap the first towel around the foot and dry it thoroughly. Make sure you dry between the toes. Place the foot on the footrest or on a towel you have placed on your lap. Step 4: First, remove polish from the little toe and move across the foot toward the big toe. Complete polish removal is important to a quality pedicure finish.805 6 8 9 Step 5: Carefully clip the toenails of the first foot straight across and even with the end of the toes. Step 6: Foot file must be used carefully and only file the nail in one direction. It can be further be used to remove, smoothen and round off any sharp points on the free edges that might leads to further infections. Do not probe with the rasp or point the tip toward the hyponychium. Gently draw it along the side free edge that you have just trimmed. Small, short strokes with the file will accomplish the task. Step 7: Carefully file the nails of the first foot with an appropriate single-use and prepped abrasive file. Step 8: Apply callus remover to the calluses, wrap the foot in a towel, and lay it aside. Remove the other foot from the water and perform steps 2 through 7 on that foot. Step 9: Remove the first foot from the towel wrap; use a wooden pusher to gently remove any lose, dead tissue.

Massage a rich cream or silky oil into the cuticles and all over the foot and leg to hydrate and replenish skin. Step 15: Prepare for polish. Moisturizing ingredients of any kind left on the nail will prevent polish from adhering properly. Using a cotton swab or pad, apply nail-polish remover over the nail's surface to remove any residue. Step 16: Buffing. Buff the nails. Step 17: Paint nails in layers. If you have weak or brittle nails, use a base coat of ridge-filling nail polish to shore up the nail. A base coat also protects nails from staining and prevents chipping. Next, apply your colour polish in layers, allowing each layer to dry between coats. Also Re-apply moisturizer and during the day reapply sunscreen! Safety Rules As a beautician, you should take precautions to prevent accidents and injury to the client and to yourself.

Be gentle but firm when handling the foot. Too light a touch or hold will produce a tickling sensation, which is not relaxing for most clients. Here are some techniques and illustrations for the massage of the left foot; make the necessary adjustments for massaging the right foot. 1. Relaxer movement to the joints of the foot. Rest the client's foot on the foot rest. Grasp the leg just above the ankle with your left hand. This will brace the client's leg and foot. Use your right hand to hold the foot just beneath the toes and rotate the foot in a circular motion. 2. Effleurage (light or hard stroking movements) on top of the foot. Place both thumbs on top of the foot at the instep. Move your thumbs, using circular movements in opposite directions, down the centre of the top of the foot. Continue this movement to the toes. Keeping one hand in contact with the foot or leg firmly slide one hand at a time back to the instep and rotate back down to the toes. This is a relaxing movement. Repeat three to five times. 3. Effleurage on the heel (bottom of foot). Use the same thumb movement that you used on top of the foot. Start at the base of the toes and move from the ball of the foot to the heel, rotating your thumbs in opposite directions. Slide your hand back to the top of the foot. This is a relaxing movement. Repeat three to five times. 4. Effleurage movement on toes. Starting with the little toe, place your thumb on the tip and your index finger on the bottom of the foot. Hold each toe and rotate with your thumb. Start at the base of the toe and work toward the end of the toes. This is relaxing and soothing. 5. Joint movement for toes. Start with the little toe and make a figure eight with each toe. Repeat three to five times.6. Thumb compression (friction movement). Make a fist with your fingers, keeping your thumb out. Apply firm pressure with your thumb and move your fist up the hell toward the ball of the foot. Work from left side of the foot and back down the right side toward the heel. As you massage over the bottom of the foot, check for any nodules or bumps. If you find one, be very gentle because the area may be tender . 83 Beauty and Wellness7. Fist twist compression. Place your left hand on the top of the foot and make a fist with your right hand. Your left hand will apply pressure while your right hand twists around the bottom of the foot.

Use your fingertips to perform tapotement movements, lightly tapping over the entire foot to reduce blood circulation as you complete the massage. Leg MassageThe foot massage may be extended up to the knee. Do not massage over the shinebone or above the knee. Limit the pressure to the muscular tissue on either side of the shinbone. On the calf area of the leg, you may use kneading movements up to the backside of the knee. Paraffin PedicureParaffin pedicure is performed in the usual manner and a rich nourishing cream is applied after the cuticle work has been completed. The feet are then completely covered in the wax or by painting the wax directly on to the hand and arm building up several layers until the coating is quite thick. The whole area treated must then be wrapped in foil before being covered by towels. This maintains the heat for a short period allowing the treatment to take effect. The treatment benefits the skin in the following ways: The absorption of the nourishing cream which has been applied. An improvement in skin colour due to the increase in circulation. A softening of the skin texture from the application of the cream and paraffin wax and the increase in sebaceous gland cavity. A soothing effect on the joints due to the increased warmth in the area.

Galvanic treatment makes use of a constant current to offer various facial treatments: This can be used in two ways: 1. De-incrustation: Deep cleanses the oil by removing oil and blockages. 2. Iontophoresis: Introduces/active/water/soluble substance into the skin for special effects.The Galvanic Machine: The Galvanic machine could be an independent device or one attached with a unit. The common parts of a Galvanic Machine constitutes of: 1. Pilot Light 2. Intensity Control Galvanic Machine903. Polarity Charger 4. Milliamp Meter 5. A socket for the Electrode De-Incrustation using Galvanic Treatment Galvanic spa facials are found to be truly helpful in providing blackheads and acne treatment. As this facial makes use of steady Galvanic current to flow down the tissues and provide ultra- fine cleaning impact. Galvanic machine thus provides deeper penetration of skin products into the skin. It proves truly beneficial in unclogging the skin cells and reducing congestion. Galvanic Facial Treatment Procedure:1. Wash the face with a deep cleansing and foaming gel. 2. Apply cleanser over the face and neckline and clean the face thoroughly. Once done wash off the cleanser with cold water or gently wipe it off using a soft cotton wool.3. Use toner to restore the pH balance and hydrate the cells. Toning further cleanses any residual impurities or oil left by the cleanser.4. Exfoliate the dead depositions on face with the help of an exfoliator. To do this, first apply the exfoliator with the help of an applicator over the face and neckline. Wait until it dries and then gently scrub the exfoliator over the skin. Once done wash off your face with cold water and dry or pat dry with a cotton towel. 5. Before using the galvanic machine, apply galvanic gel over the face and neck and the surrounding areas that you want to cover. Move your fingers in upward stroke while applying the gel and push the gel deeper into the skin. It is advised to compulsorily apply the galvanic gel before using the machine as gel makes the effect of galvanic treatment more sound and beneficial. Galvanic gel constitutes of moisturizer, anti-oxidants and peptides and is made up of Sea Kelp, Vanilla Extract and Marigold. Galvanic gel makes the skin dry after application and thus stimulates better absorption of the applied skin products. 6. Galvanic Machine/Treatment/Galvanic/machine consists of two polarities called as positive or anode and negative or cathode. While giving the treatment only one of the electrodes is introduce while other is kept on hold. Initiate the Galvanic application by moving the negative electrode over the gelled portion. The gel molecules contain negative charged particles as does the negative electrode. Due to similar charges the electrode further pushes the negative charged gel particles deep down the pores. The gel binds with the skin impurities and congestion and remains negatively charged in the skin pores. This step of galvanic treatment is called as de-incrustation. Now the second treatment gel that contains positively charged particles are applied over the treatment area. This gel primarily consists of Vitamin E, Arginine, Magnesium and Aspartate which improves the skin health and pH balance. Now introduce the positive electrode over the gel treated area. This further pushes the positively charged gel particles into the skin pores where the negatively charged particles are already present combined with impurities. Thereafter the negatively charged impurities get pulled by the positive electrode along with the impurities. Thus leaving the skin pores completely unclogged. This second phase of galvanic treatment is called as Ionotophoresis. 7. Once the process is over wipe off the excess gel with the help of a cotton wool. Apply toner once more to clean the skin surface. 8. Put the mask according to skin type and wash it off with cold water after drying.91 Beauty and WellnessPeeling Treatment Skin peels are excellent for many difficult skin indications.

Reduce Skin bumps. Skin peel treatment could be taken up by people of all age group i.e. for those who face acne related issues in their early 20s or late teens. Even clients can benefit remarkably by eradicating fine lines or blemishes that occur due to growing age. Procedure for Skin Peel Treatment Careful Tips: Skin peel could be chose depending upon the skin condition and types. Clients could be given a single peel exposure for few hours or they might undergo a more stringent treatment that might last for 3-4 days or eventually for one week in case of severe skin troubles. Step 1: Cleansing: Before beginning with the peeling treatment it is necessary to deep cleanse the skin using a good quality cleanser. This is done in order to: 1. Remove the excess make up. 2. Clear the oil deposition over skin surface. 3. Subtract any dust or dirt deposited over the face. Through deep cleansing we ensure that the peels once applied gives the best result by penetrating deep down the cells. Toning: Toning is always a second step after cleansing. However, often people neglect toning their face and leave their face half cleansed by merely doing up with a cleanser . Toning further removes any oil that is left by the cleanser and hydrates the skin. It restores the pH balance of the skin and soothes it. It's vital to apply toner before exposing skin to some chemical treatment. This step prepares the skin for next level of peel application process. Peeling: Apply the content in the peeling jar with the help of an applicator over the skin. Use the cream sparingly around the mouth and jawline to avoid any intake of the chemical. Leave the peel work over the skin for at least 5-10 minutes. Note: The client might feel slight tingling sensation over their skin due to the chemical reaction of peel with the skin cells. However, if at all this session becomes uncomfortable immediately take off the peel by spraying cold water and re moving it with a soft tissue.92To remove the peel spray ice cold water and clear the peel from skin by using a wet tissue. Also it is imperative to follow the manufacturer's instruction while removing peel from the skin surface. Toning: Post peeling skin is again toned with a good quality toner to restore the pH level and hydrate the cells.Massage: Massage the face with a normalizer cream and then remove the excess cream by gently wiping with soft cotton.Mask: Apply a nourishing mask over the face. Let it dry completely and then wipe off with a soft cotton towel soaked in cold water.After Care: Post chemical peel client's skin must be applied with serum or SPF lotion to do away with skin damage that might occur due to exposure of Sun rays after treatment. In many cases of rigorous peeling or deep peel procedure the skin is covered with thick level or protective jelly or Vaseline to protect the crust that forms over the skin.

We all perceive colours differently and hence an understanding of basic colour theory is required to provide a colour effect to the eyes as desired by the client. The entire colour palette could be divided into primary, secondary and tertiary colours: 1. Primary Colours are fundamental colours that cannot be derived by mixing two colours. Our colour spectrum has three primary colours viz. Yellow, Red and Blue. 2. Secondary Colours are obtained by mixing two primary colours in equal proportions. For example:Yellow + Red makes OrangeYellow + Blue makes Green 3. Tertiary Colours are obtained by mixing one primary colour in equal amount with its neighbouring secondary colour on the colour wheel. For example: Blue (Primary Colour) + Violet (Neighbouring Secondary Colour to Blue) makes Blue- Violet Warm and Cool ColoursTo succeed as a makeup artist it is necessary to distinct between the warm and cool colours. Warm colours are the range of colours between yellow to orange that gets around oranges, red-orange and even yellow greens. On the contrary cool colours are dominated by blues, greens, violet. Green forms the distinction line between the warm and cool sets of colours. If a green contains higher proportion of blue its forms a cool colour and if it includes more gold it is warm. Selecting Make-up Colours While determining the skin colour you must be first able to decide if the skin is light, medium or dark in complexion. Thereafter one can decide if the skin has warm or cool colours.Session-2 Advanced Eye Make-Up Relevant Knowledge Colour Wheel Warm and Cool Make-up Colours 95 Beauty and WellnessA neutral skin contains equal elements of warm and cool colours, no matter it is dark or fair in complexion.

The most common area for threading is on the face. Threading is used mostly to shape eyebrows and is considered one of the methods that involve less damage to the skin. It is a method of hair removal worth considering for individuals who have skin treatments or use products that prohibit waxing. Threading is a technique that is difficult to self-teach, and hands-on training is recommended. Contraindications Conjunctivitis Powder Cotton Astringent Scissors Tools you need for Threading Eyebrows Thin Thread (about 24 inches long) of strong and good quality Thick thread is not good for removing thread effectively.

Preparing the client for threading Determining eyebrow widthDetermine the Eyebrow Width An orange stick is used for determining eyebrow width. Place the orange stick against the widest part of the nose and inner corner of the eye. Move the stick to form a diagonal line from the nose across the outer corner of eye. High ForeheadVarious Eyebrow Shapes Since all human beings are unique their eyebrow shapes also vary along with their face shapes. It is necessary to determine the shape of eyebrows before shaping it. Before shaping the eyebrows suitable shape has to be given to the clients based on their facial features.102Few eyebrow shapes are given below: High Forehead Here the width of the forehead is just about the same as below the cheekbones. Long faces usually have a very narrow chin or a very high forehead. A flat brow will be well suitable for such faces. Here the arch should be slightly elevated. Low ForeheadFirst the length of the brows has to be measured and later on based on the length of an individual the arch should be shaped such that it deviated at lower level. Low Forehead Wide ForeheadWide Set Eyes People with wide set eyes are the most normal looking with unique features of brows. Perfect shaping can make the wide set eyes to look closer, the slightly angled shape can be given while shaping. This shape will make the eyes to appear inward and smaller. Close Set Eyes For shaping the individuals having closed set of eyes first draw an imaginary straight line from the outer side of the eye ball in parallel to the nose. To make the eyes to appear wider pluck more from the inner corner and slightly decrease towards the outer corner. Close Set Eyes Round F ace A round face will be wide and long with round edges. The nose is the center guide and the widest point is at the cheeks and ears. To shape the client with round face, we have to shape high arched eyebrows with the peak toward the end of the brow and a short tail. Round Face103 Beauty and WellnessOblong F ace People with oblong face have stretched type of eye brows with lengthy hair growth. So the horizontal shaping would well fit their face. Shaping has to be almost done in parallel to their forehead. To make their brows look more beautiful. Square F ace For the clients with square face we should consider the jaw line and hairline. To balance jaw line we have to angle the brows with high peak close to being directly above the square of the jaw. Eyebrow Shaping Eyes are said to be the main part of our face to have an attractive eyes eyebrow shapes will enhance the grace of the eyes.

The following points has to be considered before shaping Face shape of the client. Spacing values of the eyes. State of the existing eyebrow. Ask clients about which shape they want. Age of client. Threading Procedure Step 1: First cut a thread into 11inches long and make a loop with the thread by tying it. Ensure that the thread is strong, clean and knot free. Step 2: Insert the thumb and pointer of both hands inside the loop. Twist the fingers on one hand forming an 'X'. A few more times twist your fingers in the same direction (say, 4 twists) Oblong Face Square Face Step 1 Step 2 104Step 3: Now keeping fingers of one hand steady open and close the fingers of the other hand so that the twisted part slides back and forth. This movement is for the thread to grip the hair and to pull it out. Step 4: Apply little powder to the eyebrow area this will help in easy and harmless threading. Also by applying powder the extra grown hairs are highlighted so that can be trimmed easily without much difficulty . Step 5: Now in one hand take the knotted side of the string and the other side in the other hand. Now keep the twisted section on the hairy area and move your fingers of one hand up and down to create the sliding motion of the twist. This will remove the excess hair. Step 6: Make sure your fingers do not touch the face of the client while you are threading. Lace the winded section of the thread on the area where the hair needs to be removes. Then perform the open-close movement on one hand. This will trap and remove the hair along with the root. Step 7: Repeat step 7 unless all the unwanted hair is removed ensure that line of eyebrow is maintained correctly according to the shape. You can then brush the eyebrow to see if any trimming is required. Then trim the unnecessary hairs using a scissors. Make sure that the trimmers are of tiny size and maintain similarity between two sides. Step 8: A cold cream or Aloe-Vera or ice can be applied after threading. Also gently massage the surrounding area of the eyebrow for few seconds. This will reduce the stress and pain occurred while threading. Eyebrow and Eyelash Tinting Use natural dying tints to give the clients a perfect luscious appearance. If needed by the clients or if you feel that artificial tint is required then you can go with artificial tints.

Professional image reflects your attitude, personal appearance, and ability. It also signifies perceptions of your competence and character. Analyse your character traits and core competencies of the people that you want to connect with as there is always some gap between your desired professional image and perceived professional image. Hence, it is important to take pro-active approach to groom and manage your image. Personal appearance is an often disregarded part of communication and presentation skills. Good personal grooming can make a person look polished and well put together. Looking good usually improves a person's self-esteem and confidence. A person that is well- groomed is often better perceived by others than a person that does not take as much care with his or her appearance. First impressions are very important - they can be about your attitude as well as dress. Visual impact is at least as important as verbal impact, people will very quickly make assumptions based on your facial expressions, the clothes you wear, how well groomed you are and your body language. Also, one should dress according to their shape to maintain good personal appearance. Therefore, it is important to learn about various body shapes. Body language and the way one present themselves plays an important role in the development of one's professional image. Confident, clear, impressive, and comfortable body image imparts positive impression. It is very significant to exhibit positive body language and give an active and confident impression of ourselves when interacting to others. This unit focuses on the ways to exhibit positive professional image at workplace, various body shapes to help you choose the right attire, how to manage stress and time to meet the requirements and how to behave in a professionally ethical manner at workplace. Further, this unit provides knowledge on how to maintain good relationship with clients. Unit Objective After completing this unit, the student will be able to: Perform basic haircuts like: blunt, V-shape and U- shape cut Apply basic hair styling Demonstrate the procedure to apply basic hair colour Draft a client record card for a hair treatment 114Session-1 Basic Hair Cutting Relevant Knowledge Structur e of Hair The hair can be divided into two parts, the root and shaft. The root part of hair is in the skin (epidermis) of scalp. A pouch like structure called follicle surrounds the hair root. The base of hair root is in the shape of a bulb. Capillaries and nerve fibres indent this bulb. The cells in the centre of bulb divides, the newly divided hair cells push the previous cells up. The cells, which move upwards, die slowly forming hard hair shaft. Hair is composed primarily of proteins (88%). These proteins are of a hard fibrous type known as keratin. The hair shaft has three layers the cuticle, medulla and cortex. Each hair is made up of three layers. The outside layer, the Cuticle, is thin and flat. The middle layer, the Cortex, is the strong, main part of the air. The central layer, the Medulla, runs finely through the middle. a) Cuticle: This is the outermost layer. It consists of a single, overlapping layer of scale-like cells that overlap like the shingles on a roof. It acts as a protective shield to the hair shaft and is coated with sebum, a natural lubricant. Sebum is what gives hair its natural sheen. b) Cortex: the cortex is the main part of the hair, lying underneath the cuticle. The cortex determines the strength, elasticity and texture of the hair. It accounts for 90% of the hair's weight. If the cortex is damaged it will appear fragile and weak and will break easily. c) Medulla: The medulla is the innermost layer that is sometimes called the marrow of the hair shaft. d) Hair Root: The hair root is that portion of the hair found beneath the skin surface. This portion of the hair enclosed within the follicle. e) Hair Shaft: The hair shaft is that portion of the hair extending above the skin surface. f) Hair Follicle: The hair follicle is a tube- like depression or pocket in the skin or scalp encasing the hair root. Follicles vary in depth, depending upon the thickness and location of the skin. There is a follicle for every hair. The funnel shaped mouths of hair follicles are favourite breeding places for gems, sebum, and dirt. g) Hair Papilla: The hair papilla is a small, cone-shaped elevation at the bottom of the hair follicle that fits into the hair bulb. Within the hair papilla is a rich blood and nerve supply, which contributes to the growth and regeneration of the hair. As long as the papilla is healthy and well nourished, it produces hair cells that enable new hair to grow. Structure of Hair Layers of Hair115 Beauty and WellnessWhile hair contains water, lipids, traces of mineral elements and melanin, it is keratin which is its main constituent. Its organisation within the cortex is so reminiscent of a rope or a cable that it is almost worrying. Hair is incredibly strong. Each hair can withstand the strain of 100 grams, meaning that an average head of 120,000 hair could cope with 12 tons, if the scalp were strong enough! Performance which is due to the amazing way the keratin is organised in the cortex. Keratin is the essential component of hair. It is a protein formed by the combination of 18 amino acids, among which cysteine deserves special mention, being rich in sulphur and playing an important role in the cohesion of the hair. It is produced by the keratinocytes. A single strand of hair does not grow continuously throughout its life. Hair follicles grow in repeated cycles. One cycle can be broken down into three phases. Anagen - Growth phase Catagen - Transitional phase Telogen - Resting phase Each hair passes through the phases independent of the neighbouring hair . 1. Anagen Phase - Growth Phase Approximately 85% of all hair is in the growing phase at any one time. The Anagen phase or growth phase can vary from two to six years. Hair grows approximately 10cm per year and any individual hair is unlikely to grow more than one meter long. 2. Catagen Phase - Transitional Phase At the end of the Anagen phase the hair enters into a Catagen phase which lasts about one or two weeks, during the Catagen phase, the hair follicle shrinks to about 1/6 of the normal length. The lower part is destroyed and the dermal papilla breaks away to rest below. 3. Telogen Phase - Resting Phase The resting phase follows the catagen phase and normally lasts about 5-6 weeks. During this time the hair does not grow but stays attached to the follicle while the dermal papilla stays in a resting phase below. Approximately 10-15 percent of all hair is in this phase at a one time. At the end of the Telogen phase the hair follicle re-enters the Anagen phase. The dermal papilla and the base of the follicle join together again and a new hair begins to form. If the old hair has not already been shed the new hair pushes the old one out and the growth cycle starts all over again. Chemical Composition of Hair pH Balance of Hair: Expressed on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7.0 being the neutral point, where something is neither acidic nor alkaline. Plain Water is neutral.Anagen Phase Catagen Phase Telogen Phase 1161. A substance with a pH less than 7.0 is acidic. 2. A substance with a pH greater than 7.0 is alkaline. 3. The smaller the number, the stronger the acid. 4. The larger the number, the stronger the alkali. Importance of pH in hairdressing 1. Acids close the cuticles of the hair, which makes it reflect light and appear shiny. A closed cuticle is also less likely to get damaged during brushing and combing. Eg. Conditioners. 2. Alkalis open the cuticles, allowing the chemicals to enter the cortex. Porous hair with open cuticles helps chemicals process more quickly. Eg. Shampoo. Hair pH Balance Anatomy of Head/Skull 1. Reference points: On the head mark where the surface of the head changes, such as the ears, jawline, occipital bone, or apex. These points are used to establish design lines.117 Beauty and Wellness2. Parietal ridge: This is the widest area of the head, starting at the temples and ending at the bottom of the crown. This area is easily found by placing a comb flat on the side of the head: the parietal ridge is found where the head starts to curve away from the comb. The parietal ridge is also referred to as the crest area. 3. Occipital bone: The bone that protrudes at the base of the skull is the occipital bone. To find the occipital bone, simply feel the back of the skull or place a comb flat against the nape and find where the comb leaves the head. 4. Apex: This is the highest point on the top of the head. This area is easily located by placing a comb flat on the top of the head. The comb will rest on that highest point. 5. Four corners: These may be located in one of two ways. One is by placing two combs flat against the side and back, and then locating the back corner at the point where the two combs meet. The second is by making two diagonal lines crossing the apex of the head, which then point directly to the front and back corners. Elements of Hair Analysis Hair Types 1. Normal Hair: It is neither greasy nor dry. It has not been permed, straightened or colour treated. It holds its style well. 2. Fine or Greasy Hair: It tends to be limp. It looks flat and packs volume. It is difficult to manage because it does not hold the style. It soon gets greasy again after shampooing. 3. Dry Hair: It looks dull. It feels rough. It tangles easily. It is difficult to comb or brush. 4. Combination Hair: Greasy at the roots. Shaft is dry. Sometimes split-ends. 118Hair Texture Texture - it is the natural movement of the hair or the diameter of single strand of the hair [fine, medium, thick]. The ideal place to check for texture is below the crown check by running your fingers through the lengths & ends of the hair. There are three main hair textures; 1. Fine: small in circumference. 2. Medium: greater circumference than fine hair. 3. Thick (Coarse): greatest circumference of all. Density of hair Density Of Hair 1. Sparse: 100 to 150 hair fibres per sq cm. 2. Average: 200 to 300 hair fibres per sq cm. 3. Dense: 400 to 500 hair fibres per sq cm. Elasticity of HairElasticity - the ability of the hair to stretch without breaking.Test: Take 1 strand hair & pull it. If it has good elasticity it will go back to its normal length, if it has poor elasticity it will either break or will not go back to its normal state. Three Different Hairt Extures Density of Hair Elasticity of Hair119 Beauty and WellnessPorosity of Hair Porosity - The hair's ability to absorb water or other liquids. Test: checking the cuticle layer by running your fingers through the hair shower, if it is rough, then the hair is porous if it is smooth then the hair is in good condition. Various Hair Cutting Lines 1. Cutting Lines Every haircut is made up of lines and angles. A line is a thin continuous mark used as a guide. An angle is the space between two lines or surfaces that intersect at a given point. The two basic lines used in haircutting are straight and curved. The head itself is made up of curved and straight lines. Cutting lines into the hair makes the hair fall into a shape. There are three types of straight lines in haircutting: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. Horizontal lines: These are parallel to the horizon or the floor. Horizontal lines direct the eye from one side to the other. Horizontal lines build weight. They are used to create one-length and low-elevation haircuts and to add weight. Vertical lines: These are usually described in terms of up and down and are perpendicular to the floor; they are the opposite of horizontal. Vertical lines remove weight to create graduated or layered haircuts and are used with higher elevations. Diagonal lines: These are between horizontal and vertical. They have a slanting or sloping direction. Diagonal lines are used to create fullness in a haircut and to blend long layers into short layers. 2. Partings & sections: This is a method of how the hair is separated or sectioned before the hair cut. Profile: Centre forehead to centre nape. Horseshoe: Recession to recession (passing through the lower crown). Horizontal: Parallel to the floor. Vertical: Perpendicular to the floor. Diagonal Forward: Angles forward towards the face. Diagonal Back: Angles backward away from the face. Radial: Top of the head to the top of the ear. Pivoting: Rotating from a centre point. 90 degree: Perpendicular to the head. 4. Elevation - The level of hair lifting from the head during cutting. Four terms to describe elevation are: 0\u00b0 in the comb: no elevation 1 finger depth: slight elevation Porosity of 90\u00b0: perpendicular to the head 5. Cut- The shape of the line cut Five terms to describe shape are: Square: a horizontal line Visual: a variable line Parallel: a line maintaining equal distance from the parting. Vertical: perpendicular to the floor. Round: following the head shape. Basic Hair Cuts Blunt Hair Cut To have blunt haircut is the desire of many people, blunt haircut is said to be all time favourable and simple haircut.

It also has the potential for being one of the most remunerative fields in which a stylist can choose to work. Hair colouring is both a science and an art. It can simply be defined as the practice of changing the colour of hair . For a skilled hair colourist, it is essential to become an expert in the given processes: Depositing colour on natural hair colour Depositing colour on previously coloured hair Depositing colour on hair that has been lightened Lightening and depositing colour in one step Hair colourist is an interesting, artistic and at the same time adventurous job. This area of work is also in great demand these days. If you understand fully about the theory and practical of hair colour, you will have the opportunity to build a significant and loyal client base and earn high income in this field. 135 Beauty and WellnessWhy do Peopl e Colour Their Hair? Many people colour the ir hair and it is significant to have an understanding of what people motivates people to colour their hair. Following are a few reasons for hair coloring: To cover up or blend gray hair To enhance an existing hair colour To create a fashion statement or a statement of self-expression To correct unwanted tones in hair from different environmental exposure like sun or chlorine A lot of people also experiment with hair colouring. When a client turns to you for advice and service, it is important that you have a thorough understanding of the hair structure and how hair colouring products affect it. A trained hair professional will know which shades of colour are flattering on the client and which products as well as techniques will achieve the desired look. Colour Theory Colour is a form of light energy. Before attempting to apply hair colouring products, it is important to have a clear and good general understanding of how colours work together . The Law of Colour The Law of Colour can be defined as a system for understanding colour relationships. When colours are combined, you will always get the same result from the same combination. Equal parts of red and blue when combined together always make violet. Similarly, equal parts of blue and yellow mixed always forms orange. This system is referred to as the Law of Colour because these relationships have been tested over and over and have proven to be true. Primary Colours Primary colours refer to those pure or fundamental colours that cannot be achieved from a mixture or combination. Blue, red and yellow are the primary colours. All colours are created from these primaries. Blue - Blue is the darkest of the primary colours and is the only cool primary colour. Apart from coolness, blue also brings depth or darkness to any colour to which it is added. Red - Red is the medium primary colour. Red mixed with blue based colours will cause them to appear lighter. Red mixed with yellow based colours will cause them to become darker. Yellow - The lightest of the primary colour is yellow. When yellow is combined with other colours, the resulting colour is lighter and at the same brighter in appearance. When all the primary colours are present in same proportions, the resulting colour is black. It is helpful to think of hair colours in terms of their relative proportions of the primary colours. Neutral colour, for instance, has the primary colours of the following proportions: Primary Colour WheelRed Ye l l ow Blue136 Blue - B Red - RR Yellow - YYY Secondary Colours A secondary colour is made or obtained by combining equal parts of two primary colours. Green, orange and violet are the secondary colours. Green - Green is an equal mixture of blue and yellow. Orange - Orange is obtained by equal mixture of red and yellow. Violet - Violet is an equal combination of blue and red. Tertiary Colours A tertiary colour is an intermediate colour obtained by combining a secondary colour and its neighbouring primary colour on the colour wheel in equal proportion. Tertiary colour includes: Blue-Green Blue-Violet Red-Violet Red-Orange Yellow-Orange Yellow-GreenNatural looking hair colour is obtained by combining primary and secondary colours. Complementary ColoursComplementary colours are a primary and secondary colour positioned opposite each other on the colour wheel. Complementary colours include: Blue and orange Red and green Yellow and violet Secondary Colour Wheel Tertiary Colour WheelRed Ye l l owOrrange BlueViolet Green Blue WhiteRedWhite White Red WhiteGreenWhiteGreen WhiteRed137 Beauty and WellnessComplementary colours neutralize each other. When formulating hair colour, you will find that it is often your goal to emphasize or distract from skin tones or eye colour. It is important to understand the complementary colours for choosing the appropriate tone for accomplishing your goal. The Level SystemLevel is the unit of measurement used for identifying the lightness or darkness of a colour. It is also sometimes referred to as value or depth. Hair colourists used the Level System for analysing the lightness or darkness of a hair colour. Hair colour levels are arranged on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the darkest and 10 being the lightest. The names of the natural hair colour levels may vary from one manufacturer to another. It is important to be able to identify the degrees of lightness to darkness at each level. It is important to be able to identify the degrees of lightness to darkness at each level. How to Identify Natural Level and Tone?The first step for performing hair service is to identify the natural levels. One of the most significant tools that will help you with your work is the colour wheel. For determining the natural level, you have to follow and perform the given steps:1) Take a inch V square section in the crown area and hold it up from the scalp, allowing the light to pass through. 2) Use natural level finder swatches provided by the manufacture, and choose a swatch that you think matches the section of the hair and place it against the scalp. 3) Move the swatch from the scalp area along the hair strand. 4) Determine the natural hair colour. Types of Hair Colour 1. Bleach Dyes Bleach dyes removes colour from hair by oxidizing the pigment cells present in hair shaft. It is likely that after application of Complementary ColoursRed & GreenViolet & Y ellowBlue & Orange Green & Orange & BlueY ellow & Violet138bleach your hai r might appear white in lack of any pigments. Hair is mostly subjected to bleaching before applying very light tints like: golden or blonde. 2. Semi-Permanent Dyes Semi-permanent hair colours impart more natural appearing hair tinge. These are not to be pre-mixed before applying and hence one can directly use these from the applicator. It does not bleach your hair and thus you don't lose the natural colour of your hair. On the contrary, these are temporary colours and fade after exposure to shampoo and atmosphere. Though it requires regular application which again could prove detrimental to your hair in longer run. 3. Permanent Dyes Permanent hair dyes last longer than semi-permanent hair dyes as these works by oxidizing your hair pigments. Also, these cause lesser damage to the hair for these are applied over a longer period of time. In this case an oxidizer like Hydrogen peroxide and Ammonia are mixed with the dye before application. 4. Ammonia Free Dyes In Ammonia free dyes monoethanolamine (MEA) is used instead of Ammonia to adjust the pH level of the hair. Also this chemical is added in lower concentration and is mixed with various emollients to make this hair colour less damaging for the hair. Before Care for Hair Colouring1. Use a pre-shampoo deep conditioning treatment three days in advance and three days after applying the hair colour. 2. Apply the hair nourishing serum before applying the colour Contraindications for Hair Colouring An allergic reaction to a skin test Hair damage Scalp damage Existing metallic based colours on the hair Things to be examined before Applying Hair Colour Skin Test: A test to assess the reaction of the skin to a chemical product. It is used particularly for colouringElasticity test: to determine how much the hair will stretch and then return to its original position. By taking the hair between the fingers and extending it, you can assess the amount of elasticity . Porosity test: to assess the ability of hair to absorb moisture and liquids. If the cuticles are broken or open the absorption will be quick. 139 Beauty and WellnessHair Texture: to assess if the hair is fine, medium or coarse Client's natural level: Colour ranges from level 1-10. Level 1 is the darkest and Level 10 is the lightest. It is important to know whether you are lifting or depositing the client's natural hair colour level before applying the hair colour. Desired Colour: While consulting the client it is necessary to understand what colour effect they desire at the end of the treatment. Level of Shift: Depending upon the base colour and the expected outcome one can formulate the desired level of shift required while applying the hair colour. Choosing Hair Colour The choice of colour depends on the following important factors - Client Requirement - Think of client's age, lifestyle, job, fashion and dress sense. Younger client may want bright colours. Old client may wish to cover the fact that their hair is going grey . Natural Hair Colour - See the base colour of client's hair. This will help to understand whether the desired colour will be achieved or not. What is Developer? There are two major chemicals involved in every hair colouring product. These are: 1. Hydrogen Peroxide Hydrogen peroxide is also known as 'developer' or 'oxidizing agent' of a hair colour. Varying concentration of Hydrogen peroxide in different colouring products affect the initiation of hair colouring process and longer stay of colour on your hair. The higher is the concentration of Hydrogen peroxide in a colouring product higher will be its developer strength and higher would be loss of Sulphur from hair. Loss of sulphur might further make the hair hard and lose weight. This is one reason that most of the manufacturers keep developer strength or hydrogen peroxide concentration less than 30% in a hair colouring product. Different Volumes and Developer Strength of the Hair Coloura. 10 Volume: This contains 3% peroxide and is used to deposit colour on hair or go a shade darker. b. 20 Volume: This contains 6% peroxide and is the most commonly used. This developer strength is ideal for covering grey hair. c. 30 Volume: This contains 9% peroxide and is used to lift up to 3 levels. 30 V is commonly used with lightener. d. 40 Volume: This contains 12% peroxide and is used to lift up to 4 levels. It also requires lightener or high-lift blondes. 2. Ammonia: This acts as a catalyst when Hydrogen peroxide comes in interaction with permanent hair colour. Ammonia has alkaline properties and works by breaking the cuticles for easy penetration of Hydrogen peroxide.140Procedure to Apply Colour: Preparation: Protecting covering for client and therapist Barrier creams to protect the skin around the hair line Gloves Bowl and brush applicator Tail comb and clips for sectioning Cotton, to soak excess tint Chosen product Mixing of colour: Don't mix the colour unless you are ready to start Once mixed, it need to be used immediately Mix the colour carefully, measuring amounts accurately If proportion are wrong, results may not be achieved Application: Place the bowl of colour near client, to minimize the risk of dripping on her or on the floor. Make section of hair, and apply with the brush. Work methodically, from nape upwards. Distribute colour evenly covering every section. Monitor processing time after application is completed. Time must be accurate. Remove stains from skin, if any. Keep eye colour away from eye. Monitor processing time after application is application is completed.

Before working with hair colour, it is essential to perform patch test on the client's skin. Given steps should be followed while performing a patch test: 1. Choose the test area. You can choose behind the ear or on the inside of the elbow. Use a mild soap and clean and dry an area about the size of a quarter. Mix a small amount of product according to the manufacturer's directions. 2. Apply to the test area with a sterile cotton swab. Leave undisturbed for 24 hours. Examine the test area. If there are no signs of redness or irritation, then you can proceed with the colour service. Lastly, log the results on the client's information card. A negative skin test will show no sign of sensitiveness, inflammation or irritation and indicates that the colour may be safely used or applied, while a positive skin test will show irritation, redness or inflammation and a slight rash or welt. A client with these symptoms is allergic to the substance and he/she should not receive a hair service with the substance tested. 2 3 4 Preliminary Strand Test After you have created a colour formula for your client, it is important that you try it out first on a small strand of hair. This preliminary strand test will let you know how the hair will react to the formula and how long the formula should be left on the hair. This test is generally performed after the client is prepared for the colouring service. Materials Required for Preliminary Strand Test: 1. Tint cape 2. Plastic clips 3. Glass or plastic mixing bowl 4. Spray water bottleTint Cape Mixing Bowl Plastic Clips 1425. Towels 6. Shampoo 7. Colour brushes 8. Protective gloves 9. Aluminium foil or plastic wrap 10. Tint 11.

During the consultation, the client will communicate what he or she is looking for in a hair service or hair care service. It is important for you to listen carefully to what the client is looking for and take all the essential information so that you can make or offer appropriate hair care service. To help ensure the maximum satisfaction of the client, it is important that you allow sufficient time for consultation. Choose an area with proper lighting to start the consultation.

Proper Lifting MethodsBasically there are three methods of lifting, namely: straight back-bent knees, free style, and kinetic. Each has its own advantages and limitations: Among the following methods, the kinetic method is accepted and widely followed so that it provides the stability to the workers by reduces stress to their back muscles. Below are some instructions on how to lift the material properly. Before lifting the object ensure there is no grease, sharp edges, rough or slippery substances that may tend the object to slip. The body feet position should be placed correctly as far as possible to equally balance the one foot to the rear of the object and the other foot slightly ahead of the other. Bend near to the load to minimize the stress on the back muscles. Always maintain the back posture straight as much as possible. Bend from the hips and not from the middle of the back. Lift the materials with suitable grip but does not use the fingertip grip and it is preferable to wear gloves when lifting the objects that have sharp or bent edges.Safe lifting procedures must be observed 153 Beauty and Wellness You can use kinetic en ergy to carry the object using your legs then take it back to a vertical position. While lifting avoid twisting by keeping the object close to the body . How to Set the Object Down: By using the same technique for lifting, but in reverse, set the object down. By bending the legs lower the object and when discharging just maintain the load to prevent injury to fingers, hands, or feet. Carrying Methods: The methods of carrying may differ based on the type or size of the material, distance to carry and number of workers. It is important for salon workers to know how to lift any heavy material, such as, a box of shampoo bottles. The following points need to be kept in mind while lifting and setting heavy material: Use proper protection for hands and feet like gloves, shoes, etc. Sometimes heavy boxes might be high enough to block your view while you carry it. So ensure that you are able to see your path while carrying such heavy objects. Maintain caution always especially if you have to carry the objects up stairs or down stairs Follow supervisor instructions. If the size of the object can be reduced, try to bring it to a minimum size and then carry it. If needed, use help of another person. Cleaning, sterilizing and general care of salon tools and equipment Sterilization means destruction of microorganisms namely bacteria, fungi, etc. Disinfectants: These are affected only when used correctly and tools also must be disinfected for the suitable period of time. Disinfectant solutions, e.g. barbicide. Boiling water (60\u00b0 minimum) - for towels and gowns. Wash the brushes and combs with hot water and immerse it in the solution for a minimum of 20 minutes. Sterilizing Wipes and Sprays This method is best for the metal based objects, e.g. scissors, clippers and razor handles. 1.

Income Tax rates What it means for the tax payer Rs 0 - Rs 50,000 No tax -- Rs 50,001-Rs 60,000 10 % Since no tax is levied up to Rs 50,000, tax in this case is calculated on Rs 10,000 (Rs 60,000 - Rs 50,000). Rs 10,000 x 10% = Rs 1,000 VAT (Value Added Tax) Value added tax (VAT) is a tax which is levied on most business transactions.
