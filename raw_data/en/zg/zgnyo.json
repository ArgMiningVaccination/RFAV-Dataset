Evidence shows that acupuncture treats chronic and acute back pain. In this case, I am treating an acute L2 disc herniation. You may notice that one of the needles is offset. This is because the injury has disturbed the natural energy flow causing the needle to sit at a greater angle than the others.\" - Juline "}
