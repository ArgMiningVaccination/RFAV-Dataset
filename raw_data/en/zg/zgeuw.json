The inflammation and catabolism associated with severe burns can exacerbate nutrient deficiencies, thereby predisposing patients to impaired immune function and increased risk of developing infectious complications, organ dysfunction, and death. Consequently, numerous trials have evaluated the impact of different nutrition/nutrient strategies in critically ill patients and in particular, severe burns patients. Glutamine is of particular interest in this regard as it appears vital for a number of key stress-response pathways in serious illness. Aim A large, multi-centre, double-blind, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial of 2,700 patients to determine the efficacy and safety of glutamine supplementation for reducing infectious morbidity and mortality in severe burns patients. Antibiotic levels in Burn Wound Infection (ABLE) Background Burn wounds have a high risk of developing infections. Oral or intravenous antibiotics are routinely given to manage such infection however, the appropriate use of antibiotic therapy as a means of treating infection has become a topic of international debate due to rise in antimicrobial resistance. Aim To establish whether we can find therapeutic levels of antibiotics in patients wounds, which are sufficient to treat the infection. Optimising evidence-based decision-making for patients with burns by the development of a core outcome set and the identification of outcome measurement tools (COSB) Background Early measures of recovery (outcomes) include length of hospital stay, infection, healing time and complications related to treatment. Longer-term outcomes, that may be more important to patients, include problems with movement (contractures), cosmetic issues (scarring), pain and psychological health. Currently, researchers use different outcomes to assess care quality and new treatments although so many different measures are used it is not possible to combine information to draw meaningful conclusions from different sources of data and hospitals. Using the same outcomes is vital to allow clinicians to be able to compare studies clearly to determine the best care for patients. Without patient and key stakeholder input, agreed outcomes may be less relevant. Aim To establish the most important outcomes for burned patients of all ages, families, professionals and NHS for use in research Core Outcome Set and determine how to measure these in a practical and reliable way. Detecting clinically relevant wound bacteria in burns wounds using MolecuLight i:X imaging device compared with standard wound swabbing techniques (MolecuLight i:X) Background The prevalence of antibiotic resistance has risen alarmingly over the last 40 years. Few truly novel antibiotics have been developed. This has led to increased pressure on existing antibiotics and greater challenges in treating patients. Inappropriate use of antibiotics increases the risk to patients of colonisation and infection with resistant organisms and subsequent transmission to other patients. Aim Statistically compare the ability of MolecuLight i:X to accurately detect bacterial infections on burn wounds compared to current standard of care and hence determine MolecuLight i:X's ability to improve the standard wound swabbing techniques in terms of swabbing locations.
