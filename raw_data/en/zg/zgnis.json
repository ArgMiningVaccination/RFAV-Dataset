Since the coconut fiber is springy and doesn't compress under pressure, it provides a firm, contouring support, while it allows for constant air circulation, which keeps you cool and dry. The mystical bed of nails originated over 1,000 years ago and was used by gurus in the practice of meditation and healing. Bed of Nails has created a modern, ergonomically designed version of that ancient technology to model those same deep healing effects. In less than 20 minutes each day, you may restore freedom to your body. Acupressure may alleviate a whole host of pain issues, including chronic neck and back pain, sore muscles and headaches, daily stress and even help you sleep. Find out [HOW TO BON here](https://bedofnails.org/pages/how-to). Designed to make pressure adjustment simple and easy, the Bed of Nails is similar to acupuncture; the pressure of the rounded nails against the skin may help the body release endorphins, the body's very own \"happiness drug\" which provides a sense of joy, energy and pain relief, and oxytocin, which makes you calm and relaxed (yes, it is possible to feel energetic and be relaxed at the same time!). Everybody reacts differently to acupressure, and the effects may even vary from time to time; you may feel sleepy, alert, relaxed, happy and a clearer mind. Acupressure may also help the body rid itself of toxins, so it is important to drink water after using the Bed of Nails. BON ECO Material Bed of Nails started the global acupressure mat movement back in 2009. We've worked hard to create the most comfortable and practical acupressure products on the market. How? We added more nails and made our products safe for you and for the environment. Certified REACH, RoHS. Over the years, we've researched and tested, and researched again, to find the most sustainable materials for Bed of Nails. Our BON ECO line features sustainable materials that are better for the environment and more luxurious for you. 8,820 precision Acupressure Nails (210 x \"42-nails\" acupressure plates) made of 100% Non-Toxic Recyclable HIPS plastic secured to the linen fabric with a melting process rather than environmentally-damaging glue. 100% Organic Linen Fabric - Did you know linen requires less water to grow than other fabric materials? It's also stronger when wet, recyclable, and biodegradable. Linen is also more hygienic to use as it breathes better, which keeps you cool and dry. 100% Coconut Fiber - Biodegradable, coconut fiber filling gives the mat a heavier, more substantial feel and even more long-lasting strength. Since the coconut fiber is springy and doesn't compress under pressure, it provides a firm, contouring support, while it allows for constant air circulation, which keeps you cool and dry.

Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) Love this acupressure mat... it is a little prickly at first, but once you get used to it, it is amazing. I fall asleep on it frequently. I look forward to using it more to see what the results are physically. I really love the mat. I can feel the blood flowing into my sore shoulder. I bought this for my husband for fathers day but find that our whole family is now benefiting. I have tried cheaper knock-offs and this is clearly better It feels so good I have to be sure and use it before my husband or I'll be waiting for awhile to get turn! Beautiful and very helpful product. I am happy with my purchase. Just a little pricey but overall it really works "}
