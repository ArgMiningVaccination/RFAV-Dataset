This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/946,934, filed on Dec. 11, 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT This invention was made with Government support under project number ZIA BC 011773 by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The Government has certain rights in the invention.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the preparation and use of a personalized tumor vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4, have vastly improved outcome of various types of advanced cancers, including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (see Nat Rev Cancer. 2018; 18(3):139-147. doi:10.1038/nrc.2017.117). However, it has become clear that only a subset of patients achieves a durable response to ICIs. One of the strongest predictors of objective response to ICIs is the tumor mutation burden (see N Engl J Med. 2017; 377(25):2500-2501. doi:10.1056/NEJMc1713444). However, many tumors including glioblastoma are less likely to respond to single agent ICI therapy presumably due to the lack of neoantigens necessary to activate an adaptive immune response. These tumors are often found to be \"immunologically cold\" with low T-cell infiltration. An \"immunologically hot\" tumor with high T-cell infiltration suggests the presence of an active antitumor immune response and predicts a favorable response to ICIs. Hence, conversion of a \"cold\" to \"hot\" immunogenic phenotype is an important step to make a successful immunotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel treatments or immunotherapeutic agents capable of converting an \"immunologically cold\" tumor to an \"immunologically hot\" tumor. On the other hand, often a promising immunotherapeutic agent shows potent antitumor responses only when applied or injected intratumorally (in situ). Due to its reliance on an anatomically accessible tumor, the in situ injection strategy severely limits potential applications for the immunotherapeutic agent, as primary tumors are commonly surgically debulked in clinical settings or may be located in poorly accessible anatomical locations. The cancer immunotherapy field is still in its infancy and more immunotherapeutic drugs and their clinic outcomes are being explored. On the other hand, various forms of solid tumors, especially those from the nervous system, call for a delivery strategy unbound by the in situ requirement.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Disclosed herein, in some embodiments, are personalized tumor vaccines.

The personalized tumor vaccine described here having immunotherapeutic potential delivered as part of a whole attenuated cancer cell vaccine generates a potent adaptive immune response capable of preventing or controlling tumor growth and inducing tumor regression in a subject-specific subset of primary or metastatic tumors. Personalized tumor vaccines are used to train the immune system to find and destroy, attack, kill, or inhibit subject-specific cancer cells. In some instances, a personalized tumor vaccine can direct the immune system of a subject to target subject-specific cancer cells. In some cases, a personalized tumor vaccine can direct the immune system of a subject to discriminate subject-specific cancer cells from other cancer cells not of the same subject. In some cases, a personalized tumor vaccine can direct the immune system of a subject to discriminate subject-specific cancer cells from cancer cells of other subjects. Such vaccine can make use of a phagocytosis stimulating agent or agents specific to the subject-specific cancer cells. A phagocytosis stimulating agent or agents can allow the immune system to discriminate the subject-specific cancer cells from the non-cancer cells, cancer cells from other tumors, or cancer cells from other subjects. When an immune system is presented with a phagocytosis stimulating agent or agents specific of a subject-specific cancer, the immune system will be activated to target the cancer cells sharing the same subject-specificity, even if a cancer is not present. Such activation of the immune system will create long lasting subject-specific immune memory. When the immune system encounters a cancer with the same or similar subject-specificity in the future, it will immediately activate a subject-specific immune response against the cancer cell. A personalized tumor vaccine can be a prophylactic or preventative vaccine. A personalized tumor vaccine can be a therapeutic or treatment vaccine.

Cell Lines CT26 colon carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC. Tumor cells were cultured in complete medium streptomycin (Gibco). All cell lines used were shown to be negative for mycoplasma contamination using PCR amplification. A CT26 Tumor-Bearing Mouse Model To establish a mouse model to study primary and metastatic distant tumors, tumor cells were injected into the right and left flank, respectively, to form the primary tumor and distant metastatic tumor. Mice were maintained, and experiments were conducted with the approval of the NCI Animal Use and Care Committees. Female BALB/c (6-8-week-old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratory. )}5 and 2.5\u00d710{circumflex over ( suspended in 100-200 L PBS were subcutaneously injected into 101 and 102 on right or left flanks respectively, as shown in Statistics Sample sizes of animal studies were determined empirically. Pre-established starting tumor size used as inclusion criteria for randomization was determined by pilot experiments. Investigators not blinded from the group allocation during outcome measurement performed randomization manually. Survival end points for all animal studies were defined according to the following criteria: (1) tumor volume exceeding 2000 mm3, (2) tumor diameter exceeding 2 cm, (3) severe non-healing skin necrosis over the tumor. GraphPad Prism software was used to analyze tumor growth and test the statistical differences in mean tumor volumes between treatment groups reached using the Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparisons test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For survival analyses, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated. P values were calculated using the log-rank test (Mantel-Cox).Example 2: In Situ MBTA Injection at Primary Tumors Suppresses Distant Tumor Growth Via a T-Cell Dependent Subject-Specific Immune Response Provided herein are methods for using MBTA to treat primary and distant tumor growth. MBTA Immunotherapy Strategy Dendritic cells (DCs) is used for the induction of an antitumor response by a personalized tumor vaccine. DCS are 100-fold more effective in inducing the proliferation of T-cells than B-cells do. DCs are the most potent class II molecules or endogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules. In some cases, DCs can also present exogenous antigens on MHC molecules, which is necessary for the generation of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes. DCs can also induce T helper (Th)1, Th2, or Th17 polarization response. DCs need to undergo a maturation process in order to primer na\u00efve T-cells. Immature DCs can be induced to undergo maturation by a combination of PAMPs, in the personalized tumor vaccine described herein, DCs can be matured by a combination of LTA, Poly(I:C), R-848, and anti-CD40 mAb. DCs represent a link between innate immunity and adaptive immune response: DCs, as innate immune response cells, can engulf or phagocytose pathogens, such as the attenuated cancer cell associated with mannan-BAM They then migrated to the lymph node for the activation of adaptive immune cells T-cells. There, DCs digest and express antigens from the phagocytosed attenuated cancer cells on their cell surface using MHC molecules on the surface of their cell membrane. The presentation of cancer antigens then activates T-cell differentiation and proliferation, activating an immunological memory, long after even if the pathogens are eliminated. When the immune system encounters a similar or same pathogen, a potent immune response by T-cells and B-cells are, triggered i.e., the adaptive immune response. DCs, therefore, represent a physical linkage between innate and adaptive immune response. Drug Synthesis The linkage of mannan to BAM (Mannan-BAM) facilitated anchoring BAM's hydrophobic oleyl group. BAM subsequently exploited mannan's recognition by pattern recognition receptors on innate immune cells via the recruitment of the MASP1 & MASP2 proteins to activate the complement components (such as C2, C3, and C4), leading to the opsonphagocytosis of the tumor cells by the innate immune cells. After killing the tumor cells, ligation of anti-CD40-mAb to the CD40 receptor activates antigen presenting cells to present the tumor antigens to na\u00efve T-cells in the lymph node. The na\u00efve then into helper CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ for long-lasting adaptive immune response. Mannan and Poly (I:C) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). LTA was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.) and InvivoGen (San Diego, Calif.). R-848 was obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis Minn.). In some instances, anti-mouse CD40 (clone: FGK4.5/GFK45) was obtained from BioXCell (West Lebanon, N.H.). Biocompatible anchor for cell membrane (BAM) was obtained from NOF America Corporation (White Plains, N.Y.). Mannan-BAM synthesis was performed as previously reported (Janotova et al. PLoS One 2014, 9, e85222. Aminated mannan was prepared by reductive amination, as previously reported (Torosantucci et al. J. Exp. Med. 2005, 202, 597). Mannan solution in an environment of ammonium acetate (300 mg mL1) was reduced by 0.2 m sodium cyanoborohydride at pH 7.5 and 50\u00b0 C. for five days. Solution was further dialyzed using MWCO 3500 dialysis tubing (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) against PBS at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. Binding of BAM on amino group of mannan was performed at pH 7.3 according to Kato et al. (Biotechnol. Prog. 2004, 20, 897). N-hydroxysuccinimide (NETS) group of BAM reacted with amino group of mannan within one hour at room temperature. Solutions obtained after dialysis was stored frozen at 20\u00b0 C. until use. In Situ MBTA Injections For in situ MBTA injections, 50 L of the therapeutic mixture consisting of 0.5 mg R-848 (HCl form), 0.5 mg poly(I:C), 0.5 mg LTA, and 0.4 mg anti-CD40 per mL of 0.2 mM mannan-BAM in PBS was injected intratumorally. MBTA Treatment of Primary and Distant Tumors The effectiveness of the MBTA treatment was examined using the mouse model of Example 1. As referred in As referred in The in situ MBTA injected mice had a significantly improved survival over the saline treated mice (median survival \u00b1SEM of in situ MBTA versus saline treated mice: 67\u00b111.7 versus 18\u00b11.2 days, p=0.0002 by Log-rank test), as shown in To determine if the observed antitumor effect is mediated by T-cells, antibodies were administered both prior to and during treatment to deplete CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells in the CT26 tumor-bearing mice. Mice in the CD8+ and CD4+ depletion group were injected with 250 g of CD8-depleting (clone 53-6.7; BioXcell) and CD4-depleting antibodies (clone GK1.5; BioXcell), respectively. Injections were given 2 day, 1 day, and on the day of therapy initiation (day 2, 1, 0), then weekly thereafter. The T-cell depletion was confirmed via flow cytometry 16 days after initiating treatment, as shown in The primary tumor volumes of both CD8+ depleted in situ MBTA treated mice and saline treated control mice were significantly larger than those of non-T-cell depleted in situ MBTA treated mice (median tumor volumes \u00b1SEM: CD8+ depleted versus non-T-Cell depleted in adjusted p=0.0111). Therefore, CD8+ T-cells significantly affect tumor growth control of the primary tumors. No significant difference in distant tumor volumes was detected between CD4+ or CD8+ depleted in situ MBTA treated mice and the saline treated control mice (median tumor volumes \u00b1SEM: CD4+ depleted in situ MBTA treated versus 607.4\u00b1121.1 versus 607.4\u00b1121.1 mm3. Bonferroni adjusted p >0.05), as shown in When compared to the median survival of in situ MBTA injected mice in Provided herein are methods for I.P. of tumors flow cytometry. CT26 tumors were established as in Example 1 to the right and left flanks. Two independent sets of I.P. experiments were completed after 10 and 16 days from the start of treatment. Each I.P. experiment consisted of control (n=5) and MBTA treated mice (n=5). After the mice were sacrificed, both right and left flank tumors were excised and subjected to mechanical disruption using a GentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) in the presence of enzymatic digestion Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Antibodies for flow cytometry staining are listed in TABLE 2. Gating strategy used for I.P. analyses of tumors was performed. Specific immune cell populations were defined as with a fixable live/dead stain (Invitrogen) in PBS followed by surface antibody staining in FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide). For intracellular staining, cells were first stimulated with Cell Stimulation Cocktail (eBioscience) containing PMA/Ionomycin and protein transport inhibitor for five hours prior to undergoing staining. Next, cells were stained for surface molecules following fixation and permeabilization (eBioscience), and then stained with cytokine antibodies. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (LSRII; BD Bioscience). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).Example 4: Enhanced Subject-Specific Innate Immunity Against CT26 Tumors after MBTA Treatment Provided herein are methods for using MBTA treatment to treat CT26 tumors with innate immunity. Immunophenotyping (I.P.) of tumors were performed according to Example 3 to further assess the immune profile of the tumor microenvironment of subcutaneous tumor model in Example 1. Both right and left flank tumors were harvested 10 days and 16 days after the start of the MBTA treatment. To elucidate temporal changes in immune cell populations, I.P. analyses were completed at two distinct time points, as shown in In situ injection of the MBTA into the primary tumors significantly increased the infiltration of immune cells (CD45+ cells) into both primary and metastatic distant tumors of the MBTA treated mice, compared to the saline treated control mice, as shown in Provided herein are methods for using MBTA treatment to treat CT26 tumors with adaptive immune response. Results from I.P. day 10 and 16, as described in Example 4, also revealed an overall increase in adaptive immune cells in both primary and distant tumors of the MBTA treated mice compared to the control, as shown in CD4+ (CD45.2+TCR+CD4+CD8) and CD8+ T-cell populations were extracted from the distant tumors and stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin in vitro to assess for intracellular expression of IFN, TNF and Granzyme B. T-cells harvested from the MBTA treated mice on I.P. (Day 10) and (Day 16) had higher production of IFN and TNF than the control, as shown in Taken together, the in situ injection of MBTA resulted in significant changes in the immunophenotypes of representative primary and metastatic tumors. At the primary tumor, the MBTA treatment generated an innate inflammatory response initially characterized by a strong neutrophilic and DC predominance and followed by a significant increase in APC populations (WIC II+monocytes and DCs). At the metastatic distant tumor, the MBTA treatment strengthened the adaptive immune response by increasing the overall supply of CD8+ T-cells and B cells infiltrating the tumor. T-cells extracted from the distant tumor were not only higher in quantity but demonstrated higher expressions of IFN and TNF cytokines, relative to the control, validating their enhanced tumoricidal activity. Collectively, our finding in situ MBTA treatment elicits tumor rejection of representative metastatic tumors.Example 6: rCT26-MBTA Vaccines Generate a Potent Subject-Specific Antitumor Immune Response in CT26-Bearing Mice Provided herein are methods for generating a potent antitumor immune response using the rCT26-MBTA vaccine. Generation of the rCT26-MBTA Vaccine As shown in For the rCT26-MBTA vaccines, 100 L of the following therapeutic mixture were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of rCT26-MBTA treated mice: a) 1\u00d710{circumflex over ( )}6 irradiated CT26 cells suspended in 50 L PBS and b) 50 L of the therapeutic mixture consisting of 0.5 mg R-848 (HCl form), 0.5 mg poly(I:C), 0.5 mg LTA, and 0.4 mg anti-CD40 per mL of 0.2 mM mannan-BAM in PBS. The vaccine dose (a) was then pulsed (incubated) with (b) (50 L, dose per mouse) for 1 h, facilitating the in vitro integration of mannan-BAM into tumor cell membranes, to form the therapeutic mixture. It was then subsequently injected subcutaneously to the right flank of treated animals according to the specified therapeutic schedule. Mice receiving the rCT26 vaccine were injected with 1\u00d710{circumflex over ( )}6 irradiated tumor cells suspended in 100 L PBS (dose per mouse). Generation of a Potent Immune Response Using the rCT26-MBTA Vaccine The rCT26-MBTA vaccinated mice can generate CD8+ T-cell responses against CT26-specific antigens. As shown in After 6 days of treatment, a Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a statistically significant difference in tumor volumes corresponding to the saline treated control, rCT26 and rCT26-MBTA treated mice (p=0.0108), as shown in A post hoc analysis revealed that the rCT26-MBTA vaccinated mice demonstrated significantly smaller median tumor volumes compared to the rCT26 or saline vaccinated mice after 6 and 15 days of treatment, respectively (Day 6: median tumor volumes \u00b1SEM of rCT26-MBTA mice\u201467.6\u00b1137.7 versus 971.2\u00b1320.3 mm3. Bonferroni adjusted p=0.0420). No significant difference in tumor volumes was observed between the rCT26 and saline treatment mice (Bonferroni adjusted p >0.05). Mice in the rCT26-MBTA vaccine treatment group also demonstrated a significant increase in survival when compared to the saline or rCT26 vaccinated mice (median survival \u00b1SEM of mice: 44\u00b19.2 44\u00b19.2 versus 20\u00b12.1 days, Tukey-Kramer adjusted p=0.0034), as shown in The MBTA treatment was overall well-tolerated: The in situ MBTA treated mice demonstrated a significant acute drop in mean body weight 3 days after the start of treatment when compared to the pre-treatment level, as shown in Provided herein are methods for inducing immunological memory against CT26 tumors using the MBTA treatment. The MBTA treatment can generate durable and robust immunological memory to prevent the relapse of parental tumors in both the periphery and intracranially. All mice that achieved complete remission (CR) (n=4) of CT26 tumors established in methods of Example 1 were challenged after a minimum of 50 days had passed from their last day of treatment. Mice that achieved CR of CT26 tumors (n=4) and na\u00efve female 4.5\u00d710{circumflex over ( )}5 CT26 cells suspended in 100 L PBS into left flank, opposite from the site of initial treatment. Immunological memory generated by the MBTA treatment also extends beyond peripheral circulation and engages CT26 tumors within the central nervous system (CNS). CT26-Luc cells with stable luciferase expression were used to facilitate monitoring of intracranial tumor growth. Both CR (n=4) and na\u00efve female BALB/c mice were inoculated with frontal lobe. 1.0\u00d710{circumflex over ( )}4 5 ug mL1 DNase I were stereotactically injected through an entry site at a point 1 mm rostral of the bregma, 2 mm right of midline, and 2 mm deep from the skull surface in the right frontal lobe, using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company), as previously reported, according to Toda et al. (Cancer Gene Ther. 2002, 9, 356). Surgical anesthesia was obtained via vaporized isoflurane. None of the previously treated mice demonstrated evidence of intracranial tumor formation, while all control mice developed intracranial tumors and reached corresponding end points, as shown in Provided herein are methods for calculating HED of the MBTA components based on body surface area. See details from: Nair A B, Jacob S. A simple practice guide for dose conversion between animals and human. J Basic Clin Pharma 2016; 7:27-31 A formula to calculate HED is shown as follows: HED(mg/kg)=Animal dose(mg/kg)Animal Km/Human Km Using this formula, the maximum recommended starting dose of Mannan, BAM, Poly I:C, LTA, R-848, and Anti-CD40 antibody is shown in TABLE 3.
