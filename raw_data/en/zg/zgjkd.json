Recreational marijuana remains illegal under federal law and under Iowa law. Use of recreational marijuana, regardless of the location of use, may result in disciplinary action against your Iowa nursing license or privilege to practice. Note that employers and potential employers frequently forward the results of positive drug screens to state licensing boards in states where you have a nursing license. When we receive such a report, a complaint may be opened, even if a positive drug screen was the result of your use of recreational marijuana in a state where recreational marijuana is legal. We encourage all nurses to think about the potential consequences of using recreational marijuana prior to engaging in such conduct.

Weinberg, MSN, RN Executive Director 400 SW 8TH STREET , SUITE B, DES MOINES , 10, 2019 Dear Nurse Licensee: For 39 years, the Iowa Board of Nursing (IBON) has used the Nursing Newsletter as the \"official\" means of communication with Iowa nurses. This issue is the final volume of the newsletter in the existing format. Although the Board still needs to communicate with licensees, the way we will carry out that communication is changing. Printing and publication costs have skyrocketed. Advertising (which pays for paper publications) is not purchased at the same volume as in the past to sustain the publications. Since technology has advanced, paper newsletters and full issues of digital newsletters are not widely being read. Market research shows that communication and readership styles have simply evolved to new shorter formats and through the use of social media channels, emails and texts. Going forward, the Board plans to stay in touch with licensees through brief email messages, sent to the licensee's on-file email address. Also, anything sent to nurse licensees via email will be available to licensees and the public on a new section of the Board's website with the heading \"News You Can Use.\" The communication of official information to nurse licensees is an important responsibility of the IBON. Please make it a priority to check your email often, and to read anything sent from the IBON. The website at https://nursing.iowa.gov is the main source of all IBON processes and procedures. More information will follow in the near future about this topic. Sincerely, Kathleen R. Weinberg, MSN, RN Executive Director During Session 1 of the 88th General Assembly in 2019, the Iowa Legislature passed House File 731 which changes Iowa's Mandatory Reporter Training guidelines. Governor Reynolds signed the law on May 8, 2019. The Department of Human Services (DHS) is now the state agency responsible for the course curriculum. Information from their website is included in this article. The Iowa Department of Public Health's responsibility to review and approve mandatory reporter training curricula has been removed. The new law requires the Department of Human Services to develop and provide the core training curriculum for all mandatory reporters in Iowa. The law allows for an employer to provide supplemental training as it relates to their professional practice, in addition to the core training curriculum provided by DHS. The law maintains that every mandatory reporter must complete 2 hours of training within six months of employment or self-employment, unless otherwise specified by federal regulations, and requires one hour of additional training every 3 years. 0 The child and dependent adult abuse trainings can no longer be combined into one 2-hour course. Both the child and dependent adult abuse core trainings will be 2 hours each. 0 All mandatory reporters are required to take the core (2-hour) training initially, but will be allowed to take a one hour recertification training every three years thereafter so long as they do so prior to the three-year expiration period. Clarifies that all valid mandatory reporter training certificates issued prior to July 1, 2019 remain effective for 5 years.What do you need to know as a licensed nurse? 1. Certificates of completion for mandatory reporter training taken before 7/1/2019, are still valid and may be used to document completion of the requirements. When your current certificate expires, you need to take the new course that applies to the population that you serve. 2. After 7/1/2019, when you need to renew your training, you must follow the new requirements listed above to obtain the DHS training. As of this publication, the Iowa Board of Nursing renewal application changes are in process. Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) 655, chapters 3 and 5 will also be amended to reflect the new law. In the meantime, follow the DHS requirements. If a licensee is audited and the required training was taken prior to 7/1/2019, you may submit a certificate from the prior curriculum that is still effective to fulfill the documentation requirements. After 7/1/2019, if you need to take a course, you must show proof that you meet the new requirements established by the DHS. Any additional questions should be directed to the DHS. See the follow link to go directly to the DHS web page: https://dhs.iowa.gov/child-welfare/mandatoryreporter Watch the IOWA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S website for updates about the national opioid epidemic. See their website at https://idph.iowa.gov/substance-abuse/opioid-update.REMINDER: MANDATORY REPORTER TRAINING - NEW REQUIREMENTS New Requirements Announced - June 21, 2019 page 2ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A 1919 NURSE? The original version of the popular quiz game TV show known by the name \"Are You smarter than a 5th Grader?\" yields a maximum $1,000,000 prize for its winners - of which there have only been three. Along the way in the game, contestants can ask for help from a school-age cast member, known as their \"classmate.\" Contestants who lose because they can't answer correctly, or end the game before it's through, have to say \"I am not smarter than a 5th grader.\" Recently, while going through files and archives, board staff found a variety of old Iowa State Board of Health Nurse's examinations that contain some very interesting questions: Questions strange enough that modern-day nurses would likely need the help of a \"classmate\" to answer. Although there were no prizes involved, a 1919 nurse would have been granted their nursing license by answering and passing a bank of test essay questions. This glimpse into the past yields the question: \"Are you smarter than a 1919 nurse?\" Unfortunately, we don't have the answers to these questions, but this is one test where you can work with a \"classmate\" to get help! Check out a few of the questions on the next page. page 31. Why are puncture wounds made with infected instruments more dangerous than open cuts? 2. Name the two diseases most to be feared from puncture wounds. 3. Name three methods of sterilizing a sheet. 4. Why is bathing so important to health? 5. State briefly how to prepare and apply the following: a. Mustard plaster. b. Turpentine stupes. c. Hot boric acid dressing. 6. How should a nurse be released from quarantine? 7. Name two qualifications especially necessary in a woman who nurses children? 8. Explain fully your understanding of the responsibility a nurse owes to her patient and to her country in regard to the war-time food problem? 9. Explain briefly how fumigation and disinfection may be performed? 10. Differentiate in a general way bet ween the microscopic appearance of streptococci and staphylococci. 11. Name three remedies used for headache, not including opiates, and give the adult dose. 12. What is the action of Ammon. Chloride, Strychnia, Digitalis, Morphia, Belladonna? 13. Name five distinctly different methods of serving milk to patients, not including \"Hot milk\" and \"Cold milk.\" page 4The information in this article is provided in good fun. It's fitting to reflect on our past to see how far nursing and healthcare have come. There are equally as difficult test questions in the current nursing licensure examinations, which are designed to test the abilities of an entry-level nurse. As a glimpse towards the future, watch for information about the Next Generation NCLEX\u00ae Exams, currently under research. See the NCSBN website for more details: https://www.ncsbn.org page 5 Gwen Suntken Interested in serving on the Iowa Board of Nursing? See the Boards and Commissions website at the following link for more information about the process: https://openup.iowa.gov/. To discuss the time commitment and expectations of serving on the Board of Nursing, schedule a call with the IBON's executive director, Kathy Weinberg, by emailing kathy.weinberg@iowa.gov.A Thank You to Gwen Suntken I would like to extend a sincere thank you to board member Gwen Suntken for her service to the Iowa Board of Nursing. Gwen has served on the board for 9 years representing nursing practice and has held the office of Board Chair for the past 6 years. As a board member Gwen has been involved in many Iowa Board of Nursing (IBON) initiatives; such as the development of the Iowa Nurse Assistance Program, the passing of the updated Nurse Licensure Compact, numerous revisions to the Iowa Administrative Code, moving forward with paperless licensure and transitioning to a digital newsletter. The members of the IBON are committed to carrying out the mission of the board to protect the public health, safety and welfare and Gwen has been a true leader in this work. Please join me in thanking Gwen for her endless hours of serving the public and Iowa's licensed nurses. ~ Kathy Weinberg, Executive DirectorREFLECTIONS FROM THE BOARD OF NURSING CHAIRPERSON This is like ly my last article for the Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter. I am now in my 9th year serving on the Iowa Board of Nursing, and my term will expire on April 30, 2020. My goal has always been to protect the public and see that we have the best nurses possible to provide care for all Iowans. Being a Board Member has a big learning curve; so many things that as nurses we just know are done for us, but have no idea the amount of time and work it takes to make changes to improve health care. I have seen many changes during my tenure on the Iowa Board of Nursing. In the beginning it was mainly learning the role and duties of a Board Member, and then has ended with my serving as Chairperson for the past six years. We deal with issues related to updating the Iowa Administrative Code for Nurses, conducting hearings when charges are brought against a nurse, plus changes that occur due to changes in society. Marijuana use become legal in some states, so the Board has carefully considered our approach on nurses using marijuana and the effect this has on their practice. I just want to assure you that the Board spends a great deal of time in open discussion, educating ourselves, and giving thoughtful consideration of all and any changes that we make. Our Board consists of seven board members that represent Nursing Practice, Nursing Education, LPN Nursing Practice, and two Public Members. This provides the Board with a broad array of experience, education, and input in all Board decisions. I would like to thank the people who encouraged me serve on the Board when appointed by the Governor. My hope is that I helped the practice of nursing to grow, change with the times, and yet maintaining our goal of \"always protecting the public.\" Thank you for the opportunity to serve the people and nurses of Iowa.page 688th Iowa General Assembly SESSION TIMETABLE * 2020 IOWA LEGISLATIVE JANUARY 13 First day of session (Iowa Code Sec. 2.1) ___________________________________________________________________________________ JANUARY 24 Final day for individual Senator and Representative requests for bill and joint (Friday of the 2 nd week) resolution drafts to the Legislative Services Agency (Senate Rule 27 and House Rule 29) ___________________________________________________________________________________ FEBRUARY 21 Final date for Senate bills and joint resolutions to be reported out of Senate (Friday of the 6 th week)** Committees and House bills and joint resolutions out of House committees (Joint Rule 20) ___________________________________________________________________________________ FEBRUARY 24 - 28 Senate considers only Senate bills, joint resolutions, and unfinished business (7th week) House considers only House bills, joint resolutions, and unfinished business (Joint Rule 20) ___________________________________________________________________________________ MARCH 2 - MARCH 13 Debate not limited by rule (8th and 9 th weeks) ___________________________________________________________________________________ MARCH 20 Final date for Senate bills and joint resolutions to be reported out of House (Friday of the 10 th week)** committees and House bills and joint resolutions out of Senate committees (Joint Rule 20) ___________________________________________________________________________________ MARCH 23 - 27 Senate considers only House bills, joint resolutions, and unfinished business (11 th week) House considers only Senate bills, joint resolutions, and unfinished business (Joint Rule 20) ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ MARCH 30 Only the following bills and resolutions are eligible for consideration: (Joint Rule 20) (Beginning of the 12 th week) Bills passed by both Houses Appropriations Bills Ways and Means Bills Government Oversight Bills Legalizing Acts Administrative Rules Review Committee Bills Committee Bills related to delayed or suspended Administrative Rules [Iowa Code Sec. 17A.8(9)] Bills co -sponsored by Majority and Minority Leaders of one House Conference Committee Reports Companion Bills sponsored by Senate and House Majority Leaders Concurrent or Simple Resolutions Joint Resolutions nullifying Administrative Rules Bills on the Veto Calendar (Joint Rule 23) Unfinished Business ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ APRIL 6 Amendments need not be filed on the day preceding floor debate (Beginning of the 13 th week) (House Rule 31.8) ___________________________________________________________________________________ APRIL 21 100 th calendar day of the session [Per diem expenses end - Iowa Code Sec. 2.10(1)] **The February 21 and March 20 committee deadlines do not apply to Appropriations Bills, Ways and Means Bills, Government Ove rsight Bills, Legalizing Acts, Administrative Rules Review Committee Bills, Committee Bills related to delayed or suspended Administrative Rules [Iowa Code Sec. 17A.8(9)], Bills co-sponsored by Majority and Minority Leaders of one House, Conference Committee Reports, Companion Bills sponsored by the Majority Leaders of both Houses after consultation with the respective Minority Leaders, Concurrent or Simple Resolutions, and Joint Resolutions nulli fying Administrative Rules.

Competencies required for nursing telehealth activities: A delphi-study. Nurse Education Today, 39, 50-62. Funding Source: National Council of State Boards of Nursingpage 8INTRODUCTION Telehealth modalities and the role and responsibilities of registered nurses (RNs) and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) using this technology continues to change and evolve in the United States. As indicated by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) (2014) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) (2015), the delivery of nursing services via telehealth constitutes the practice of nursing. Yet, little is known about the education and competencies needed to effectively provide care via telehealth modalities by RNs and APRNs. In addition, there is even less information on the implementation of a standardized curriculum on required telehealth competencies. OBJECTIVESThe objective of this study was to discuss the needed competencies for the implementation and provision of telehealth modalities by RNs and APRNs. METHODSThis study used a descriptive qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews to explore the needed competencies for the implementation and provision of telehealth modalities.RESULTS The findings revealed that RNs and APRNs require both a subset of foundational clinical knowledge and technology-specific competencies and skills to build and enhance telehealth delivery capacity. Sub-themes emerged which included focused assessment, analysis and interpretation of data, communication, privacy and confidentiality, use of technology and software application, sharing information via electronic approaches and troubleshooting issues. Educating RNs and ARNPs on the effective use of telehealth modalities may improve healthcare delivery, patient satisfaction, patient outcomes, and optimize healthcare services by reducing costs and improving access to services. CONCLUSIONSThis study described the needed competencies and requirements for the delivery and implementation of telehealth modalities. In addition, this study underscored the importance of integrating both foundational clinical knowledge and telehealth-related competencies in nursing education programs as there is a systematic absence of skills, knowledge, and behaviors to effectively and safely implement this technology. The findings may be of value to schools of nursing, healthcare facilities, and regulatory bodies as competencies may be used to develop curriculum and standards of practice. NEXT STEPSWork with Iowa Board approved schools of nursing to include telehealth competencies and content in their curriculum. Develop rules and regulations on the practice of telehealth in Iowa.

What? WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM ? All licensees seeking entry require INAP Committee approval Nurses with a physical or mental condition affecting their practice Nurses who use alcohol or drugs to the extent their practice is affected Nurses in recovery who voluntarily enter INAP and admit to violations WHO MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE ? The INAP Committee will determine ineligibility on a case by case basis Nurses who divert drugs for profit Nurses who adulterate/misbrand or tamper with drugs intended for patients Nurses who provide inaccurate or fraudulent information or fail to fully cooperate Nurses who participated in the program or similar program offered by other states without success Nurses who are not in recovery and deny violations IMPAIRMENT CAN COST YOUR JOB AND LICENSE . WHY INAP WAS ESTABLISHED A nurse's ability to safely practice may be affected if a nurse routinely use substances or has a mental health condition. The program is designed to encourage health professionals to seek a recovery program before their condition harms a patient or results in disciplinary action . WHY INAP WORKS INAP is a supportive program that promotes and monitors nurses in recovery. INAP addresses the treatment needs specific for the individual and actively monitors progress . INAP Services Include : Intake assessment, support and treatment referrals Ongoing nurse monitoring including random body fluid testing Reporting non -compliant participants to the Board to ensure public safety Why? WHAT IS THE IOWA NURSE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (INAP)? INAP is a self -report monitoring program for nurses who may be impaired as a result of substance use, a mental health condition or a physical condition. INAP is a voluntary, confidential program. It provides an opportunity for licensed professionals to receive proper treatment and maintain their professional status. Participants who are compliant to program requirements may not be reported to the Board. WHAT IS REQUIRED ? To be considered for INAP, licensees need to be in recovery, be compliant to treatment recommendations and sign a three year monitoring contract. The contract can include limitations on nursing practice or employment, drug screening, progress reports, self -help meetings, peer support groups and ongoing treatment. Licensees are required to follow all recommendations of the treatment team. Participants are responsible for all costs of treatment and the program. page 10See this news release from the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) regarding new guidelines. NCSBN and ANA issued new joint National Guidelines for Nursing Delegation ( https://www.ncsbn.org/NGND- PosPaper_06.pdf ) utilizing new research findings and evidence in the literature to update and standardize the nursing delegation process. The new guidelines are applicable to all levels of nursing licensure where the nurse practice act is silent. The National Guidelines for Nursing Delegation can be applied to: Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) when delegating to registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical/ vocational nurses (LPN/VNs) and assistive personnel (AP); RNs when delegating to LPN/VNs and AP; and LPN/VNs (as allowed by their state/jurisdiction) when delegating to AP. NCSBN and ANA note that the guidelines do not apply to the transfer of responsibility for care of a patient between licensed health care providers (e.g., RN to another RN or LPN/VN to another LPN/VN), which is considered a handoff. The new guidelines replace the previous ones issued in 2010. Retrieved from NCSBN \"Good Morning Members - June 6, 2019\" News ReleaseAPPROPRIATE DELEGATION CONTRIBUTES TO PATIENT SAFETY AND BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES IMPORTANT NOTE: THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD issues the following recommendation for licensed professionals with prescriptive authority: \"Remember to routinely discuss with patients the effect a person's diagnosed medical conditions or prescription medications may have on his or her ability to safely operate a vehicle in any mode of transportation.\" In respect to best practices, also remember to document patient teaching regarding the above recommendation.

Diploma programs were nursing programs associated with a hospital or medical facility. Diploma numbers continue to decline following the closing of the last Iowa diploma program in 1999, and the retirements of nurses who attended the diploma programs. The number of Associate Degree in Nursing/ Associate of Science in Nursing (ADN/ASN) graduates and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) graduates have continued to rise over the last 11 years. However, the total number of graduates from ADN/ASN programs continues to outpace the number who earn a BSN degree upon original licensure. Since 2008, the number of ADN/ASNs awarded has increased by 41.5 percent while the number of 4-year degrees earned has 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Diploma ADN/ASN BSN at a rate over 13% greater than ADN/ASN graduates (2008 - 2018) Total BSN graduates have increased IOWA CENTER FOR NURSING WORKFORCE page 18 13 FIGURE 9: Highest Degree Held by Active Licensed RNs (2008- 2018) The following chart identifies the highest degree held by active licensed RNs. All degree categories identified by RNs experienced an overall increase since 2008 with the exception of diplomas which is a reflection of the absence of diploma nursing programs in Iowa and the aging workforce. There was a 15.7 percent increase between 2017 and 2018 for RNs who reported a doctorate as their highest degree. During this same time period, there was a 21.2 percent increase in RNs who specifically reported a doctoral level in nursing as their highest degree. In addition, there was an increase of 5.5 percent during 2017 -2018 timeframe among RNs who reported a BSN as their highest degree level and a 4.6 percent increase in baccalaureate degrees, overall. Nurses with Master's degrees as their highest level of education more than doubled from 2008, with 3,065 reporting to 6,353 reporting in 2018. In 2018, over half (52.2%) of total RN licensees reported a highest degree kevel of a baccalaure - ate or higher. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 93 100 116 170 258 369 482 579 702 Other Doctorate 199 208 220 224 224 222 232 227 223 216 21805,00010,00015,00020,00025,000 *For 2018, of the 702 doctoral in nursing degrees reported: 537 are Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degrees, 32 are other doctoral nursing degrees, and 133 are PhDs in nursing.
