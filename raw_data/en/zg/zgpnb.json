Moreover, immunoadjuvants can support immune system acting on nonimmune targets, thus improving the immune response. The modulation of inflammatory pathways and microbiome can also contribute to control the immune function. Some plant-based nutraceuticals have been studied as possible immunomodulating agents due to their multiple and pleiotropic effects. Being usually more tolerable than pharmacological treatments, their adjuvant contribution is approached as a desirable nutraceutical strategy. In the present review, the up to date knowledge about the immunomodulating properties of polysaccharides, fatty acids and labdane diterpenes have been analyzed, in order to give scientific basic and clinical evidence to support their practical use. Since promising evidence in preclinical studies, limited and sometimes confusing results have been highlighted in clinical trials, likely due to low methodological quality and lacking standardization. More investigations of high quality and specificity are required to describe in depth the usefulness of these plant-derived nutraceuticals in the immune system modulation, for health promoting and disease preventing purposes.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-08-22", "cleaned_text": "by physical and biochemical barriers, alongside a non-specific cell-mediated immune response, including granulocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells and humoral elements, which cooperate to counteract pathogen infection and malignant transformation [ [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, an adaptive immunity is activated as a second defense line after a macrophage-mediated presentation of antigens to B lymphocytes, with the help of T lymphocytes; then, B cells can mediate the humoral immunity through the production of high-affinity antibodies and establish immunological memory [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, T lymphocytes can mediate cellular immunity after activation by cytokines released from helper T cells [ [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00468)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00468)]. Particularly, immunosuppressors inhibit the activation of immune response or decrease the activity of its components, thus restoring normalcy. They are of interest in organ transplantations and in autoimmune disorders, wherein the immune system mistakenly activates an immune response against the own body tissues, leading to their destruction [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00468)]. For instance, vitamin D has been shown to counteract the aberrant immune responses of systemic lupus erythematosus, without compromising the physiological defences and to in atopic dermatitis too [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00468), [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00468)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00468)]. They can be exploited as immunotherapeutic agents by individuals with immunocompromised conditions; however, they can represent suitable prophylactic strategies for healthy individuals or more susceptible subjects against viral infections [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00468)]. In support, during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the trained immunity by vaccines, which induce heterologous protection, have been proposed as a rational strategy to boost antiviral defences and reduce susceptibility to infection [ [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00468)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00468), [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00468), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00468), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00468)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00468)]. On the other hand, the chronicity of inflammatory response can negatively influence the immune function, affecting both innate immune cells and T and B lymphocytes, thus suggesting a possible usefulness of anti-inflammatory immunomodulators [ [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00468)]. Accordingly, immunomodulatory agents, with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, have attracted great attention as possible chemopreventive agents, due to their ability to counteract chronic inflammation, which provides favorable conditions for the transition from normal to cancer cell [ [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00468)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00468)]. [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00468)]. This intimate microbiome-immune system crosstalk suggests that boosting the resident microbiome, through pre/probiotic supplementations or suitable intervention for preventing disruption of microbial communities, can reinforce the immune defences, thus representing an alternative immunomodulatory strategy [ [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00468)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00468)]. As major immunomodulatory mechanisms, they act especially as boosters of immune system, through the stimulation of both innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immunity ( [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00468-t001)). However, further mechanisms, such as an interference with proinflammatory pathways and a modulation of the gut microbiome, have been reported [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00468), [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00468), [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00468)]. [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00468)]. More recently, its ability to indirectly boost the immune system, through the modulation of gut microbiome, has been highlighted [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00468)]. All the phytocomplex seems to be involved in these properties, however, alkylamides and purified polysaccharides have been found to induce immunomodulatory effects [ [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00468), [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00468)]. The immune boosting properties of echinacea, particularly as enhancers of macrophage and lymphocyte activation, have also been highlighted in clinical studies; however, further high-quality studies are required for better characterizing the possible usefulness of echinacea byproducts as immunomodulators [ [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00468)]. [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00468)]. [35](#B35-vaccines-08-00468), [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00468)]. Indeed, ginseng has been reported able to prevent several diseases through modulating the immune system and gut microbiome, thus suggesting its usefulness as an immunity boosting dietary supplement [ [36](#B36-vaccines-08-00468)]. Similarly, the immunomodulatory properties of W. somnifera and its constituent withaferin A have been reported [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00468)]. At last, preliminary studies have highlighted the immunomodulatory effects of other medicinal plants, such as Asparagus racemosus Willd., Azadirachta and immune modulating properties [ [48](#B48-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, terpenoids, polysaccharides and fatty acids ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00468-f002)) have received considerable attention as possible immunomodulatory agents for further application in immune disorders [ [48](#B48-vaccines-08-00468), [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. [50](#B50-vaccines-08-00468)]. Likewise, vincristine and staurosporine act as immunostimulants at low doses, while as immunosuppressors at higher doses [ [51](#B51-vaccines-08-00468)]. Among polyphenols, resveratrol stimulated both cellular and humoral immunity in preclinical models, thus preventing pathogen replication and inflammation, and promoted antitumor immune response too [ [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, cichoric acid from echinacea promoted phagocytic activity, both in vitro and in vivo [ [53](#B53-vaccines-08-00468)]. Anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects has been highlighted for curcumin too, although the poor bioavailability limits its clinical application [ [54](#B54-vaccines-08-00468)]. 2. Polysaccharides The (16)-D-mannan moiety (e.g., galctoglucomannans), acetyl and sulfate group presence, and this kind of branching seems to confer a high immunostimulatory activity [ [58](#B58-vaccines-08-00468), [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00468), [60](#B60-vaccines-08-00468)]. [61](#B61-vaccines-08-00468), [62](#B62-vaccines-08-00468)], to which the arabinosyl units might be attached. The degree of branching, methyl esterification, acetylation, and the type of branched chains and molecular weight determine the structural diversity [ [63](#B63-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, flexible chain conformation and branched regions are the main ones responsible for the immunomodulatory properties [ [64](#B64-vaccines-08-00468), [65](#B65-vaccines-08-00468)]. [66](#B66-vaccines-08-00468), [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00468)]. [68](#B68-vaccines-08-00468)]. The naturally higher content of sulfate groups and the presence of acetyl groups are associated with a higher stimulatory activity [ [56](#B56-vaccines-08-00468)]. [69](#B69-vaccines-08-00468), [70](#B70-vaccines-08-00468)]. At last, xylans are polysaccharides containing predominantly a backbone of (14)-D- xylosepyranosyl units. Other monomers attached to their backbone include -D- glucopyranosyl A units (glucuronoxylans) and -L-arabinofuranosyl units (arabinoxylans). A correlation between their structure and activity has not been elucidated yet [ [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00468), [72](#B72-vaccines-08-00468)]. 2.2. Natural Occurrence [73](#B73-vaccines-08-00468)]. Thus, they represent an ideal alternative for immune modulation. A variety of polysaccharides with immunomodulatory properties have been discovered in different species of plants ( [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00468-t002)). Among the most studied, there are type and II arabinogalactans from Astragalus [101](#B101-vaccines-08-00468)]. For A. membranaceus polysaccharides have been shown to promote nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in macrophages, by inducing the gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), through the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B)/Rel [ [102](#B102-vaccines-08-00468), [103](#B103-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, they were also able to increase the macrophage phagocytic activity, by enhancing their secretion of release intracellular Ca2+ concentration [ [104](#B104-vaccines-08-00468), [105](#B105-vaccines-08-00468)]. [106](#B106-vaccines-08-00468)]. Arabinogalactan from E. been reported increase macrophages activation and IL-1, TNF- and interferon (IFN)- production [ [86](#B86-vaccines-08-00468)]. The activation of macrophages by plant polysaccharides seems to be due to specific receptors present on their surface, which initiates the immune response, and exerts an immunomodulatory effect. These receptors are called pattern recognition molecules, and include: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), CD14, complement receptor 3 (CR3), scavenger receptor (SR), mannose receptor (MR), and Dectin-1. Their activation determines a series of intracellular signaling cascades, leading to the transcriptional activation and production inflammation-related inulin, have been found to elevate IL-10/IL-12 ratio and to reduce the release [ [108](#B108-vaccines-08-00468)]. Polysaccharide enriched extracts of E. purpurea have been found to promote the phenotypic and functional maturation of dendritic cells Moreover, they were able to increase CD3-CD4-CD8+ NKs in peripheral blood lymphocytes [ [111](#B111-vaccines-08-00468)]. NKs activation is probably due to the polysaccharides interaction with the killer cell lectin-like receptor K1(KLRK1) of NKs [ [112](#B112-vaccines-08-00468)]. Arabinoxylans extracted from wheat bran have been shown to inhibit the growth of transplantable tumors, and to promote the NK cell activity in S180 tumor-bearing mice [ [113](#B113-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, the MGN-3 rice bran arabinoxylan showed to enhance natural killer (NK) cell activity in aged C57BL/6 and C3H mice upon [116](#B116-vaccines-08-00468), [117](#B117-vaccines-08-00468)]. A. membranaceus also able to increase the number of CD3+CD4+CD8+ memory T helper (Th) cells and CD3+CD4-CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [ [111](#B111-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, they also enhance the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio [ [118](#B118-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, arabinoxylan were found to increase the activation of T- and B-cells and humoral and cell-mediated immunity in tumor bearing mice [ [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00468)]. [119](#B119-vaccines-08-00468)]. Their ability to affect the immune system by inducing Th1 and/or Th2 type immune response makes polysaccharides suitable adjuvants of the vaccine. Among them, inulin, chitosan, glucans and mannans have been most extensively studied. Particularly, the gamma and delta forms of inulin fructan have shown adjuvant activity against infectious pathogens by stimulating both Th1 and Th2 responses without inducing immunoglobulin E (IgE) production [ [120](#B120-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, Advax, a polysaccharide derived from delta inulin, has demonstrated to increase the immunization derived from influenza vaccine in mice. Particularly, an induction of neutralizing antibody and memory B-cell against influenza, an increase in CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation, and enhanced levels highlighted were also used as adjuvants of Hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine in a mice model, showing increased HBsAg-specific antibody levels, higher activity of T cells, the production of IL-4, IL-2 and IFN- by CD4+ T cells, and IFN- expression of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, a stimulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and dendritic cells maturation, and a reduction in the frequency of regulatory T cells were observed [ [123](#B123-vaccines-08-00468)]. Mannans and fructooligosaccharide have also been shown to possess adjuvanticity [ [124](#B124-vaccines-08-00468), [125](#B125-vaccines-08-00468)]. [126](#B126-vaccines-08-00468)]. These molecules are able to cross the gut epithelium and interact with surface receptors on the immune cells, such as the G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) 41 and 43 [ [127](#B127-vaccines-08-00468)]. The activation of GPRs by SCFA modulates inflammatory signalling [126](#B126-vaccines-08-00468)]. 2.4. Clinical Studies [130](#B130-vaccines-08-00468)], twenthy-eight stable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients were treated with peritoneal dialysis fluid containing astragalus (20 mL/2 L) for one week. An increase in the macrophage phagocytic capacity, NO and TNF- contents were observed in patients compared to those before the treatment [ [130](#B130-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, Ji et al. [ [131](#B131-vaccines-08-00468)] investigated the effect of astragalus pre-operative treatment of colorectal cancer patients (n = 128) on immune function. Results showed that astragalus pre-operative treatment promoted the NK cell activity in postoperative patients. In addition, the possible immunomodulatory activity of astragalus in patients with acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma (n = 72) has been investigated [ [132](#B132-vaccines-08-00468)]. Particularly, it was observed that the combination of conventional therapy with astragalus injection for 14 days improved the effects of routine treatment, by enhancing T lymphocyte and NK-cells immune function. [133](#B133-vaccines-08-00468)]. [134](#B134-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, prevention trials have been carried out, showing that echinacea products slightly reduce the risk of getting a cold in healthy individuals [ [135](#B135-vaccines-08-00468)]. However, the heterogeneity (e.g., different species and part used) of preparations used in the trials makes the conclusions on the potential immunomodulatory properties of echinacea difficult. [136](#B136-vaccines-08-00468), [137](#B137-vaccines-08-00468), [138](#B138-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, the combination of resveratrol plus carboxymethyl--glucan as a solution for aerosol has been tested in clinical trials. Particularly, the ability of the combination to prevent or treat recurrent respiratory infections in children was studied [ [139](#B139-vaccines-08-00468), [140](#B140-vaccines-08-00468)]. In both cases, resveratrol plus carboxymethyl--glucan had a positive impact on children clinical conditions. Indeed, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, fever, medication use, medical visits, and school absence were significantly reduced. Moreover, resveratrol plus carboxymethyl--glucan have also been shown to relief nasal symptoms in children with allergic rhinitis, due to pollen allergy [ [141](#B141-vaccines-08-00468)]. [124](#B124-vaccines-08-00468)]. 3. Fatty Acids 3.1. Chemical Features [142](#B142-vaccines-08-00468)]. Based on the number of carbons in the chain, fatty acids can be classified as shortchain fatty acids (SCFA; aliphatic tails up to and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; aliphatic and more carbons) [ [143](#B143-vaccines-08-00468)]. [144](#B144-vaccines-08-00468)]. Bacteroidetes are reported to be mainly responsible for the production of acetate and propionate, while Firmicutes are the primary contributors of butyrate; however, other bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. are involved too [ an example of MUFA. [143](#B143-vaccines-08-00468)]. The number of carbon atoms and unsaturated bond position are used for the systematic nomenclature of FA. Moreover, the greek letters omega () and delta () are included, to indicate how far a double bond is from the terminal methyl carbon and the presence and position of one or more double or triple bonds in the carbon backbone, respectively [ [143](#B143-vaccines-08-00468)]. A further \"\" or \"n\" classification designates the position of the first double bond in the skeleton from the end opposite to the carboxy group. Accordingly, oleic acid is classified as a -9 (or n-9) fatty acid, while linoleic acid and -linolenic acid are -6 (or n-6) and -3 (or n-3) fatty acids, as they contain the double bond nine, six and three carbons from the methyl end [ [143](#B143-vaccines-08-00468)]. Nomenclature of the major representative fatty acids in the different FA classes is displayed in [Table 3](#vaccines-08-00468-t003). [143](#B143-vaccines-08-00468)]. Trans-fatty acids are considered undesirable compounds in foods, as their intake is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases [ [145](#B145-vaccines-08-00468)]. [143](#B143-vaccines-08-00468)]. Unconjugated PUFA, especially -3, -6, and -9 series, are the most occurring in nature. The most common conjugated PUFA are trienes, such as octadecatrienoic acids (e.g., punic acid, calendic acid). [146](#B146-vaccines-08-00468)]. Particularly, the biosynthesis of -3 and -6 PUFA starts from -linolenic acid (ALA or linolenate; 6](#vaccines-08-00468-f006)). [146](#B146-vaccines-08-00468)]. Both series of acids can be further metabolized by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, to obtain eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes, acting as central modulators of the inflammatory process [ [146](#B146-vaccines-08-00468)]. 3.2. Natural Occurrence [147](#B147-vaccines-08-00468)]. Likewise, the MCFA lauric acid and myristic acid are the major components of the oils obtained from some Lauraceae and Myristiceae species [ [148](#B148-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, palmitic acid is the most representative SFA in vegetable oils, such as palm oil [ [149](#B149-vaccines-08-00468)]. [150](#B150-vaccines-08-00468)], while oleic acid is one of the most widely distributed fatty acids: it represents 49% to 83% of total FA in olive oil, although it does occur in high amounts in other oils, such as those from grape seeds, canola and sufflower [ [151](#B151-vaccines-08-00468), [152](#B152-vaccines-08-00468)]. [Table 4](#vaccines-08-00468-t004)), although in different amounts [ [153](#B153-vaccines-08-00468)]. [153](#B153-vaccines-08-00468)]. Likewise, green leafy vegetables seem to be an interesting source of ALA [ [163](#B163-vaccines-08-00468)]. Fish oils are also sources of both EPA and DHA (3 PUFA), with lower amounts of DPA (6 PUFA) [ [153](#B153-vaccines-08-00468)]. [153](#B153-vaccines-08-00468)]. Some vegetables can supply both the essential PUFA and some derivative fatty acids. Particularly, the oils obtained from the seeds spp., Echium spp., Ranunculus spp. and Oenothera biennis L. have been reported to contain high levels of both LA and -linolenic acid (GLA) [ it diminished NK cell activity [ [165](#B165-vaccines-08-00468)] and the expression of the leucocyte adhesion molecules, which have shown to be implicated in some pathophysiological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis [ [165](#B165-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, it enhanced neutrophil aggregation and [166](#B166-vaccines-08-00468), [167](#B167-vaccines-08-00468)]. [164](#B164-vaccines-08-00468)]. Similar suppressive effects were also highlighted for its synthetic analogue minerval and confirmed in animal models [ [164](#B164-vaccines-08-00468), [168](#B168-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, the treatment with oleic acid and minerval induced proapoptotic effects in Jurkat (T lymphocyte) and Raji (B lymphocyte) cells, likely due production [168](#B168-vaccines-08-00468), [169](#B169-vaccines-08-00468), [170](#B170-vaccines-08-00468)]. [171](#B171-vaccines-08-00468), In the skin, oleic acid, along with other unsaturated FA, seems to be incorporated into the lipid moiety of Staphylococcus aureus Lpp, inducing an immune response against the pathogen [ [173](#B173-vaccines-08-00468)]. [174](#B174-vaccines-08-00468)]. These immune boosting effects are due to nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)- and -dependent mechanisms, as punicic acid is able to act as an agonist of these receptors; in support, the loss of PPAR in immune cells impaired its effects [ [174](#B174-vaccines-08-00468), [175](#B175-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, punicic acid inhibited the TNF--induced priming of by inhibiting the Ser345-p47phox phosphorylation and upstreaming kinase p38MAPK; likewise, it blocked of myeloperoxidase from neutrophils, and decreased neutrophil-activation and ROS/MPO-mediated tissue damage in vivo [ [176](#B176-vaccines-08-00468)]. Antinflammatory properties were found to be related to the activation of PPAR and the suppressed expression of inflammatory genes (encoding cytokines, chemokines, cyclooxygenase, NO synthase, and fatty acids share common biosynthetic enzymes which mediate the production of different series of eicosanoids, starting from typical precursors, including dihomo--linoleic acid (DGLA), arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Among prostanoids, three types of prostaglandins (PG), including PG1, PG2 and PG3, can be obtained. PG1 is associated with beneficial effects and lower inflammation, thus being considered as an antinflammatory prostanoid; conversely, PG2 has opposite behaviour, increasing inflammation, vasoconstriction and blood clotting. PG3 acts through a mixture of functions and is able to reduce the PG2-mediated inflammation [ [177](#B177-vaccines-08-00468)]. [Figure 7](#vaccines-08-00468-f007)). [178](#B178-vaccines-08-00468)]. [178](#B178-vaccines-08-00468)]. Like punicic acid, the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA are mediated by the activation of the PPAR/ [ [179](#B179-vaccines-08-00468)]. [180](#B180-vaccines-08-00468)]. [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. Modulating signalings through the GPR receptor activation can also affect leukocyte function. Likewise, an inhibition of the pro-inflammatory phenotype of dendritic cells and of the T cell responses has been reported [ [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. They are also able to inhibit neutrophil and monocyte adhesion, depending on the activation of PPAR- [ [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. Particularly, linoleic acid increased the marginated pool of neutrophils in tissues by the induced expression of adhesion molecules; it also complexed with the LPS-induced IL-1 secretion in neutrophils [ [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. On the whole, preclinical evidence highlighted that these fatty acids could increase neutrophil function, thus promoting innate immunity. [180](#B180-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, an increased production of associated anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, in spite of a reduction of pro-inflammatory TNF-, was found [ [180](#B180-vaccines-08-00468)]. Similar effects were highlighted with both fish oil-enriched diets and the purified EPA and DHA [ [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, a strictly interplay between omega-3 fatty acids, immunity and gut microbiota has been reported and seems to be an essential factor to maintain the intestinal wall integrity. These effects have been ascribed to the ability of -3 PUFA to positively affect the microbiota composition and increase the production of anti-inflammatory compounds, [184](#B184-vaccines-08-00468)]. Flaxseed oil was found to be effective in reducing skin inflammatory responses, although with a lower immunosuppressive power with respect to fish oil [ [185](#B185-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, it improved systemic and gut immunity, in a piglet model with intrauterine growth retardation: increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G, decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and the downregulation of genes expression for proinflammatory factors been [186](#B186-vaccines-08-00468)]. [187](#B187-vaccines-08-00468), [188](#B188-vaccines-08-00468), [189](#B189-vaccines-08-00468), [190](#B190-vaccines-08-00468), [191](#B191-vaccines-08-00468)]. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effects have been found to be involved in the immunomodulation by evening primrose oil [ [160](#B160-vaccines-08-00468)]. [192](#B192-vaccines-08-00468)]. However, a contribution of LA to the antinflammatory effects seems to be likely; indeed, LA can itself modulate inflammation as it is metabolized by LOX to hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) and oxo-HODEs, characterized by [183](#B183-vaccines-08-00468)]. A chemotactic migration of monocytes to necrotic site that differentiate into macrophages is associated with the administration of this product. Moreover, it is known to reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, and to promote PGE1 generation; a reduced expression of inflammatory genes, especially those of macrophages involved in atherosclerosis, has been clinical evidence about the immunomodulatory power of punicic acid in healthy or sick subjects is lacking [ [150](#B150-vaccines-08-00468)]. [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00468)]. [195](#B195-vaccines-08-00468), [196](#B196-vaccines-08-00468), [197](#B197-vaccines-08-00468)]. In support, low levels of PUFAs have been found in the serum of patients with rheumatic diseases [ [198](#B198-vaccines-08-00468)]. Conversely, inconsistent results are reported for multiple sclerosis, thus the possible usefulness of these fatty acids as supportive therapy requires more clinical trials [ [199](#B199-vaccines-08-00468)]. [200](#B200-vaccines-08-00468)]. Indeed, studies in healthy human adults highlighted that an increased intake of these fatty acids did not induce inflammation; conversely, epidemiological evidence reported reduced inflammatory conditions [ [200](#B200-vaccines-08-00468)]. The antinflammatory effects of LA have been reported too [ [193](#B193-vaccines-08-00468)]. Similarly, increased LA intake was found to be not related to increased amounts of ARA and proinflammatory factors; however, an inverse correlation with EPA and DHA was reported [ [201](#B201-vaccines-08-00468)]. This suggests that the interaction between -e and -6 series is regulated by complex mechanisms that requires further clarifications. [202](#B202-vaccines-08-00468)]. [203](#B203-vaccines-08-00468)]. Some beneficial effects were also reported in multiple schlerosis patients, although the few available studies limited the evidence in this disorder. [204](#B204-vaccines-08-00468)]. Similarly, in association with -3 fatty acids, it did not induce improvements in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ [205](#B205-vaccines-08-00468)]. A Cochrane revision highlighted moderate evidence for oils containing GLA (i.e., evening primrose, borage, or blackcurrant seed oil) to produce benefit in rheumatoid arthritis [ [205](#B205-vaccines-08-00468), [206](#B206-vaccines-08-00468)]. Evening primrose oil along with borage oil were not effective to treat eczema too [ [207](#B207-vaccines-08-00468)]. Highly variable results were also obtained for borage oil in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, although, in all the studies, a moderate efficacy degree was displayed [ [208](#B208-vaccines-08-00468)]. [209](#B209-vaccines-08-00468)]. 4. Labdane Diterpenes 4.1. Chemical Features [Figure 8](#vaccines-08-00468-f008)). Labdane-related molecules have a hydrocarbon skeleton, originated from dual biosynthetic cyclization and/or rearrangement reactions, produced through the biosynthetic pathway gibberellin phytohormones by the diterpene cyclases. The labane diterpenoids belong to a superfamily of natural products, in which the hydrocarbon skeleton might serve as privileged scaffolds for their biological activity [ [210](#B210-vaccines-08-00468)]. 4.2. Natural Occurrence [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00468-t001), some of them (where diterpenes have been found), their botanical family (in parentheses) and the part of plant of biological interest are reported. [Figure Pharmacological Properties: Preclinical Studies [Table 5](#vaccines-08-00468-t005), are shown below. For each plants and plant-derived nutraceutical, only properties potentially attributable to the labdane skeleton and useful to improve the immune system are reported. [211](#B211-vaccines-08-00468)]. Indeed, labdane diterpenoids have recently gained greater attention from the scientific point of view, due to a wide range of biological activities, including the anti-inflammatory modulation of immune cell functions [ and NF-B [ [211](#B211-vaccines-08-00468)]. Many labdane diterpenoids compounds have been found to act on the latter. The activation of the NF-B pathway leads to several physiological responses, including inflammatory or innate immune response [ [217](#B217-vaccines-08-00468)]. [211](#B211-vaccines-08-00468)]. These effects can contribute to the immunoregulatory activity of this plant-derived nutraceutical, as it can modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses by regulating macrophage phenotypic polarization and antibody productions [ [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00468)]. Moreover, it was found to exert cytotoxic/anticancer effects on almost all types of tumour cell lines (human leukemia, renal tubular epithelial cells, breast cancer cells, etc.), mainly by cell cycle arrest, autophagy, cell death, anti-inflammatory and immune system mediated effects [ [220](#B220-vaccines-08-00468)]. [212](#B212-vaccines-08-00468)]. [213](#B213-vaccines-08-00468)]. [221](#B221-vaccines-08-00468)]. [222](#B222-vaccines-08-00468)]. In preclinical studies, E. macrophyllus was not cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and no acute toxicity (up to the maximum dose of 2000 mg/kg b.w.) has been observed in tested animals [ [221](#B221-vaccines-08-00468)]. However, the extrapolation of animal experiments to clinical practice must be done with caution [ [223](#B223-vaccines-08-00468)]. [215](#B215-vaccines-08-00468)]. The berries from J. oblonga also have antimicrobial activity and anti-inflammatory effects. [216](#B216-vaccines-08-00468)]. [217](#B217-vaccines-08-00468)]. Marrulibanoside, obtained from the aerial parts of M. globosum, inhibited catalytic activity of iNOS and COX-2enzymes, and consequentely, the PEG2 and NO production. [218](#B218-vaccines-08-00468)]. 4.4. Clinical Studies [219](#B219-vaccines-08-00468)]. The most interesting activity is the increase of CD4+ lymphocyte levels, in HIV-positive patients [ [211](#B211-vaccines-08-00468)]. The increase in these lymphocytes testifies an improvement in the state of the immune system. Moreover, a Chinese product containing andrographolide improved the efficacy of glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin in patients with severe hand, food, and mouth disease. [211](#B211-vaccines-08-00468)]. [219](#B219-vaccines-08-00468)]. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports a possibility of causing reproductive toxicity of Andrographis extracts (decreases in sperm motility and counts) [ [219](#B219-vaccines-08-00468)]. On the other hand, no major adverse effects have been reported for A. paniculata; only minor side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, are known [ [219](#B219-vaccines-08-00468)]. 5. Further Research [224](#B224-vaccines-08-00468), [225](#B225-vaccines-08-00468)], herbal products under study must be characterized for the phytochemical composition, using validated analytical methodologies, and for the extraction procedures; moreover, the starting material should be fully defined in terms of origin (country and region), cultivation conditions, botanical identity and plant part. The content of specific compounds, used as analytical or active markers, should be determined too. These requirements are needed to ensure reproducible pharmacological/clinical activity and to compare different studies. Indeed, using nonstandardized phytocomplexes increases variability of the biological response, thus limiting the reliability and validity of the studies. [226](#B226-vaccines-08-00468)], would allow a rational interpretation of the results and suggestions for future research. 6.
