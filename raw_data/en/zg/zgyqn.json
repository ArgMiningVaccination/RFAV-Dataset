Disclaimer 3 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesPre-Positioning of Vaccine Vaccinate with Confidence U.S. CDC Website Resources Next weeks Topic: Storage and Handling from Pfizer Agenda 4 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesOWS may pre -position vaccine to ensure that supply is closer to the administration sites where vaccine is needed once FDA issues an EUA and ACIP recommendations are made. This pre -positioning is a onetime effort intended to shorten the timeline between EUA release and the initiation of vaccine administration (e.g., if initial prioritization focuses on administration of vaccine to healthcare providers).

These concerns are understandable and need to be addressed with empathy and transparency. Concerns among healthcare providers is a risk for overall vaccine confidence. Healthcare providers are the most trusted source for health information. Communities will have unique experiences informing COVID -19 vaccine perceptions. Engagement with community organizations and leaders will expand access to clear and accurate information on COVID -19 vaccines. Vaccinate with Confidence 11 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesIntentions to Get Vaccinated Participants generally open to getting the COVID -19 vaccine eventually Many participants hesitant to get the COVID -19 vaccine when first available Concerns included: -Safety and Side effects (both short and long term) No specific consequences expressed, but just \"side effects\" -Effectiveness -Sufficient testing in their group (age, race, ethnicity, underlying health conditions) -Rapid development process Participants wanted more information, would \"wait and see\" before deciding 6 months commonly cited as a reasonable time frame Vaccinate with Confidence 12 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesReasons to Get Vaccinated or NotYES Desire to get back to a normal life Trust in vaccines and the scientific process NO I don't get vaccines I'm healthy Don't trust it Maine Department of Health and Human Services 13Priority Group -Health Care Workers Doctors, nurses, hospital workers (and occasionally paramedics/EMTs) Consistently mentioned as group to get COVID -19 vaccine first Usually mentioned first/early in discussion -Every group mentioned they should be first Why first? -High exposure to COVID -19 (risking their health/life) -Interact with the public -Keep everyone healthy Vaccinate with Confidence 14 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesPriority Group -First Responders First Responders -Fire, police, paramedics/EMTs -Widely agreed that they should be first/among first Why among the first? -Frequent interaction with public, exposure to people with COVID -19 -Keep people safe Mixed response on whether first responders should get vaccine first along with healthcare workers: -Should get vaccine first along with health care workers (Older Adult groups) -Should get vaccine after health care workers along with essential workers -Often no direct comparison of who is first among \"high priority\" occupations Vaccinate with Confidence 15 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesMaine Department of Health and Human Services16 Maine Department of Health and Human Services17 8 Things to Know about Vaccine Planning 18 Maine Department of Health and Human Services1.The safety of COVID -19 vaccines is a top priority 2.Many vaccines are being developed and tested, but some might be ready before others. CDC is planning for many possibilities. 3.At least at first, COVID -19 vaccines might be used under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 4.There may be limited supply of COVID -19 vaccines before the end of 2020, but supply will continually increase in the weeks and months that follow. 5.If there is limited supply, some groups may be recommended to get COVID -19 vaccine first. 6.At first, covid -19 vaccines may not be recommended for children. 7.Cost will not be an obstacle to getting vaccinated against COVID -19. 8.COVID -19 planning is being updated as new information becomes available. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/8 -things.htmlHow is the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Fact Sheet for Recipients different from a vaccine information statement (VIS)? When FDA authorizes a vaccine for use under an EUA, providers and public health entities involved in vaccine administration are legally required to provide the FDA - authorized EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients to individuals receiving vaccine or their guardians, similar to VIS's that are also required by law for certain licensed vaccines. The EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients, like the VIS, explains the benefits and risks associated with the vaccine. But unlike a VIS, the EUA fact sheet also provides vaccine product -specific information, including the vaccine's authorized use, dose/dose -series, and known information or experience with the vaccine from clinical trials that support issuance of the EUA by FDA. Emergency Use Authorization 19 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesWhat is the difference between an EUA, an EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers and an EUA Fact Sheet for Patients? -The legal authority of FDA to authorize emergency use of an investigational medical product (e.g., vaccines prior to licensure, drugs prior to approval) or an unapproved use of an approved medical product to diagnose, treat, or prevent a serious or life -threatening disease is referred to as Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The term \"EUA\" can refer to either the legal authority itself or to the regulatory status of a medical product, such as COVID -19 vaccine. For example, one could say \"FDA issued an EUA\" or \"an EUA is in place.\" -When FDA authorizes emergency use of a medical product such as an anticipated COVID -19 vaccine, an EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers (in place of a package insert typical of a licensed vaccine) and an EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients (akin to product information for patients or a CDC -provided VIS for a licensed vaccine) must be provided to the healthcare providers prescribing and/or administering the authorized medical product. The healthcare providers, in turn, provide the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients to vaccine recipients or their guardians. Emergency Use Authorization 20 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesCan the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients or VIS be provided to vaccine recipients electronically or is a hard copy required? The EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers and EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients can be offered in an accessible form (e.g., printable as a hard copy) or through mass media (including print, broadcast, radio, satellite, internet, or other electronic means of dissemination), videos/DVDs, or direct communication from public health agencies.

ACIP is a federal advisory committee made of up of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the U.S. public. ACIP holds regular meetings, which are open to the public and provide opportunity for public comment.
