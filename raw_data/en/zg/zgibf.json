There is limited research and evidence regarding the effectiveness of many supplement products . Things to Consider Before Beginning a Supplement Because a product is labeled as \"natural \" doesn't mean it's always healthy or non -toxic. It may actually mean the product is less safe , because there is no way for healthcare providers to tell what is in the product . Claims about supplements found in magazines, websites , and on the radio can be over exaggerated and sometimes wrong. There is little to no research to support most of these claims . Manufacture rs do have to follow good manufacturing practices to ensure that supplements are processed consistently and meet quality standards. However, there is no way to make sure the right ingredients are included in the appropriate amounts. Supplements can interact with prescription medications and chemotherap y. Herbal supplements have the potential to increase toxicity while a person is receiving c hemotherapy, or possibl y d ecrease its effectiveness. Many supplements are processed through the liver and can change liver functions or cause live r t oxicity . Supplements don't need to be approved by the FDA. However , the FDA is still responsible fo r m onitoring their safety . If the FDA receives reports that a product is unsafe , it can take action against the manufacturer, distributor, or both . Manufacturers don't need FDA approval in order to put a supplement on the market. They can claim that the product supports health or treats a disease only if they include a disclaimer that the FDA has not evaluated the claim. The FDA does require some information to be included on the manufacturer's label. When purchasing a supplement, make sure the label contains: o The name of the supplement; o The name and address of the manufacturer (be cautious if the product is made outside the United States); o The complete list of ingredien ts, either in the supplement fact sheet or beneath it; o The serving size and amount; o The supplement's active ingredients. It's better to start with one supplement at a time to be sure you're able to tolerate it beforeexploring another one. Always discuss what supplements you are taking with your healthcare care provider. Vitamins Can Be Fat -Loving or Water -Loving Vitamins that are fat -loving are absorbed into your fat stay in your body longer and have the potential to cause more toxicity.

If you are taking any of these vitamins , it is important to know signs of toxicity: October 2016 Vitamin A - nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, muscle weakness Vitamin D - gastrointestinal symptoms , eleva tion in calcium levels Vitamin E - fatigue , dizziness, weakness, headache, blurred vision, rash Vitamin K - dizziness, flushing Antioxidants and Free Radicals Radiation and some chemotherapy kill cancer cells by creating free radicals. Free radicals are normally found in your body. Free radicals help to kill certain types of bacteria and fungi , and also regulate cell growth and destruction. Antioxidants in your diet help protect cells from damage done by free radicals. I f you are receiving chemotherapy that works by creating free radicals and you take a supplement that binds with free radicals , they might counteract each other and limit the effectiveness of your chemotherapy treatment .
