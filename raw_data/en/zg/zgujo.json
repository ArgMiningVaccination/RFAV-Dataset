V-safe is a new smart phone -based system that uses text messaging to initiate web -based survey monitoring in the form of periodic health check -ins to assess for potential adverse events following vaccination . CDC will use the follow -up capability of the existing Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) call center to conduct active telephone follow -up on recipients reporting significant , medically attended health impact s during v -safe health check -ins. The purpose of v -safe surveillance is to rapidly characterize the safety profile of COVID -19 vaccines when given outsi de a clinical trial setting and to detect and evaluate clinically important adverse events and safety issues that might impact policy or regulatory decisions . Background and significance Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2). Following the emergence of COVID -19 in China in late 2019, the first confirmed U.S. cases were detected in January 2020. With rapid human -to-human transmission occurring, the United States declared a public health emergency in February 2020, followed by a national emergency in March 2020 (1). As of November 18, 2020, there have been 11,300,635 cases of COVID -19 disease in the United States and 247,834 deaths ( 2). A key U.S. pandemic response initiative is Operation Warp Speed, a public -private partnership established in May 2020 , with a goal to develop and deliver safe and effective COVID -19 vaccine(s) to the U.S. population by early 2021 (3). Post-authorization/ post-approval vaccine safety m onitoring is a federal government responsibility, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA sharing most of the responsibility along with other federal agencies involved in healthcare delivery (e.g., Veterans Affairs , Department of Defense , Indian Health Service ). Initial safety assessment begins in early vaccine development and expands during phased clinical trials in humans. Clinical trials are effective at identifying and characterizing common adverse events, such as local and systemic reactions . However , even large clinical trials, like the COVID -19 vaccine v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 6 of 87 clinical trials that are enrolling tens of thousands of volunteers, might not be large enough to detect rare adverse events (for example, those occurring at rates of <1 per 100,000 people vaccinated). Furthermore, for some clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, the follow-up period to monitor for possible adverse events with delayed onset may not be completed for all subjects prior to issuance of an EUA or licensure. Additionally, exclusion criteria for clinical trials may limit generalizability of safety and efficacy findings to special populations, such as those with certain chronic illnesses or pregnant women (4). For these reasons, robust post- authorization/approval safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines is a public health priority. To meet the safety data needs for COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance during the post- authorization/approval period, CDC implemented v-safe, a smartphone-based system that uses text messaging to initiate web-based surveys to monitor for adverse events following vaccination. The surveillance process triggers active telephone follow-up on vaccinated individuals reporting a significant, medically attended health impact during v-safe health check- ins. Goals and objectives Goals Characterize the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines, including primary series and booster doses. Rapidly monitor and identify potential safety problems associated with COVID-19 vaccines that would impact policy or regulatory decisions. Objectives Characterize the local and systemic reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines during the first week post-vaccination (days 0-7). Identify and characterize clinically important adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination during a 6-week post-vaccination follow-up period. v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 7 of 87 Monitor the long (er)-term (3, 6, and 12 months post-vaccination) safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods Surveillance population All people in the United States who receive a COVID-19 vaccination will be eligible to enroll in v-safe for the duration of the v-safe program. Surveys will be available in English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean languages. Enrollment criteria: - Participants must have received a COVID-19 vaccination. - Participants or their parent/guardian must possess a smartphone with a valid US telephone number. More than one individual may use the same smartphone/telephone number (i.e., shared smartphone). Enr ollment The v-safe program commenced when COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for use and became available to the U.S. population on December 14, 2020. Vaccination may occur at a mass vaccination clinic, an occupational health clinic, a public health clinic, a healthcare provider's office, a pharmacy, or other setting. At the time of vaccination, the healthcare provider will briefly describe the v-safe program using a prescribed script. In addition, the healthcare provider will provide the vaccinated patient with an information sheet that includes a brief description of the program, a URL and a scannable QR code, and enrollment instructions. Vaccinated individuals can enroll in v-safe immediately following vaccination or at a later date; surveys will be timed appropriately based on vaccination date(s). For vaccine recipients whose vaccination information is captured in CDC's Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS), VAMS will send recipients a reminder text message about v-safe 24 hours after vaccination (5). For vaccine recipients receiving a 2-dose vaccine, v-safe will send a text reminder to participants that they should schedule the ir second dose. Participation in v-safe is v-safe protocol : April 1 8, 202 2, version 5 Page 8 of 87 voluntary and people can opt out at any time by texting \"STOP\" when v -safe sends a reminder text message; people can also start v -safe again by texting \"UNSTOP .\" Once a vaccinated individual decides to enroll in v -safe, the indi vidual will either scan his/her mobile phone camera over the QR code on the information sheet or type in the v -safe URL to access the v -safe registration website. Registration information include s: First name Last name Mobile phone number Date of birth Sex Zip code If registering in v -safe on behalf of a dependent , the original registra nt will also be asked to supply the following: First name of dependent Last name of dependent Date of birth of dependent Sex of dependent Zip code of dependent Relationship to dependent (child or adolescent, adult friend or relative, other) The registration system will ask the participant to verify their phone number by sending a text message with a verification code . The participant will enter the texted code to verify their identity. After that, the participant will be asked to record information about their COVID -19 vaccines received to date (or that of their dependent) , including the vaccine manufacturer (s) and the vaccination date (s). The participant will also be asked if any other vaccines were administered at the time of COVID -19 vaccination and, if there were, to specify the type of vaccine(s). If the v -safe participant does not know this information, they are encouraged to refer to the vaccination record card they received or to contact their health care provider. v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 9 of 87 Once a participant has registered and provided information on the ir COVID-19 vaccine(s), they will be prompted to take an initial v-safe health check-in survey for themselves or their dependent. The survey will be dependent on the vaccination date and dose number (if applicable) entered during registration. Subsequently, text messages will be sent to their smartphone with a link to a web-based survey at 2:00 pm (local time based on zip code entered at registration) on the schedule listed below. Surveys for all timepoints are included in Attachment 1 (daily surveys for participants ages 3 years and over, weekly and monthly surveys for all participants) and Attachment 2 (daily surveys for non-verbal participants age <3 years). Electronic health check- in schedule The schedule for electronic health check-ins is as follows: 1. Day 0 (day of vaccination) 2. Daily on days 1-7 (the 1st week post-vaccination) 3. Weekly starting day 14 (2nd week post-vaccination) to up to day 42 (6th week post- vaccination) if no other dose of COVID-19 vaccine is received a. If participant receives another COVID-19 vaccine dose during the post- vaccination follow-up period, the process will reset to day 0 for the most recen t dose and continue through steps 1-3 above based on time since the most recent dose. 4. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-vaccination following most recent dose vaccine or following first dose if no other dose is received a. If participant receives another COVID-19 vaccine dose during the post- vaccination follow-up period, the process will reset to day 0 for the most recent dose and continue through steps 1-4 based on time since the most recent dose v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 10 of 87 Daily surveys expire at midnight on the day of the survey and weekly surveys expire at midnight on the last day of the week before the next weekly survey period. The day 42 survey will expire on day 48 at midnight. Monthly surveys will be available for 6 full days following receipt of the survey, expiring at midnight. A participant cannot go back and complete surveys for timepoints prior to their registration (i.e., surveys will be prospective from the time of enrollment). In addition, a participant cannot revise their survey once it has been submitted. After submission, the participant is told that depending on his/her answers, someone from CDC might call to follow up. Active telephone follow-up If, during any v-safe health check-in, a participant reports a significant, medically-attended health impact event for themselves or their dependent, including but not exclusive to requiring care in a hospital or emergency room setting, VAERS call center staff will be informed and active telephone follow-up will be initiated to check on the patient and take a VAERS report if appropriate. VAERS is an existing national spontaneous reporting system that is co-managed by FDA and CDC. It serves as an early warning system for adverse events following vaccination (6). VAERS call center staff will be notified of participants who have reported a medically-attended health impact via a data set that will be created from the v-safe survey system. The data set will include the following variables: Unique v -safe id First name Last n ame Phone n umber Sex Age Zip code First name of guardian, if applicable Last name of guardian, if applicable Relationship to guardian, if applicable Flagged health impact question Flagged health impact response(s) survey number (dose/survey [i.e., Dose2D0]) Days since (allows identification of number of days since last dose) Vaccine manufacturer v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 11 of 87 Dose number Reported date Preferred language Time zone Pregnancy indicator Source for medically-attended care Using this information, the VAERS call center staff will call participants identified in the data set and complete a VAERS report (located at https://vaers.hhs.gov) by phone if appropriate. Data collection, quality, and management V-safe data will be collected, managed , and housed on a secure server by Oracle. Through Health and Human Services (HHS), Oracle has donated IT services to any agency conducting COVID-19 related activities. Oracle is providing IT support for v-safe. All data will be stored, processed, and transmitted in accordance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and based on NIST standards. Data will be housed in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) U. S. Government Cloud tenancy ; the OCI U.S. government tenancy is Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FEDRAMP) approved (7). Per Oracle 's internal policies, Oracle staff will not be able to view any individualized survey data (including variables with personal ly identifiable information [PII]) but, rather, will have access to aggregate deidentified data for reporting. CDC will have \"read\" access to the individualized survey data, including PII, provided by Oracle. On a continuous basis (either daily or weekly), these survey data will be accessible to CDC through downloads from the secure server. The v- safe system employs strict security measures appropriate for the level of sensitivity of the data. Data received by CDC will be stored on an internal secure CDC/ISO server and access will be limited to authorized personnel. Oracle will create a data set for the VAERS call center that includes those participants who reported having a heath impact event that requires call follow-up . A small number of select employees of the contractor will access these data in order to provide call center representatives with information needed to follow up with participants (see \"Active telephone follow -up\" v-safe protocol : April 1 8, 202 2, version 5 Page 12 of 87 above) . The VAERS call center staff is employed specifically for v -safe follow -up and is associated with the overall VAERS contractor. VAERS reports will be obtained during active teleph one follow -up with v-safe participants and will be processed, handled, stored, and accessed in accordance with existing approved VAERS procedures and policies. Data from all components of v -safe, as well as VAERS reports obtained through the call center , may be combined into a master data set behind the CDC firewall using unique identification numbers assigned at registration. The VAERS call center staff will provide a cumulative dataset to CDC on a weekly basis containing information on completed call ou treach and allowing CDC staff to link VAERS reports completed during outreach with v -safe participant records. Preapproved CDC investigators and data managers , including CDC contractors, will be the only individuals with access to the full data (v-safe, linked VAERS reports ). All electronic documents, data sets, and files relevant to the project will be stored on secure network locations with restricted access on CDC computers. The v-safe team at CDC will be primarily responsible for data management activi ties, including data extraction, documentation , and archival of a final data set for data sharing purposes. The archive will include the protocol, statistical programs, human subjects review documents, statistical output, analytical data sets, and manuscri pts. It will clearly identify the permanent storage location for these files . A final data set at the end of the v -safe program with deidentifi ed aggregate data will be made available for external data requests or through Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests. Analysis plan Descriptive analyses will be conducted using the data collected through surveys on a weekly basis during the surveillance period . Participation rates over time will also be calculated. Analyses for specific cohorts, as defined by age, vaccine manufacturer, dose , or special population status (for example, pregnant persons) will be executed as needed and/or requested by pandemic response leadership and advisory committees. v-safe protocol : April 1 8, 202 2, version 5 Page 13 of 87 For v -safe participants who have a VAERS report submitted through the VAERS call center, additional analyses will be conducted by VAERS, using the VAERS Standard Operating Procedure s for COVID (8). Rates of serious events as well as adverse events of special interest (AESI) following COVID -19 vaccin ation will be generated using VAERS reports solicited via v - safe to define the numerator and v-safe participants as the denominator (Attachment 3). VAERS reports that are considered serious or AESI will be reviewed by medical staff at CDC. Case definitions (Brighton Collaboration or other standard definitions as appropriate) will be applied to the AESI s. Reporting rates for each AESI will be calculated and compared to established background rates. If at any time rates observed in v -safe exceed what is expected from background rates, further investigation will occur within other vaccine safety monitoring systems, including VAERS and Vaccine Safety Datalink (9). VAERS monitoring for all COVID -19 reports will include VAERS reports solicited from v -safe participants . Reports obtained from v -safe participants during call center outreach will be coded so that they can be distinguished from other VAERS reports and analyzed separately from other VAERS reports if needed. Human subjects considerations and c onfidentiality This protocol will require human subjects determination at CDC since CDC is the lead site and surveillance data will include collection of PII. No PII will be included in any v -safe analyses , manuscripts, or data sets shared through external data requests . Participation is completely voluntary and individuals self -enroll. Participants can elect to stop text notifications at any time and their data will be used for those surveys completed prior to opting out . Participants who request to be removed entirely from the system will be inactivated in v -safe so that their registration record is deleted , and their health survey data w ill not be included in future analyses. As an analysis of data collected for non -research purposes , this activity presents minimal risk to subjects, and use of patient data for this purpose will not adversely affect subjects ' rights or welfare. v-safe protocol : April 1 8, 202 2, version 5 Page 14 of 87 Duration The anticipated duration of the v -safe program is at least 2-3 years of active enrollment , based on anticipated length of emergency use authorization s for COVID -19 vaccines . The decision to discontinue v -safe or to modify v -safe procedures to scale back active telephone follow -up will be made in consultation with the CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Task Force leadership and FDA. Limitations and challenges Limitations and challenges for v -safe surveillance include : Enrollment and registration is a manual process and will be dependent on healthcare provider s sharing information about the system with vaccine recipients . Enrollment might be limited . While VAMS will help promote v -safe enrollment though automated text message reminders, not all jurisdictions will use VAMS , and VAMS text messaging capabilities may not be rolled out until several weeks/months after vaccine becomes available. Accurate capture of vaccine manufacturer information will depend on accurate se lf- report . Vaccine recipients are expected to receive vaccination record cards specifying the vaccine they received, which might help to improve accuracy of these data . Vaccinated people who choose to participate in v -safe might be different from those who decline; therefore, rates of side effects and adverse events generated from v -safe might not be generalizable to the full population of vaccine recipients . V-safe allows people to enter late in the post -vaccination monitoring period. Th e group of indivi duals who enroll in v -safe late might be heterogenous -those who simply neglected to enroll early, those who chose to enroll only after experiencing a clinically important adverse event, and others. Data collected from these individuals may need to be analy zed separately from data from those who enrolled early. The information provided by v -safe participants at 3, 6, and 12 months after vaccination might be impacted by recall bias. v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 15 of 87 Participants will likely be lost to follow-up at later time points, reducing participant numbers and likely creating biases in v-safe analyses of safety out to 12 months. Because v-safe relies on vaccine recipients reporting their own experiences after va ccination, v-safe is not conducive to capturing the adverse event of death following vaccination. Dissemination Data from v-safe will be important throughout the COVID-19 vaccination program. Regular updates will be provided to advisory committees and data review groups. It is anticipated that v- safe data will be shared with the scientific community and with the public through manuscripts and public reports. v-safe Program Evaluation To better understand factors related to participation in v-safe, a multi-component evaluation strategy has been developed. This includes surveys and cognitive interviews to address: (1) Knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine recipients and user testing of the v- safe registration process; (2) Promotion efforts and barriers to promotion of v-safe among COVID-19 vaccine providers, and (3) Motivating factors for participating in v-safe among current v-safe participants. The evaluation activities are described in more detail below. The information gathered from these evaluation activities will inform future strategies to improve v- safe promotion and participation. 1. Knowledge, Attitudes, & Perceptions (KAP) and user testing of v-safe registration process The purpose of this activity is to understand knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) and usability of the revised v -safe landing page and registration process. Cognitive individual interviews lasting 30-45 minutes each among a total of 30 COVID -19 vaccine recipients and parents of children who have received or intend to receive COVID-19 vaccine will be conducted by user insight staff from Tanaq Government Services LLC (Tanaq) using a discussion guide approved by CDC (see Attachment 4). Participants will be 18 years of age or older, English v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 16 of 87 speaker, and own a smartphone. During the interview, participants will be asked open-ended questions about their knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of v-safe and be asked to complete registration of v-safe on their smartphone using dummy data (fake names, birth dates, and mock- COVID-19 vaccination dates). Staff will ask follow -up questions related to the v-safe registration process so that future modifications to the v-safe registration platform can address particular areas of difficulty for registrants, if needed. KAP interview data will be analyzed using category-based thematic analysis techniques and frequencies of responses to the user testing survey data will be reported. The data will be shared with CDC via an interim and final report. No PII will be collected. User testing will occur through the v-safe user testing environment where no PII will be collected as participants will enter dummy data (fake names, birth dates, and vaccination data ) in order to test the revised v- safe registration page. Tanaq will analyze both quantitative and qualitative data and share results with CDC. 2. Promotion efforts/barriers to promotion of v-safe The purpose of this evaluation activity is to assess promotional efforts for and barriers to promotion of v-safe among a convenience sample of U.S. healthcare providers, pharmacists, and health department staff. CDC will share an email including a link for an online REDCap survey in English that will be sent to CDC partner groups, including AMA, AAP, AAFP, ANA, NAPNAP, CDC COVID-19 vaccine state awardees, and CDC Pharmacy Partner groups. These partner groups will share this information, which will include the REDCap survey link, to their membership for voluntary participation. The survey will be open for two weeks with no reminders. Participants will be 18 years of age or older. See Attachment 5 for full surveys. Data will be collected and housed in the CDC REDCap Anonymous/Survey Environment (https://airc.cdc.gov ). No PII will be collected, and all responses will be anonymous. Data access will be limited to authorized personnel. Survey responses will be analyzed and described by CDC staff to inform CDC on promotional practices and barriers related to v -safe promotion so that additional v-safe promotional interventions can be implemented. 3. v-safe participant surveys on motivators for registration v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 17 of 87 The purpose of this evaluation activity is to assess current v-safe participant motivations for signing up for v-safe. A survey link distributed by Oracle from the v-safe system via text will be sent to a sample of current v-safe participants 18 years of age or older who registered themselves or their dependents during March 1 - April 1, 2021, May 11 - June 12, 2021 (vaccine recommendation for 12- 15-year-olds), and Nov 2 - Dec 1, 2021 (vaccine recommendation for 5- 11-year-olds). The link will be open for 6 days, and one reminder text will be sent 4 days after the initial text. See Attachment 6 for full survey. As with the standard v-safe survey data, these data will be collected, managed, and housed on a secure server by Oracle. See the Data collection, quality, and management section in this protocol for full details. Survey responses will be analyzed and described to inform CDC on motivators for v-safe participation to better cater additional v-safe promotional interventions for improved uptake. v-safe protocol : April 18, 2022, version 5 Page 18 of 87 References 1.

My name is _______. I work for a company contracted with CDC to hear your thoughts and opinions about the v-safe program, an after COVID-19 vaccination program created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I will be guiding our discussion today and will ask you to complete a few tasks and have a conversation about it. Our discussion should take no more than 60 minutes. Before we begin, I want to go over a couple of things: We invited you here today because we want to hear what you think and feel about v-safe. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions, and any thoughts or opinions you share are greatly valued and appreciated. Our whole purpose for being here is to hear what you think, so please feel comfortable sharing your point of view. You may represent what a lot of other people think. There may be times I ask you to clarify or talk more about what you just said. This is just to make sure I understood a nd accurately capture what you think, not because I'm challenging your point of view. We want to make sure you have the chance to share your ideas precisely. I didn't design or make anything that we will discuss today. So nothing you say will offend me or hurt my feelings. Please feel free to openly share your thoughts and give me your honest opinions. We appreciate the time you have taken out of your busy day to be here and want to be respectful of that, so I may interrupt you so that we stay on track. Your participation is voluntary, and you can choose to leave this interview at any time. If I ask any questions you don't want to answer, you don't have to ans wer them. There are some other people listening who are working with me on this and interested in hearing from you as well. Someone is helping me take notes so that I can fully focus on our conversation and be respectful of your time. At the end of the discussion, they might have a couple clarifying questions for us to make sure they captured everything we discussed today accurately. We don't want to miss any of your comments, so I'd like to record our conversation. Only the project staff will have access to this recording and no personally identifiable information will be used in connection with the recording, so please speak freely and honestly. Do you agree to be recorded? [Obtain verbal agreement] Nothing you say during our conversation will be tied back to you. Your name and any identifying information will not be used in any of our reports, and all information from this discussion will be summarized anonymously. Lastly, I am not an expert on COVID vaccines. You may have questions that I cannot answer about the vaccine. At the end of this discussion, I will have additional information and resources available for you. v-safe protocol : April 1 8, 202 2, version 5 Page 74 of 87 Do you have any questions before we begin?
