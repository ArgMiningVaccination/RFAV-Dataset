It was a by-product of the elements of Indian culture and its quality of absorptive cohesiveness. Ayurveda has not been a part of mainstream Indian culture as has been believed and proposed by many authors and promoters of Ayurveda. The distinct element of Indian culture has been its flexibility to integrate diverse cultural elements and Ayurveda is a complex product of this trait resulting out of assimilation of different cultural strands and medical insights. In its initial evolution, Ayurveda faced the tension between the competition of superiority of ritual practices versus the scientific use of herbs. What is practiced today is a result of the development of a paradoxically conservative yet progressive culture. The practice of Modern Ayurveda is also a culmination of scientific research and experience of nature giving a scientific discipline of medicine that is steeped in religious tradition as well as natural medicine based both on tradition and experience. It is a complete medical system that deals with health in all its aspects including physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, while giving utmost importance to diet, lifestyle habits, and treating and managing specific diseases. [Panchkarma treatment](https://www.mediflam.com/medical-tourism/wellness-in-india/panchakarma) forms an important part of the detoxification regimen of Ayurvedic practice. It leads to the complete detoxification of the body and is now a major inclusion in the therapies provided in multiple [wellness centers in India](https://www.mediflam.com/medical-tourism/wellness-center-in-india). WHAT IS PANCHKARMA TREATMENT? Ayurveda believes that diseases occur in the body because of the accumulation of toxins. Thus, Panchkarma treatment holds an important position in Ayurveda as it leads to complete detoxification of the body. It is not only suggested for sick patients but also for healthy people to keep them charged. So, what is Panchkarma exactly? As the name suggests, Panchkarma contains five major procedures that lead to detoxification. It involves two main components of treatment, oleation, and fomentation. Oleation refers to lubrication and includes the use of oils or oily substances, both internally and externally. Usually, medicated ghee is used for internal use. Oleation treatment is followed by fomentation treatment which leads to sweating. The treatment is performed over several days. The human body has an elegant system of removing wastes from the body through multiple channels like sweat glands, blood vessels, urinary tract, and intestines. Panchkarma helps to clear out these channels so that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. Panchkarma treatment costs vary from one wellness resort to another but usually are in the range of around $1200 for a twin-sharing room for 14 days program.
