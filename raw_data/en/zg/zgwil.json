The functioning of all drug courts relies on the integrity and accuracy of the drug testing process as well as the immediacy with which drug testing services areaccessed and the reliability of results obtained. This issues paper has been prepared by the OJP Drug Court Clearinghouse and Technical Assistance Project to address the most frequent issues that have been raised by drug court programs regarding drug testing. Although thisreport is by no means a definitive treatment of all of these issues, it is intended to provide an overview for drug courtprogram officials\u2014primarily lay persons\u2014regarding the most critical topics that need to be addressed in developingand maintaining a drug testing capability. The authors, Jerome Robinson and James Jones, director and deputy director, respectively, of the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency Drug Laboratory, are forensic scientists and have worked for many years with theapplication of drug testing technologies in a variety of sectors. The results of their experience, research, and training,as they apply to drug testing in a drug court environment, are synthesized in this document. We are grateful for the helpful comments and insights of the following individuals who reviewed this document in draft: John N. Marr of Las Vegas, Nevada, who directs the drug treatment component of most of the Nevada drugcourts, including the drug testing conducted by those programs, and Dr. Leo Kadehjian, of Palo Alto, California, abiomedical scientist who oversees the drug testing program for the U.S. Federal court system. Their advice and suggestions have been incorporated throughout the text. Drug testing is a science that requires the guidance and oversight of appropriately trained forensic scientists. We hope that this document will assist drug court officials in working with forensic experts in the design and operationof the drug testing component of their drug court programs. Caroline S.

Critical Components of a Drug and Periodic Updating of Procedures Manual Documenting All Aspects of the Drug Testing To Comply With Drug Testing Program Requirements and for Release of Tips for Promoting an Effective Drug Court Drug Testing Situations That Can Create Positive Test Results That Challenge the Integrity of the Testing Contracts With Participants That Increase Responsibility for Eliminating Situations That Challenge the Test effective operation of a drug court program is premised upon having the capacity to: conduct frequent (often two to three times per week) and random drug tests of participants; obtain test results immediately; maintain a high degree of accuracy in test results.Drug testing is a key component of drug court programs because it provides readily available and objective infor-mation to the judge, other justice system officials,treatment personnel, and caseworkers regarding a partic-ipant's progress in treatment. The drug testing process,coupled with immediate program responses, forcesdefendants to address their substance abuse problemsimmediately and continuously. Every professional discipline requires professionally trained individuals. Forensic drug testing is no excep-tion. Drug testing is a complex science and requires thesupport of a forensic expert regardless of the testingmethod that is used. As with any scientific test, theinterpretation of a drug test result requires balancing anumber of factors, including elements directly related tothe test, the physical characteristics of the individualbeing tested, and the nature and length of the individ-ual's drug usage. The value and usefulness of a drugtesting regime are dependent on the scientific integrityof the drug testing process and the accurate interpreta-tion and assessment of the raw data. This is not to saythat every program must hire a pathologist or certifiedlab technician to interpret test results. However, everycourt should have technical support, which is generallyavailable from the drug testing/chemical companies thatprovide equipment, supplies, and training in this area. Drug Testing: A Continually Evolving Science The large-scale application of drug testing to detect drug use was initiated by the U.S. Department ofDefense (DOD) during the late 1960s to deal with theproblems of marijuana and heroin use by military per-sonnel in Vietnam. The military's desire to respond tothese problems was the driving force that led to the initial developments in urine drug testing technology. During this process, cutoff levels (i.e., standards deter-mining the level of drug concentration in the humansystem above which would be deemed a \"positive\"finding) were established. Workplace testing followedseveral years later and developed rapidly after PresidentReagan's 1986 directive on drug abuse and drug-freeworkplaces. The National Institute on Drug Abuse(NIDA) became the oversight agency involved with fed-erally regulated workplace drug testing and establisheda second and similar set of cutoff standards for variousdrugs. During the early 1980s, the criminal justice system also began using drug testing, with a number of Federal,State, and local agencies becoming involved. TheFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also began to usedrug testing as a component of its investigations, andpretrial and probation agencies soon adopted drug test-ing as a component of their supervisory functions. Unlike the drug testing practices conducted by the mili- tary and workplace programs, however, drug testing inthe criminal justice system has not been accompaniedby the establishment of consistent cutoff standards thatare uniformly enforced. Although the knowledge gainedthrough the drug testing activities conducted by DODand the Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration (SAMHSA) has provided useful guid-ance for criminal justice drug testing programs, therange of applications of drug testing programs in thecriminal justice environment has raised unique issuesthat have frequently required the development of specialpolicies and protocols. The development of appropriate drug testing method- ologies and procedures for criminal justice systemdefendants generally\u2014and for drug court participants inparticular\u2014requires a consideration of the purposes ofthe drug testing program and the uses of drug testresults. Clearly, drug testing's role in the military or theworkplace differs from its role in the criminal justicesystem. Even within the criminal justice environment,drug testing can be conducted for very different pur-poses: prosecution, supervision of a defendant's compli-ance with a pretrial release or probation order, or, as isthe case in drug courts, monitoring a participant's1. Introduction 1progress in treatment and compliance with drug court program conditions. For a drug court program, drug testing is conducted pri- marily to monitor a defendant's progress in treatment\u2014to determine whether he or she has been using drugsand, if so, the type and quantity of substances beingingested. The drug test result may be used as a basis forimposing sanctions and/or enhancing treatment ser-vices, on the one hand, or reducing treatment servicerequirements, on the other. Drug test results may alsoindicate a participant's progress in reducing drug usewhen he or she has not eliminated it altogether. Although drug test results are frequently reported in terms of \"positive\" or \"negative,\" in reality, the determi-nation of the presence or absence of a particular drug inthe system is not always a black-and-white determina-tion. Ultimately, for a drug court program, a positive ornegative result reflects the presence or absence of cer-tain drug metabolites in the sample at a concentrationabove or below the established cutoff concentration.How the laboratory interprets such results and the court responds to them depends upon a complex set of factorsrequiring an understanding of: the biological process that affects the length of time different drugs stay in the human body; interactions of one drug with another; distribution and elimination rates of the drugs in question; the participant's drug history and other physical characteristics; the capacity of the testing procedures to identify potential adulteration (e.g., flushing or water load-ing) that may affect the test results; the effect of other variables, such as the individual's health, physical condition, and duration of drug use,on the test analysis. 2DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIESMost Commonly Used Samples for Detecting Drug Use The presence of drugs in the human system can be detected by testing a variety of different samples, mostnotably urine, blood, hair, sweat, and saliva. Urine test-ing is the most cost effective, reliable, and widely usedtest. Each jurisdiction, however, must understand thedrug use demographics of the region to determine themost appropriate drug testing strategy to employ. Thetesting characteristics of the five sample sources, inaddition to breath samples, are described below andcompared in table 1. Urine For reasons of both economy and accuracy, urine testingis currently the most appropriate method for drug courtsand most criminal justice agencies for detecting thepresence of illegal substances. Generally, urine testingmethods fall into two types: instrumental and non- instrumental. Both methods use some form of immuno-assay technology to provide an initial determination ofthe presence of a drug. These technologies are furtherdescribed in the Testing Technologies section. Blood Testing blood for evidence of drug use is a highly invasive procedure. Blood tests can provide discreteinformation regarding the degree of an individual'simpairment, but the invasiveness of the procedure andthe potential danger of infection make blood testinginappropriate for drug court programs. Hair The introduction of new, powerful instruments for hairanalysis has increased interest in hair testing. Manyquestions remain unanswered, however, regarding theapplication of hair testing for drug courts, includingappropriate cutoff values; dose relationships (hair Table 1.

Robinson, director of drug testing for the Pretrial Services Agency of the District of Col umbia.2. Drug Testing Methodologies 3samples do not provide a correlation between the pres- ence of drugs in the system and the extent of an individ-ual's use); and potential differentiations that can beproduced by differences in hair color and/or ethnicity ofthe defendant. 1Hair analysis is also subject to potential external contamination. There are also indications thathair analysis can produce biased results. For example,dark pigmented hair absorbs drugs more readily thanblond or bleached hair. Male African-American hair(black/brown) appears to absorb drugs more readilythan hair of other groups, such as female African-Americans (black/brown), male caucasians (black/brown), female caucasians (black/brown and blond). 2 Sweat Sweat samples, which are obtained from patches thatcan be placed on a person for a number of days, havethe advantage of providing a longer timeframe fordetection and they are difficult to adulterate. They donot, however, provide a correlation regarding the degreeof impairment and they are subject to individual differ-ences in sweat production. Saliva Saliva samples permit a correlation with the degree ofimpairment and can be easily obtained. They are, how-ever, subject to contamination from smoking or othersubstances. Testing Technologies Immunoassay The most widely used technology for testing the pres-ence of drugs in the human system is the immunoassay.Primarily used as a screening test, immunoassays useantibodies that specifically bind to drugs and theirmetabolites (the chemical compounds that results afterthe body has metabolized a drug) in urine and other flu-ids. The immunoassay drug-screening procedures havegained in popularity because they are relatively inexpen-sive, can provide results in a quick turnaround time, andhave been found to produce highly accurate test resultsif properly performed. There are several major suppliersof immunoassay test kits. Chromatography Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is an analytical technique that can be used to confirm apositive initial drug screen. Chromatography testing provides a method that is specific to particular drugsand can distinguish a specific drug from other sub-stances that may have similar chemical properties, suchas a prescription medication. With this technology, tech-nicians are able to identify and quantify atoms, isotopes,and the chemical composition of a given sample.GC/MS can be used to analyze urine, blood, hair, andother samples to determine the presence of drugs andother substances and is currently the most definitiveconfirmatory procedure for most substances in mosttoxicology laboratories. Testing Procedures Testing Methods Generally, urine testing methods fall into two types:instrumental and non-instrumental. Both methods ofanalysis use some form of immunoassay technology toprovide an initial determination of the presence of adrug and chromatography to confirm the presence andquantity of the drug. Regardless of the drug testingmethod used, the integrity of the collection, testing, andreporting process must be maintained to (a) ensure thatthe specimen is from the named defendant; (b) detectadulteration; and (c) ensure that no contaminants havebeen introduced that would affect the validity of theresults. These elements are discussed further in chapter 3. Evidence of drug use may be present in the urine in the form of the parent drug and/or metabolites.Determination of the length of time that has elapsedbetween the time of ingestion and the time the test wasconducted depends upon the rate at which the bodymetabolizes and eliminates the drug, physical character-istics of the individual's metabolism, and the sensitivityof the testing procedure. The timeframe also can varydepending on the duration of abuse (e.g., long-termheavy doses or infrequent use), the amount of the dailydosage, and the route of administration (e.g., oral,injected, smoked, or inhaled). Instrument Testing Instrument testing is analysis that involves instrumenta-tion (a machine) that will sample, measure, and producea quantitative result (a numeric amount on a scale).Instrumented analysis has the advantage of being auto-mated, provides precise and accurate documentation,and lends itself to convenient storage of samples in the 4DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIESevent that subsequent retesting may be required. Instrumental methods for testing urine rely onimmunoassay technology for initial detection. Theseanalyses have increased accuracy and precision in test-ing results and provide data printouts for review andcourtroom presentation. The test results can also becommunicated directly from the machine to a programmanagement information system. The reagents forinstrument testing are not as expensive as those suppliedfor non-instrument systems, although the initial cost ofthe instrument may be expensive. Refurbished machinesare frequently available, however, and the cost of amachine should be prorated over a 5- to 7-year period.Frequently, manufacturers of reagents for these instru-ments provide the equipment at no cost or a nominal feeif the purchaser agrees to purchase the reagents fromthem. Trained laboratory staff, however, are required.Most, if not all, manufacturers also provide staff train-ing on the use of their drug testing products. Thus, although the costs per test are low for instrument testing, consideration must also be given to the initialcosts for equipment and the need for trained staff, facili-ties to house the equipment, and \"plant\" facility require-ments (electricity, water, waste). Non-Instrument Testing: Point-of-Contact Tests Non-instrument testing is analysis that involves devicesthat require manual sampling and manual observation toproduce a qualitative result (either negative or positive.)Point-of-contact testing utilizes a non-instrument deviceto analyze a sample at the point of collection. Non-instrumental test devices have improved significantly inrecent years and can be useful if handled by properlytrained staff. Although non-instrument testing does notprovide the intricate level of information that can beobtained with instrumental readouts, these tests providequick and relatively accurate results and the supplies areeasy to store and use. Cost per non-instrument test tendsto be higher than the cost per instrumental test but thesecosts need to be considered in terms of the total volumeof tests being conducted and the alternative costs thatwould be incurred with instrument testing. Storage ofspecimens and retrieval of test results may also presenta problem if specific provision is not made to addressthese requirements. As with instrument testing, staff training is essential to accurately and consistently interpret test results.Relying on a visual detection of a color result can lead to misinterpretation of results for a number of rea- sons, including color acuity, color perception, and light-ing. Care must also be taken to ensure that staff are notcolor blind. Skill in interpretation is required for weakpositives in particular. Role of Breathalyzers in Drug Testing Programs Breathalyzers, which can be used with considerable frequency and at relatively minimal cost, can be particu-larly useful in detecting the presence and amount ofalcohol that may not otherwise be detected through random urinalysis because of alcohol's relatively shortlifespan in the human system. Breathalyzers can there-fore be a very effective and a relatively low-cost compo-nent of a drug court drug testing program, used inconjunction with urine testing for other substances. TheBreathalyzer must be calibrated according to certifica-tion standards established by the U.S. Departments ofTransportation (DOT) and Health and Human Services(HHS) and/or the State toxicologist. The test must beadministered by breath alcohol technicians who aretrained in the use and interpretation of breath alcoholresults. Local drug court officials may wish to contacttheir local law enforcement agencies regarding the useof Breathalyzers in their local jurisdiction for require-ments such as calibration settings, interpretation of testresults, and the expertise available to administer and/orprovide training on Breathalyzer testing. Urine testing, through both instrumental and non- instrumental devices, is also an accurate and reliablemethod for detecting the presence of alcohol if per-formed within the relatively short period followingingestion in which it can be detected. Because alcohol is more concentrated in urine than in blood, urine is the best specimen to use if one wants to determine ifalcohol has been consumed. Testing for Special Substances Inhalants Testing for inhalants, a chromatographic process, ismore complicated than the process required for detect-ing the presence of other substances and must be con-ducted by a forensic expert. This process entails takinga sample of blood or urine (blood is preferred) and ana-lyzing the gases emitted. Because of the volatility of thevapors, it is often difficult to detect the presence ofinhalants with any consistency because often they arepresent in only small amounts. To date, no quick point-of-contact tests have been devised to detect inhalants. Drug Testing in a Drug Court Environment: Common Issues To Address 5Tobacco In many States, juvenile drug courts are consideringrestricting tobacco use by participants who are belowthe age permitted to purchase or use tobacco products.Testing for tobacco use involves primarily testing forthe presence of nicotine, which can remain in the sys-tem for some time depending upon the frequency of use.Drug court officials interested in testing for tobaccousage by participants should explore products availablefrom drug testing equipment manufacturers and distributors. Considerations in Selecting the Appropriate Testing Method for Individual Drug CourtPrograms To determine the methodology that best meets the needs of a particular drug court program, several factors mustbe considered, the most significant of which include thefollowing: the volume of tests that will be conducted; the drugs that will be analyzed; the number of trained individuals available to con- duct the analysis; the availability of automated instruments; the turnaround time needed for obtaining test results; the need for confirmation of test results and the fre- quency of and conditions for confirmation; the quantification of levels of drugs required.For jurisdictions with limited resources that are con- ducting only a small number of tests (e.g., less than10,000 annually), consideration might be given to: using a point-of-contact testing methodology for rou- tine tests, with instrument confirmation and analysisconducted by an outside laboratory on an as-neededbasis; identifying other entities that conduct drug testing and pooling resources to develop the most cost-effective strategy for meeting these multiagency drugtesting needs (State and local probation departments,for example, frequently conduct a high volume ofdrug tests for defendants under probation supervisionand can add the drug court testing component to theirexisting operations.); identifying other agencies that might be willing to join with the drug court in developing a cost-effective drug testing capability. For jurisdictions that have decided to use non- instrument methodologies, consideration should also be given to: the types of drugs being tested for and the non- instrument methodology most accurate for detectingthese drugs; developing policies regarding confirmatory testing (Will confirmations be made for all positive tests oronly in situations in which the test result is chal-lenged? Who will pay for the test if the positive testresult is confirmed? Negated?); special procedures, in addition to those in place for the drug testing process generally, that can be used todetect adulteration. 6DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIESEnsuring Adequate Staffing The drug testing component, regardless of the method- ology used, should be staffed by qualified and trainedemployees who can perform the duties to which theyare assigned and are prepared to testify in court regard-ing the testing process and protocols used. Two types ofwitnesses may be required: layand expert. A laywit- ness may be called to testify about objective facts (e.g.,the procedures used to collect specimens) and is gener-ally not asked to interpret test results or to give an opinion. The expertwitness may be called upon to voluntarily share some specialized knowledge that mayaid the court in determining the validity of the testingprocedure or interpreting the test results. The expert wit-ness is rarely used in drug court programs because thedrug testing conducted is primarily for supervision andmonitoring purposes\u2014rather than for prosecution\u2014anddrug court participants generally have already agreed toparticipate in the drug testing program and to the sanc-tions that may be imposed for a positive test result. Thelay witness, however, may be used more frequently ifquestions arise regarding the procedures used to collectand test the specimen. For this reason, documentedspecimen collection procedures and ongoing training atall levels are essential for the drug testing program. Linestaff must be trained thoroughly in the day-to-day pro-cedures of the program as well as in handling commonsituations that may occur\u2014such as hearing a participantstating he or she is unable to provide a sample orobserving an adulteration. Maintaining the Integrity of the Process The reliability of a drug court drug testing system is dependent upon sample integrity. To ensure sampleintegrity, effective techniques must be instituted\u2014andpracticed\u2014regarding sample collection, testing, andadulteration detection. Establishment of an airtightchain of custody system, documented in writing,ensures test results in which the drug court judge canhave confidence. Such a system requires that each stepin the collection process\u2014from specimen collection and transport through the testing process to the validity ofthe test result\u2014be documented, from the time thedefendant checks in to submit the sample to its final dis-position. The chain of custody process should documentwho performed the critical functions entailed in the drugtesting process and when they occurred, including: the client reporting for testing and his or her being checked in; the sample collection; the examination of the sample for signs of tampering or adulteration; the transportation of the sample to the laboratory; the actual testing of the sample; followup tests that were performed; the review of the results; the recording of the results.It is important that specimens should be kept in a limit- ed access security area and, ideally, refrigerated, if theyare not tested within a few days, or frozen, if longerstorage is expected. Direct observation of the sample submission is also essential. This step requires that the observer and thedonor be of the same gender. Upon entry into the drug court program, participants should execute their agreement to comply with the drugcourt program drug testing requirements, including thesubmission of observed urine samples. Additionally,clearly defined policies and procedures must be in placefor all aspects of the drug testing process, including ori-entation for the participant regarding the drug testingprogram; collection of the sample; examination of thesample for signs of tampering or adulteration; chain ofcustody requirements for the sample; policies regardingconfirmation of test results; sample storage; persons towhom drug tests will be reported and under what cir-cumstances and by which staff member; staff training;3. Critical Components of a Drug Court Drug Testing Program 7and dealing with common situations that may occur (e.g., participant is unable to void). Detecting Adulteration Screening for Common Methods of Adulterated Specimens Even if the specimen collected is the urine of the client, a variety of techniques can be used to adulterate the speci-men to achieve an erroneous reading. Although adulter-ation detection procedures may not ensure completedetection in every instance, they can alert staff to themost common methods that may be employed and cansignificantly enhance the integrity of the drug testingprocess. This section provides discussion of commonadulteration techniques observed by drug court personnel. Waterloading Waterloading refers to an individual's dilution of his orher urine by drinking large volumes of fluids, usuallywater. It is one of the most common adulteration tech-niques and one of the most difficult to detect unless thetechnician is experienced in detecting waterloaded spec-imens. Running parallel tests for creatinine concentra-tion levels (see Submission of Another's Specimenbelow) can detect waterloading. Addition of Common Household Products Tampering with a specimen by introducing commonhousehold products, such as bleach, Drano, and perox-ide, to alter the chemical composition of urine can pro-duce a false negative. However, skilled forensic expertscan often detect these adulteration attempts. Bleach, forexample, will give off a recognizable odor. Drano maymake the urine more basic (less acidic) and may alsomake it unusually warm\u2014even bubbly. Metal shavingsmay also be detected. KLEAR has been aggressivelymarketed as a product that, when added to a urine sam-ple, produces a negative result. The presence of KLEAR,however, can be detected through analysis of nitrite levelsif the confirmatory tests are run immediately. Other adulteration techniques are being continually developed and marketed, and scientists are trying todevelop new techniques for adulterant detection. Submission of Another's Specimen Carefully designed and documented observation of eachperson's provision of his or her specimen, coupled withestablished chain of custody procedures, are critical todetecting situations in which a participant may attempt to substitute the urine of another person for his or her own. Use of Diuretics A number of teas, milkshakes, fruit juices, and otherconcoctions act as diuretics that can potentially decreasethe retention time for drugs in the system. Most of theseproducts also require the ingestion of large amounts ofwater, which may result in diluting the urine to such adegree that the presence of drugs falls below drug test-ing cutoff levels. There are a variety of other adulteration techniques that clients use from time to time. Publications have beenwritten with suggested adulteration strategies, and several Web pages are devoted to the topic. Programofficials need to recognize that, despite their most con-scientious efforts, some adulteration may occur unde-tected. However, careful interpretation of drug testresults, coupled with observations of potential clinicalsigns of drug use (see table 2), reduces the likelihoodthat adulteration can occur with any frequency. Checking for Temperature, Color, and Other Evidence of Tampering Standard procedures should be instituted to detect evi- dence of tampering at the time of initial collection ofthe specimen, including observing the color and appear-ance and detecting odor of the sample. For example,ingestion of Vitamin B 1(which some drug court clients may be taking to rebuild and rebalance their body's sys-tem that has been worn down by years of abuse) gives abright yellow color to the urine, but an experiencedtechnician can detect that it is quite different from theyellow color of unadulterated urine. Followup analysisshould then be performed through additional tests forspecific gravity, pH levels, creatinine, and possibly evennitrates. Urine should be a light to golden yellow, freefrom foreign materials, and have a slight ammonia odor.Samples that are colorless or very pale yellow should besuspect. The average temperature of a freshly voidedurine sample is 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 to37.8 degrees Celsius); samples outside this range shouldbe suspect. Normal urine has a pH of 5 to 8; specimensabove or below this value should be suspect. Measuresshould also be taken to detect possible waterloading.Two particular tests may be useful. A test for specific gravity , which compares the density of a drop of water to the density of a drop of urine. If the weight of the urine is below a certain 8DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIESlevel, it is indicative that the urine has been diluted. Samples with a specific gravity under 1.003 shouldbe suspect. A test to measure the creatinine level. Creatinine is a metabolic product normally excreted in the urine bythe kidneys. Its concentration in the urine is affectedDrug Testing in a Drug Court Environment: Common Issues To Address 9Table 2.

If the creatinine level of a urine sam- ple falls below a certain level, it is indicative that theclient consumed large quantities of fluids prior togiving the sample. Values less than 20 milligrams per deciliter may be an indication of waterloading. Additional Tips A few additional tips for drug court officials to avertadulteration include requiring: observed monitoring of all submissions; the submission of a minimum amount of urine; set time limits for providing a specimen (e.g., 1 hour or less from the time of test notification to the time of col-lection) to minimize the possibility of internal dilution; limited access to fluids prior to providing the specimen. 3 Determining Appropriate Testing Frequency Determining the appropriate drug testing frequency for any drug court program will depend upon the resourcesavailable, the testing methodology being used, and thecharacteristics of the drugs being tested for. Most drugcourts develop a standard policy regarding drug testingfrequency (e.g., twice weekly during the first phase,weekly during the second phase) but also increase therequired frequency on a case-by-case basis for individu-als who need more frequent testing. In developing a drug testing schedule, special attention should be paid to the length of time particular drugsremain detectable using the selected assay cutoff. As table2 illustrates, developing a meaningful testing frequencyfor individual drugs that have a relatively long eliminationhalf-life will require the capacity to determine the quanti-tative levels of the drugs initially detected, and subse-quently tested for, so that even though a positive test maybe the result, a declining level may still indicate cessationof use. This assessment of declining levels may be diffi-cult to do in practice because of the key role of dilution.To interpret such test results and determine whether they reflect renewed use, the tester needs both the drug/metabolite levels and the creatinine levels along with a knowledge of pharmacokinetics. Although such interpretation may be possible, it cannot be undertakensimply by looking at instrument-based results. The retention/detection timeframes in table 2 provide a general framework for determining appropriate testingfrequency for specific drugs. Reference should also bemade to the special retention characteristics of drugsused in the local community (see Establishing CutoffLevels for the Drug Court Program). Spot Testing Spot tests are unscheduled tests usually conducted bytreatment or case management staff when they suspectthat the client may be under the influence of a drug oralcohol. Some drug courts use the same testing methodsfor spot testing as are used in the regular drug testingprogram. Others, for reasons primarily relating to logis-tics and costs, have adopted special testing methods. Indetermining how best to conduct spot testing, considera-tion should be given to the level of accuracy required,the immediacy with which test results are needed, costs,and the volume of testing that will be conducted. Random Testing Unless drug testing is conducted frequently\u2014a practicemost programs cannot afford\u2014there is a possibility thatclients could ingest drugs without detection. Randomtesting prevents participants from planning ahead andavoiding detection. A variety of randomized procedureshave been instituted by various programs, the mostcommon of which requires a defendant to call in eachmorning to ascertain whether his or her number or coloris scheduled for testing that day. Persons whose numberor color is chosen are then given no more than 10 to 12hours to report to a testing center. Using Confirmation Testing For urine drug screens, immunoassay testing is readilyavailable for a quick, qualitative result. However, con-firmation may be requested, or required, for positiveresults, particularly if a sanction is to be imposed or the test is to be used for prosecution purposes. Manyprograms use GC/MS for confirmation (see TestingTechnologies in chapter 2). It should be noted, howev-er, that for most drug court programs confirmation test-ing is performed in relatively few instances because thepurpose of drug testing in drug courts is primarily tomonitor a participant's progress in treatment. Manyprograms charge the participant for the confirmationtest if the positive test is confirmed; if the test is notconfirmed, however, the program pays. 10DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIESAlthough requests for confirmation of positive drug tests are generally much less frequent than in traditional crimi-nal justice drug testing programs, every program shouldhave the capacity for confirmation testing, particularly ifsanctions may be imposed for positive test results. Giventhe high volume of drug tests conducted by drug courts(significantly higher than for persons under standard pro-bation supervision) and the relative frequency of positivetest results (drug courts are aimed at persons with signifi-cant substance involvement), drug courts should developpolicies regarding confirmation testing, including thetimeframe for requesting confirmation (see MaintainingSpecimens for Retesting, below) and payment responsi-bility for the confirmation test. It should be noted thatthere may be valid reasons for an initial positive test tofail to confirm upon subsequent confirmation testing atanother laboratory that may not reflect any deficiency ineither the onsite or confirmation laboratory results.However, any significant frequency of unconfirmed testsshould signal the need for prompt review of the entiredrug testing procedure. Maintaining Specimens for Retesting Samples should be kept long enough to reconcile anylegal challenges to the test results. As noted above,every drug court should establish a policy regardingconfirmation testing and the timeframe in whichrequests for confirmation must be made. Two weeks to one month should be adequate in a program with fre-quent testing and prompt responses to new drug use.Specimens should be stored at temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius but at -20 degrees Celsius ifkept longer than 1 week. Obtaining Accurate and Meaningful Interpretation of Results Establishing Cutoff Levels for the Drug Court Program Drug test results are generally reported as positive or negative. The positive or negative finding reflects a determination of whether the specimen is equal to orexceeds the cutoff concentration levels that have been established. These cutoff concentration levels must takeinto account that some small traces of a drug metabolitemay be present in a person's system without a determina-tion that the individual has used illegal drugs (e.g., opiatelevels below 2,000 ng/ml may be associated with the ingestion of poppy seeds and not necessarily indicative ofheroin use). Cutoff levels should therefore be adequate toscreen out false positives (i.e., positives that would not beconfirmed upon further testing). Positive drug test resultsfrom passive inhalation or accidental exposure areextremely unlikely if the cutoff levels established are sufficient to screen out trace drug metabolites. Each drug court must establish the cutoff values to determine whether a test result is positive or negative.This cutoff value should set the quantitative level at andabove which it is deemed that the test is presumptively positive and below which indicates a negative result.Cutoffs, therefore, are quantitative values regarding theamount of drug present in the specimen that set thepoint at which a urine sample is reported as positive.Setting the appropriate cutoff value should also accountfor accidental exposure and/or passive inhalation toavoid the possibility of false positives. Cutoff values have been developed by professionals in forensic toxicology for various organizations. The tablesin the appendix list the various cutoff guidelines usedfor screening and confirmation by SAMHSA for work-place testing, DOD for military testing, and the D.C.Pretrial Services Agency for testing of defendants in the D.C. Superior Court for initial screening and forsubsequent confirmation. Addressing \"Spiking\" Situations Spiking\u2014a situation in which the quantitative level of a drug may appear to increase because of changing con-centration levels of a drug in urine due to the individ-ual's metabolic factors rather than new use\u2014is aphenomenon that must be considered in interpretingdrug test results. For example, urine may be more con-centrated due to the time of day the sample is taken orbecause of increased physical activity by the participant,thereby resulting in a quantitative increase in the levelof drugs detected even if there has been no resumptionof use. The quantitative level of a particular drug mustbe assessed given the creatinine level in the urine, whichcan provide an indication of the level of urine concen-tration. By looking at the creatinine level as well as thedrug concentration level, a normalization value (the ratio of the drug level to the creatinine level) for an indi- vidual can be determined and subsequently compared tonormalization levels taken previously. 11Drug Testing in a Drug Court Environment: Common Issues To AddressAlthough the cocaine level detected in test 1 in the example remained the same in test3, the normalization levels, which take intoaccount the relative concentration of theurine, indicate a steady decline in concen-tration. Although the normalization levelsappear to be declining, this decline doesnot necessarily rule out new drug use.Programs must adopt guidelines regarding the periodafter which a continued positive reading is indicative ofnew use. Understanding the Drug Use Characteristics in the Local Jurisdiction Uniform guidelines can be developed regarding cutoff lev- els, but each program must conduct research on its localpopulation to determine how long specific drugs availablein the locale remain in the human system. This retentionperiod is frequently affected by the strength of the drugscommonly available in the locale, the drug use history ofthe individual user, and the user's physical size. Determining an Acceptable Error Rate for the Testing Program The integrity of a drug testing program depends upon reli- able test results in which the court can have confidence.The program's error rate\u2014the rate of false positives aswell as the frequency with which the presence of drugs isnot accurately detected\u2014should be extremely low. Testingmethodologies should be checked daily, with test samplesconducted to ensure that the testing procedures are bothdetecting the presence of drugs and not falsely reportingthe presence of drugs. For example, screening tests shouldbe run periodically (ideally daily) to include one negative,one strong positive, one specimen at 75 percent of cutoffvalue, one specimen at 125 percent of cutoff value, andone blind control specimen that alternates between positiveand negative. The purpose of having controls 75 percentbelow and 125 percent above cutoff is to test the assay'sability to identify positive tests that are close to the cutoff. Development and Periodic Updating of Procedures Manual Documenting AllAspects of the Drug Testing Process A complete policy and procedures manual that describes the entire drug testing process should be prepared,reviewed with staff\u2014initially and regularly\u2014and updatedperiodically. Every step of the drug testing process must be documented in the policy and procedures manual. Themanual should be used to orient new staff members aswell as to train staff periodically. The policy and proce-dures manual should also be referenced on an ongoingbasis as questions arise. Procedures must be in place, forexample, to detect samples with low or high temperatures(which can be measured using temperature strips or ther-mometers), low creatinine levels (which can be measuredwith both automated instrumental and non-instrumentaldevices), and acidity levels (which can be detected withdipsticks, pH meters, or automated analyzers). Policiesand procedures should also be articulated for handlingcommon situations that may occur, such as participantswho state they are unable to provide a sample. The procedures manual should also include the required reagents for each drug tested,applicable quality control pro-cedures,and steps for interpreting the test results. Proficiencytesting should be conducted periodically to ensure that theentire drug testing process is operating as intended. Defendant Agreements To Comply With Drug Testing Program Requirements andfor Release of Information Each participant who enters the drug court program should execute a written agreement acknowledging therequirements of the drug testing component of the drugcourt program and his or her agreement to comply withdrug testing program requirements. The requirementsshould include required submission of urine samples,compliance with observed testing protocols, and waiver of confidentiality claims to the test results insofar as theirtransmittal to the drug court judge is concerned. Theagreement should require the participant to disclose anyprescription or other medications he or she is taking(see also Develop Contracts With Participants ThatIncrease Responsibility for Eliminating Situations ThatChallenge the Test Results in chapter 4).EXAMPLE Three successive drug tests are conducted on the same individualwith the following results: Test 1 cocaine level: 200 mg Creatinine level: 100 mg Normalization level = 2.0 Test 2 cocaine level: 160 mg Creatinine level: 100 mg Normalization level = 1.6 Test 3 cocaine level: 200 mg Creatinine level: 300 mg Normalization level = 0.67 12DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIESEducate and Train Everyone Involved About the Process and Procedures In addition to staff training regarding program policies and procedures, everyone involved with the drug courtprogram should be informed about drug testing policiesand procedures, factors that need to be considered ininterpreting results, drug test result patterns emergingand any significant implications they may have for jus-tice system or treatment staff, and other issues that maysurface as the drug testing program becomes operational. Anticipate Situations That May Occur Everyone involved with the drug testing program shouldbe aware of procedures for responding to situations thatmay frequently occur, such as an individual beingunable to provide a sample, a claim that a positive drugtest resulted from inhalation or ingestion of other (legal)substances, or an individual providing a sample that isclearly adulterated. Recognize Situations That Can Create Positive Test Results That Challenge theIntegrity of the Testing Process Situations can occur that may result in positive drug tests that potentially do not reflect illegal drug use.Many of these situations can be anticipated and avoided.For example, a number of prescription drugs can causea positive result. Participants should be required to dis-close at the time of program entry all medications theymay be taking\u2014prescribed as well as over the counter.Drug court program officials should consult with physi-cians to alert them to the participants'involvement withthe program and their addiction and ask them to pre-scribe nonnarcotic medications, if possible. Prescription medications when used as instructed can produce true positive test results (e.g., codeine in prescription cough syrup or pain relievers; prescriptionamphetamines for obesity or attention deficit hyperac-tivity disorder). The Physicians'Desk Referenceprovides a list of more than 350 medications that may produce positive test results for amphetamines, PCP,cocaine, or opiates, ranging from cough suppressantsand antihistamines to antibiotics and medications forasthma, hypertension, lymphomas, and irregular heart-beat. Some over-the-counter medications may producepositive test results when misused or taken in amountsabove the recommended dosage. Information regardingthese various medications is usually detailed in the testassays'package inserts and is well known to testingexperts who can assist drug court officials in learningabout these possibilities and interpreting any question-able results. The medical history of each participantshould be carefully reviewed, and any medications thatcan produce a positive test result should be identified. Strategies must also be developed to expedite the flush- ing of the system of defendants who have been chronicdrug users to avoid difficulties in distinguishingbetween residualuse and newuse. These strategies might include increased monitoring of participants andstricter procedures regarding the scheduling of drugcourt specimen collection. For example, schedulingdefendants to provide urine specimens only in the morn-ing, when their urine should be at its highest level ofconcentration, would obviate the potential ambiguitiesin drug test results that can occur when specimens arevoided later in the day (see chapter 3). Develop Contracts With Participants That Increase Responsibility forEliminating Situations That Challengethe Test Results The drug court contract that participants sign should also include a provision stating that they agree to refrain(1) from being in environments where drugs are usedbecause passive smoke could affect their results; (2)from eating poppy seeds; and (3) from participating in activities (e.g., using toiletries, over-the-counter medications, or other products) that could create a falsepositive. Complying with such a provision woulddecrease the chances of false positives. 134. Tips For Promoting an Effective Drug Court Drug Testing ProgramDocument All Policies and Procedures in Writing Every aspect of the drug testing program should be documented in the policy and procedures manual. Asnew situations arise, they and their appropriate respons-es should be included in the manual. Areas where discretion may be exercised, such as spot testing, should be clearly explained. A written summary of the drug testing program and salient policies and procedures, including any modifica-tions that are made, should also be explained to partici-pants, their counsel, and others who may be involved inthe drug court program. 14DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIESDrug testing technology is changing rapidly, as are associated costs. Budget estimates for drug testingshould therefore be based on costs at the time the bud-get is being prepared. Currently the costs of supplies tomaintain a point-of-contact testing process and the costsof instrument analysis vary because of many factors,including different pricing structures used by differentmanufacturers. Each drug court should consider allopportunities for conducting drug testing of participantsto procure the most cost-effective urine monitoring system for its program. Drug testing costs are not necessarily fixed price ser- vices. Like any contractual service, the specific costs for drug testing should be negotiated with prospectivevendors, taking into account the volume of tests to beconducted and the degree to which the drug court drugtesting activities provide a marketing opportunity for the vendor in the local community. Jurisdictions exploring the feasibility of instrument test- ing should keep in mind that although the cost forprocuring equipment to produce instrument analysismay initially appear substantial, some economies can berealized through the purchase of used equipment or smaller table-model types (see question 1 in chapter 7,Frequently Asked Questions). Additional costs for sup-plies need to be budgeted for each test. Regardless of the type of methodology, additional costs for staffing, training, facilities, and storage of specimensshould be calculated. A Breathalyzer is also a criticalcomponent of drug testing programs, and costs for pur-chasing new Breathalyzers should be considered. Determining the appropriate costs for drug testing func- tions should be made after considering many factors.Relative costs are not the sole indicators of the qualityof the process for the drug court's purposes, and localofficials should investigate the degree to which alterna-tive processes meet the drug court's needs, over both theshort term and the long term. Preliminary questions toraise with distributors of drug court supplies for point-of-contact systems are listed in chapter 6, and a suggest-ed strategy for developing a drug testing budget isprovided in the response to question 1 in the FrequentlyAsked Questions chapter. 155. Estimating Drug Testing Costs The following is a list of suggested questions to guide drug courts in their initial inquiries with vendors of drugtesting equipment and/or supplies. What supplies are needed to conduct the drug testing? What are their costs? What staff and facilities will be needed to conduct the testing, store supplies and samples, etc.? What is the methodology used to produce the test results? Who interprets the results? What staff train-ing is needed? How are test results recorded? Howare test results reported to the court? How quickly can test results be obtained? What potential for error is associated with producing drug test results? Reading the test results? Is the test more accurate for some types of drugs than for others? What type of confirmation process is required? Suggested? How much does each test cost? What does this cost include? What additional costs associated with thedrug testing process need to be budgeted? How many drugs can the methodology test for at once? 176. Questions To Ask Drug Testing Equipment and/or Supply VendorsQuestion 1:We are a small community. How much should we budget for drug testing? Response: To determine the costs for drug testing, you will need to consider the following: a. How many tests will you be doing monthly or weekly? If, for example, you conduct 2 tests each week per person for the first 120 days and then weekly for thenext 8 months and you have approximately 50 per-sons in the program during this period, you will conduct approximately 3,300 tests during the year. (2 tests x 17 weeks x 50 persons) + (32 weeks x 50 persons) = 3,300 tests during the year. b. At a very rough estimated cost of $5 to $15 per specimen for a full (5 to 7) test panel, you will needto budget (the cost per screen currently runs between$5 and $20) 3,300 drug tests x $5 $16,500 to $49,500.Non-Instrument Point-of-Contact Testing$16,500 to $49,500 for drug testing supplies if a point-of-contact system is used. Additional costs for the following must also be included: staff to conduct the drug testing program; facilities for sample collection and analysis; training of staff conducting the drug testing and for educating others involved in the program. Instrument Testing Instruments geared to perform a small volume of tests are available. They do not require much space(some fit on a tabletop), are easy to work with, andrequire only distilled water or other readily accessi-ble reagents. The purchase cost for these instrumentsusually begins at approximately $20,000 and increas-es depending upon the volume and capabilities of thesystem. Most manufacturers provide staff training. These instruments generally provide more reliable,cost-effective testing results than a dipstick method. Several manufacturers have special incentive pro- grams for instrument purchases or leases. Thesemanufacturers should be consulted regarding currentmarket prices. Used machinery is also available. Additional costs for alcohol testingBreathalyzers are an important component of your drug testing program because they identify the levelof alcohol in the system, whereas most urine testingtechniques only detect the presence or absence ofalcohol. If determining the degree of intoxication isimportant, a Breathalyzer should be used togetherwith a urine test. To determine the most appropriate drug testing strategy for your program, you should also consider contactingother nearby agencies that either are conducting drugtesting or are in the planning stages. Other criminal jus-tice agencies, as well as health departments, businesses,and other entities may be interested in pooling resourcesto develop a drug testing program that can take advan-tage of the cost savings provided by high-volume systems. Question 2: How long should we keep samples?Response: Samples should be retained as long as there is a possibility of a challenge or a hearing on a result.Some programs retain samples for 14 to 30 days.Private organizations may keep them for a year or more.Because drug testing in drug courts is used primarily tomonitor participants'progress in treatment and thedegree to which they have stopped using drugs, requestsfor confirmation of positive drug tests are generallymore infrequent than in traditional criminal justice drugtesting programs. Each drug court program shoulddevelop a policy regarding a reasonable period forretaining samples that is consistent with the timeframein which requests for confirmation testing can be made. Question 3: How frequently should we drug test?Response: Generally, random testing should occur twice or more each week in the initial phase of a client's 197. Frequently Asked Questionsparticipation in a drug court program and decrease to once weekly if the client demonstrates progress in treat-ment and improvements in drug test results. Hair andsweat patch testing may be useful after prolonged abstinence. Question 4:What is an acceptable error rate for a drug court drug testing program? Response: With a well-managed testing system, all errors should be detected and reconciled before the test-ing program begins operation. The level of accuracy fordrug test results in any given program should, therefore,be as close to 100 percent as possible for the court andothers involved in the drug court program to have confi-dence in the drug testing program and its results.Testing methodologies should be checked daily toensure that the testing procedures are both detecting thepresence of drugs and not falsely reporting the presenceof drugs. If false positives should occur, they should be promptly tracked and the underlying reasons for the false positive should be identified and addressedimmediately.Question 5:What special issues should we be concerned with when testing juveniles in a drugcourt program? Response: The testing process for juveniles is identical to that for adults. The types of drug used or detected,however, may differ. For example, special proceduresmay apply to testing for inhalants or for high volumesof over-the-counter medications that juveniles may usemore regularly than adults. The other principal issueregarding drug testing of juveniles concerns require-ments for parental consent. Jurisdictions planning toimplement a juvenile drug court should review applica-ble State statutes concerning who must consent to med-ical procedures for juveniles. The mature minor rule ofsome States permit minors over a specified age or matu-rity level to consent to medical procedures withoutparental consent. Other States limit these provisions tohealth care relating to substance abuse, mental health, orsexual activity. Still other States require the consent of aparent or legal guardian prior to any medical treatmentof a minor. Determination also should be made ofwhether drug testing is considered a medical procedureunder State statute. 20DRUG COURTS RESOURCE SERIES21Appendix: Drug Test Cutoff Values Drug Test Cutoff Values Developed by Different Organizations: Screening Drug SAMSHA DOD D.C.
