We all encounter so much dense and negative energy on a daily basis, you might not even be aware of it until it builds up inside and suddenly you find yourself tossing and turning at night, having unpleasant dreams, or feeling a general sense of discomfort. The reason for this, is that energy accumulates in your field over time, especially negative energy, and if you don't take the time to clear it out it will keep building up until you're overwhelmed. The good news is, there are many ways you can cleanse your energy. Lower vibrations can consume you if you allow them to. Now of course, there's also an infinite supply of high vibrational energy and Divine Light you can tune into, and really this is the key. To start allowing more high vibrational energy into your life, make an effort to become mindful of your energy and your state of mind in the moment. The state of your mind, and physical body offer valuable indicators of your vibrational level and will alert you when a spiritual detox is in order. Are you joyful, filled with love, energy, and passion as you gracefully and easily move forward in sync with the flow of life? If so, keep doing what you're doing! But if you are feeling, off, out of sorts, and disconnected... It's not fun. I know because I was once there too in the midst of that hazy clouded fog. But I can promise you, there is a way through! You can dissolve the cloud cover and start living with more joy, love and clarity than ever before. Sound enticing? This really is possible for you... Kick Off Your Progress Is With A Spiritual Detox! Start by setting an intention, something along the lines of: \"I am spiritually connected, vibrantly clear, energized and filled with immense joy, love and gratitude.\" This may sound too good to be true for now, but with the intention in place, the entire universe begins to conspire with you to make your intention a reality. Be sure you listen to your voice of inner wisdom and know that you are guided well! It's just a matter of listening to your inner guidance, and taking action. With this, you'll be feeling lighter, brighter and more connected with Spirit in no time. Just be sure that if your heart is telling you to turn off the TV and go for a walk to the park... You listen... And then do it! If you find you're not able to decipher what your inner guidance is telling you, here are some steps you can take to get yourself back in tip top shape vibrationally so you're once again spiritually aligned and connected. 8 Simple (yet highly effective) Methods for a Spiritual Detox... 1. Get Outside in Nature! The natural world has an incredible power to cleanse and uplift your energy! Just about any time, Mother Earth offers you a quick and powerful way to ground your energy, and elevate your vibration. You don't even have to be anywhere special to connect with nature. Tune into the energy of a tree on a busy street, or even the weeds growing against your building. Even better, go to a local park on a break from work, or while visiting family members that are challenging, or when you finish up at school. If you can go for a walk or hike outside, do it! Stop and smell the flowers, hug a tree, listen to the birds, or gaze into a body of water. If it's too cold, too windy, or you can't actually spend time outside for whatever reason, bring a piece of nature indoors. Sit and hold a crystal in your hand get a potted plant and consciously tune into it's energy, or take a moment to relax and enjoy the scent of an essential oil. The benefits of connecting with the natural world are immense and are always available, but are also easy to ignore. Turn off the TV, put down your smartphone or shut down your computer and just take some time to be and breathe while you tune into the energy of Mother Earth. Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you! 2 . Cleanse Your Space Your surroundings absolutely have an affect on your mental, physical and spiritual state of being. Feeling off? A good place to start is by cleaning up your space! Take out the trash, clean your kitchen, do a load of laundry, and vacuum the living area. Take steps to put things away, clean and declutter your space, and it will begin to raise the vibration of your surroundings. Once you've cleaned up, you can then clear the energy. Burn some white sage or incense, light a candle, diffuse an essential oil, and set the intention for your space to be energetically cleared. [More on how to do this here!](http://www.ask-angels.com/spiritual-guidance/energy-clearing-with-positive-energy-from-the-angels/) 3. Shift Your Awareness Inward Through Meditation! One of the best ways to energetically reset, and raise your vibration is to clear and quiet your mind. There's nothing you need to accomplish this step, just take some time to be, breathe and meditate. If you find you are having trouble calming your mind to meditate, you may want to switch up your routine a bit! Call on your Angels and Spirit Guides and ask them for a calming white light to surround you. Their loving, peaceful and calming light will surround you and uplift you so you are able to tune into the calm and present that is always accessible to you within. Diffuse an essential oil like Sacred Frankincense or dab some lavender on yours wrists and breathe in the relaxing scent. This can be an incredibly powerful tool when a vibrational shift is needed prior to or while meditating. Crystals and gemstones that have been properly cleansed and charged, can be held in your hand or placed on your brow at the third-eye chakra to help you quiet your mind too. There are a wide array of crystals that are helpful while meditating including Selenite, Amethyst, Tourmaline, Celestite, Clear Quartz, Blue Calcite and more! Or, just relax, and listen to one of the many free angel meditations available on this site. 4. Ask Your Angels For Help! For a quick, effective, and powerful spiritual lift, invite your angels to connect with you energetically, clearing your vibration and giving you an energetic lift. You can also connect with Archangel Michael and ask for his protection, ask him to cut any ties or cords from others that are draining you. Archangel Michael can also vacuum your energy of all fear, pain and negativity... Just ask! When you ask, your Angels will surround you like a team of healers who know your spiritual state and exactly what will most serve you now. Your Angels are always delighted to assist you and want to be aligned with you on your spiritual journey. All you have to do is ask. Ask as often as you need to remembering that your angels are always there to help you.... Just ask, and then be open to assistance. 5. Detox Your Physical Body Wait this was supposed to be about spiritual detox right? Absolutely! However, keep in mind that your body, mind, and spirit are all connected. In other words, they all influence and affect one another. So, if you're feeling off a bit emotionally, mentally, or spiritually... Chances are your physical self is a bit out of balance too! Detoxification is the process of ridding your physical body of toxic substances. And a good way to start doing this is by simply paying attention to what you are putting in your body. Eating healthy, nourishing meals with fresh fruits and vegetables has an incredible way of raising your vibration. You'll also want to be sure you're well hydrated, by drinking plenty of purified water, herbal tea, and other non-caffeinated, chemical laden, or sugar filled drinks! I love drinking lemon water to detox, and stay hydrated, [which you can learn more about here!](http://www.ask-angels.com/spiritual-guidance/raise-your-vibration-with-essential-oils/) 6. Move Your Physical Body! Another great way to spiritually (and physically) detox is to get moving! Get some exercise, get your blood flowing, and break a sweat! Not only will this help you to physically sweat out toxins, it will help you to let go of tension, stress, and negativity you may be consciously or unconsciously holding on to. You don't have to do anything strenuous or intense, and actually you may receive more benefit from gentle yoga, dance, or walking than you will from forcing yourself to run on a treadmill when you're really not inspired. Double this up by working out outside in nature for an added benefit! 7. Infuse Your Mind and Space With Positivity There is so much negativity in the world... But rather than letting this weigh you down, create some space between you and it. Turn off the TV, set down the newspaper, and instead find something positive to fill your mind up with instead. Surrounding yourself with positive people, inspiring music, and uplifting messages has a powerful effect on your mood, energy, and well-being too. If you're not able to easily find positive people to be around, pick up an inspiring book, listen to a podcast or watch YouTube videos that excite, inspire and uplift you. Gaia TV is a good alternative for programming that is inspiring instead of draining. I am not saying you can never read a news site, or watch a TV show again, just pay attention to how it affects your energy and mood and be sure to counter balance it with something high vibrational, uplifting and light. You may also notice you're guided to spend less time with certain people and to avoid situations that cause you pain and heartache. Listen to your inner guidance and if you do have a friend or family member who tends to \"dump their problems\" on you, know that you don't have to take their drama on. Keep asking your angels to release lower vibrations into the light. 8. Cleanse Your Energy With Light Finally, no spiritual detox is complete without consciously cleansing your energetic slate with light. To do this you can simply take a deep breath, and consciously call in a waterfall of white light to flow all around your being. Imagine the light pouring down all around you and cleansing your mind, body, and spirit from head to toe. Visualize light flowing along your spinal column, as it cleanses each and every chakra with pure light of the Divine. You can also take a salt bath, smudge your energy with white sage, or use a sound healing tool like a brass bell, singing bowl or Tingsha. You may also enjoy [spiritual cleansing meditations](http://www.ask-angels.com/angel-messages/spiritual-cleansing-angels/), or simply asking your angels to help you with this step as well. Remember, that staying spiritually connected is something that is well within your means, and you don't have to make a phone call, buy anything, or even leave the house to make it happen. Just be aware, take action as you're inspired, ask your angels for help and detox as often as is necessary, to stay present, aware, and spiritually connected!
